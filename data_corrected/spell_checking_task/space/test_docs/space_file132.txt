Antifreeze coolant For those of you with motorcycles of the liquidcooled persuasion , what brand of coolant do you use and why ? I am looking for aluminumsafe coolant , preferably phosphatefree , and preferably cheaper than 13 gallon . Can you believe it : the Kaw dealer wants 4.95 a QUART for the Official Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant ! ! ! No way I 'm paying that usury ... Thanks , Chris BeHanna DoD 114 1983 HD FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee 's Red Lady 1975 CB360T Baby Bike Disclaimer : Now why would NEC 1991 ZX 11 needs a name agree with any of this anyway ?
