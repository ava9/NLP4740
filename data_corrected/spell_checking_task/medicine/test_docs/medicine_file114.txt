Hmm . The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as officers and yelling Police repeatedly . This is used every day to bust drug houses . The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and d isplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight . As for not knocking , it 's and sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it did n't , than it would n't be used so commonly , now would it ? How often is it used when the convoy carrying the brigade is visible for miles before it reaches the place that 's to be searched ?

My understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below . So unless what I 'm saying is directly related to VAX VMS , do n't hold me or my organization responsible for it . If it IS related to VAX VMS , you can try to hold me responsible for it , but my organization had nothing to do with it .
