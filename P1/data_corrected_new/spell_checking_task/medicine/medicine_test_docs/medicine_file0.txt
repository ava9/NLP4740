if I 'm riding I would far sooner have the pillion hanging on to the bike , rather than me , because I find that their weight can cause me to move , and that can upset the balance of the bike . Most of the pillions I see over here hold the grabrail . The really good ones do n't hang on to anything unless violent acceleration is taking place . Hmmmmn ... do n't you ride with your sweetheart ? Only in my dreams ... :
