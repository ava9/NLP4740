I looked into getting a c installed on my 1987 Honda CRX Si . The unit is 875 plus shipping , installation is like 5 12 hours on top of that . This is a hunk of change . Does anyone know any place that does aftermarket a c installation not with a Honda a c unit , but some third party unit . I can not seem to find anyone who can put a third party a c unit in a Honda . I am in No Carolina , so I would prefer some place nearby , but any references would be handy . Thx , Andy Sorry I ca n't help you with your question , but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A C units . I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier , and am quite unhappy with it . The fan is noisy , and does n't put out much air . I will never have an aftermarket A C installed in any of my vehicles again . I just ca n't trust the quality and performance after this experience . les Les Bartel I 'm going to live forever Intergraph Corporation ... or die trying Electronics Division or 205 7308537
