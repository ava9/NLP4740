Ashtrays and cigarette lighters . These should be an option . Why make it an option . You can use the ashtray to store coins and other small things which come in handy . Use the cigarette lighter as an electrical outlet for all types of handy gadgets CD players , vacuum cleaners , flashlights , etc . I do n't want to pay extra for these things and if you do n't use them , they do n't hurt you . I use the ashtray to keep change and other items in . I converted the cigarette lighter into a volume control knob for my in trunk subwoofer ! George . Larry OO 1990 2.0 16v FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER ! The fact that I need to explain it too you indicates that you probably would n't understand anyway !
