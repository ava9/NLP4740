I 'm wondering if anybody else out the is a clutchless shifter ? I 've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles , on my current toyota truck I 've got over 150k . I 've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission . My experiences suggest otherwise . What techniques do you use ? Yeah . I do n't use the clutch all the time either . I 've done it with Fords , BMW , Datsun , and Chevy and it works fine . I ca n't think of any reason that it would damage the tranny . Essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear . On some old pieces of junk I drove , the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift , except clutchless . To date I 've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords a chevy . Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker easier they where to shift . My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever . If for some reason I miss the shift window , I lightly press the accelerator try agian . I 've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms 40007000 . I also skip gears some times using 13 5 , 12 45 . Sounds about right . I usually slip it out during throttledown and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear ... krispy Jon You obviously do n't know who you 're dealing with Gross
