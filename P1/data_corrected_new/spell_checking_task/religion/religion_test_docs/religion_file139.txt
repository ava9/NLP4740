Would someone please post the countersteering FAQ ... i am having this awful time debating with someone on why i push the right handle of my motorcycle foward when i am turning left ... and i ca n't explain well at least why this happens ... please help ... post the faq ... i need to convert him . Ummm , if you push on the right handle of your bike while at speed and your bike turns left , methinks your bike has a problem . When I do it Really ! ? Methinks somethings wrong with your bike . Perhaps you meant pull ? Pushing the right side of my handlebars will send me left . It should . REally . on MY bike , I turn right . No wonder you need that FAQ . If I had it I 'd send it . I 'm sure others will take up there slack ... Andy Infante I sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis ' 71 BMW R60 5 upon the observance of the law than they do upon it 's DoD 2426 enforcement . Calvin Coolidge My opinions , dammit , have nothing to do with anyone else ! ! !
