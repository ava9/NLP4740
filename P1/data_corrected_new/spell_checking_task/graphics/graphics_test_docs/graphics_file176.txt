LH car order delay I read and article in the 325 Chicago Tribune stating that Chrysler is having problems addressing the demand for the 3.5 L engine for it 's LH cars . Can anyone post how long they are waiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told they 'll have to wait ? ? Ordered mine December 30 , got it nine weeks later . But the dealer said that new orders were being held up he did n't expect to see any more 3.5 Lengine LHs for awhile . Andrew Klossner
