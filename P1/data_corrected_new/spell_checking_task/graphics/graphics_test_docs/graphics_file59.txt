After 2000 years , can we say that Christian Morality is Frank O'Dwyer writes ... Plus questions for you : why do subjectivists relativists nihilists get so het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism ? To the degree that relativism is and more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism , it provides more power and ability to control events . Assuming , for the moment , that morals are relative , then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results . Assuming that the is an absolute morality , two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; the is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is amoral . Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention , I 'd say that compromise seems to be better . Ray Fischer Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies .
