Of course we ca n't hope currently at least to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails . Surely it was n't the only daydream he had . What was special about this one ? Could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules ? Is such analogical reasoning extrascientific ? Or is it rather at the very heart of science Perice 's notion of abduction , the use of models within and across disciplines ? Upon close examination , is the a nonrational mystical leap taking place , or is it perhaps closer to and formal though often incomplete analogy or model ? I feel the need to repeat myself : Kekule 's dream is a rather bad example of much of anything . Read RootBernstein 's book on the history of the benzene ring . Mark A .
