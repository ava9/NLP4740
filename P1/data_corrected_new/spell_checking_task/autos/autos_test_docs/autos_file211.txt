Why not build a inflatable space dock . If you 're doing largescale satellite servicing , being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense . The question is whether anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near future , too the point of justifying development of such a thing . ... inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen , just neeeds to be nonflameble , nondamaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat ... You 'd almost certainly use air . Given that you have to pressurize with something , safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable even if there servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing , too avoid needing a ventilation system , it 's nice if there hangar atmosphere is breathable in a pinch it makes mask functioning much less critical .
