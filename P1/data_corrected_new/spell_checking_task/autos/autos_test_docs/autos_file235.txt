Fred , the problem with such reasoning is that for us nonbelievers we need a better measurement tool to state that person A is a real Muslim Christian , while person B is not . As I know the are no such tools , and anyone could believe in a religion , misuse its power and otherwise make bad PR . It clearly shows the sore points with religion in other words show me a movement that ca n't spin off Khomeinis , Stalins , Davidians , Husseins ... . I do n't think such a system exists . I think the reason for that is an condition known as free will . We humans have got it . Anybody , using their freewill , can tell lies and halftruths about any system and thus abuse it for their own ends . I do n't think such tools exist either . In addition , the 's no such thing as objective information . All together , it looks like religion and any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose . This all reminds me of Descartes ' whispering deamon . You ca n't trust anything . So why bother . Cheers , Kent . ALink : KSAND Private activities on the net .
