Miracle Berries anyone ? From Kalat , J . W .. 1992 : Biological Psychology . Wadsworth Publishing Co . Belmont , CA . Pg . 219 . Reproduced without permission . Digression 6.1 : Miracle Berries and there Modification of Taste Receptors Although the miracle berry , and plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless , it temporarily changes the taste of other substances . Miracle berries contain a protein , miraculin , that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids Bartoshuk , Gentile , Moskowitz , Meiselman , 1974 . If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry and I do recommend it , for about the next half an hour all acids which are normally sour will taste sweet . They will continue to taste sour as well . Miraculin was , for a time , commercially available in the United States as a diet aid . The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened , slightly acidic substances . Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories . A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries . We drank straight lemon juice , sauerkraut juice , even vinegar . All tasted extremely sweet . Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are . We awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers . ... continued discussion of a couple other tastealtering substances ... Refs : Bartoshuk , L . M . , Gentile , R . L . , Moskowitz , H .
