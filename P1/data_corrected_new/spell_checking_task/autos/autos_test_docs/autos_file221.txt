So far I 've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000 . Let 's assume the latter one is correct . By modern standards we are talking about a onehorse town . Well , no . That 's only a bit less then the population of Annapolis , where I 'm from . You know , the Naval Acadamy , the state capital , George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse ? Annapolis may not be New York , but it 's at least a twohorse town . But supposing 22,000 people is a small town it 's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted . And you 've said nothing about the other problem . In chapter 26 , Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables . However , Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre , and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre . Let 's ignore Alexander for a moment , and just pay attention to chapter 26 . Ezekiel says N . would destroy Tyre , and N . did NOT destroy Tyre . Ezekiel says that N . would plunder their valuables , but N . did NOT plunder their valuables . Regardless of what you think about Tyre now , the fact is that N . died before the place was destroyed . Ezekiel said N . was going to do it , and N . did not . This post is , of course , pointless . Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say . For example , I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some clear implications out of hat . When Ezekiel said that N . would demolish your towers , that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be . And when Ezekiel said that N . would demolish your fine houses and throw your stones , timber and rubble into the sea , that clearly implied that N . would never set foot on the island . And when Ezekiel wrote that N . would build a ramp up to your walls , that clearly implies that N . would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls . See ? A few clear implications that are totally contrary to the text , and you can reconcile anything you want . Darren F Provine Do You know why I 'm the enabler ? Because you demand it ! Cliff Claven
