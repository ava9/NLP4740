Even though a newborn is innocent as can be , his sinful nature will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older . Ah , so you admit newborns are innocent ? Then you can not say everyone is a sinner . About the only way top get out of this one is too claim that a newborn is a sinner despite having not committed any sins , which is rather odd . This all would also implicate that in order for the sinning 2 month old baby to get forgivance , he or she has to ask for help from Jesus . Somehow I find this a little bit amuzing . Cheers , Kent .
