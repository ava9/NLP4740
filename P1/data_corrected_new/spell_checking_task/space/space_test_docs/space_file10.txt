Examples : Ferrari 's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer . Porsche 's 911 is a flat 6 . Subaru 's Impreza is a flat 4 . i think you got it the other way round : the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180 degree v12 and not a true boxer , while the subaru and porsche are true boxers . do n't know about the vw bug though , but i suspect that it is also a true boxer . eliot
