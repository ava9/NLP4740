Atheism denies the existence of God . This is logically bankrupt where is the proof of this nonexistence ? It 's a joke . This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i . e . the belief that you ca n't deny anything that you ca n't prove does n't exist . This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist , does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them ? According to the above poster , we must believe in objects or beings that have n't been proved not to exist so why stop at God ? the could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences , say one is missing a finger , one has blond hair , ... and they all live on other planets so we ca n't see them The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God . Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of a God ? Here again is a classic atheist fallacy . How did they shoot themselves in the foot ? Radical Muslims , the Crusades , the Inquisition are common examples that atheists like to bring up as marks against religion . How weak ! Only fools can take that drivel seriously . How about the granddaddy of all human atrocities , the Stalinist movement ? Twenty eight MILLION people killed under this leadership , which proudly featured atheism . There is a big difference here , Stalin did n't say that he stood for a particular moral position i . e . against murder and terrorism , etc . and then did the opposite like the religious movements , he was at least an honest killer . This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint . Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic , look at all the russians that helped Stalin that were n't atheists do n't they contradict your point ? Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people , this is just the common assumption that atheists ca n't value life as much as theists which you did n't support . Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . Yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God is unknowable . This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is , though it 's less arrogant and pompous . Ah , and here 's another point you did n't get out of the FAQ . An atheist does n't have to hold the positive view that god does n't exist , he she may just have the nonexistence of the positive belief . Here 's the example : Strong atheism I believe god does not exist a positive belief Weak atheism I do n't believe in a god a negative belief these are NOT the same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable . Or let 's look at it this way in sets suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not . So if S santa , then E S no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa . But notice that even E S no is itself another idea ! This means you have lots of cases : christian : A , E A yes , B , E B no , . . . G , E G yes ... where G god atheist strong : A , E A . . . . . G , E G no atheist weak : A , ... E i . e . no G at all in the set agnostic : A , ... G , E G indeterminate , E ' , ... Why are people so afraid to say undecided ? It must just be another feature of human nature undecided is not a sexy , trendy , or glamorous word . It does not inspire much hate or conflict . It 's not blasphemous . It 's not political . In fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated . Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us to take positions , even false ones .
