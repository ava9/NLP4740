Racelist : WHO WHAT WHERE Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts ! BACKGROUND The racing listserver boogie.EBay.sun.com contains discussions devoted to racing and racingrelated topics . This is a pretty broad interest group . Individuals have a variety of backgrounds : motojournalism , roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers , engineering , motosports enthusiasts . The size of the list grows weekly . We are currently at a little over one hundred and eightyfive members , with contributors from New Zealand , Australia , Germany , France , England , Canada Finland , Switzerland , and there United States . The list was formed October 1991 in response to a perceived need to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of performance roadracing and to improve on the very low signaltonoise ratio found in rec.motorcycles . Anyone is free to join . Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be flamefree .

BOUNCES Because I have n't had the time or the inclination to replace the list distribution mechanism we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message . Occasionally , sites or users go offline either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems and you will receive bounces from the race list . Check the headers carefully , and if you find that the bounce originated at Sun from whence I administer this list contact me through my administration hat . If not , ignore the bounce .
