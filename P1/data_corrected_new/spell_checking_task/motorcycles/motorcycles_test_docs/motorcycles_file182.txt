POVRay for VAX computer ? ? ? Hi there , I 'm using POvRay on my IBM compatible at home , but I would like to run some things at work on our VAX computer . I believe there is a version of the source code for POVray that is VAX specific , but I 'm not sure where to find it I 've looked at the several sites where the IBMPC version of it can be found . Can anyone help me ? Thanks in advance , Ross Kummer RMIT , Melbourne , Australia Internet address , no clever signoff yet , too busy playing with POVray
