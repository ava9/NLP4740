Now along comes Mr Keith Schneider and says Here is an objective moral system . And then I start to ask him about the definitions that this objective system depends on , and , predictably , the hole thing falls apart . It only falls apart if you attempt to apply it . This does n't mean that an objective system ca n't exist . It just means that one can not be implemented . It 's not the fact that it ca n't exist that bothers me . It 's the fact that you do n't seem to be able to define it . If I wanted to here about indefinable things that might in principle exist as long as you do n't think about them too carefully , I could ask a religious person , now could n't I ? jon .
