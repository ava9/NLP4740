If it takes making it an alt group , then why not ? I 've been following this thread for , what has it been , too months now ? Liefting The alt . hierarchie is created for 2 purposes : 1 . For Liefting groups which do not fit under the comp . or other ' official ' Liefting hierarchies 2 . For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups Liefting like alt.gulf.war Liefting Because there is no voting process or any other control Liefting facilities , sites are free to decide not to carry some of Liefting the alt groups . Liefting Therefore , it is I think desirable to try to create Liefting comp.graphics . raytrace , rendering or whatever and not an Liefting altgroup Plus , many sites , especially many . com sites do not carry any alt newsgroups . We do n't for example . A comp . group will get a much broader distribution and would be useful to many more people . Plus the topic is important popular enough to warrant its own group , IMHO .
