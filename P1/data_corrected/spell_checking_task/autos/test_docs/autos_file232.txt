Explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts , and I am happy to listen . For example , if it were instinctive not to murder ... Then not murdering would have no moral significance , since the would be nothing voluntary about it . See , the you go again , saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary . Why do you think this ? And anyway , humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts . So , only intelligent beings can be moral , even if there bahavior of other beings mimics theirs ? You are starting to get the point . Mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated . A Parrot saying Pretty Polly is n't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly . You are attaching too many things to the term moral , I think . Let 's try this : is it good that animals of the same species do n't kill each other . Or , do you think this is right ? Or do you think that animals are machines , and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong ? Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily , but they do n't . They do . I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this , but you seem to have a very short memory . Those were n't arbitrary killings . They were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot . Are you trying to say that this is n't an act of morality because most animals are n't intelligent enough to think like we do ? I 'm saying : There must be the possibility that the organism it 's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives . It 's right there in the posting you are replying too . Yes it was , but I still do n't understand your distinctions . What do you mean by consider ? Can a small child be moral ? How about a gorilla ? A dolphin ? A platypus ? Where is the line drawn ? Does the being need to be self aware ? What do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from arbitrarily killing each other ? Do n't you find the fact that they do n't at all significant ? keith
