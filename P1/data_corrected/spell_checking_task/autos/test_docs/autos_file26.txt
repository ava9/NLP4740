1 . Calculators 2 . Teflon So your eggs do n't stick in the pan 3 . Pacemakers Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988 I do n't think touting contributions is a good idea . World War II produced many many beneficial spinoffs . Eg . Radar , jet aeroplanes , rocket technology . I do n't think anyone would argue that World War II was , in and of itself , and good thing . If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in and of itself . I disagree with what to tout , although I agree that the space program is inherently a good thing . Most people today only care about what will it cost me ? and what 's in it for me ? and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself . Our society has become increasingly geared toward the shortterm which you could read as NOW ! . They could n't care less about next week , much less next century . They want something to show for the expenditure and they want it now . I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level . You assume that the general public ca n't handle the truth and then , based on this assumption , go for the fluff arguments . Then someone , who can understand a good argument , comes along and asks why do n't you just develop the spinoffs ? or why ca n't we just get our spinoffs from some other program , like the military ? There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects . I 'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs . I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them . BTW : do n't forget Velcro ... And if you 're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right . Teflon has been around since before NASA . As I understand it , Velcro was conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes . Certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties . I would need to see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here today without NASA .
