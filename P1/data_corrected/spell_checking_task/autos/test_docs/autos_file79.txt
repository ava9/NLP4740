USMade MB SUV MercedesBenz announced yesterday its plans to begin building sportutility vehicles in the US by 1997 . They are targeted at the Jeep Grand Cherokee et al . and will reportedly sell for less than 30,000 . Did anyone see a picture ? Is it the Gwagon Gelaendewagen currently available in Europe and in the US by greymarket or is it an entirely new vehicle ? Any details would be appreciated .
