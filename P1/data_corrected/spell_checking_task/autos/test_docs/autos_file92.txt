Anyway , since I seem to be the only one following this particular line of discussion , I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have read this book ? What are your thoughts on it ? I read it . I found it wonderful . For some reason no flames , please , I was reminded of Hemingway , Carl Orff and Van Gogh not all at once , though . Geoff Arnold , PCNFS architect , Sun Select . What if they made the whole thing up ? The Great Lie by Four guys , two thousand years ago , over wine ... The Tear Garden
