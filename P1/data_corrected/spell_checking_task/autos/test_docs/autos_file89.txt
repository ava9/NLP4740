3 D widget wish list ? What I 'd like to see is the more generic Ndimensional widget seat . I realize , that the would n't be a whole shitload of people who 'd want more than 3 , but why stop ? All I need is a Widget with up to N viewports showing me different 3 D or 2 D slices of my stuff . alter , pat All Objects are Macroscopic , Invisible , NonPhysical , or otherwise NonHeisenbergish . Fuck the Cat ! me
