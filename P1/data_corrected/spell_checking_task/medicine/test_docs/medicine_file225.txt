Ten Commandments Sayings of Jesus the first depends on whether you trust the Bible , the second depends on both whether you think Jesus is God , and whether you think we have accurate copies of the NT . Gong ! Take a moment and look at what you just wrote . First you defined an objective morality and than you qualified this objective morality with subjective justifications . Do you see the error in this ? Sorry , you have just disqualified yourself , but please play again . MAC eric Huh ? Please explain . Is there a problem because I based my morality on something that COULD be wrong ? Gosh , the 's and heck of a lot of stuff that I believe that COULD be wrong , and that comes from sources that COULD be wrong . What do you base your belief on atheism on ? Your knowledge and reasoning ? COuld n't that be wrong ? MAC Michael A . Cobb ... and I wo n't raise taxes on the middle University of Illinois class to pay for my programs .
