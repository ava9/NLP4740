... For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping ' cid LSD . Frankly speaking , I did n't really care . It was fun anyway . It did n't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a tremendously greater risk of serious birth defects . Does it matter that the study yes , singular that showed LSD causing birth defects also holds true for aspirin ? Does it matter that this study is flatout wrong , and LSD does not give you a greater risk of having children with birth defects ? Merlyn LeRoy
