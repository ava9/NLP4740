Ouch . : This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study . Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy , Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce there , er , step function provided when the rider 's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider does n't . I think it 's really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advise to heart in their design of bikes like the CBR 900RR and the GTS 1000A . When I 'm riding my 900RR , my goodies are already up against the tank , because the design of the Corbin seat tends to move you forward . Would n't the major danger to one 's cajones be due to accelerating into and then being stopped by the tank ? If you 're already there , the would n't be an impact problem , would there ?
