Boy , this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ : center and radius , exactly fitting those points ? I know how to do it for a circle from 3 points , but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in 3 D . I have checked some geometry books , Graphics Gems , and Farin , but am still at a loss ? Please have mercy on me and provide the solution ? Off the top of my head , I might try : Given : p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 Find : pc center of sphere determined by p1 , ... , p4 , dist pc , pi radius pc is the same distance from our four points , so dist pc , p1 dist pc , p2 dist pc , p3 dist pc , p4 Of course , we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots : distsq pc , p1 distsq pc , p2 distsq pc , p3 distsq pc , p4 Plug in the variables into the distance formula , simplify , and the x 2c , y 2c , and z 2c terms cancel out , leaving you with three linearly independent equations and three unknowns xc , yc , zc .
