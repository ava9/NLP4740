CB750 C with flames out there exhaust ! ! ! From article , by Mike Hollyman : Hi , I have an 82 CB750 Custom that I just replaced the cylinder head gasket on . Now when I put it back together again , it would n't idle at all . It was only running on 23 cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out there exhaust on the right side . The exhaust is 42 MAC . I bought new plugs today and it runs very rough and still wo n't idle . I am quite sure the fine tune knobs on the carbs are messed up . I checked the timing , it was fine , so I advanced it and little and that did n't help . I assume the carbs need to be synched . Can I buy a kit and do this myself ? If so , what kit is the best for the price . Any other suggestions ? I dont think its the carbs that are out , I would suspect that the cam timing is out , as you say that you had the head off , that would make sense to me , Ian . Just my 0.02 emu 's worth .
