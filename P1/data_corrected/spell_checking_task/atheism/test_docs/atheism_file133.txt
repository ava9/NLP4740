hello there ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax , pls kindly comment on its handling . From CycleWorld magazine 593 who usually never says anything bad about any motorcycle : The Max certainly has motor , but there are some things it is short of . It is short of chassis . It loves straight lines ; aimed in one , it is nicely stable . But it is not overfond of corners . Forced into one , it protests , shaking its head , chattering its front tire , grinding its footpegs , and generally making known its preference for straight pavement . Bumps ? It does n't like them either . Its fork is n't too bad , though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking . The shocks , though which work on that shorttravel , shaftdrive swingarm , are firm to the point of harshness .
