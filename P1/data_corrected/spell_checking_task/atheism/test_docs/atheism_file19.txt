I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against FMGs . Is that true ? I know some that wo n't even interview FMGs . I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory , particularly if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but was n't offered an interview , but I do n't know if it has ever gone to court . FMGs who are not citizens are , like all aliens , in a difficult situation . Only citizens get to vote here , so noncitizens are of little or no interest to legislators . Also , the noncitizen may well be in the middle of processing for resident alien status . There is a stron sense that rocking the boat eg . suing a residency program will delay the granting of that status , perhaps for ever . Don Mackie his opinions
