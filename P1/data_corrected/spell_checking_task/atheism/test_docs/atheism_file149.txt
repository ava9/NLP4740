Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling photography I could n't help but being slightly disgusted by the narrowminded , I know it all , I do n't believe what I ca n't see or measure attitude of many people out there . I am neither a real believer , nor a disbeliever when it comes to socalled paranormal stuff ; but as far as I 'm concerned , it is just as likely as the existence of , for instance , and god , which seems to be quite accepted in our societies without any scientific basis . I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something , ANYTHING , simply because it does n't fit your current frame of reference . History shows that many great people , great scientists , were people who kept an open mind and were ridiculed by sceptics . Especially the USA should be grateful ; after all , Columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth . It is one thing to be openminded about phenomona that have not be demonstrated to be false , and quite another to believe in something like Krilian photography , where all the claimed effects have be demonstrated to be artifacts . There is no longer any reason to adopt a wait and see attitude about Krilian photography , it has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal discharge . The auras shown by missing leaf parts came from moisture left by the original whole leaf , for example . That 's what science is , son . Bill VanHorne
