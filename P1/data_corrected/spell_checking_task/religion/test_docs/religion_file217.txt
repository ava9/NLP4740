I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also . I finally decided to just have my drain plug welded shut . It works great ! I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that it 's just as good or better then the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles . Works for me , I must say . I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons . I was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my airfilter . Oh come on , Silly , all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole . What do you think all those big air intake things are for on those hotrod cars ? They 're just for looks only ... little does anyone know , they provide access to the oilfill hole . Well , over where we live , we have problems with vandals stealing people 's wheels . Those locking nuts did n't stop them . So to be safe and sure , I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together . It works , serious ! I have n't had my wheels stolen yet ! .
