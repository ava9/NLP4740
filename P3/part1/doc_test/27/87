NEW SATICOY BRIDGE DEMANDED

Warning that the Saticoy bridge spanning the Santa Clara River is in danger of 
collapse, a group of Saticoy businessmen, property owners and a Ventura City 
Council member have joined forces to hasten state efforts to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the bridge is safe and have the replacement project, which 
includes a new bridge and widening of California 118 through Saticoy, 
tentatively scheduled to begin in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the newly formed Saticoy Bridge Committee said this week that 
1992 is not soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is just Mickey-Mousing around with this bridge. If that 
bridge goes down, someone is going to get hurt, just like the Oakland Bay 
Bridge," said Bill Martin, a Saticoy property owner and bridge committee 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the committee, which met for the first time Wednesday, plans to 
pressure state officials to keep the Saticoy bridge project in the forefront 
and is considering a lobbying trip to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Charles Davis, who runs a bakery and barbecue business along 
Wells Road, said the bridge is extensively cracked in many of the vertical pier 
supports and a bridge footing has been undermined, exposing several steel 
pilings that are driven 50 to 60 feet into the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a county resident for 43 years, said the bridge was weakened when it 
was damaged during a 1969 flood that washed out several other county bridges. 
He said the bridge has been patched up but not adequately repaired. 
</P>
<P>
But California Department of Transportation officials said this week that they 
have no fears about the bridge's immediate safety, although they acknowledge 
that it may be below standards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfectly safe," said Jack Hallin, chief of the local Caltrans project 
development branch. "Caltrans inspects every bridge on the state highway system 
every two years as a matter of course. The piles are not in any danger of being 
undermined." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Caltrans environmental report on the project states: "The bridge 
is structurally deficient as well as functionally obsolete. The footings are 
too high -- pile footings are exposed and subject to scour undermining the 
bridge. Decking is deficient -- barely adequate for legal loads." 
</P>
<P>
The study also specifies problematic expansion joints, cracked concrete 
surfaces and a metal beam guardrail that doesn't meet Federal Highway 
Administration requirements. It also says the bridge is too narrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Saticoy bridge is one of four bridges linking Ventura across the Santa 
Clara River to Oxnard and east Ventura County. It was built in 1912 but 
destroyed in a 1914 flood. The bridge washed out again in 1938 and was rebuilt 
in 1939. Major repairs were done in 1956, 1969, 1974 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans plans to build a new four-lane bridge and widen 1 1/2 miles of the 
highway along Los Angeles Avenue and Wells Road between Vineyard Avenue and the 
Santa Paula Freeway. California 118 will be diverted diagonally across the 
railroad tracks, bypassing downtown Saticoy, to link up with Wells Road, which 
will also be extended southward. 
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 cars and trucks use the route and bridge daily, according to 
Caltrans figures, last compiled in 1984. The count is the highest of any 
two-lane state highway in Ventura County and includes 14% truck traffic, 
according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and other committee members said Caltrans officials are ignoring the 
safety issue when they continue to delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a case against the safety of the bridge, but when it became prudent 
that plans be delayed they seem to take a laissez-faire attitude about it," 
said Ventura City Councilman Donald Villeneuve, who initiated the bridge 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said Caltrans first considered the project in 1984 and planned to have 
it finished this year. Now the construction, which has been subject to 
fluctuating state budgets, is not set to be completed until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, along with widening California 118 and California 23 through 
Moorpark, has been a long-term Caltrans goal but was delayed in 1985 because of 
a $300-million shortfall in the state's $5.3-billion highway project fund. 
Hallin said funds being shuttled to highways and bridges in the San Francisco 
region, damaged after the Oct. 17 earthquake, may delay other state projects 
but should not affect work on California 118 and the Saticoy bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said the state has $17 million set aside in its State Transportation 
Improvement Program for the Saticoy project but the funds are not specifically 
budgeted for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
Funding and the date of completion for the project will depend on the passage 
of a Senate committee bill in June. If signed into law, the bill will raise the 
Gann spending limit and allow a gas tax increase, which will provide additional 
funds for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said if the bill is not passed, county projects may be delayed for 
several more years.
