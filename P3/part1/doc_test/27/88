A short but strategically important new road opened Friday in Dana Point, and 
it is expected to ease some of the traffic congestion on Coast Highway, a 
county transportation official said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-mile, four-lane, divided highway called Camino del Avion connects Crown 
Valley Parkway and Street of the Golden Lantern. The new highway was built with 
private funds from developers in the area, said Kenneth R. Smith, Orange 
County's director of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the area 
where the new highway opened, praised the opening of the new link. 
</P>
<P>
"The completion of Camino del Avion allows county staff to now focus on other 
critical links in the 1990 Action Plan" for county highway improvements, Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the frustration of the coastal area residents in (the) south 
county who use our arterial highways," he said, but added, "I'm proud of the 
progress we have made, and more improvements are on the way." 
</P>
<P>
Camino del Avion is a "critical east-west arterial highway" that will provide 
an alternative route for residents of Laguna Niguel and Dana Point who now use 
Coast Highway, according to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of Camino del Avion has strategic significance to southern Orange 
County and provides long-needed traffic relief in booming southern Orange 
County, Smith said 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's real important because (there are) very few routes in that area 
going in an east-west direction," Smith said. "It'll relieve a lot of traffic 
on Coast Highway and on Stonehill (Drive)." 
</P>
<P>
The $4.5-million construction cost of Camino del Avion came entirely from 
developer contributions. Developer-paid highways are now "the backbone of the 
county's program for adding new roads," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been forced into this type of financing because the (state) gas tax 
hasn't been increased for many years." The state gasoline tax is used to 
finance roads, highways and their improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said maintenance of the newly opened Camino del Avion will now be handled 
by the county and the city of Dana Point.
