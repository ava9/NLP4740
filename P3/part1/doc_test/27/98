The county Planning Commission on Tuesday upheld an earlier recommendation 
against building a two-lane road in Trabuco Canyon that critics have warned 
would open hundreds of acres of rugged backcountry to intense development and 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 3 to 2 to recommend that Rose Canyon Road -- a 
three-mile-long proposed road through Trabuco Canyon on the edge of the 
Cleveland National Forest -- be eliminated from a land-use plan now under 
consideration for a 6,300-acre swath of canyon country. The commission also 
voted to support "spot improvements" along two-lane Live Oak Canyon Road, which 
links El Toro Road with Trabuco Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements would include widening each lane from 10 to 12 feet and adding a 
four-foot-wide shoulder to each side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Stephen A. Nordeck, Thomas Moody and Roger Slates voted to 
recommend deleting Rose Canyon Road from the Foothill-Trabuco Specific Plan, a 
sweeping proposal to establish building limits for an area best known for its 
stands of ancient oak trees and scenic ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Earl Wooden and Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth opposed 
Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, a commission majority not only opposed Rose Canyon Road but 
recommended that it be eliminated from the county's master plan of highways. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors will make a final decision sometime early next 
year on the road, as well as the growth blueprint for the sparsely populated 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's debate focused on whether existing roads in the area, primarily Live 
Oak Canyon and Trabuco Canyon roads, can safely handle the increase in traffic 
generated from new development that is expected once the Foothill-Trabuco plan 
is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not convinced that we can live without Rose Canyon Road," 
Leavenworth said. "I don't think we've been offered a viable alternative to 
allow a reasonable amount of development." 
</P>
<P>
But Nordeck, whose district includes Trabuco Canyon, said that Rose Canyon Road 
would largely serve commuters from Rancho Santa Margarita, not the needs of 
local residents. Nordeck, who supports a network of local roads, was sharply 
critical of the way county planners and traffic engineers gathered their data 
to support inclusion of Rose Canyon Road in the area's specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
The commission delayed any decision on placing a cap on the number of new homes 
that can be built in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Without Rose Canyon Road, county planners say, only 400 to 550 new homes can be 
built. Less than 300 now exist in the area. STEVEN R. CHURM
