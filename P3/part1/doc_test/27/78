Allowing private companies to build and finance toll roads in California has 
become a new option in legislative negotiations over a 10-year plan for easing 
congestion in the state's highway system, possibly including two tollway 
projects aimed at relieving congestion on two Orange County freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said that, as a concession to Republicans, 
Democratic negotiators are considering offering their support for a measure by 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) which would permit private groups to 
build and operate transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're looking at and it's a serious consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said Wednesday that Baker's proposal is linked, in 
part, to recent interest among authorities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties who have been promoting two potential toll road projects to relieve 
the severely congested Orange and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Those same Orange County officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
that Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum and a San Bernardino County 
official have been trying to garner private support for toll roads into Orange 
County. They said Schabarum favors a route through Tonner Canyon, while San 
Bernardino County prefers Soquel Canyon. Both are in Chino Hills north of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the toll road proposal would be part of an overall agreement that is 
being hammered out by legislative leaders and Gov. George Deukmejian on a plan 
to finance $20 billion in transportation improvements over the next decade. The 
plan includes proposals for a gasoline tax increase and a hike in truck weight 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, private construction and operation of toll roads as part of the 
state highway system has been prohibited by California law. In 1987, the 
Legislature authorized three toll road projects in Orange County but specified 
that two newly created local government agencies would oversee both the 
construction and financing. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said his proposal would allow the California Department of Transportation 
to enter agreements with private business to construct and lease transportation 
facilities which could include everything from bridges to roads and urban 
interchanges to elevated traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've left it open," he said. "I don't have a specific project in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would be limited to authorizing only three projects -- one each 
in Northern and Southern California and a third in an area yet to be specified. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the project, Baker said it would have to be built to state 
specifications and with specific approval by Caltrans because "we wouldn't just 
want a road to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Private companies entering agreements with the state, he said, would be 
permitted to impose tolls on the new facilities to pay for construction and 
provide them with a "reasonable" profit. 
</P>
<P>
Although he anticipated that tolls would be the most popular method of paying 
for the projects, he said the companies could propose other financing schemes. 
The private companies would operate the facilities for 35 years, at which point 
they would revert to the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said private involvement is needed in state transportation projects 
because there is not enough public money to pay for all the projects needed. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan for toll roads in northern Orange County would provide badly needed 
"relief valves" in an area where the borders of the three counties meet, an 
area for which little or no state highway money is available to build new 
highways, Orange County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said that they have not been asked yet to support either the 
Tonner or Soquel Canyon projects, nor have they been approached by Orange 
County businesses interested in funding or building either link. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission already is studying the feasibility 
of building a proposed extension of the Orange Freeway as a toll road. But the 
study is not aimed specifically at the possibility of building the project with 
private funds. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway currently ends at the Garden Grove Freeway near Anaheim Stadium and 
would be extended along the Santa Ana River to the San Diego Freeway in 
Fountain Valley, at a cost exceeding $1 billion. No money is expected to be 
available for the project from the state or federal government, because such 
sources already have been tapped for other traffic improvements, including the 
massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said that although the Orange Freeway extension has not 
come up in discussions with Los Angeles and San Bernardino County officials, 
and is in no way connected with Wednesday's legislative developments, some 
talks have been held with Orange County developer Henry T. Segerstrom and the 
Reason Foundation, a Libertarian think tank in Santa Monica, about building the 
extension as a toll road. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the county transportation commission, 
said Wednesday that he welcomes the Assembly proposal, although he added that 
he has not discussed it with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no resistance to private toll roads," he said. "We need every kind of 
innovative funding technique we can get in this county. We should carefully 
look at the (Orange Freeway) extension and a new connection to San Bernardino 
County or Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Hagen, chief deputy director of Caltrans District 12, which encompasses 
Orange County, added, "There are some areas where private financing may be the 
only way to build new highways. The location of those (proposed) routes -- 
Tonner Canyon and Soquel Canyon -- are in places where there is a great need 
but no money to do anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker's legislative proposal has the strong backing of the 
Deukmejian Administration through Robert K. Best, director of Caltrans, who has 
argued that it would "give us the flexibility to supplement governmental funds 
with the resources and talent of private industry to bring additional projects 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate Transportation 
Committee, said that while he has consistently supported the "use of toll roads 
in theory," the plan may face strong opposition from some Democrats in the 
Senate.
