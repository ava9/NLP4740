The California Highway Patrol warned today that three officers will work 
overtime to ticket solo drivers and illegal lane changers in the car-pool lane 
that opens Wednesday on a section of the northbound San Diego Freeway from 
Westminster to Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And those tickets will cost twice as much. A new state law took effect Jan. 1 
doubles the minimum fine for lane violators to $100, and sets the maximum fine 
for repeat offenders at $500. 
</P>
<P>
Orange cones blocking motorists from using the completed, 4.5-mile section 
between Springdale Street and Interstate 605 will be removed late tonight, so 
that commuters can start using the lane Wednesday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Mike Mikita said that, beginning immediately, the CHP will assign two 
extra officers to work overtime during the day and a third at night to 
ticketing solo drivers or those who enter and exit the special lane across the 
four-foot buffer area and double-yellow line that separate it from regular 
traffic. The CHP will also add another regular "beat" officer on the route for 
daytime enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no grace period," Mikita said. 
</P>
<P>
Mikita said he expects some traffic congestion Wednesday under the I-605 
overpass in Seal Beach, where the car-pool lane gradually merges into a regular 
traffic lane.
