Royal Dean Fadely was trying to do his son a favor by taking a look at his 
dishwasher before the repairman came. When he left his son's condo Tuesday 
morning to return home, he was struck by a tractor-trailer and killed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Rialto resident Leanne Fargon, 30, was driving the truck carrying 
sand off a hill on Chapman Avenue just east of Crawford Canyon Road. Fadely, 
70, was driving south on Crawford Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said both vehicles were in the intersection when the truck struck the 
driver's side of Farley's white Thunderbird. Police could not determine who ran 
the red light. No traffic tickets were issued, and Fargon was released at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Fadely, a 17-year resident of Tustin and a retired advertising manager, was 
pronounced dead about 20 minutes after the accident while still pinned in his 
car. An official from the coroner's office said Fadely was wearing his seat 
belt but that it didn't help since the truck smashed directly into the door on 
the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
Several area residents gathered around the scene and spoke about the frequent 
accidents that occur at the intersection, which is at the bottom of a hill 
outside Santiago Canyon, where a lot of construction work has taken place in 
the last few years, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Roper, a driver's education teacher at Santa Ana High School, has lived in 
a house about 100 feet from the intersection for about 10 years and said at 
least one serious accident happens there every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have the green arrow at that intersection, you don't assume the other 
trucks are going to stop," he said, referring to facing traffic that is coming 
down the hill. He said he has often waited at a green turn signal while 
fast-moving vehicles, mostly trucks, ran red lights. He said that many car 
drivers also speed down Crawford Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"No amount of engineering is going to stop an accident if someone runs a red 
light," said Chuck Glass, a traffic engineer with the city of Orange. He added 
that all city equipment in the area, including the lights, was working 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
Glass would not comment on the safety of the intersection compared to that of 
other intersections, but said that one fatal accident there every six months 
was possible. The speed limit on the hill just east of the intersection is 45 
m.p.h., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city installed a traffic light about halfway down the hill several months 
ago, residents said, and the signal has helped slow traffic. Glass said the 
light was installed to accommodate traffic from new housing developments, not 
because of the truck traffic. LUCY CHABOT
