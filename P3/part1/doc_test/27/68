O.C. TRANSPORTATION PANEL STUDIES FEES FOR DRIVERS

A $1-a-day parking fee for all employees driving to work in Orange County is 
one option being considered by county transportation officials to raise up to 
$5 billion that is needed for easing highway congestion in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission voted Monday to begin the process 
of hiring a consultant to study the feasibility of imposing parking fees, as 
well as possible increases in vehicle registration or driver's license fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although no public official has yet proposed parking fees in the county, the 
planned feasibility study comes as the commission seeks alternatives to Measure 
M, a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for transportation projects that was 
defeated by voters Nov. 7. The increase, which lost, 52.6% to 47.4%, would have 
raised about $3.1 billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how parking fees would be collected," said Stanley T. Oftelie, 
the commission's executive director. "But we want to inventory everything 
that's possible so we'll know what options we have." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no consensus on the commission to impose such fees," added Commission 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. "I'd say 
it's a little too early for that." 
</P>
<P>
Charging people -- or their employers -- for parking at or near their 
workplaces was proposed earlier this year by respondents to the Orange County 
Transportation Commission's "100 Traffic Solutions" program. The project asked 
the public to mail in potential solutions to the county's traffic crunch. Also 
proposed were increases to existing registration and license fees. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the panel voted to seek proposals from consultants. A contract for a 
study on the proposals is expected to be awarded in February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A countywide parking fee of $1 per vehicle per day would raise about $5 billion 
over 20 years, according to commission projections. A $1 increase in vehicle 
registration or driver's license fees would generate less than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation would be needed to enact any increase in vehicle or driver's 
license fees, and the proceeds could probably not be used for mass transit 
projects, OCTC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A $1 surcharge on registration fees was used to pay for Orange County's freeway 
emergency call box system. But since then, Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed 
other proposed surcharges for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
No state legislation is needed for parking fees, but Oftelie said each city 
council, as well as the Board of Supervisors, would have to adopt separate 
ordinances to impose parking fees. Countywide, that would mean 30 separate 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of that happening are slim," Oftelie said. "And that means that it 
would be difficult to make implementation uniform. But that's one of the things 
we want to find out, since our last inventory of options was done in 1983. The 
landscape has changed significantly since then." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Oftelie cited a 1983 study that gave tolls short shrift because, 
at the time, federal laws made toll roads ineligible for U.S. highway funds. 
That changed several years ago, so the county is pursuing construction of toll 
roads with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's 20-year master plan of traffic improvements -- published 
earlier this year -- forecast heavy political opposition to parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward, a board member of Drivers for Highway Safety, a grass-roots group 
opposed to car-pool lanes that helped lead the campaign to defeat Measure M, 
said the method of raising revenue may not be the main issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know enough about it," Ward said of parking fees. "It's not the 
way they were raising the money in Measure M, it was the way they were going to 
spend it. And if they (OCTC) spend parking fees on the same plan, which 
includes more car-pool lanes, then it will all be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Ward predicted that parking fees would be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Reeder, a spokesman for Hughes Aircraft, the county's largest employer, 
said he is unaware of the company's position on parking fees but added: 
</P>
<P>
"Hughes would have a hard time accepting them. We have empty spots now in our 
parking lot, so there's not the competition for parking space that there was 
here a few years ago. Also, we do pay for what we think is our share of traffic 
improvements in Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Besides taking steps to hire a consultant, commission members have also 
discussed going back to the voters for approval of a half-cent sales tax 
increase, perhaps in November, 1990. However, no feasibility study for another 
tax effort has been scheduled.
