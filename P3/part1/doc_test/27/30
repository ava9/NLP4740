STREET SMART: BRIDGE AT FEATHERLY PARK IS FINALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS

Dear Street Smart: Why don't they open up the bridge over the Santa Ana River 
at Featherly Park? The bridge appears to be complete and is needed to permit 
some degree of safety to the bottlenecked portion of the Riverside Freeway in 
event of some emergency. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it's remaining closed because neighbors across the river are 
worried about traffic flowing from the freeway through their neighborhood. But 
traffic could also flow out of the neighborhood to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
If they're not going to use the bridge, why don't they tear it down?

The new bridge, which helps connect Gypsum Canyon Road with La Palma Avenue in 
Yorba Linda on the north side of the river, opened about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
But your frustration over the delay is understandable. The bridge opening was 
put off several weeks because of electrical problems with a couple of signal 
lights on the road leading to the bridge from the freeway, according to Jerry 
Crabill, Yorba Linda's traffic engineer. Officials opted to keep the bridge 
closed "for safety reasons" due to the balky signals even though the structure 
was raring and ready to have car traffic roll across, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crabill said the main reason for the bridge was not to provide relief to the 
freeway, but rather to allow residents of a neighborhood to the north of the 
river another access point to reach the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Your point about the potential use of the bridge by commuters trying to skirt 
the freeway is well taken. It's possible that during a crowded morning commute, 
traffic headed westbound on the Riverside Freeway might opt to get off at 
Gypsum Canyon Road and head out to La Palma Avenue, which snakes west well into 
the heart of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
If such a scenario takes place, it could introduce a new element of traffic 
into an otherwise quiet neighborhood that was previously just a collection of 
cul-de-sacs cut off to such incursions. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I often wonder why the Department of Motor Vehicles doesn't allow all 
motorcycles to use the emergency lane (outside the yellow line on the left) for 
two-wheeled travel. 
</P>
<P>
It would go a long way toward eliminating the dangers and occasionally serious 
accidents that result when motorcyclists split lanes between slow-moving 
traffic. Use of this space would involve no additional expense to the state or 
the driving public and provide an instant solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The motoring public may not realize that riding a motorcycle is far easier when 
it is moving, even slowly. When you stop a motorcycle, it wants to tip over. It 
is far safer for everyone if the motorcycle rider is allowed to keep rolling. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if there is some motorcycle-riding legislator who would get us some 
new law to use the emergency lane in stalled or slow-moving traffic. 
</P>

Even if the entire California Legislature rode motorcycles, it's pretty 
unlikely they would pass a law granting motorcyclists permission to use the 
emergency lane. After all, there would be no surer way to anger all those 
car-driving constituents barred from using the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials routinely cite a number of reasons for prohibiting 
motorcycles and other vehicles from using the emergency lanes as an escape 
hatch during traffic jams. It presents a safety hazard, they say, because 
stalled cars are often parked in the emergency strip or Highway Patrol officers 
are pausing there to monitor traffic. In such circumstances, motorcyclists 
could create a safety problem as they swing from the emergency lane into the 
regular traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, however, that the use of the emergency lane during periods 
of peak congestion is not without precedent. Motorists for a time were allowed 
to use the emergency lane on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway out of downtown 
Los Angeles during the crowded afternoon commute. 
</P>
<P>
But that rule wasn't discriminatory: It was applied to both cars and 
motorcycles. Moreover, the emergency lane in that section of freeway no longer 
exists. Recognizing the need to expand the freeway in the spot, state highway 
officials converted it into a regular traffic lane.
