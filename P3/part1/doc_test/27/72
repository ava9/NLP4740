Hurricane-force winds battered Southern California on Thursday morning, 
shredding a blimp and closing the runways at Ontario International Airport, 
ripping parts of the roofs from two buildings, knocking over trucks, toppling 
trees and power poles and fanning two brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
At least 29,000 customers lost electrical power as the cool, dry, Santa Ana 
winds blasted through areas below mountain canyons and passes at speeds as high 
as 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Police donned goggles to direct traffic as the down-slope winds whipped sand 
and dust into an opaque, tornado-like cloud between Ontario and San Bernardino, 
prompting a series of Sigalerts on Interstates 10 and 15 to warn of hazardous 
driving conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The winds began to ease Thursday afternoon as a new weather system started 
pushing toward Southern California from the north. 
</P>
<P>
And forecasters said at nightfall that "the Santa Anas are essentially over." 
They said today should be mostly clear and rather on the cool side, with winds 
gusting to no more than 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. in the most exposed areas. 
</P>
<P>
The gusts peaked shortly before dawn Thursday, hammering hardest at the 
foothill communities in western San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 million Airships Inc. craft, used by the Pepsi Cola Co. to advertise its 
Pepsi and Slice soft drinks, was "literally blown to bits" at its moorings at 
the Ontario airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Large pieces of it took off in the wind and proceeded to head toward Chino," 
airport manager Michael DiGirolamo said. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than the nose cone of the airship remained attached to the mooring 
pole. The fabric of the craft was reduced to ribbons and the gondola was dumped 
about 30 yards from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Airships Inc. said the gondola and engines were saved. But the 
polyester fabric skin, designed to hold 233,100 cubic feet of helium, was a 
total loss. The spokesman said the skin could be rebuilt within six weeks, but 
too late for the craft's next scheduled duty -- the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario Airport spokeswoman Angie Summers said winds gusting between 80 m.p.h. 
and 100 m.p.h., blowing dust and debris from the shredded airship onto the main 
runways combined to close the airport from 9 p.m. Wednesday until about 7:45 
a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
She said that at least 45 flights were delayed, canceled, or diverted to other 
airfields, including Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
An air cargo container pushed by the winds slammed into the side of a Southwest 
Airlines jetliner parked at Ontario. Southwest spokesman Ron Todd said the 
impact dented the Boeing 737 and punched a small hole in the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
A section of roof was torn from an Ontario Airport building that houses a 
kitchen providing food for up to 100 flights a day. David McMichael, shift 
manager at the Marriott In-Flite Services plant, said a 300-square-foot slab 
was torn from the building's roof at about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Rancho Cucamonga, the winds tore away a patch of roof at a San 
Bernardino County sheriff's substation, scattering paper work and personal 
effects around a briefing room and locker area. Several deputies said their 
personal cars in the parking lot were damaged by airborne debris. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Jerry Hunter of the Orange County Fire Department said a 
100-acre blaze in Trabuco Canyon was started by two arcing electrical wires at 
about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said it took about 220 firefighters from throughout the county more than 
three hours to control the blaze, which briefly threatened about 50 homes in 
the Rose Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
"It burned up quite a few back yards, but the houses were saved," said fire 
spokeswoman Kathleen Cha. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, a brush fire fanned by gusts of up to 60 m.p.h. spread rapidly 
in the Ramona area of San Diego County, blackening about 160 acres. 
</P>
<P>
No homes were threatened and California Department of Forestry officials 
expected full control by this morning. Officials said a downed power line 
ignited the thick grass and brush in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. said power was restored by late Thursday morning 
to most of the 29,000 customers blacked out in Los Angeles, Orange and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said only about 100 of its 
customers, in the Canoga Park and Sun Valley areas, lost electricity and in 
most cases, power was restored promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Interstates 10 and 15 remained open Thursday, but California Highway Patrol 
Officer James O'Brien said there were overturned trucks "everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"The most spectacular blow-over was where Interstates 10 and 15 meet in 
Ontario," said CHP Officer Vivian Firlien. "It left part of a truck hanging 
over the edge of one of those high transition roads, dangling over the 
motorists below." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Davis, general manager of a large truck stop in Ontario, said at least 
700 big rigs were parked there at one point early Thursday, waiting for the 
winds to ease. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the blowing dust and sand, traffic in some areas of western San 
Bernardino County was still moving at less than 5 m.p.h. at midday. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility was down to 10 feet in some places," Firlien said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times, said the high winds were generated by a large area of 
high pressure stationed over the Great Basin late Wednesday and early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the high pressure began to weaken late Thursday as a moderate, 
low-pressure storm system started to move south along the coast toward Southern 
California. The storm system will bring increasing clouds, and a "slight 
chance" of showers, to Southern California early Saturday, Beusterien said. 
</P>
<P>
It should be mostly sunny and clear on Sunday, he said, with increasing clouds 
on Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday was 61 
degrees. Relative humidity ranged from 41% to 14%.
