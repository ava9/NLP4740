<P>
It's a portrait in commuter frustration. John Randell likes to avoid the 
freeway when he drives from his Mission Viejo home to work in Irvine, so he 
spins up Alton Parkway. But it's no quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
Although the broad thoroughfare is hardly bumper to bumper, its traffic signals 
are so poorly synchronized that Randell said he typically grinds to a halt at 
20 or more red lights over just 10 miles. He knows. He's counted them. The 
result is a trip that sometimes takes an agonizing 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But now there's relief in sight. With voter approval last week of Measure M, 
the half-cent sales tax increase, there will soon be a flood of dollars to 
quell many of the most exasperating transportation dilemmas in Orange County, 
among them the synchronizing problem on Alton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye out. It'll be coming soon to a street corner near you. Up and down 
Orange County, from Stanton to San Clemente, residents should begin noticing 
changes on the highway in the months to come, courtesy of Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
A plethora of orange traffic cones will signal the start. More work crews than 
ever before will begin ladling out asphalt along roads and freeways. New trains 
gorged with commuters headed for Los Angeles or arriving from Riverside are 
eventually expected to click down the tracks. If all goes according to plan, 
the end result will be swifter trips for everyone, whether they're bound for 
work or the local grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.1-billion infusion of cash expected from Measure M should trickle down 
in varied ways that will be noticeable to anyone who ventures out on the 
county's traffic-choked roads and highways. Improvements will range from subtle 
to substantial, transportation authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Potholes will be repaired a bit more promptly. Road-widening projects that 
would have gone begging for decades will become a reality far sooner. 
Intersections that once lacked enough left-turn lanes or a simple right-hand 
turn pocket will begin to sprout such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes will be added in each direction on the Riverside and Orange 
freeways. Efforts to transform the Santa Ana Freeway from a antiquated, 
car-clogged interstate into a 12-lane superhighway will be speeded up 
dramatically, with the entire project now expected to be completed by the end 
of the decade instead of 2010 or later. 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious new monorail or trolley system could emerge in Central County, 
thanks in large part to money from Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
"It will touch everyone in Orange County," said Stanley T. Oftelie, executive 
director of the Orange County Transportation Commission (OCTC). "We're going to 
be rebuilding our transportation system. We're going to use this money to make 
up for past years of neglect and then keep up and get ahead of the curve." 
</P>
<P>
Like most things in life, all the work can hardly happen fast enough. Money 
from Measure M will trickle in over 20 years, meaning that many of the biggest 
projects will have to be spaced carefully to avoid exhausting the cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, county transportation officials are trying to get a head start on the 
effort, boldly pledging to push ahead immediately, although the half-cent tax 
will not start kicking in at county cash registers until April. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting of OCTC on Friday, the agency tentatively agreed to 
proceed with several key projects that will cost more than $82 million. 
Authorities expect to borrow against the anticipated taxes so the time schedule 
for high-priority projects can be moved up. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, meanwhile, is already gearing up for the increased workload by adding 
people to the Orange County district staff. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first construction projects financed by Measure M will be the 
$40-million Orange Freeway car-pool lanes. Work is expected to begin in 
February, if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope within 18 months also to begin work on the infamous El Toro "Y," 
the jammed confluence of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. Measure M will 
provide $55 million for that job, which will add lanes to the Y. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities envision ordering the first phalanx of commute trains 
that are expected to improve rail service between Orange County and Los 
Angeles, ultimately running one train every 20 minutes during peak hours. The 
trains and locomotives take about 18 months to build, so officials do not 
anticipate the new service to begin rolling until late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects will take a bit longer to hit the ground. A car-pool lane in 
each direction along Interstate 5 from San Clemente to the El Toro Y will be 
built with $80 million in Measure M money, with work probably beginning later 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes will also be added to the Riverside Freeway, likewise later in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
While such high-profile freeway projects will surely command the public 
spotlight, Measure M will also bolster work on scores of streets throughout the 
county. Among the most ambitious projects are the 21 "super-streets" that will 
be crafted with $120 million from the proposition. Under the program, the 
designated streets will get face lifts that include synchronized signals, turn 
pockets and other improvements to speed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Boulevard will be the first, with work expected to start in February. 
Katella Avenue, Moulton Parkway and others will follow by mid-decade, getting 
face lifts that will include better signal synchronization, more turn pockets 
and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Many people can hardly wait. Donna Stubbs, the chief public relations officer 
for the county's tollways agencies, struggles each day in the traffic up 
Moulton Parkway from her South County home to work in Costa Mesa. She wishes 
Moulton Parkway could be improved tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short stretch between El Toro Road and Lake Forest Drive I'll spend 10 
to 20 minutes in traffic every day," Stubbs said. "Going home is just as bad. 
Moulton is getting worse every day. But I think it'll make a big difference as 
a super street." 
</P>
<P>
Another $50 million of the Measure M money will help coordinate traffic signals 
around the county, and $70 million will go to improve some of the most 
traffic-clogged county intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest chunk of street money, $450 million, will go to local cities for 
road maintenance and improvements. Cities have already drawn up a list of more 
than 300 candidate street projects. The Measure M money will go not only to 
repair potholes but also to widen some streets, provide more turn lanes on 
others and generally ensure that the road network is running up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think this will result in people saving a lot of time on the road, 
particularly during the peak driving hours," said William Morris, public 
services director in Costa Mesa. "We'll be proactive and cure problems before 
they occur, instead of being reactive, only making improvements as traffic 
congestion builds up." 
</P>
<P>
Morris envisions money improving intersections such as Sunflower Avenue at 
Fairview Road and the traffic-choked confluence of MacArthur and Harbor 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials have been eyeballing improvements to 28 congested 
intersections. Without Measure M, there was money to improve just six of them 
in the next five years, said John Lower, the city's principal traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
With Measure M, the city expects to tackle 16 of the choke points by 
mid-decade, including the intersections of Tustin and La Palma avenues and 
Katella Avenue and Haster Street. 
</P>
<P>
In San Juan Capistrano, the top-priority projects are building an extension of 
Stonehill Drive over a creek bed to provide an alternative to heavily congested 
Del Obispo Street, and the widening of the La Novia Avenue bridge, La Novia 
itself, and Rancho Viejo and Junipero Serra roads. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Measure M, there's still not enough money to tackle all of the 
region's transportation difficulties, experts caution. The flood of money 
during the next 20 years will simply help make a bad situation a bit better, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been a disaster had it not been approved," said John R. 
M. Wilson, a history professor at Southern California College in Costa Mesa who 
rides his bicycle to work to avoid traffic congestion. "It had to be done if 
this place wasn't going to freeze up completely."

FROM POTHOLES TO OVERPASSES: Where Measure M money goes 
</P>
<P>
In the months to come, residents throughout Orange County will begin to see the 
fruits of Measure M, the half-cent sales tax earmarked for transportation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by voters Tuesday, the tax will raise $3 billion during the next two 
decades for transportation projects ranging from fixing potholes to building 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Spending plans include: freeway improvements, mass-transit projects, "super 
streets" and other local road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, 21 major thoroughfares would be designated super streets, 
with better signal timing, turn pockets with two left-turn lanes, more lanes 
and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local roads will be fixed as a result of Measure M, but city 
councils will decide which roads. Senior citizens and handicapped passengers 
will also pay lower bus fares throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at five regions of the county and some of the Measure M 
transportation plans. 
</P>
<P>
1. NORTH 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: Santa Ana Freeway widened to 12 lanes to the county line, with 
completion expected in 2000. Car-pool lanes to be built on the 
Artesia/Riverside and Orange freeways, with the latter under construction next 
year and work beginning on the former later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Beach Boulevard, Imperial Highway, Harbor Boulevard, Tustin 
Avenue/Rose Drive, Katella Avenue, Orangethorpe Avenue and State College 
Boulevard to be transformed into super streets with various improvements. 
Katella Avenue work expected first, with others to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: Brookhurst and Lincoln expected to be widened in Anaheim. Placentia 
Avenue targeted for repair. A new section added to Bastanchury Road in Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: Central Orange County monorail expected to run through Anaheim and 
Fullerton. More Amtrak-operated commute trains to run through this area to Los 
Angeles by 1993. New train station in Buena Park expected. Possible link with 
proposed Riverside commute train in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
2. NORTHWEST 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: Car-pool lanes, two in each direction, to be built on Riverside 
Freeway. Work not expected to begin until mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Beach Boulevard, Katella Avenue, Pacific Coast Highway, Warner 
Avenue, Valley View Street, Adams Avenue and Bolsa Avenue to be transformed 
into super streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads: Various cities to use money to repair and maintain roads, among them 
Lincoln Avenue and Golden West Street. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: New light-rail link to Los Angeles International Airport, following 
the old Red Car trolley route. Also possible link in Huntington Beach to a 
proposed Central County monorail. 
</P>
<P>
3. CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: This area is prime beneficiary of freeway money. Will help speed 
completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening throughout Central County. Will add 
three lanes in each direction. Work will now be completed in 10 years instead 
of 20. Intersection of Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove freeways to be 
rebuilt in mid-decade. Costa Mesa Freeway to get a new lane in each direction 
toward end of decade. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Harbor Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, Katella Avenue and Warner 
Avenue to become super streets. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: El Camino Real in Tustin expected to be widened. Bristol and 17th 
streets and McFadden Avenue in Santa Ana to be widened. New pavement to be laid 
on various streets in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: Several mass-transit systems will connect here. A monorail or other 
"guideway" system would link Santa Ana and Orange with adjacent cities. A new 
light-rail line running along old Red Car trolley line to LAX would end in 
Santa Ana. More Amtrak-operated commute trains will run through this area to 
Los Angeles by 1993. New train station expected to be built in Tustin; 
abandoned station in Orange to be refurbished. New commute-rail link to 
Riverside possibly later in decade. 
</P>
<P>
4. COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: Will benefit from reconstruction of the El Toro Y, which acts as a 
logjam for motorists trying to travel on the San Diego Freeway. Elevated 
car-pool lanes planned to sweep over and avoid interchange traffic at junction 
of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Harbor Boulevard, Jamboree Road, Laguna Canyon Road, Newport 
Boulevard, MacArthur Boulevard, Coast Highway, Adams Avenue and Irvine 
Boulevard to become super streets during next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: Newport Boulevard targeted for widening, as are Irvine Center Drive, 
Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive in Irvine and Victoria and 19th streets in Costa 
Mesa. Money also probably to be spent for signal synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: Costa Mesa and Irvine may be linked with Central County monorail line. 
Irvine also a destination point for Riverside commute-rail line. More 
Amtrak-operated commute trains to run through this area to Los Angeles by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
5. SADDLEBACK/SOUTH BEACH 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: El Toro Y interchange to be widened and new ramps built. Construction 
starting within 18 months. One new car-pool lane in each direction on 
Interstate 5 from the Y to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Irvine Center Drive/Moulton Parkway/Street of the Golden Lantern 
to become a super street, along with Laguna Canyon Road, El Toro Road, Crown 
Valley Parkway and Coast Highway. Moulton probably completed by mid-decade, 
others by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: Traffic signals on Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road expected to be 
better synchronized. San Clemente to target widening of El Camino Real. San 
Juan Capistrano expected to widen Rancho Viejo Road. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: More Amtrak-operated commute trains to Los Angeles, with new stations 
likely in Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commuter Rail Lines 
</P>
<P>
A. This abandoned railway right of way to be purchased as early as February for 
new public commuter-rail sevice between Orange County and Los Angeles' Blue 
Line. 
</P>
<P>
B. New locomotives and rail cars for more daily commuter trains to Los Angeles 
may be purchased in about 18 months. Aquisitions hinge on pending public 
purchase of Santa Fe rail line.
