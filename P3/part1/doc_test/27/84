</P>

City and state traffic officials acted decidedly non-collegial Tuesday as they 
traded barbs over the cause of a giant traffic jam that tied up the Ventura 
Freeway as well as surface streets in Sherman Oaks and Encino for several hours 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed that the tie-up was caused by motorists detoured off the 
Ventura Freeway by lane and ramp closures that are part of a widening project. 
But city officials said they were not adequately notified of the closures, 
which were scheduled for the same time as repair work at Sepulveda and Ventura 
boulevards that added to motorists' woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't adequately notified" by Caltrans of the freeway closures, said Guy 
Quinn, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles city Department of 
Transportation. "They told us about the closures but not the extent of it." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans also failed to notify the city that motorists would be directed to use 
Ventura Boulevard as an alternative route, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city was adequately notified," said Pat Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman. She 
said a Caltrans engineer gave the city a detailed explanation of the agency's 
road closure and detour plans. "This was a routine contact with DOT. It was 
done just like it's been done before, for weeks," Reid said. "We have no 
further comment." 
</P>
<P>
The traffic jam clogged streets for miles at midday. Traffic snarled major 
east-west streets between Reseda and Van Nuys boulevards and north-south 
streets between Victory and Ventura boulevards, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Diverting traffic off the Ventura Freeway were lane and ramp closures that are 
part of a $76-million project to widen the roadway between Agoura Hills and 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The worst congestion occurred at Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, where a 
private contractor was digging a trench for the city's Automated Traffic 
Surveillance and Control system. The contractor, Steiny &amp; Co., was allowed 
to close one lane of the boulevard in each direction, Quinn said. Ventura 
Boulevard has six through-traffic lanes and two left-turn lanes at that 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the contractor closed only the number of lanes allowed. "There's no 
way that little work caused that tie-up," Quinn said. "It wasn't us." 
</P>
<P>
City traffic crews, which use the computerized control system in City Hall to 
detect traffic jams and alter signal operations in response, watched the jam-up 
develop Saturday, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"They dealt with it as best they could," he said. But no amount of signal 
manipulation could ease the movement of two lanes of freeway traffic being 
diverted onto city streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Saturday's problem, Quinn vowed that a similar mix-up "won't happen 
again. We're going to be a lot more cautious in the future."
