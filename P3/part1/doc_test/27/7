FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A new millennium - and not a traffic
cone to be seen

<TEXT>
Sir, With regard to celebrating the millennium ('Wanted - wonder of the
age', October 1), I think the government should pledge to remove every
single traffic cone from every road in the kingdom by 4.30pm on December 31
1999.
In order to placate all those who believe that celebrations should only take
place in December 2000, I suggest that, during the intervening year, all the
cones gathered should be given to a number of sculptors, who can each create
a fitting memorial to the 'last' century. These sculptures should be placed
at various points around the country, to be seen from our motorways, rather
as Stonehenge is viewed from the A303.
This pledge, incidentally, should be put on the statute books so that any
other incoming government must abide by it too. Thus, future generations
will gain from finished roads, no more road works, and the disbanding (and
financial saving) of the cones hotline.
