Want to buy a duck? It's pretty much your garden variety duck. You know -- 
looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck. Funny thing, though. 
The folks trying to sell it don't call it a duck. 
</P>
<P>
This particular duck is labeled the "Orange County Traffic Improvement and 
Growth Management Ordinance," or Measure M. Doesn't sound too bad. But wait! 
What's that quacking? 
</P>
<P>
Measure M is a tax measure! A half-cent sales tax increase to be exact, costing 
every man, woman and child in Orange County an average $63 a year. That's $126 
a year for a married couple, and $252 for a family of four. Over 20 years, 
that's more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M is also a bond measure. It allows spending up to $900 million a year, 
but since the tax raises just a fraction of that, bonds may be sold to raise 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
So, what does it buy you? Traffic improvements? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are super-streets, or mini-highways, like Harbor Boulevard and 
Laguna Canyon Freeway, er . . . Road. It accelerates Santa Ana Freeway 
improvements. And it builds car-pool lanes on the Santa Ana, Riverside and 
Orange Freeways. That's fine -- if you can car-pool. But projects on state or 
federal highways require state and/or federal approval. What if Caltrans or the 
feds have other plans? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, shouldn't Caltrans or the Federal government pay for state and federal 
roads? Actually, after shortchanging Orange County for years, Caltrans finally 
is funding some of the same improvements provided under Measure M. Why tax 
ourselves again? 
</P>
<P>
Will traffic improve? It could, if growth were managed properly. But Orange 
County Transportation Commission (OCTC) documents show that, when all is said 
and done, many locations will still be at level of service F, or system 
failure. The tax provides money to fix these areas, but new development will 
leave things just as bad as they are today, or worse. For example, OCTC 
projects that development in the Anaheim Stadium area will triple, leaving the 
Santa Ana-Orange-Garden Grove interchange at level of service F. The 
interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego Freeways will also be at level F, 
after massive development at the El Toro "Y." In both areas, you'll pay 
millions to expand capacity. A lot of good it'll do you. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Measure M require growth management? Well, local growth management 
plans are required, but that's nothing new. For years, state law has required 
that cities and counties adopt general plans specifying the type and amount of 
growth that may occur and coordinate them with plans for streets and highways. 
If Orange County governments don't obey existing law, will they obey a new law 
any better? 
</P>
<P>
Under Measure M, the citizens' committee supposedly overseeing things is 
expressly forbidden from even considering whether growth plans are adequate. 
The committee can merely check off whether or not a piece of paper called a 
plan exists. Further, Measure M permits planning for levels of service commonly 
defined as the lower acceptable limit for most drivers. It is claimed Measure M 
won't benefit developers. Sure, that's why developers have already kicked in 
nearly a million dollars in "duck feed" to promote it -- and will undoubtedly 
double or triple that by November. Why? 
</P>
<P>
The tax provides commuter rail service straight from Riverside to Irvine 
Spectrum, where OCTC projects growth at almost 500%. Guess who benefits? By the 
way, this project is so costly, one OCTC member speculated that it might be 
cheaper to buy houses in Irvine for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Tax dollars go for car-pool lanes in San Clemente. What future development and 
traffic are these new lanes for? Measure M specifically provides tax money to 
deal with "cumulative effects of development." Who profits from that 
development? After Measure M money is spent on Caltrans projects, nothing 
prevents the reallocation of Caltrans funds to projects that help developers. 
These guys are no dummies. When they invest big bucks, they expect big returns. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of later, Measure M sets us up for future taxes. Much of the transit 
money goes for operating subsidies and rolling stock with a useful life of 12 
to 30 years. What about future operating subsidies? How will we replace old 
equipment? The transit right of way to be acquired can't complete the system, 
and there's no money for construction or operations. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, why are they trying to muzzle the duck? If Measure M is so great, why 
obscure its true nature as a tax, both in its title and in ballot arguments? 
Why are the duck pushers so reluctant to debate local citizens opposed to 
Measure M? Why will they attend "information meetings" where they don't have to 
share the podium, but avoid open forums? Perhaps they fear the feathers will 
fly if they stop ducking the issues! 
</P>
<P>
Vote No on Measure M!
