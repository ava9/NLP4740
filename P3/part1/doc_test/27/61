A toppled electrical pole caused officials to close California 118 -- one of 
Ventura County's main east-west roads -- for 12 hours Sunday, forcing motorists 
to detour nearly nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
A van ran off the road and knocked down the pole at 5:49 a.m., blocking the 
road about a mile west of Moorpark, said Officer David Wighton of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists were detoured onto Grimes Canyon Road, Broadway, Stockton Road and 
Balcom Canyon Road until 5:49 p.m., when California 118 reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had traffic going by here all day long," said Fauvette Rollyson, who 
lives on Stockton. "Fortunately, this was not a weekday or the trucks would be 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Wighton agreed. "On a weekday you get a heavy commuter traffic, but today was 
pretty light," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Stockton Road resident, Richard Allen, said he counted almost 100 cars 
a minute going in both directions during peak traffic on the detour. "It was 
steady, almost bumper-to-bumper," Allen said, adding that Stockton Road 
normally is seldom used. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, on a weekend, if someone goes by I go out to see who it is," Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Sheldon, a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co., said the toppled 
wires were "live" and had to be handled carefully. Then a new pole had to be 
installed and wires restrung before the road could be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
The accident cut power to residents in the immediate area, Sheldon said. 
Rollyson said her home lost power for about 75 minutes, but Allen had no power 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Salvador Padilla, 28, of Pomona, driving a Chevrolet 
van west on 118, veered across the opposing lane, left the roadway and hit the 
pole, Wighton said. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla left the scene but was found in Moorpark about 5 1/2 hours later by 
deputies of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, Lt. Kelly McIlvain said. 
He has not been cited, Wighton said.
