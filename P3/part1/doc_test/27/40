<P>
LIGHTS IN DAYTIME CUT ACCIDENT RATE

The accident rate on Santiago Canyon Road dropped 58% after a program 
encouraging drivers to use headlights during the daylight hours was introduced, 
a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents rates are computed on the number of accidents per million vehicle 
miles. The total number of accidents on the 13-mile stretch of two-lane highway 
between Orange and Trabuco Canyon decreased by seven in 1987 and 1988 compared 
to the previous two-year period, despite a more than 100% increase in the daily 
traffic volume, according to the study. The number of accidents dropped from 81 
to 74. No statistics were provided on numbers of deaths and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The study is the first comparing accident trends since daytime headlight 
programs were implemented throughout Orange County over the past five years. 
Other programs are in effect on the Ortega Highway and Laguna Canyon Road. 
While use of daytime headlights is voluntary, surveys by police and county 
engineers show a compliance rate of between 50% and 70%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Outstanding Program' 
</P>
<P>
A county engineer who conducted the study cautioned that due to drastic changes 
in traffic volume and patterns, the study is not scientific. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials said the findings reinforce their belief that the 
headlight program is succeeding in reducing accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outstanding program for our area," said Officer Mike Lundquist, 
spokesman for the Santa Ana division of the California Highway Patrol. 
Lundquist said the 58% reduction is "probably one of the highest in the state." 
</P>
<P>
While more recent accident figures are not available, Lundquist said the trend 
appears to continue downward. CHP Motorcycle Officer Wally Seibert, for 
example, said he has noticed a decrease in accidents in his early-morning 
patrols of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (daytime headlights) work," Seibert said. "It's a visual thing. 
It's like with motorcycles. Someone sees that your headlights are on and it's 
easier to see the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans posted signs asking for daytime headlights along Santiago Canyon Road 
in September, 1986, at the request of the California Highway Patrol, after 10 
fatalities and 109 injuries resulted from traffic accidents there between Jan. 
1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1985. Although the roadway's overall accident rate at the 
time was well below state averages, the severity of accidents was such that 
Capt. C.A. Lynd of the CHP's Santa Ana division asked for the signs. 
</P>
<P>
A CalTrans study at the time of 10 other headlight programs outside of Orange 
County found that the total accident rate was reduced 18% after the posting of 
headlight signs. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Canyon Road study, completed Aug. 1, found even more dramatic 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
James Swatzel, a county senior civil engineer who conducted the study, also 
documented significant reductions in types of accidents. Accidents in which 
vehicles were sideswiped decreased from 16 in the previous two-year period to 
nine in the next two-year period, the report found. The number of accidents 
involving overturned vehicles dropped from 16 to six over the same time 
periods. And accidents related to unsafe speed decreased from 25 to 19, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Although some accident categories showed small increases, Swatzel noted that 
there had been such a large increase in traffic on the roadway that a net 
reduction in the accident rate still occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Volume Doubled 
</P>
<P>
The traffic volume doubled from 6,000 vehicles per day to 12,000 vehicles per 
day in one six-mile stretch of road between Silverado Canyon and Live Oak 
Canyon, the report found. Traffic volume on the remaining seven-mile stretch 
between Silverado Canyon and Chapman Road increased from 11,000 vehicles daily 
to 16,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no similar studies have been conducted on Ortega Highway or Laguna 
Canyon Road, law enforcement officers there say they are also seeing accident 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The signs went up in June, 1985, along a 14-mile stretch of Ortega Highway, 
where CHP statistics showed there were 87 major accidents resulting in 95 
injuries and four deaths during 1984. Headlight signs also went up in 1984 on a 
five-mile stretch of Laguna Canyon Road between the San Diego Freeway and El 
Toro Road because of a concentration of serious accidents there. 
</P>
<P>
Headlight signs "make people more aware that this is a problem area and it 
makes oncoming vehicles more visible," said Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Linda 
Parker. "It makes them more alert." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Estimated at 25% 
</P>
<P>
Use of headlight signs and a CHP radar enforcement program have combined to 
reduce accidents along the Ortega Highway by as much as 25%, said Lt. Michael 
Bair of the CHP office in San Juan Capistrano. Bair said the figure was an 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the headlight program is helping not so much for visibility but to 
remind drivers . . . that there is something a little unique about driving this 
highway," Bair said. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as the headlight programs seem to be, Swatzel warned in his 
report that the lights should not be considered a general solution. It is the 
fact that the lights are unusual that gets the attention of drivers, Swatzel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any proliferation of this method will render it completely ineffective, he 
said." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daylight Headlights Reduce Accidents 
</P>
<P>
Accidents along Santiago Canyon Road between Chapman Avenue and Live Oak Canyon 
Raod decreased dramatically when drivers were asked during a test period to use 
their headlights during daylight hours. Despite a 100% increase in traffic in a 
portion of the road between that period and a period which headlights were not 
required, the daylight headlight test indicated an overall accident rate 
reduction of about 58%
