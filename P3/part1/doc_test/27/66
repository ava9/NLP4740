Any natural disaster over a widespread area or catastrophic failure which causes serious (more than heavy maintenance)
damage to IRR, may be cause for eligibility for reimbursement under the Emergency Relief Program of 23 U.S.C. 125 and
23 CFR part 668. To qualify, the occurrence should be declared a disaster by the President of the United States and shall
have a positive finding determination made by the Federal Highway Administration. If the road repairs in an area may
be considered for authorization under the Emergency Relief Program, records and photographs of the damage sites
and of initial repairs and closures to assure public safety shall be kept by the BIA for possible reimbursement under
this program. Those initial repairs may, as an emergency measure, be charged to any available program under the control
of the line official. Reimbursement will be made from Emergency Relief Funds after approval, or from road maintenance
funds if approval is denied. Careful analysis of program fund usage shall be made considering the temporary charges
made to a program whose authority may terminate with the fiscal year. (Specific procedures to be followed in the Emergency
Relief Program are contained in 23 CFR part 668.)

(a) The existence of a flood plain encroachment by a proposed structure shall be determined by technical study. An
analysis of the hydrology and the hydraulics of the site shall be performed in accordance with established Executive
Order 11988 as implemented in 23 CFR 650.111.

(b) All existing bridges on the BIA road system shall be inspected periodically for structural condition and functional
adequacy, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 144 and 151. These field inspections shall be conducted in accordance with
the National Bridge Inspection Standards. The following measures shall be taken in accordance with recommendations
of the inspecting engineer in the field inspection report, as amended by a technical review by the BIA Division of Transportation
and the Area Road Engineer, in order to protect the safety of the travelling public:

(c) Current data obtained from the bridge inspections shall be maintained in a computer inventory file. The inventory
data shall be used to produce a biennial bridge inventory report and an annual bridge sufficiency rating report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The National Bridge Inspection Standards require each State to maintain an inventory of all bridge structures
subject to the Standards, which includes all bridges on public roads. Therefore, the required inventory and inspection
data for all IRR bridges must be submitted to the State for inclusion in the State's bridge inventory file. The data
shall include all items contained in the current ``Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal
of the Nation's Bridges.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Bridges that are identified on the bridge sufficiency rating report as being deficient shall be prioritized and
programmed for closure, maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement. Correction of the deficiency shall be accomplished
expeditiously after the deficiency is first identified.
