Under pressure from residents upset about truck traffic, the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors has revoked the operating permit of a Somis dirt- and 
gravel-hauling company. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Somis Sand and Rock Inc. either must close its quarry 
business in Balcom Canyon or, to keep its permit, comply with numerous county 
requirements, including curtailing about half of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Atkinson, an attorney for the gravel company, and company owner Dave 
Smith declined to comment after Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor James Dougherty called the operation a public nuisance, because 
of the danger posed by its trucks. In addition, Dougherty said, the company did 
not attempt to negotiate or take responsibility for any problems raised by 
citizens or county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to give a clear message: Don't come to this county and say, 'I 
want to do business here, but I'm not responsible,' " Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Blacher, a spokesman for Citizens for a Safe Balcom Canyon Road, the 
neighborhood group seeking the permit revocation, said he was pleased by the 
board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw that the issues of public safety are overriding and that the operator 
was uncooperative. This was rampant neglect of public safety," said Blacher, a 
former head of the Ventura County Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The residents were appealing an October action by the county Planning 
Commission, which imposed a series of restrictions on the operation. Blacher, a 
16-year resident in Balcom Canyon, said his group thought the Planning 
Commission had not gone far enough in limiting truck traffic on narrow, winding 
Balcom Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Truck drivers were forced to use the two-lane road to haul loads from the 
quarry about three miles to California 118 after the only alternate route, 
Bradley Road, was closed to trucks in February. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the 60-foot trucks jeopardized cars, school buses, postal 
vehicles and agricultural vehicles because they often crossed into oncoming 
traffic lanes to manage corners. The group said excessive speeds and aggressive 
driving, noise, air pollution and high dust levels contributed to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Blacher cited California Highway Patrol statistics to indicate that there was a 
high accident rate involving trucks in the area, including a fatal accident 
involving a Somis Sand and Rock truck in 1987 and a head-on collision involving 
two of the company's trucks last April. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Planning Commission restricted the gravel company's operating 
hours and trimmed truck traffic to 300 daily round-trips. The commission forced 
the company to put tarps over trucks if dirt came within one foot of their tops 
and to pay for widening the intersection of California 118 and Balcom Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Blacher said that in a nine-hour workday, the approved 300 round-trips amounted 
to a truck traveling on Balcom Canyon Road every 1.8 minutes. He added that the 
trucks caused traffic jams during peak hours and threatened children getting on 
and off school buses.
