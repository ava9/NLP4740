It is 4:01 p.m. at Shadow Traffic Network, and Fred Bennett's headset is 
buzzing with bad news. 
</P>
<P>
A school bus accident has snarled traffic along Flatbush Avenue. A disabled 
tractor-trailer is tying up the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. Another truck accident 
is blocking an entrance to the George Washington Bridge. Five minutes later, 
the Manhattan Bridge is packed after being closed while President Bush's 
motorcade carried him to a GOP fund-raiser at the Waldorf Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, operations manager for a firm that provides live reports to 62 area 
radio and television stations, alternately works the phones and takes two-way 
radio reports from six aircraft and 40 cars, furiously typing each tie-up onto 
a color-coded computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:37, helicopter pilot Bob Glantzberg reports that construction is causing 
bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Van Wyck Expressway. At 4:57, things look bad 
on the New Jersey Turnpike. At 4:59, Glantzberg's voice crackles over the 
headset with word of yet another accident, this one causing a standstill on the 
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Bennett's computer screen is full. 
</P>
<P>
Shadow Traffic's far-flung network provides minute-by-minute confirmation of 
what anyone who drives in and around New York City already knows: The place is 
a commuter's nightmare. With 900,000 smoke-spewing vehicles crawling into 
Manhattan each weekday morning -- 25% more than a decade ago -- traffic 
routinely backs up at the 20 bridges and tunnels connecting the island with the 
rest of the sprawling tri-state area. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, New Yorkers waste 50 million hours a year stuck in traffic. 
Eleven million cars compete for space across the 31-county region, a number 
that is expected to jump to 16 million within 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Things have gone from awful to absurd recently as a spate of construction 
projects has further constricted the aging concrete arteries that bind the 
region. Two lanes on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, Manhattan's main north-south 
highway, were closed in July for a reconstruction project scheduled to last 
three years. Two lanes were shut down in June on the Queensboro Bridge, where 
endless construction has tied up traffic since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Repaving on the Long Island Expressway approach to Manhattan will last until 
1995; work will continue on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway through 1994. From 
cable repairs on the Brooklyn Bridge to nighttime work on the George Washington 
Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the list seems endless. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no off-peak period any more," said former city traffic engineer 
Samuel Schwartz, who writes the "Gridlock Sam" column for the New York Daily 
News. "We've moved into a dimension of round-the-clock rush hours. We're 
condensing 50 years of construction work into 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the jackhammer pace of construction is that the city's highways 
and bridges are falling apart. Local officials plan to spend $3 billion during 
the 1990s, most of it federal and state money, just to keep open the same basic 
system that carried about half as many cars into Manhattan during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"This construction is necessary because we have the oldest infrastructure in 
the country, and it's been subjected to years of neglect," said Joe DePlasco, 
spokesman for the city's Transportation Department. "Many of these facilities 
are in very poor shape. Most of the highways are approaching 50 years old; many 
of the bridges are approaching 100 years old. Some of them haven't been painted 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
The price of bottlenecks -- from Montclair in New Jersey to Montauk on Long 
Island -- is more than just frayed nerves and increased air pollution. "It's 
definitely a drag on the economy: time wasted in traffic, wear and tear on 
roadways, the very high cost for truckers trying to get goods in and out of the 
area," said Mary Rivers of the Regional Plan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The danger level is also increasing. Last year, a 500-pound slab of concrete 
fell from the FDR Drive, killing a Brooklyn dental technician in his car, and 
part of the Manhattan Bridge was closed after two support beams rusted through. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Williamsburg Bridge was closed for a couple of months for safety 
reasons a year after two 30-pound steel bars fell from the bridge into the East 
River. In 1982, part of the West Side Highway collapsed. A year earlier, a 
Japanese photographer died after being struck in the head by a 600-foot cable 
that snapped on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to New York's seaside geography, traffic is constantly snarled at toll 
booths, where drivers pay up to $5 for the privilege of traversing rivers and 
bays. The gridlock even extends to the skies: Flight delays soared 111% at La 
Guardia Airport and 52% at Kennedy Airport last year. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, only 16% of the 3.4 million daily commuters converging on midtown 
Manhattan arrive by car or taxi, compared to 60% by subway and 23% on buses and 
commuter trains. Yet despite years of official hostility to the automobile 
("Don't Even THINK of Parking Here"), a tripling in the number of parking 
tickets and $32-a-day midtown garage fees, still more commuters are hitting the 
highways. Others are fleeing the subway system -- where ridership is down 6% 
because of rising crime and higher fares -- for such alternatives as express 
buses and private car services.
