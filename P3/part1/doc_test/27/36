MOBIL PLANS BIG FESTIVITY AT BELEAGUERED REFINERY 
</P>

<P>
To the unease of Torrance officials, Mobil Oil plans to invite thousands of the 
refinery's neighbors to party at its beleaguered plant on Oct. 7. There will be 
jugglers, clowns, hot dogs, hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel and booths 
about the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
It will all be free and refinery officials, who have yet to send out the 
invitations for the $200,000 bash, expect as many as 12,000 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials say it has nothing to do with a measure on the ballot in March, 
which would force the refinery to stop using hydrofluoric acid, a highly toxic 
chemical, or a lawsuit by the city that seeks to declare the refinery a public 
nuisance subject to city regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Mobil officials say, the festivities are the latest in a concerted 
image-building effort that has included a tabloid publication about the 
refinery, bus tours of the plant and advertisements in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials learned of the party proposal in a July 25 letter from Mobil 
seeking city assistance for crowd and traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Ken Nelson, whose staff is researching what permits Mobil would need 
for the party, said the idea of having thousands of people attend a party on 
refinery grounds "makes me very uncomfortable" because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at it very closely," he said. The refinery, he added, is "not 
exactly your local winery." 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawsuit cites a host of troubles at the plant, including state and 
federal investigations into safety and health problems, as well as a series of 
explosions, fires, fatal accidents and gas releases. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert described Mobil's party plans as "very strange. They expect 
10,000 to 12,000 at a facility under which the very best of conditions is a 
dangerous facility and where extreme precautions need to be taken. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know they are putting out a great effort on their public relations," she 
said, "but I'm not sure this is what I would have thought up. It sounds like 
something you would have for the opening of a mall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mobil Says It's Safe 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti rejected suggestions that the party is 
ill-advised for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 830 employees working here," he said. "If we thought it was dangerous, 
we wouldn't be working here. We don't think we are endangering anybody's life." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Mobil does not envision the party as a demonstration -- 
to be used later in the city's lawsuit -- that thousands of people of all ages 
consider the refinery a safe place and not a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that has even been considered," Carbonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the reason for the party is that Mobil is merely following the 
advice of City Council members "that we should communicate better to the 
community, and this is one of the ways we are doing it. . . . The timing was 
picked to get the most people. . . . It happens to be our 60th anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowd Control 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spate of bad publicity about the refinery, Mobil expects so many 
people that it is worried about handling traffic and crowds. That prompted the 
letter from Mobil Security Director Daniel J. Malinowski to the city on July 
25. 
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that attendance will be approximately 10,000 to 12,000 persons 
for that day," wrote Malinowski, noting that the Police Department had already 
agreed to help with traffic. "In order to allow everyone to have a good time 
and provide for their safety, we request permission to borrow approximately 100 
barricades and/or traffic cones for crowd control and traffic flow purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Horkay, Torrance transportation director, said the city has begun 
discussions with Mobil about the use of the cones.
