Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I've been riding my bike more and more recently. It bothers me when cars park 
in the marked bike lane. When is it, if ever, all right to park or drive in a 
marked bike lane? It seems dangerous for me to have to veer outside the lane.

Life in the bike lane isn't always so pleasant. If there isn't some Beemer 
veering willy-nilly across the painted white line, there's a Coupe de Ville 
crammed against the curb, its rear bumper waiting to gobble up any errant 
cyclist who happens by. 
</P>
<P>
While the rules of the bike lane can vary from city to city, most 
municipalities allow cars to pull into the paths about 200 feet before a corner 
to make a right turn. Moreover, cars generally can park in the paths as long as 
there are no signs posted prohibiting it. In some spots within the county, this 
can virtually eliminate the lanes, forcing cyclists out into the street along 
with the growling packs of cars. 
</P>
<P>
A few tips from the experts: If you have to veer around a parked car, avoid 
darting into the traffic lane. Instead, try to anticipate the move and begin 
gradually moving out so any cars can see you well in advance and avoid you 
accordingly. Also, be careful to swing wide enough around the parked car so 
you'll avoid the door if a motorist swings it open. 
</P>
<P>
At times, of course, motorists won't take kindly to a cyclist using the traffic 
lane to avoid a parked car. They'll honk. They'll scream. They'll cuss. But the 
fact of the matter is, cyclists have as much right to the traffic lane if 
they're steering around an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, conflicts between cyclists and motorists can sometimes escalate 
into something just short of war. Some stories have become legend. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, a cyclist in South County was tooling along a remote road when 
a car began veering into the lane repeatedly. The cyclist yelled at the driver, 
who in turn rolled down his passenger-side window and shouted obscenities at 
the cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist returned fire by pulling out his water bottle and squirting the 
motorist and his female passenger. Outraged, the driver cut off the cyclist, 
jumped from the car and began pounding on the befuddled cyclist. The melee was 
broken up only when the cyclist's riding partners caught up. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was a relatively rare incident that escalated well beyond 
reason. But the point is clear: When cycling, keep your wits about you. A 
person on a bicycle is a lot more vulnerable than someone strapped into a ton 
of sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Does Caltrans have any plans to build a grade separation that would allow 
drivers on the northbound San Diego Freeway to exit at Bristol Street in Costa 
Mesa without having to cross two lanes of high-speed traffic coming off the 
connector road leading from the Costa Mesa Freeway to the northbound San Diego 
Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Building such a grade separation will not merely remove a nuisance. When 
traffic backs up from the Bristol off-ramp (as it frequently does), a serious 
conflict is created between cars moving at full speed on the connector road and 
cars slowing (or completely stopping) for the Bristol off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
There also appears to be plenty of right of way for Caltrans to build the 
necessary bridge for the freeway connector road to pass over traffic moving 
into the Bristol exit's lanes.

That stretch of roadway is indeed a problem for motorists eager to pull 
smoothly off the freeway at Bristol Street and hit the Nordie racks at South 
Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that transportation officials are eyeing the strip for 
improvement. The bad news is that any solutions are probably still far off. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa authorities are planning to use developer fees to build a new, 
elevated connector road so Bristol Street-bound motorists won't have to mix it 
up with folks trying to head north from the Costa Mesa Freeway onto the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't look for it any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just now getting the ball rolling," said Bill Morris, Costa Mesa public 
services director. "We are years away."
