</P>
<P>

Love them or hate them, the much-debated car-pool lanes that run on the Costa 
Mesa Freeway down the middle of Orange County are the busiest in the state. But 
just wait. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction may not last long. Car-pool lanes are expected to open in two 
weeks along much of the southbound San Diego Freeway, north of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway. And by next spring, when the diamond lanes are completed along the 
entire length of the San Diego Freeway in Orange County, it may well assume the 
top spot soon after the ribbon is cut, state Department of Transportation 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, the diamond lanes stretching along the Costa Mesa 
Freeway (California 55) have the record, carrying about 22,000 people a day in 
each direction. The highway quietly took the top spot in mid-1987 from the El 
Monte transitway on the San Bernardino Freeway, but the record drew little 
notice outside Caltrans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 22,000 people use the car-pool lanes in each direction every 24 
hours on the Costa Mesa Freeway, followed by nearly 14,000 on the El Monte 
transitway and about 7,000 on the commuter lane that runs eastbound along 
California 91. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it as a successful operation," said Joe El Harake, Orange County 
commuter-lanes coordinator for Caltrans. "When we opened the car-pool lanes on 
the 55, we never thought we'd have so much utilization of them. This is a 
positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a bit of bad news. With the popularity of the car-pool lanes 
soaring, the average time saved by commuters who use the lanes has dropped. 
When the lanes were introduced in November, 1985, a motorist could save 17 
minutes compared to someone sitting in traffic, El Harake said. Today, the 
car-pool lane shaves off 10 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very nice incentive," El Harake said. "To the average motorist, 
that is a tremendous savings, and there is a definite psychological advantage 
to be in a lane that keeps moving." 
</P>
<P>
Initially opened as a one-year experiment to test the car-pool concept in 
Orange County, the restricted lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway have survived a 
rash of criticism from groups opposed to the notion of setting aside a strip of 
asphalt for cars with two or more occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have gone to great lengths to get their point across, doing 
everything from handing out leaflets to motorists at freeway on-ramps to 
picketing the Caltrans offices. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the grass-roots group Drivers for Highway Safety has targeted 
the freeway's diamond lanes for ridicule, saying they pose a danger by sending 
commuters zooming within inches of cars poking along in unrestricted lanes 
congested by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Catron, president of the group, questioned whether the Costa Mesa Freeway's 
car-pool lanes truly are the most heavily used, suggesting that Caltrans 
officials have skewed the statistics to affect the public's opinion of the 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy that at all," Catron said. "I definitely would question their 
numbers. As we have in the past, I would question their counting methods. 
There's been lots of inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
El Harake of Caltrans, however, said the proof is right there on the freeway. 
The Costa Mesa freeway has been the busiest since mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
While the El Monte transit-way, which is heavily traveled by commuter-laden 
buses, features greater flows during peak commuting hours, the Costa Mesa 
Freeway's commuter lanes have more extended use at other times of the day and 
night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though they flow freely most hours of the day, the Costa Mesa Freeway's 
car-pool lanes actually carry twice as many people during rush hour as the 
freeway's other lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The car-pool lane also accommodates more cars than the freeway's other lanes 
during peak hours. One recent afternoon, for example, the car-pool lane was 
used by more than 1,500 cars between 5 and 6 p.m. The three other lanes ranged 
between about 1,400 and 1,100 cars during the hour, El Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are eager to open additional car-pool lanes in the county, 
in particular along the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Freeway, the second most heavily traveled highway in the world, 
just behind the busy Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, is used by as many as 
300,000 cars a day along some stretches in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-mile section of the northbound car-pool lane was finished between 
Brookhurst Street and the San Gabriel River Freeway in late spring. In early 
September, the southbound car-pool lane will be opened from the San Gabriel 
River Freeway to Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of car-pool lanes along the freeway between Fairview and 
Interstate 5 is expected to be completed by spring. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes are also featured in construction plans along Interstate 5.
