'SHORTCUT SHARKS' TAKE BITE OUT OF TRAFFIC JAMS

If you're content to be a member of The Pack -- that huge mass of drivers 
willing to be led by their license plates down the jammed highways of life -- 
then driving for the next four months on the Ventura Freeway will call for 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 21, the state Department of Transportation will jam the freeway's 
legendary 267,000 cars a day onto the south side of the center divider during 
the widening and reconstruction of 3,200 feet of pavement between Warner Center 
and Calabasas; when the westbound lanes are completed, all six lanes of traffic 
will be diverted to the north side. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, the construction project will shut down five off- and 
on-ramps for the duration. And if an accident occurs, there's no way to clear 
it to the side of the road because all available space will be taken up with 
live-action, use-it-or-lose-it traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
So be prepared to listen to your books on tape, do your taxes with one eye on 
the road or whatever else it is that keeps your mind off the time you are 
wasting. If, however, you drive to a different downshift and your transmission 
transcends such slug-like non-activities as patiently enduring traffic, there 
are alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Roberts and Richard Schwadel, Southern California natives and 
self-described "shortcut sharks," highway hackers of the first order whose 
motto is To move is to live, to stop is to suffocate and die, are ready to 
point you the way. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of a book called "L.A. Shortcuts" that they will publish this summer, 
Roberts and Schwadel say breaking free from highway hell is as easy as heading 
for an off-ramp. There are more than 21,000 miles of surface streets in Los 
Angeles and, especially in the San Fernando Valley, many of them are more wide 
open than the highways. 
</P>
<P>
"The shortest distance between two points is never a straight line," said 
Schwadel, 32, who uses his penchant for pavement pathfinding to get to 
free-lance film editing jobs from his home in Marina del Rey. "That's what 
separates shortcut sharks from the rest of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 30, a film editor and director who lives in Hollywood, said some of 
the 90 shortcuts compiled by the partners, including 13 for the valley, don't 
save a lot of time. But they will keep you moving while others are riding the 
brake. "The point is to get away from where everybody else is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Schwadel anticipate that disclosing their street secrets will anger 
some of their friends. "People who are shortcutters will think of us as 
traitors," Schwadel said. 
</P>
<P>
But, they say, everybody has some tricks for getting around and all they are 
doing is compiling them. "It's like modern folklore," Roberts said. "Everybody 
knows it, but nobody's ever written it down." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have acknowledged the potential for tie-ups in this phase of 
the three-year project to widen and improve the Ventura Freeway between 
Calabasas and Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
They have come up with what they think is the most ambitious traffic diversion 
and public education effort in highway construction history. It involves 
observation cameras to monitor traffic, an automated traffic signal system that 
can be altered to deal with the traffic flow on Ventura Boulevard, construction 
of a new frontage road, new signals, more traffic cops, a fleet of tow trucks 
to clear disabled vehicles and financial incentives for drivers to take up 
ride-sharing and van-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Kilmurray, the Caltrans engineer who designed the plan for managing the 
traffic snarl, said no acceptable alternate routes skirt the area that will be 
torn up starting this month. So a new local access route was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the eastbound traffic is headed for the Warner Center area, Kilmurray 
said, and if a few hundred motorists each hour use the alternate exit at 
Parkway Calabas as and the new frontage road on the north side of the freeway, 
traffic should keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
Westbound traffic headed for the Calabasas area will be encouraged to exit at 
Shoup or Woodlake avenues, cross the freeway at Valley Circle Boulevard and 
recross to the north on Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test is going to be this next segment of work," said Kilmurray, who 
is now chief of design for the Century Freeway and Harbor transitway projects. 
A similar traffic diversion plan will be used there. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts and Schwadel take the idea that there are no alternative routes as 
a challenge to find some, and they offer two basic east and west routes that 
actually could be traveled in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Sailing on Burbank 
</P>
<P>
Their plan for westbound drivers is to duck off the Ventura Freeway at the 
first sign of brake lights, head north to Burbank Boulevard in the east valley, 
or Oxnard or Topham streets if drivers are west of Reseda Boulevard. Burbank 
often offers clear sailing while The Pack is barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
At Topanga Canyon Boulevard, head south to Avenue San Luis and turn west. 
Although Avenue San Luis will be part of the local access route between Valley 
Circle and Parkway Calabasas, you, shortcutter, go left at Rigoletto Street, 
right at Calabash Street, left on Deseret Drive, a quick right at Mulholland 
Drive, left at Valmar Road, right at Park Ora, right at Park Sienna, right at 
Park Capri, left at Park Granada and then down Parkway Calabasas into the belly 
of what is likely to be a beastly traffic tie-up. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound escape hatch is easier to follow: Use a temporary off-ramp to 
exit early onto Calabasas Road, go right at Parkway Calabasas, thread your way 
through the Parks but then stay on wide-open Mulholland all the way to Topanga. 
Go north on Topanga and the whole valley opens up to you. (Travel time east or 
west between Parkway Calabasas and Topanga Canyon is slightly more than eight 
minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Rather than re-entering the freeway at Topanga, go east on Victory Boulevard, 
turn right on Topham Street just before you get to the railroad tracks and stay 
on it as it turns into Oxnard Street, all the way to Louise Avenue, where you 
turn right. That's a shortcut they call "Kick in the Oxnard" for its quick 
access to the west valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow to Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Louise takes you to Burbank Boulevard, one of Rogers and Schwadel's highly 
recommended east-west roadways, and you can follow it all the way to the San 
Diego Freeway or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
One of their rules of the road is that "residents take precedence." Speeding 
and squealing will cause complaints, and complaints will bring police 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing magic about these routes, Schwadel said. The partners 
consulted Caltrans and Los Angeles traffic-flow maps, learned about the timing 
of traffic lights and surveyed friends, cab drivers, television news crews and 
bar-stool compatriots for advice. Then they drove the shortcuts, checking for 
hazards, such as school crossings, and timing them. 
</P>
<P>
But whether drivers will use the routes has little to do with knowing that they 
exist, the authors said. "It all has to do with your attitude and state of 
mind," Schwadel said, and shortcut sharks rebel rather than stew in someone 
else's exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's anarchy out there," they write. "The cardinal rule is there are no rules. 
But there are shortcuts."
