Rush hour traffic was snarled for hours on the Golden State and Simi Valley 
freeways Tuesday because a large earth excavator on a transporter truck hit an 
overpass in Sun Valley, seriously damaging the structure, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was traveling south on the Golden State Freeway at the junction with 
the Hollywood Freeway shortly after 2:30 p.m. when it hit an overpass, knocking 
off pieces of concrete, CHP Officer Howard Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
All but one lane of the southbound Golden State Freeway were closed at the 
junction. 
</P>
<P>
The transition road leading from the northbound Hollywood to the northbound 
Golden State Freeway was closed to keep motorists off the damaged overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for about three miles 
and was diverted to the southbound Hollywood Freeway, while motorists on the 
northbound Hollywood freeway were diverted at Sheldon Street to relieve 
congestion, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway was also congested for about a 
mile west of the juncture with the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Marty Thurmon, said he was transporting a 75-ton shovel for 
construction excavations from Sacramento to San Juan Capistrano when it slammed 
into the overpass while the truck was traveling about 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmon said he had a Caltrans permit to travel that route, indicating that the 
load was not too tall for the overpasses on it, and added that no signs were 
posted near the overpass specifying height restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said she did not know if Thurmon had been 
issued a permit to carry the load or if signs with height information were 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had a permit, he would have known what areas to avoid. . . . I don't 
know what information the driver had," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tiritilli said she had no estimate of the cost of the damage.
