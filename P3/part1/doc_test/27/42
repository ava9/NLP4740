A ROLLS-ROYCE IS EARL GREY TEA AND WEEKENDS AT ASCOT AND ALL THINGS BY ROYAL 
APPOINTMENT. IT IS, IN SHORT, A LEGEND THAT IS AT ITS HAUGHTIEST AND MIGHTIEST 
ONLY ON THE HIGHWAYS, BYWAYS AND MOTOR WAYS OF ENGLAND.

o realize that a car has a soul is to accept that it is a creature of habitat. 
Thereupon, there really is no other highway for stretching a Porsche to its 
tiptoes than 200 kilometers of mostly Bavarian autobahn between bookbinding 
Stuttgart and beer-drinking Munich. The throat of a V-12 Ferrari -- a tame 
tenor on the Hollywood Freeway -- somehow, inexplicably, maybe as a trick of 
its heritage, rises to a ripping alto when shaking off Milan and driving the 
Alpine foothills in search of Lago di Como. And a Rolls-Royce . . . well, it's 
forever Earl Grey tea and weekends at Ascot and all things By Royal Appointment 
and a legend that is at its haughtiest and mightiest only on the highways, 
byways and motor ways of England. Not in Scotland, mind you, where England 
continues to be blamed for Emperor Hadrian and his wall. Nor Wales, of course, 
where the Plaid Cymru party still seeks home rule. But in emerald, tweedy, 
fabled, Conservative, drafty, thatched, humorous and unhurried England, where 
the Rolls-Royce was born in 1905 as "the new all-British motor car" of C. S. 
Rolls &amp; Co. and where this rolling thing of steel and walnut, rubber and 
leather remains an icon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would endorse that," agrees Gillian Hepworth, speaking for Guy Salmon Car 
Rentals, firmly established renter of Rolls-Royce to visiting Americans. "A 
Rolls-Royce is so very English. It is not a car you race down the autobahn. You 
drive it in stately fashion, and there is no statelier country for doing that, 
than England." 
</P>
<P>
A Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit rented from Guy Salmon of London costs $800 a day. 
Or about $4,900 a week. Or $19,000 a month. Plus insurance and an enormous 
Value Added Tax of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Avis also rents the Silver Spirit for a mere $700 a day -- or $24,900 for a 
29-day rental which includes, bless 'em, comprehensive insurance and unlimited 
mileage. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1905 catalogue, the 11-car Rolls-Royce line (entry level then being a 
two-cylinder Tonneau for $600) was introduced as "a model of accurate and 
scientific construction . . . the most perfect and luxurious car . . . fast, 
silent, vibrationless." 
</P>
<P>
It still is. 
</P>
<P>
In 1905, the company's showroom was at 14-15 Conduit Street near fashionable 
New Bond Street in London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
It still is. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Sir Henry Royce died, the color of the famed and entwined RR emblem 
went from red to black in mourning, and a young delivery driver and factotum 
named Roger Cra'ster started working for the company. 
</P>
<P>
He still does. 
</P>
<P>
"The classic truth of the Rolls-Royce is that it is the magic of a name," 
Cra'ster says. "And it still is." 
</P>
<P>
We were in his office above that first showroom on Conduit Street. He produced 
tea in bone-china cups. We exchanged schools, spoke an update on the Los 
Angeles Cra'ster had known as a Rolls-Royce representative in the '50s, and 
then explored that mystique of his marque. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with aristocracy implied. "The inference is that if you are in a 
Rolls-Royce, you are at least influential," Cra'ster explains. "Of course, if 
you're worthy of a Rolls-Royce it's an entirely different matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once driving around a Royal Air Force station. The guards on the 
gate saluted me. I drove around this highly secret station and nobody stopped 
me. And I couldn't have done that in any other car." 
</P>
<P>
To a bred-in-the-bone motorist, such challenges are irresistible. I proposed a 
trial marriage. Rolls-Royce accepted. For seven days, it was agreed, my charge 
would be a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, all Wedgwood blue, all magnolia-cream 
leather, all snootiness. 
</P>
<P>
We drove its world; from the Dorchester to the Savoy, from chic pubs in 
Belgravia's mews to the empty Cotswolds and antique stores of Regency 
Cheltenham. 
</P>
<P>
Cra'ster was correct. At the wheel of a Rolls-Royce, the unworthy assume 
influence. It's like marrying old money. If you admired it in the first place, 
you quickly want to become it. So the actor in all of us starts to dress the 
Rolls-Royce part (gabardine blazer and a Burberry raincoat are excellent form 
when driving the car during daylight hours; but no tank tops and Andy Capp 
cloth hats, old boy, and act the part (one searches for full-service stations 
because no Rolls-Royce owner pumps his own four-star petrol) and eventually, 
inevitably, totally, one becomes swallowed by the game. 
</P>
<P>
Do both sides play? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
At the Savoy, in a pouring rain, in a car-clogged forecourt, at lunchtime, the 
doorman waved Lady Wedgwood and me through irritable traffic to his front door. 
Cabdrivers said nothing. Fords and Vauxhalls moved over. They knew their place. 
You feel like a lord. Or a pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
"Just leave her with me, sir," he said. "She'll be here when you get out." 
</P>
<P>
She was -- with a fresh newspaper on the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
At Harrods, with the rain now a metropolitan monsoon, we were allowed to triple 
park. A green-and-gold commissionaire holding a green-and-gold umbrella opened 
our door. He was our cover and interference to the green and gold store. "About 
an hour, sir?" "Yes, about an hour." Exactly 60 minutes later, the car slid 
from nowhere to the store doorway where we had been waiting for nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Denver Boot -- that impregnable clamp and imported 
conqueror of red-zone and parking ticket scofflaws -- was not designed to 
imprison a Rolls-Royce tire. Or tyre . I did not challenge that. But in sedate 
Cheltenham, the premise of one law for the poor, one law for the Rolls-Royce 
owner, was fully tested. The curb was clearly marked. No parking. But I stopped 
there anyway, directly behind an Austin Mini. The traffic warden eyed the 
Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to be long, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
"About 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be much longer, sir." 
</P>
<P>
He continued writing a ticket for the Mini. 
</P>
<P>
But this was fluff. I was allowing Cra'ster's Theory that a Rolls-Royce will 
rise above its driver. Not only that, I was groveling before this vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Enough. We would see if this product of the late and Honorable Charles S. 
Rolls, MA, once a racer of cars, former holder of world speed records and flier 
of airplanes, had evolved as thoroughbred automobile or Mayfair fop. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, no Silver Spirit is a Corvette. Too heavy and not aerodynamic enough. 
Its broad track and long wheelbase preclude nimbleness. Too much of everything 
at slow speeds in tight quarters make any maneuver an end result of calculating 
all the options. But as a cruiser of motor ways . . . ah, even in this age of 
shaky superlatives, the Rolls-Royce motorcar is consummate. At 80 m.p.h. she's 
only flexing. At 100 her legs are ready. At 130, its indicated apogee on a 
deserted stretch of the M1 nearing Leicester at dawn, the Rolls speeds flat and 
stable. Wind and engine noise are a subdued second to Count Basie and "April in 
Paris" on the tape deck. Whether a Rolls-Royce simply holds its own or munches 
BMWs, Jaguars or Mercedes is a matter of choice. The car can do it. Can you? 
</P>
<P>
Lady Wedgwood and I finally found each other on an innocent secondary road 
leading from Marlborough to the Wiltshire village of Aldbourne. It was a dark, 
clear night on an empty road of stern macadam, and there was a full, earned 
respect between car and driver. A string of red lights ahead formed into a road 
construction site abandoned for the day. Fluorescent cones formed a detour, and 
a driver's mental computer took it all in: Two lanes wide, a fast, flat, 
sweeping left-hander followed by a straight, full-bore exit. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat. Balance the car with a touch of brake and a feather of throttle. 
Enter the left-hander fast, looking for the apex and exit as one. There they 
are. I clipped the apex, dove for the exit and had it made . . . when a rumble 
and a jink said that everything, suddenly, was very wrong. The curve, dammit, 
had been set with a negative camber, a banking sloping down from the apex of 
the turn. In a microsecond, the weight of the Rolls-Royce, more than two tons, 
had shifted to the outside of the car and the turn. The geometry was a tangle. 
She was ready to slide. 
</P>
<P>
Only one thing to do. Drive the Rolls like a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
I flicked the steering a notch to shake the center of gravity loose from 
somewhere over the rear passenger door handle. Felt the weight settle. 
Straightened up the front end. Quick, ease on power and hope there's enough 
torque in this duchess to restore balance, direction and control. It worked. We 
came out from the cones like Emerson Fittipaldi. A Rolls-Royce had behaved like 
a real car. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, at London Airport, I turned the car back to a genial, polite, Tom 
Murphy, the car's venerable handler and silent sufferer of all those who drive 
her. I stared a goodby at the car. I'd beaten it. For one moment on a dark back 
road in Wiltshire, I had been the absolute master of this Rolls-Royce. I swear 
the car sneered. But then it had seen my final clumsiness and knew. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't yet learned to step out of a Rolls-Royce as if I owned it.
