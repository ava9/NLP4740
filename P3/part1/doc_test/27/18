Caltrans began a $1.8-million dollar project this week to install a center 
guardrail on the Golden State Freeway along a stretch of road in northern Los 
Angeles County where six motorists have died in head-on collisions this year. 
</P>
<P>
The steel barriers will be placed along a 13-mile stretch of the freeway going 
north from Templin Highway near Castaic Lake to Hungry Valley Road near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Thomas Knox said actual construction could begin any day. 
Contractors began stockpiling rails to be used for the project at a Templin 
Highway storage yard Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Interstate 5 project, which was approved by the state more 
than a year ago, is expected to be completed by February. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news because of the accidents we've been having," said Capt. 
Terry Horan, head of the California Highway Patrol's Newhall district, which 
includes the area where the barrier will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"This will make it safer," Horan said. "The head-on collisions demonstrated the 
need for a barrier. There were fatals; there were accidents where a blown tire 
could send cars into the other side." 
</P>
<P>
The four northbound and four southbound lanes of the freeway -- the major 
artery linking the Southland with the San Joaquin Valley -- are divided by 
guardrails or canyons throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. But the separation 
ends from Templin Highway north to California 138 above Hungry Valley. Along 
this stretch, the northbound and southbound lanes are separated only by a 
36-foot-wide gravel median that dips in the center. 
</P>
<P>
The guardrail project is part of a statewide plan to add safety barriers along 
the entire length of Interstate 5 as increased population and traffic dictates, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers said that in recent years there have been numerous accidents along 
the stretch that were caused when cars crossed the center strip into oncoming 
traffic. Since April, six people have been killed in four separate accidents 
involving head-on collisions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the deaths, the accidents often cause massive traffic snarls on 
both sides of the freeway -- the state's major north-south artery. On Aug. 5, a 
head-on collision in Sunday evening traffic near Templin Highway left one 
motorist dead and delayed weekend travelers more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Steve Cortes, who has patrolled the stretch through open, 
mountainous country, said the area is heavily traveled by trucks and motorists 
making lengthy drives to or from Northern California. He said that several of 
the accidents he has investigated there involved drivers who fell asleep and 
drifted into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to prevent a lot of serious accidents," Cortes said of the new 
center guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Cortes said that once while chasing a speeding car along the stretch, his 
patrol car blew a tire and veered across the center median and all four 
oncoming lanes. It was 3 a.m. and traffic was light. He and his partner came 
out of it shaken but unscathed.
