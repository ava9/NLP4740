A construction crane fell over on the Ventura Freeway early Wednesday, dumping 
a boom arm and a five-ton slab of concrete onto a transition road below and 
turning the already sluggish freeway into a virtual parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The transition road, connecting the eastbound Ventura Freeway to the southbound 
San Diego Freeway, was closed at the time for work on the Ventura Freeway 
improvement project. Although some traffic lanes on the Ventura were open to 
the right of the crane, it fell to the left, away from traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Crane operator David Loyd suffered minor cuts and bruises when the device 
toppled as it moved the concrete barrier into place at the interchange with the 
San Diego Freeway about 4:50 a.m. No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first major mishap on the freeway improvement project, Caltrans 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said crews were installing new guard rails on the freeway interchange -- 
work that required the closure of one eastbound lane and several transition 
roads between midnight and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the crane was replacing 20-foot temporary concrete 
barriers. Crews already had replaced 15 to 20 of the barriers and were 
scheduled to reopen the closed freeway lanes and transition roads as soon as 
the final barrier was in place, said Jim McAllister, Caltrans resident engineer 
for the improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
But the crane, which was in a closed traffic lane, tipped and rolled onto its 
side. It remained unclear late Wednesday what caused the large crane to topple, 
Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Weighed down by the concrete barrier, the arm of the crane fell onto the closed 
transition road. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister said the crane was prevented from falling over the side of the 
freeway by its arm, which bent when it hit the pavement 15 to 20 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was a major headache for hundreds of early morning commuters on 
the Ventura Freeway who found themselves trapped in traffic backed up more than 
five miles. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which is under investigation by state safety authorities, closed 
several transition roads between the freeways for as long as four hours. All 
eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed for about 15 minutes as 
workers righted the crane about 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the San Diego Freeway moved surprisingly fast, apparently because 
many motorists heard news of the accident and used surface streets. 
Consequently, city streets were overwhelmed with a crush of motorists looking 
for a speedier way to work. 
</P>
<P>
They were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Intersections were snarled and traffic inched along major streets running 
parallel to both freeways. Eastbound traffic on Ventura Boulevard was jammed 
from the San Diego Freeway to Louise Avenue about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," said Los Angeles police Officer Clarence Dean, part of a 
contingent dispatched to direct traffic. 
</P>
<P>
All freeway lanes and transition roads were reopened by 9 a.m. and normal 
traffic flow was restored about 30 minutes later, California Highway Patrol 
Officer Jayne Suits said. 
</P>
<P>
The crane involved in the accident is owned by the Tutor-Saliba Corp., which is 
under contract with the California Department of Transportation for the 
$62-million project to widen the Ventura and Hollywood freeways from Universal 
City to Agoura Hills. When the project is completed in early 1992, the two 
freeways will be 10 lanes wide between Lankershim and Topanga Canyon 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Scarrot, Tutor-Saliba vice president of equipment operations, said the 
company will investigate the accident. A spokesman for the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said his office also will 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister of Caltrans apologized for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what many people may think of Caltrans, we do not go out there and 
purposefully try to jam freeways," he said.
