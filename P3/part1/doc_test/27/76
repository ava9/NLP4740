PANEL MOVES TO PUT HALF-CENT TAX HIKE ON NOV. 7 BALLOT

<P>
Citing an unprecedented traffic crisis, the Orange County Transportation 
Commission voted Monday to place a countywide, half-cent sales tax for highway 
and transit projects on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would raise $3.1 billion for a far-reaching, $11.6-billion plan to 
speed traffic with wider freeways, additional car-pool lanes, streamlined 
streets and commuter rail service. About $8.4 billion for the 20-year plan 
would come from existing sources, such as the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would cost each Orange County consumer an estimated $50 to $75 per 
year. It would increase the sales tax from 6% to 6 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decision came a day after The Times Orange County Poll showed that 
public support for the sales tax hike has slipped to 48% from 54% about 11 
months ago, with 46% now against the measure and the rest undecided. The poll's 
margin of error is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by pollster Jim Moore for sales tax advocates showed 
Monday that support has slipped from 67% to 61% since March but that the 
opposition is "very soft," officials said. Moore's poll introduced the measure 
as funding "needed" improvements that would help reduce congestion, while The 
Times Orange County poll did not. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners voted 6 to 0 for a Nov. 7 special election to avoid confusing 
voters with Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state gasoline tax increase, now 
scheduled for the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the people of Orange County are willing to wait any longer," 
said commission member Dana W. Reed, referring to the 20-year plan. "The wheels 
of government turn too slowly as it is," added Reed, a Costa Mesa lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Councilman and Commission Vice Chairman Richard B. Edgar said: "Some may 
say this is not perfect . . . but we've reached a consensus. Let's put our 
shoulders to the wheel and get this thing done." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the audience rose to criticize the 20-year plan's partial 
reliance on additional car-pool lanes, prompting Commission Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley to respond sarcastically at one point: "Thanks for your vote of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Riley, who was reelected as OCTC chairman on Monday and is also Board of 
Supervisors chairman, said he was frustrated by some critics who focused on 
complaints about separate elements within the plan without seeing the "whole, 
regional picture." 
</P>
<P>
Keith McKean, Caltrans' Orange County director, warned that without the 
additional revenue from the proposed half-cent tax, there is little than can be 
done to prevent the congestion from getting much worse. Orange County 
motorists, as a group, spend more hours in traffic delays than drivers in Los 
Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to a 
regional planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
Without the extra $3.1 billion, transportation officials say, there will be 
sufficient money for only 80% of the $1.5-billion Santa Ana Freeway-widening 
project, 60% of planned local street projects, and maintenance of existing 
transit service at current ridership levels. Construction of three planned 
tollways in eastern and southern Orange County would be paid for with developer 
fees and bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Officials generally were upbeat, however, since the 20-year sales tax plan has 
now survived a gauntlet of citizens' advisory groups and public hearings over 
an 18-month period. Riley and others said they believe that traffic has 
worsened to the point where most motorists are willing to pay to try to solve 
the problem. Officials have avoided some mistakes made in 1984, when a 1-cent 
tax measure was hurriedly assembled and went down in defeat, 70% to 30%, Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ink was not even dry on OCTC's sales tax ordinance last week when a small 
group of civic activists and business leaders began talking to potential 
campaign managers, such as Sacramento-based consultant David Townsend. One 
possibility, participants in those discussions said, was that former Orange 
County Republican Party leader Lois Lundberg might handle phone-bank operations 
from which voters would be contacted individually. 
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the group favoring the tax said that no contracts had yet 
been offered and that many more consultants were under consideration, based 
partly on whether they are available for an election as near as Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition to have surfaced so far includes Russ Burkett of San Juan 
Capistrano, who said Monday that the growth-control regulations contained in 
OCTC's 20-year plan "are meaningless words," and members of Drivers for Highway 
Safety, a grass-roots organization that intends to turn the election into a 
referendum on car-pool lanes, which the group argues are dangerous and 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
County and Caltrans officials argue that not only do car-pool lanes improve 
traffic flow, they are also a necessary element in current efforts to meet 
tough anti-smog regulations and in competing with other counties and states for 
federal highway grants. They also say that OCTC's 20-year plan earmarks far 
more money for other highway and transit projects than it does for car-pool 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 20-year plan, about 43% of the sales-tax proceeds would go for 
freeway-widening projects, 32% for regional street and road-improvement 
projects, and 25% would fund transit projects, including additional rail 
service and planning for monorails or other advanced-technology, light-rail 
projects linking various communities. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the commission must give final approval in two weeks to the 
Nov. 7 election date. The Board of Supervisors has until Aug. 8 to ask 
Registrar of Voters Don Tanney to include the sales-tax measure in the printing 
of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The sales-tax plan will occupy 23 pages of a voter-information booklet, 
according to Tanney. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney estimated that it will cost up to $1.2 million to hold the special 
sales-tax election. He said that nine school districts and eight special 
service districts will have elections on that same day, involving 50% to 60% of 
the county's eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout, Tanney said, probably would be only 12% to 20% in the special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the OCTC would pay the cost if the measure passes. County 
government would pay the cost should voters reject the tax.
