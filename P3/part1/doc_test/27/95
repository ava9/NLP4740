Caltrans Director Robert Best has threatened to simply close the highways on 
which construction workers are exposed to traffic. Best and California Highway 
Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan made a joint plea to drive safely and 
soberly through highway work zones and "end the slaughter of California highway 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
In less than two months, five Caltrans workers have been killed, including two 
early this month along Interstate 5 in Stockton who were struck by a suspected 
drunk driver. The toll attributed to errant motorists is 25 since 1972. Best 
issued a statement saying: "If we can't stop the carnage, then we may have to 
curtail or eliminate night construction work, or close roads while work is 
being done. We will do whatever it takes to get this necessary work done 
without sacrificing the safety of our road workers."
