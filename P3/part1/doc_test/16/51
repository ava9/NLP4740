Geena Davis won best the supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of a wacky, 
sweetly aggressive dog-trainer in "The Accidental Tourist" as the 61st Academy 
Awards ceremonies got under way Wednesday evening at the Shrine Auditorium in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old actress, a former model who made her screen debut in the 1982 
hit "Tootsie," was a first-time nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Her Oscar brought the evening's first distinction to a film that enjoyed four 
other nominations, including best picture. The movie was based on a 
best-selling novel by Anne Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Warner Brothers' "Bird" won an Oscar for sound, the only category in 
which the Clint Eastwood-directed film about jazz great Charlie Parker was 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" also won an early evening award for sound 
editing. "Roger Rabbit," a huge box office hit, did not receive nominations in 
any major category. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's heavy favorite remained MGM/UA's "Rain Man." The film, about the 
adventures of an autistic savant and his car-salesman brother, led the pack 
with eight nominations, including best-picture and a best-actor nomination for 
screen veteran Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Los Angeles-born actor has been nominated as best actor six 
times and won an Oscar in 1980 for his performance in "Kramer vs. Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
Other nominees for best actor included Gene Hackman for "Mississippi Burning," 
Tom Hanks for "Big," Max von Sydow for "Pelle the Conqueror" and Edward James 
Olmos for "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the stars began to arrive, the crowd out front waiting to greet 
them was estimated at 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Carr, the ABC telecast's producer, opened the show with a tribute to the 
Cocoanut Grove, which had been an early Oscar venue. 
</P>
<P>
In one signal change, celebrity presenters were instructed to say, "And the 
Oscar goes to . . . ," rather than the customary "And the winner is. . . ." The 
new formula was supposed to lesson the sense of competition among the stars. 
</P>
<P>
The show was being aired live throughout the world, including in the Soviet 
Union for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
A triumph by "Rain Man" would be particularly sweet for Lee Rich, Tony 
Thomopoulos and other deposed executives of MGM/UA Communications Co., who left 
the studio last year amid differences with Kirk Kerkorian, the studio's 
principal owner. 
</P>
<P>
The film itself had a tumultuous production history. It evolved from a much 
rewritten screenplay originally conceived by Barry Morrow, ricocheted from one 
director to another before landing with Barry Levinson, and grew from a small, 
arty film into a big-budget star vehicle backed by the powerful Creative 
Artists Agency, which represents its co-stars Hoffman and Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, "The Last Emperor," distributed by Columbia Pictures, swept nine 
Oscars, including the best picture award. This year Columbia, under a new 
studio administration, had no nominations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Picture Nominees 
</P>
<P>
Other best picture nominees this year included 20th Century Fox's "Working 
Girl," Warner Bros.' "The Accidental Tourist" and "Dangerous Liaisons," and 
Orion's "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous Liaisons," about the immoral doings of 18th-Century French 
aristocrats, and "Mississippi Burning," a reality-based film about the murder 
of three civil rights workers in the 1960s, were close behind "Rain Man" with 
seven nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
Any recognition for "Mississippi Burning" could trigger controversy, since the 
film, while well received, has been excoriated by Coretta Scott King, widow of 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and various black groups for downplaying the 
role of blacks in the '60s civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether pre-Oscar awards pointed in several directions this year. While 
the Directors Guild of America honored director Barry Levinson for his work on 
"Rain Man," the Writers Guild of America bypassed the film to honor 
screenwriter Ron Shelton for Orion's "Bull Durham," a baseball picture that 
received no other nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., meanwhile, gave its Golden Globe Award for 
best movie to "Rain Man," but presented a best-director award to Eastwood for 
"Bird." 
</P>
<P>
The best actress category did not appear to be dominated by any heavy favorite 
in the pre-Oscar handicapping. 
</P>
<P>
Nominees included Glenn Close for "Dangerous Liaisons;" Jodie Foster for "The 
Accused;" Melanie Griffith for "Working Girl;" Meryl Streep for "A Cry in the 
Dark," and Sigourney Weaver for "Gorillas in the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
All but Griffith had previous Oscar nominations, and Weaver enjoyed the rare 
distinction of a second nomination this year as best supporting actress in 
"Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
If Neilsen ratings for the three hour-plus show have dipped over the years, 
Hollywood appears more enamored of its annual celebration than ever. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which sponsors 
the awards, a record 87 screen stars were expected to attend this year's 
black-tie ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best-picture nominees, "Rain Man" was clearly the box office 
favorite, with more than $120 million in ticket sales so far. "The Last 
Emperor," last year's winner, grossed only about $43 million at the U.S. box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Entertainment Data Inc., a box office consulting firm, Sigourney 
Weaver and Tom Hanks are clearly the biggest grossing stars among this year's 
nominees. Films starring Weaver have grossed $401 million since 1982, while 
films starring Hanks have taken in $415 million for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
As the show opened, Oscar officials scouted for guests carrying any of 40 
tickets that had been picked up by a man claiming to be a 20th Century Fox 
publicity official. The academy said it would press charges if it could prove 
that any guest knowingly tried to use a stolen ticket. 
</P>
<P>
It could not immediately be learned if any guest had been stopped for carrying 
a stolen ticket. No arrests had been made in the theft of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite tight control by the academy, scalped tickets sold from $500 for 
balcony seats to $2,000 for the best seats. 
</P>
<P>
This year the academy chose not to present its Irving Thalberg Award, an Oscar 
that is periodically given for sustained excellence in film making. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the award was given to Austrian-born writer and director Billy 
Wilder.
