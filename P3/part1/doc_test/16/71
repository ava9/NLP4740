MERYL STREEP ATTACKS HOLLYWOOD'S GENDER GAP AT SAG CONFERENCE; 
</P>

DECREASES IN ROLES FOR WOMEN AND INCOME.

Perennial Academy Award contender Meryl Streep lashed out at the film industry 
this week for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off and 
said, with tongue only slightly in cheek, that if current trends continue, 
women will be eliminated altogether from movies by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of roles isn't there (for women) and hasn't been for a long time," 
Streep told a predominantly female audience at Wednesday's opening of the 
Screen Actors Guild's first National Women's Conference at the Ma Maison 
Sofitel Hotel in West Hollywood. "I'm barely able to contain a guffaw when a 
reporter asked me what drew me to a role, as though there is a rainbow of 
well-written female leading roles." 
</P>
<P>
A SAG report released Wednesday showed startling decreases in both women's 
roles and relative income. In 1989, 71% of all roles in feature films and 64% 
of all roles in TV went to men. The report said the combined income of men more 
than doubled that of women ($644 million to $296 million). 
</P>
<P>
Women are at a disadvantage in every age group, the study shows, except 
children under 10. The greatest disparity begins after age 40, where the 
percentage of roles for women drops off dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Streep, the keynote speaker for the conference, called it a career nightmare 
for actresses who reach 40. No matter who they are, she said, they face the 
"age police who want to see your passport or driver's license." 
</P>
<P>
Streep blamed the blockbuster mentality in Hollywood for spawning big-budget 
male action films, at the cost of character-driven films with balanced gender 
roles. Referring back to the days when there were as many female stars as men, 
she said "the crackling wit and stylish verbal surprise which characterized 
films of the past has been crushed under the wheels of blockbusters." 
</P>
<P>
The main culprit for the current disparity is the dependence on foreign 
markets, where male action films are dominant, Streep said. "What we see (in 
the U.S.) is predetermined by what deal makers think will go over well in 
Southeast Asia." 
</P>
<P>
SAG President Barry Gordon told the audience that it's up to labor and the 
public to force a change of thinking among management, but Streep said she 
doesn't "hold out much hope that anything will change." 
</P>
<P>
"There's profit in the old way of doing things," she said. "It's the bottom 
line that drives the dream machine."
