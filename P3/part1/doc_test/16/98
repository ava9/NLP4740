THE LOST GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

For those who missed Peter Rainer's article "Hollywood's Lost Generation of 
Women" (June 3), I suggest that you search your newspaper piles to find it; it 
raises some vital concerns about women in Hollywood today. Rainer addresses the 
reasons why talented actresses are faced with such flat, sexist roles. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the article, Rainer offers some insight into why this tragedy is 
sweeping Hollywood. Hollywood does not want and does not know how to approach 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely insulting for Hollywood to assume that people won't want to 
see funny, intelligent, sensitive women in action. Why can't they ask 
themselves, "You mean there are extraordinary women of today and yesterday?" 
Yes! Women of all different colors, sizes and backgrounds who have shaken the 
world unnoticed. If we can't learn of women heroines in the classroom, 
Hollywood should consider its position to educate in society. 
</P>
<P>
It was to my distress this weekend that I could not find one film I could drag 
myself to see, and Rainer's article helps to examine why Hollywood's summer 
lineup lacks integrity. I do not want to see a sequel, or violent images of men 
in grease paint shooting everywhere to save humanity. Is it really too much to 
ask? I want to see a film, one that does not depict women as only Barbie doll 
hookers, money-hungry sex machines, or murderous villainettes. 
</P>
<P>
Please, give actresses a choice, and give us a break. I think for now, like 
Rainer, we'll have to wait.
