CINEFILE: IN SEARCH OF . . . RAQUEL WELCH 
</P>

She made an early acting career of skimpy on-screen outfits in B and C movies, 
but later quieted skeptics with her comedic skills in "The Three Musketeers" 
(1974) and her SRO performances on Broadway as Lauren Bacall's replacement in 
the Tony Award-winning "Woman of the Year." Now, soon to turn 50 (Sept. 5), 
Raquel Welch is gradually easing herself out of the role of actress, aiming at 
a new career as a producer. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging Hollywood's unkindness to aging actresses, she hopes "in five 
years time I wouldn't have to be in front of the camera" and could be producing 
full-time, developing strong film roles for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with anyone," Welch says. "I think 
they are waiting to be told. . . . This is a marketplace. Here, they are ready 
for people with ideas. I have plenty of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Not that she's disappeared. She's just released her fourth fitness video ("Body 
&amp; Mind") and has made a TV movie each of the last three years. But she 
hasn't had a feature film role since 1982 when Debra Winger replaced her in 
MGM's "Cannery Row." She later sued MGM and was awarded $10.8 million, a 
judgment that's been appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"My feature career got cut off at the knees" with the "Cannery Row" incident, 
Welch admits, but feels it's now behind her. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of an office at First Management, an arm of Guber-Peters 
Entertainment, she's a bit cagey about projects she says she has in development 
-- "You're talking about a cake that is baking, and I'm not ready to open the 
oven door yet." She mentions features, TV movies, miniseries and sitcoms that 
she would produce and appear in, including a miniseries on controversial '30s 
torch singer Libby Holman, but won't provide many details. 
</P>
<P>
The face and body that made her famous were "my ticket to ride," Welch says, 
although she concedes that the sex-symbol stereotype can be a trap. "Here I am 
an actress in my late 40s -- I don't look like that, but that's where I am 
emotionally and personally.

"I am grown up and I don't have any yen to play in 'Splash,' you know?" Mary
