The Scene: The party after Tuesday's premiere of "Without You I'm Nothing" held 
at Bar One in West Hollywood. The film was a record of comedienne Sandra 
Bernhard's one-woman Broadway show, and the evening was a benefit for the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
The Entertainment: X-rated antics from a troupe of transvestites, emceed by New 
York cable TV star Robin Byrd, who wore a backless (and we mean backless) 
cowgirl outfit. Chichi LaRue kicked off the fun by lip-syncing to the song 
"Nasty," during which LaRue grabbed 15-year-old Drew Barrymore from the 
audience. Bernhard cheered the whole thing and even dirty-danced with Robin 
Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Director John Boskovich, designer Isaac Mizrahi (who designed 
Bernhard's lipstick-red dress), singer John Doe, sculptor Julian Schnabel, 
writer Bruce Vilanch, actress Theresa Russell with husband Nicolas Roeg, 
professional gossips the Hollywood Kids, artist Allee Willis, and actress Kim 
McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Bernhard's floor-length red Mizrahi dress made her look like 
Cinderella's wicked stepmother. The other woman wore streetwalker chic, while 
the guys who weren't wearing dresses wore leather jackets and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Fresh shrimp, antipasto, pate, and hot pasta. The guests attacked the 
buffet like the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead." 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: The evening raised $50,000 for the group, according to AMFAR 
president Mervyn Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: As observed in this space before, the '70s are back. Guests wore vinyl 
shorts, tank tops, dog tags, and even sequined tube tops. The deejay had the 
nerve to play that ultra '70s hit, "One Tin Soldier" by Coven. The crowd showed 
admirable restraint by not wearing bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Remember, if you don't have a loved one at home, you always have us!" 
screamed Bernhard and Byrd to the appreciative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Sandra Bernhard is not your average Hollywood actress, and this was 
definitely not your average Hollywood premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: One woman who approached the buffet was told, "You can't have any 
shrimp until 9:30!" That was rude -- almost as rude as adult film star Angel 
Kelly, who took everything off as the mixed crowd screamed and whistled. As we 
said, it was not your average Hollywood premiere.
