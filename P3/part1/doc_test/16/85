A 19-year-old "obsessed fan" accused of murdering Rebecca Schaeffer at her Los 
Angeles apartment house had hired private investigators in his hometown of 
Tucson to track down where the young actress lived, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks before Schaeffer's killing, Robert John Bardo walked into the Anthony 
Agency, a Tucson firm that advertises its ability to find missing persons, and 
showed private investigators a studio publicity photo of the television and 
film actress, Los Angeles police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the firm told The Times that Bardo had said Schaeffer was an old 
friend and he wanted her current address so he could send her a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had been writing letters to her in the past and he wanted a current 
mailing address," recalled William Johnson, who works for the investigation 
firm but did not personally handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the photograph of Schaeffer that Bardo carried contained her 
signature and a personal message scribbled on the print by the actress. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he knew her from some (Hollywood) studios," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The private investigators said they had no knowledge that Bardo may have been 
intent on killing Schaeffer: "Naturally," said Johnson, "if they knew what he 
would do, they wouldn't have taken the case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$250 Fee 
</P>
<P>
For a fee of $250, the private investigators contacted a person in California, 
whom they refused to identify, and asked that person to find Schaeffer's 
address through public records. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made a request of someone over there (in California) to do a check," 
Johnson said. "Apparently, they got a driver's license with an address." 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Motor Vehicles, for a nominal fee, regularly 
provides driver's license information to the public. Authorities said that it 
is virtually impossible to fully shield a person's residence if it exists in 
public records. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have all left a paper trail, be it voter records, tax or motor 
vehicle records," said LAPD homicide detective Dan Andrews. "If a person is 
inquisitive enough, that trail can be found." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, 21, who co-starred in the TV series "My Sister Sam" and recently 
appeared in the film "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," was 
shot to death Tuesday morning at the glass security door to her Fairfax 
District apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized in Tucson 
</P>
<P>
Bardo, a high school dropout who worked occasionally at fast-food outlets, was 
arrested the next day in Tucson as he walked into oncoming traffic on a 
downtown highway. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo is being held in a Tucson jail on $1-million bail, awaiting an Aug. 18 
extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said that the Tucson private investigators called police and said they 
had been contacted June 5 by Bardo. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Bardo had sent a stream of fan letters to Schaeffer. Recently, 
authorities said, he mailed an ominous-sounding letter to his sister in 
Knoxville, Tenn., indicating that if he could not have the actress, no one 
would. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Schaeffer said her assailant had pulled out her photo and asked if 
they knew the exact building where she lived. Police suspect he was guided to 
the street by the information he purchased from the private investigators, but 
may have been unsure of the specific building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Exceptions 
</P>
<P>
With some exceptions, California law states that "every person has a right to 
inspect any public record." The exceptions are home addresses of judges and 
peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, California legislators were angered when a Northern 
California newspaper obtained the driving records of each lawmaker. But, DMV 
officials said, there was nothing they could do but release the information. 
</P>
<P>
DMV officials said the records of 19 million licensed drivers are open to the 
public for inspection under state law. 
</P>
<P>
For as little as $1, a person can go into any of the DMV's 170 field offices, 
fill out Form 70 stating who they are, what person they want information on, 
the reason they are requesting the information and how they intend to use it. 
The information is delivered on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, more than 16 million requests were made by the general 
public for driver and vehicle information in California, according to the DMV. 
Many requests are made to verify information supplied by job applicants, loan 
seekers and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone comes in and says, 'We have a class or armed forces reunion and we 
need this information,' we are going to say, 'That is an acceptable reason,' 
and give out the information," said DMV spokesman Bill Gengler. 
</P>
<P>
But, Gengler added, "If a person comes in and says a driver has made an obscene 
gesture and they want to get the driver's license because they are mad at them, 
or they saw a person in a car and want to get together with them socially, they 
would be turned down." 
</P>
<P>
DMV employees are told not to release information if they believe the applicant 
might seek to harass or harm someone else. But officials concede that, as with 
any form, people can lie. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said he doubts there would have been any way to stop Bardo from getting 
the information if it came through legitimate channels. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any way this particular person could have been 
protected from this because of the public information laws and the way they are 
written."
