Jill Ireland, the British-born actress who bore her private agonies publicly in 
order to help others, succumbed Friday at her Malibu home to the spreading 
cancer she had fought for six years. She was 54. 
</P>
<P>
She slipped into a coma early Friday and died at 11:30 a.m. Her husband, actor 
Charles Bronson, whom she credited with helping her endure intensive radiation 
and chemotherapy treatments and with whom she appeared in numerous films, 
including "Breakout" and "Death Wish II," was at her side when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Valentine McCallum, her sons from her first marriage to actor David 
McCallum, her daughter, Zulieka Bronson, her mother, Dorothy, and her brother, 
John, also were at her bedside Friday, according to publicist Lori Jonas. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland was first diagnosed as having breast cancer in 1984. She wrote 
about her mastectomy and recovery in her first book, "Life Wish," and made 
upbeat talks and appearances to bolster cancer victims and raise money for 
cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, doctors told her that the cancer had reappeared and 
metastasized to her lungs. The disease quickly spread to her hip, femur and 
thyroid. She was given two to three years to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to die," she said shortly after that. "It's not an OK thing. Not 
right now. We all die one day, but I am not in the mood to do it yet." 
</P>
<P>
A different tragedy struck last November, interrupting her chemotherapy and 
prompting a cross-country flight in a chartered plane from her much-loved 
Vermont farm. Jason McCallum, 27, the son she had adopted at infancy with 
McCallum, had died of ingested and injected drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She had chronicled his drug addiction and treatment in her second book, "Life 
Lines," and had believed he was "clean" when the death occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland celebrated a special day last month when a star honoring her work 
in more than 35 films was placed on Hollywood Boulevard. She appeared frail and 
gaunt at that time, as she hoarsely said: "This is really quite a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
She had been working on a third book, "Life Times," a series of profiles of her 
friends, when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Ireland was born April 24, 1936, in London. She was trained as a ballet 
dancer and first performed professionally when she was 12. For a time, she 
appeared with the Monte Carlo Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Singing and acting as well as dancing, she began performing in British films 
and television as a teen-ager, making her film debut in 1955 in "Oh, Rosalinda" 
with Sir Michael Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in several of the "Carry On, Nurse" series of comedy films. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Miss Ireland married McCallum, with whom she had appeared in several 
British productions, and the couple moved to Hollywood in 1962. She soon became 
a popular guest star on U.S. television series including "Ben Casey," "Mannix," 
"Star Trek," and husband McCallum's "Man from U.N.C.L.E." 
</P>
<P>
Her marriage to McCallum ended in 1967, and a year later, she married Bronson, 
becoming his permanent leading lady in a string of action films beginning with 
"Villa Rides." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in so many Charles Bronson films," she once joked, "because no other 
actress will work with him." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, looking for new challenges, Miss Ireland co-produced some of 
their movies. 
</P>
<P>
She also recorded an album, "Hello and Goodby," in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Off-screen, Miss Ireland devoted her time to positive speeches encouraging 
fellow cancer patients and their families to live fully. She referred to 
herself as a "survivor" of cancer, never a "victim." 
</P>
<P>
"Think of yourself and be happy. Make the most of your life and put yourself 
first," Miss Ireland had urged women who had undergone mastectomies. "A breast 
does not make me who I am." 
</P>
<P>
She also sought to help families fight drug addiction, openly discussing son 
Jason's travails. Miss Ireland had not determined until after the adoption that 
the infant had been born addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She regarded former First Lady Betty Ford as a role model because of her public 
discussion of her own mastectomy and treatment for drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I greatly love and admire Betty Ford," she said last year. "She was very 
inspirational to me with her honesty about her breast cancer and then again 
with her candor about her drug abuse. If anything, if I can help other people 
feel less alone with the problem, that would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
With Bronson, she raised his two children, her three, their own daughter, and a 
friend's daughter. Survivors include Bronson, six of the seven children, her 
mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay she wrote for Life magazine last June, Miss Ireland described the 
kind of funeral she wanted: "A real wake, with balloons, champagne, everyone in 
bright, happy colors, lots of food and music. A fiesta. A celebration of my 
life. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were pending.
