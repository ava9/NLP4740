No news would be good news for the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood. Instead, the 
50-seat theater, best known for its multi-award-winning production of "El 
Salvador" in 1988, is at the center of two controversies that bubbled into 
public view this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Gnu is about to open Lee Blessing's "Independence" concurrent with another 
production of the show only a few miles away -- despite the fact that the Gnu's 
rights to the play were withdrawn. An administrator with the company that 
licenses rights to the play said this would be the first time in his six years 
on the job that a theater has openly defied the company's withdrawal of rights. 
</P>
<P>
And in an unrelated matter, the state attorney general's office -- acting as 
the agency that oversees nonprofit "public benefit" corporations -- is 
investigating the management of the Gnu in response to complaints of 
mismanagement and deceit filed by the theater's former managing director, 
Elizabeth Reilly. Gnu artistic director Jeff Seymour denied Reilly's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Gnu plans to open "Independence" Thursday. The Burbank Theatre Guild will 
open the authorized "Independence" one day later. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank producers, veteran sound designer Jon Gottlieb and actress Rhona 
Blaker, have held the local "professional" rights to "Independence" since 
January, 1989. At one point in early 1989, Blaker inquired about the 
possibility of a production at the Gnu, but Seymour wasn't interested. Gottlieb 
and Blaker decided to do the show in Burbank, but their production was delayed 
because of a city-ordered renovation of the 99-seat theater's lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
By last January, Seymour decided he wanted to do the play at the Gnu after all 
-- but on a "non-professional" pay scale. He obtained the "non-professional" 
rights from Dramatists Play Service -- the New York firm which licenses 
professional and non-professional productions of this and many other plays and 
collects the royalties for the playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
(The Burbank rights to the play are "professional" because its producers plan 
to pay the actors -- including former TV stars Marion Ross and Lauren Tewes -- 
a minimum of $75 a week, the level at which Dramatists Play Service defines 
"professional" and guarantees a degree of exclusivity within a radius of 50 
miles. By contrast, the Gnu's payments to actors average about $8 per 
performance; the Gnu's "Independence" will play three performances a week.) 
</P>
<P>
When Gottlieb and Blaker learned of Seymour's plans, they protested. Dramatists 
Play Service responded by withdrawing rights from the Gnu -- but not before 
Seymour had auditioned 400 actors for his production, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Pospisil, the Dramatists Play Service's non-professional rights 
administrator, acknowledged in a telephone interview that he didn't check with 
the professional rights administrator, Anthony Damato, before he approved 
Seymour's request for non-professional rights. It was "a regrettable 
circumstance," he said, but he added that "no specific contract is ever really 
signed for the (non-professional) rights." Added Damato: "We have the legal 
right to withdraw permission for (non-professional) rights at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour has "no problem" with both productions going on at the same time. 
"People aren't going to stand at the crossroads, trying to decide which one to 
go to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gottlieb believes the Gnu production "impacts the profitability of my show. 
It's only 2 miles away, it's confusing to the audience, and now I'll be 
compared to another production. I didn't put in all this time and money (he 
estimates he has invested $10,000) to turn it into a high school skit contest." 
Indeed, he said that he and Blaker secured the professional rights -- despite 
the small size of the theaters they considered using -- because they wanted 
exclusivity and the ability to move their production to a larger venue without 
having to renegotiate rights. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb said he will "take legal action" -- if Dramatists Play Service doesn't 
go to court on his behalf. Damato said he couldn't predict what his company's 
attorneys would do. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seymour already faces legal action from Reilly, his former Gnu 
colleague and ex-girlfriend. In documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court 
last August and in February, Reilly accused Seymour of mismanagement and deceit 
in the running of the theater and in their personal and business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly claimed that she had supported Seymour and the Gnu with her earnings as 
a waitress and actress between December, 1984, and January, 1989, and that she 
and Seymour had an "oral agreement" to be "50/50 partners" in a theater that 
would "showcase their individual talents." They also shared the house they 
rented next door to the theater. But last year, contended Reilly, Seymour 
arbitrarily ended their professional as well as their personal relationship, 
ousting her from her responsibilities at the Gnu. She also accused Seymour of 
using Gnu funds for his personal needs, and she requested the dissolution of 
Gnu Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Because Reilly named the state attorney general's office as one of the 
defendants, in its role as watchdog of nonprofit corporations, Patricia 
Barbosa, deputy attorney general, investigated Reilly's charges. In an opinion 
submitted to the court on April 6, Barbosa noted that nonprofit "public 
benefit" corporations "cannot form the basis of a partnership agreement." But 
she concurred with Reilly's request for an accounting of Gnu Productions, Inc. 
and with her request to remove Seymour as a director of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Barbosa said there were indications of "some serious 
violations of the Corporations Code" at the Gnu. "The books were not kept 
properly," she said. "We couldn't complete the audit." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he has resigned from the theater's board. And he acknowledged that 
"in the early days of the theater, I didn't have a (personal) checking account 
and I would write a check to my dentist from the Gnu Productions account. Later 
I found out you don't do that. For two years I haven't done that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Seymour said that over the years, "I've put in more money than I've 
taken back." He called most of Reilly's charges "the ravings of an ex," and he 
denied virtually all of them in his official written response to her suit, also 
filed in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
OH! CANCELLATION! The touring production of "Oh! Calcutta! has canceled its 
scheduled engagement at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, April 29-May 6. A 
spokesman for the show noted that this engagement was longer than most of the 
stops on the tour, and "the tickets weren't selling as they expected them to." 
Refunds are available at point of purchase.
