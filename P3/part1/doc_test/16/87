Actress Shirley MacLaine says her relationship with Meryl Streep while filming 
"Postcards From the Edge" was nothing less than "awesome." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Old Hollywood met New Hollywood -- when MacLaine and Debra Winger 
co-starred in "Terms of Endearment" -- there were a series of skirmishes 
between the two actresses. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Entertainment Weekly magazine, Hollywood insiders 
predicted similar quarreling between MacLaine and Streep. But it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Meryl is a genius," MacLaine said. "You don't say her name in the same breath 
as Debra Winger's. Or mine. She's got a whole other thing going there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more akin to channeling than anything else. It's awesome."
