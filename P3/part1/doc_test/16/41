French director Agnes Varda at 61 is very much the same woman she was more than 
20 years ago when she first came to Hollywood. She herself admits to no great 
sense of time passing, except in the maturing of her children, Mathieu, who 
co-stars in her new film, "Kung Fu Master!" and is now going on 17, and 
Rosalie, 31, who designs costumes for the opera. 
</P>
<P>
Varda is short, compact, dresses simply and speaks with the wit and the 
matter-of-factness of her films, which include "Cleo from Five to Seven," an 
early work in France's New Wave, and the more recent "One Sings, the Other 
Doesn't" and "Vagabond." Varda still wears her dark hair in a short Dutch bob, 
and her gaze is as direct as ever. 
</P>
<P>
In her Chateau Marmont cottage, Varda complained about the unreliability of the 
TV, the phone and the plumbing, "but I love it. I love so much to be here. Los 
Angeles is where I feel good." Yet in returning to Los Angeles, where she and 
her husband, director Jacques Demy, lived and worked in the late '60s and for 
various periods thereafter, Varda found herself full of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
She hated leaving her husband, currently stricken with a severe case of 
phlebitis; she hated being able to stay only long enough to promote "Kung Fu 
Master!"; and it disturbed her to find that in America the fight for a woman's 
right to have control over her own body was having to be fought all over again. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophisticated Frenchwoman, Varda is not about to allow her picture to be 
described as controversial simply because it involves an affair between a 
40-year-old woman, played by Jane Birkin, and a 15-year-old (Mathieu Demy), who 
is one of her daughter's classmates. "I don't see it as controversial," said 
Varda, with a firm, contemptuous dismissal. "I see it as off-center. Such 
relationships allow people to become different persons, to escape themselves. 
For the woman it was a chance to come back to the time of her adolescence, a 
much deeper need in her than sex. And it allows you to see what the boy needs. 
Boys want so much to become men, and all society tells them is to be good, to 
get good grades and to straighten their rooms." 
</P>
<P>
"Kung Fu Master!" grew out of "Jane B. by Agnes V.," which Varda describes as 
an essay on Birkin, a film portrait of the British actress and singer who has 
long resided in France. "I was trying to invent a new category. I was asking, 
what is an actress? How can she be herself? I showed her in excerpts of films 
that she's never done. I made her play Jeanne of Arc, a woman of the 
Renaissance and Stan Laurel. (Noted Italian actress Laura Betti played Hardy.) 
Jane said, 'You made me do all these different women. Why for once can't I be 
myself? With my kids, wearing jeans and no make-up.' 
</P>
<P>
"You remember, Jane was one of the models in 'Blow-Up,' and she's done a lot of 
French comedies that haven't been seen here. Then there was that famous song, 
'I See You . . . Neither Do I,' she did with Serge Gainsbourg where they did 
all those noises of love-making. It got banned by the Vatican. The Italian 
distributor even went to jail. After that, she was never received in Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, she had a lot of children -- three by three different men -- and 
became a grandmother. She's beloved by everybody in France, half the audience 
at her concerts is under 18. I couldn't believe it! But she doesn't behave like 
a frightening woman to young people. She's like a loving sister to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, she very shyly handed me a 10-page treatment which became the premise 
of 'Kung Fu Master!' She's very sentimental. What she wrote for herself was 
very good, but the boy in the story was a ghost. She saw him as 'Camille.' I 
said, 'Well, forget it. This is 1987-88. Forget the Marguerite Gauthier boy. I 
buy your sentimentality and nostalgia for adolescence, and I'll write the boy. 
It will be a woman in love with a boy not yet a man, but he would be passionate 
for video games.' Video games are important because they embody myths: David 
and Goliath, the pursuit of the Holy Grail, the freeing of Andromeda, the 
journey of Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>
"They both want escape, but freedom is an illusion, as we all know. It's an 
impossible love, but in terms of what it liberates in each of them, it's good. 
The boy doesn't have to be a man, they don't have to be a couple, and that's 
where they really meet. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said to Jane, 'You bring the woman, and I'll bring the boy and the 
society of today.' Kids have always been curious about sex and interested in 
love. It's always been difficult to be 14 or 15, but with AIDS the pressure is 
so much worse. I told Jane that I respected her feelings about wanting to be 
what she wanted to be and that she could be as near as possible to being 
herself, but that the story would be a fiction -- with the texture of reality. 
We shot in her house with her own children playing her children, and her own 
parents in London playing her parents." 
</P>
<P>
"Kung Fu Master!" was not the first time she directed her own son -- he played 
the child in her short 1981 narrative, "Documenteur" ("An Emotion Picture"), 
shot in Venice, Calif., in 1981 -- but it may be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he doesn't want to become an actor," said Varda. "He says that only if 
he doesn't succeed in anything else he'll become an actor because it's the 
easiest thing in the world. His father and I are very amused at that." 
</P>
<P>
Varda resists the notion that she has come into her own in the past decade. 
"After 35 years I still have a hard time finding money," she said. "But I only 
make films that I love. Can you imagine the freedom that represents? All over 
the world people come up to Jacques and me and tell us how much they have loved 
our films. This is the real reward of the real artist."
