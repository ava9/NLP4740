Edla Muir was just 13 years old when she apprenticed to John Byers, a craftsman 
who later became an architect. She designed more than 200 projects, mostly 
residential, and was known for her use of natural materials and careful 
integration of outdoor and indoor space.

Julia Morgan, the best known of the four, had an engineering degree from UC 
Berkeley and was the first woman to graduate from the prestigious Ecole des 
Beaux Arts. Among her more than 700 projects, Morgan designed the Hearst Castle 
at San Simeon, the former Herald-Examiner building and five YMCAs in Los 
Angeles, as well as homes for actress Marion Davis.
