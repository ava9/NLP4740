EVELYN WAUGH (1903-66) wrote Brideshead Revisited in 1945. In a stage
premiere by the Snap Theatre Company at the Swan Theatre, Worcester, it
seems more serious than itself, much more like Eliot's The Cocktail Party
(1950) or Rodney Ackland's The Dark River (1941). The play sets out to be a
corrective to the nectared nostalgia of Granada's lavish 1980 TV series.
However, the familiar characters, or rather ciphers, have still not shaken
off the Granada heritage. The Swan production, adapted by Roger Parsley and
directed by Andy Graham (who appeared in the TV Brideshead), still owes much
in tone to Granada. What Waugh wrote in the 1959 preface to Brideshead
speaks for the history of the book and its representations: 'a gluttony for
the splendours of the recent past'  - Granada revisited.
The story of Charles Ryder's obsession with the Marchmain family and in
particular Sebastian Flyte and his sister Julia is overlaid with Catholic
excess and guilt. Julia says: 'The worse I am, the more I need God.' These
three are the most perplexed and engaging characters; around them a cast of
1920s academics, socialites and aristocrats hovers like gnats over Christ
Church meadow. Anyone who crossed Waugh's path was immediately made into a
figure of absurdity and ridicule. The persistent Oxford context (the House,
Old Tom, Mercury) gives the novel and the play a Zuleika Dobson feel, but
the action stays clear. The rest is Aloysius the teddy bear, plovers' eggs
and Moet.
The adaptation crams Waugh's text into 34 scenes. Ryder's memories are
spread out laterally on the stage, a living portrait of a dying family. The
here-and-now of Ryder's 1943 army billet contrasts perfectly with the blue
remembered hills of early adulthood. The action does move elegantly between
scenes, but Lady Marchmain appears to have strayed in from Ambridge,
constantly 'having a word' or 'wanting a chat.' And it was brave to abandon
Waugh's haunting last line spoken by an adjutant to Ryder as the troops
settle into the billet, 'You're looking unusually cheerful today.'
The cast of seven plus teddy play 15 of the more memorable characters in the
novel, as well as some minor ones. The acting is everywhere tactful and
thoughtful, with particularly versatile performances from Barney Long (as
Samgrass, Sebastian's academic minder, and Lord Marchmain) and Brian Orrell
(as Boy Mulcaster and Brideshead). The principals, Andrew Loudon as Charles
and David Willoughby as Sebastian flirt with the sexual relationship hinted
at in Waugh. Lisa Turner as a sexy, troubled Julia is excellent.
