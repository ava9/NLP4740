ACTOR BRINGS BIT O' IRELAND TO ST. PAT'S CELEBRATION

Shamrocks and shillelaghs, leprechauns and green beer. . . . These are the 
things of which St. Patrick's Day celebrations are made -- in America, at any 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-born actor and singer Shay Duffin takes the stereotyping in stride. "It's 
a friendly attitude," the Redondo Beach resident said in a phone interview this 
week. "Everybody wants to be Irish." Besides, he asked, what other nationality 
is celebrated in the United States with a whole day all of its own? 
</P>
<P>
Still, Duffin refuses to pander to the quaint American view of Irish folklore, 
preferring in his own stage performances to spotlight the island nation's rich 
literary, theatrical and musical heritage. "I'm always trying to raise the 
level of the appreciation of the Irish," said Duffin, who performs Saturday in 
Huntington Beach as part of a St. Patrick's Day celebration being sponsored by 
the Irish Fine Arts Society of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin's performance will include storytelling drawn from the lives and 
writings of such Irish giants as James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde 
and William Butler Yeats. "I'll be stealing from everybody. Stealing from one 
person is plagiarism; stealing from many people is research," Duffin quipped. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the literary references will be leavened with humor: "Just do it and 
get the laugh, and they don't know they've been hit with a Shaw or a Joyce." 
</P>
<P>
Duffin is best known for his portrayal of Brendan Behan, the colorful writer 
and anti-English rebel whose works include the autobiographical novel "Borstal 
Boy" and the satirical play "The Hostage." Behan, whose drinking was legendary, 
died in 1964 at age 41. ("Too young to die, too drunk to live," was how the 
London Times eulogized him.) 
</P>
<P>
At last count, Duffin has performed his one-man Behan show 3,844 times. He hits 
the road in a few weeks to bring the show to Canada and the East Coast. 
Saturday's show will include an excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin knew Behan, 26 years his elder, as a youth growing up in the same Dublin 
neighborhood. Duffin was a biking enthusiast and on Sundays Behan often would 
drop by the local team's locker room, where the cyclists would mix brandy with 
a glucose solution for their morning rides. "That was the only place you could 
get a drink on a Sunday," Duffin said. "Consequently, that's where you found 
the bold Brendan. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had the discipline, he could have been one of the world's greatest 
entertainers. When you see a 41-year-old man die of too much booze, it's a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, who said he does not drink, brought the Behan show to Dublin for the 
first time 3 years ago and played for 3 weeks in the historic Olympia Theatre. 
In the audience one night were Behan's mother and his widow, Beatrice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting," said Duffin, who bears a physical resemblance to Behan. 
Brendan's mother, then 94, "kept interrupting, because she thought it was 
Brendan up there." 
</P>
<P>
The show gained the family's approval -- "the Behans said, 'You do him proud' " 
-- but prompted a few quibbles from the local critics: "His American twang is 
very distracting," Duffin said, reciting from a review. "He's been out in 
Hollywood too long." (To ears perhaps less trained, however, his brogue still 
sounds 100% Irish.) 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, who moved to Canada from Ireland in 1963, started in show business as a 
singer of Irish folk songs and recorded five albums for RCA. Saturday, he will 
sing updated versions of a few auld favorites. One, called "Green Cards" (sung 
to the tune of "Greensleeves"), takes a satiric look at Ireland's wave of 
departing emigrants. "Ronnie, We Are Glad to Know Ye" is sung from the 
perspective of the homeless to the tune of "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye." 
</P>
<P>
Current projects include a new one-man show called "Beyond Pale." "The 
importance of being Irish is the theme of the show," Duffin said. "One-man 
shows are great," he added, "but the cast parties are lousy." 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, he will appear with Vanessa Redgrave in a movie about the 
Irish uprising of 1916 and with Mickey Rourke in a film about the Doukhobors, a 
rebellious Russian community in Canada at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, a widower whose children are now grown, also will keep to the road, 
continuing his Behan shows and another, more cabaret-oriented act. "I'll sing 
or entertain at the drop of a hat, and if I get paid, that's the bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's revue, sponsored by the Irish Fine Arts Society of Orange County, 
will feature Shay Duffin with singers Michael McCormack and Jan Knolton, dancer 
Vinnie O'Connor, the Nicholas Pipe Band and harpist Ellie Shoate. The 
dinner/cabaret show begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Huntington Beach Inn, 21112 
Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach. Admission: $45, includes dinner, 
dancing and show. Information: (714) 840-7903.
