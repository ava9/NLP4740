Rodney Ackland was a friend and admirer of the young Alfred Hitchcock when
there were still silent movies. That is the key to the sensational revival
of Ackland's play, The Old Ladies, at Greenwich. Even Hitchcock would have
been impressed by Annie Castledine's production. It is the first time that I
have felt goose-pimples in the theatre.
Ackland described in his memoirs, The Celluloid Mistress, how he borrowed
the story from the novel by Hugh Walpole. He was so excited at the prospect
of producing of a great milestone in the art of the cinema that at first he
failed to tell Walpole what he was doing.
The Old Ladies, he wrote, 'seemed intensely cinematic: it offered tremendous
scope for warning shadows, huge close-ups of hands and feet and faces, and
the use of ever such significant angles and symbolic objects.' Thus Ackland
wrote the script with only one word of dialogue. It came when Miss
Berringer, an elderly spinster, was so terrified by her gypsy-like
neighbour, Agatha, that she cried 'Jesus]' and then fell dead.
Walpole, when informed, suggested that it might be more lucrative to try a
play before a movie. Ackland complied with this stage version. John Gielgud
agreed to direct and Edith Evans to star. The piece had a decent but not
spectacular run in the West End in 1935. The movie never materialised.
That was the cinema's loss. Hitchcock could have picked up The Old Ladies
just as Hollywood pursued Patrick Hamilton's Rope and Gaslight, which are
similar psychological thrillers from the same period. Ackland, like
Hamilton, is now making a comeback in the theatre.
The tension in the Greenwich production is almost unbearable. It comes at
least as much from the set, the lighting and the accompanying sound effects
as from the acting and the plot. For the plot is pretty well non-existent.
Here are three elderly ladies together in an old house in Polchester, which
might be Colchester or any place around the southern English coast. Two of
them dislike each other. Yet it is a tribute to the play that you never
quite lose the suspicion that it may be Lucy, the amiable one in the middle,
who is the most unhinged.
Nor do the ladies, by today's standards, seem especially old. They are just
three different people, trapped in the same surroundings. Iona McLeish's
two-tier set features a central staircase: the bedrooms of the two disputing
women are at the top. Agatha, the gypsy lady played by Miriam Karlin, is
slightly lame. Anything that happens on or around that staircase is
electric. Even when the lights are out, Agatha is always stirring. The
shadows that Ackland envisaged for a movie version are all over the house.
The technique is teasing. No-one falls down the stairs. The references to
drinking the last drop of coffee or tea are a decoy, for no-one is poisoned
either.
There is no premeditated murder. This might almost be normality in
Polchester, which as in the best of Hitchcock is precisely what makes The
Old Ladies so haunting.
The only failing in Ms Castledine's production is probably not her fault.
The end is not quite as dramatic as the rest of the play has led you to
expect. Yet coming after nearly three hours, which seem to pass like 30
minutes, that it is a small fault. It may even be deliberate: after so much
suspense, why not conclude on a note of anti-climax?
Doreen Mantle plays Lucy with great gentleness, including a reading from
Tennyson. Ms Karlin's Agatha is genuinely frightening, and so is Faith Brook
as the terrified spinster  - but for her frailty not her strength.
