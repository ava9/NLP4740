'Nous Accusons]' began the letter sent to critics covering the recent Dublin
Pinter Festival. The Daughters of Eve, a feminist group which gives its
address as the University of Southern California, announced the forthcoming
trial of three writers: Harold Pinter, John Osborne and Ted Hughes. Their
crimes? 'Fatal damage' to three women - Vivien Merchant, Jill Bennett and
Sylvia Plath, all of whom died, two by suicide and one of alcoholism, after
broken marriages with the writers.
'Age has withered their talent,' says the letter of Pinter, Osborne and
Hughes, 'but the continuity of their spite, damage, self-seeking is so far
unbroken.' Although a feminist trial of Harold Pinter is as offensive to
most people as the Islamic fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the Daughters of
Eve - who see art as an extension of personality - reflect a wider shift
towards the politicisation of an artist's life.
'Perfection of the life, or of the work?' Yeats once asked. When he wrote,
few readers cared about the facts of the writer's existence. In the past 15
years, however, there has been a surge of literary biographies and an
explosion of interest, which is changing the fundamental way we think about
the relation between life and art.
'Biography is listening to backstairs comment and reading people's mail,'
says Janet Malcolm, whose controversial book The Silent Woman, about the
battle between Hughes and the 'cultist' biographers who see Sylvia Plath as
a feminist martyr, has just been published in the US. Last year, after
Andrew Motion's biography of Philip Larkin, and the publication of Larkin's
own letters, revealed racist attitudes - 'too many fucking niggers around' -
and sexist tastes - a penchant for schoolgirl bondage - there were calls for
his poems to be banned.
To trace this movement is to see a cloud of censorship emerging from our
most liberal and individualistic traditions. In an individualistic society,
it is natural that the writer becomes the celebrity, almost a consumer icon,
as well as in some sense our representative - an Everyman whose life tells
us about our own. Hence the bestselling status of recent biographies such as
Richard Ellmann's Oscar Wilde or Victoria Glendinning's Trollope. And in a
culture which flatters itself on its lack of repression it is also
inevitable that we assume the writer's private life, like his work, is our
public property.
In so far as this effects our aesthetic responses, it is usually to enrich
them - most literature is grounded in personal experience, and is a better
read when we know what that experience was. But recently other cultural
trends have come into play - political correctness, the tendency to
conformism, to simplify and to be over-literal. Together, these encourage a
conflation of an artist's life and work, and the passing of an inappropriate
moral judgment on both.
There are the modern giants whose books we are constantly trying to explain,
but who are above moral criticism, such as Joyce. His books are driven by
personal experience. When he wanted to write about infidelity, he covertly
urged his wife Nora towards an affair, but she saw through him. 'Jim wants
me to go with other men so that he can write about it,' she explained baldly
to the suitor he found for her, 'but I want only him.' Brenda Maddox's Nora
is a model of a biography which illuminates Joyce's work through a
fascinating account of two lives.
But at the other end of the spectrum are the more recent authors whose lives
happen to embody current political myths. The hijacking of Sylvia Plath, who
gassed herself in 1963 leaving bread and milk by her sleeping children, as
an early feminist icon, has prevented serious evaluation of her work beyond
those terms. Thus Ronald Hayman's 1991 study reads like a detective story
('had there been a suicide note? What had it said? . . . was it true that a
doll had been found . . . with pins stuck into it?') in which Plath's poems
are used to solve questions about her life.
Where Plath is the good girl, Larkin is the bad guy in the new Life stakes.
But both are badly served because appreciation of their work risks being
subsumed into tokenism. So when Larkin began to be seen - retrospectively -
as politically incorrect, a flurry of critics who had previously been
respectful suddenly called him a minor poet and there was a new hint of
dismissal from the literary establishment. This trend is not limited to the
literary world. Something similar happened, to the popular reputation of
Woody Allen; many fans vowed never to see another movie after revelations
that Allen had betrayed Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter.
Here is ideological revisionism in strong new form. It is a fearful and
irrational interpretation of the link between life and art. It masks an
intolerance of those we don't agree with, the suspicion of what is not the
moral fashion of the day. Enjoyment of Larkin's poetry or Allen's films does
not depend on the moral purity of their creators.
'Women who assist in realising the fantasies of Pinter/Osborne/Hughes in any
medium are in complicity with them and their crime,' say the Daughters of
Eve. But fantasies are not separatist sub-committees, and you can't
legislate over artistic inspiration, which is an haphazard, sub-conscious
amoral affair. Andrew Motion defends Larkin by saying that 'art exists at a
crucial distance from its creator'. Art is timeless and universal, and means
different things to different people in different ages, whereas an artist's
life is conditioned by his time, and by the morality of the moment when we
interpret it.
It may be true that Osborne has exploited his public image as the angry
young man of his plays and that this has made his later writing immature,
self-indulgent, vacuous: a casualty of his and our cult of the artist. But
William Burroughs is an equally powerful case: a writer whose morality few,
in any age, would share. He really did kill his wife - he shot her dead at a
party - yet the tragedy then inspired one of his best works, the magical
lyrics for the rock musical The Black Rider, about a marksman who shoots his
lover. The piece opened in 1990, and, as the most innovative of recent
musicals, has been a popular hit across Europe, while some of the poetry -
'I'll shoot the moon out of the sky for you' - seems likely to last beyond
its commercial success.
Artists rarely lead lives which we would call normal; how ironic, in our
tolerant, post-Freudian society, to criticise their work because they fail
an emotional health test. Artists have always stood on the edge of society:
loners like Larkin or radicals like Pinter or angst-ridden neurotics like
Allen. The paradox is that, from this position as outsiders they distil, in
art, experiences which we can all share - they touch the loner, the radical,
the neurotic in all of us. If we allow the straightjacket of conformity or
political correctness to tighten, we risk losing the richness of such
vision. It is an absurd and horrific form of censorship.
