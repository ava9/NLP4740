</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Samuel Beckett, whose "Waiting For Godot" and other tragicomic plays of 
brooding despair revolutionized 20th-Century theater, died in a Paris nursing 
home at the age of 83 and was buried today in strict secrecy, four days after 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
Editions de Minuit, the French publishing house that turned the spotlight on 
Beckett after printing "Waiting for Godot," said the death Friday of the 
Dublin-born dramatist had been kept quiet to respect his lifelong desire for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his wish," said the daughter of Jerome Lindon. Lindon published the 
enigmatic play in 1952, a year after agreeing to print one of Beckett's first 
novels, "Molloy," a difficult text turned down by established publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize-winning author was buried in Montparnasse cemetery beside his 
wife, Suzanne, who died last July. 
</P>
<P>
A pot of yellow flowers, a plant and a single candle stood on the gravestone 
after the funeral, a simple ceremony attended by a score of close friends, with 
no priest and no speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, gaunt writer never gave press interviews and refused to travel to 
Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
But the reclusive Irishman was a familiar figure in some of Paris' oldest 
literary cafes, especially the Closeries des Lilas, not far from his 
Montparnasse apartment and once a favorite haunt of figures such as Ernest 
Hemingway and V. I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett moved to France in 1937 after giving up a job as a university lecturer 
in Ireland and roaming Europe in a style reminiscent of the hobos who are 
featured in his later work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, he was stabbed by a man asking for money and rushed to a hospital by a 
young woman, a stranger who became his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beckett was influenced by his friend and fellow-countryman James 
Joyce, his sparse writing was the exact opposite. His tragicomic plays, colored 
with a brooding pessimism, cast aside conventional plot, time and characters. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of my work, there is nothing but dust," he once said. British 
theater critic Martin Esslin quoted him as saying: "I am an analyzer, trying to 
leave out as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Lindon, who has published 22 of Beckett's works, said in a recent interview 
that he took on the then obscure writer in the early 1950s because "I knew 
immediately he was one of the greatest writers of our time." 
</P>
<P>
His first encounter with Beckett's work was "one of the great moments of my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett wrote with equal ease in French or English, translating his own texts 
from one language to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting for Godot," the story of two tramps who wait for Godot, who never 
comes, has been translated into several dozen languages and influenced a 
generation of playwrights, including Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Edward 
Albee. 
</P>
<P>
At a nursing home where Beckett lived for most of the last 18 months, a 
spokeswoman said the writer never mentioned his wife's death. "It's not that he 
didn't care, but he never mentioned it," she said.
