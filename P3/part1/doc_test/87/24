Alcofribas Nasier: even his anagrammatical nom de plume has the smell of
drink about it. But there was a time, and there are still some places, where
Francois Rabelais was better known for thinking than for drinking. As the
sober-suited director of the Montpellier public library, Gilles Gudin de
Vallerin, said: 'The word 'rabelaisian' just does not suit him.'
The 500th anniversary of the birth of the author of Gargantua and Pantagruel
is being celebrated all over France - mischievously, because it is the
second such celebration in a decade. But French wine-growers, tourist
officers, politicians, visiting bibbers and buyers care little for the
latest scholarly consensus which says Rabelais was born in 1484, not 1494.
Their attitude is, as Rabelais might have said: 'You open the books; we'll
open the bottles.'
The pilgrim's path to the real Doctor Rabelais is littered with bottles.
This pilgrim's journey was launched during a convivial winter evening, from
a stone farmhouse at the top of a Yorkshire dale. Hanging on the wall was an
engraving of an equivalent stone farmhouse, La Deviniere, ('the soothsayer')
near Chinon in Touraine, the reputed place of Rabelais' birth.
La Deviniere stands on the upper slope of a wide and open valley,
overlooking fields of sunflowers and melons. The farmhouse bedroom is
reached by an outside stair under its own grey slate roof. In the corner is
a four-poster bed, hung in jute and linen drugget. Around the panelled walls
are illustrations by artists over the centuries of the five books of
Gargantua and Pantagruel; there is a piano score by Erik Satie and an
original Matisse sketch.
But the putative birthplace of Rabelais is overwhelmed - undermined, one
should say - by the magnificent rustic cellars below the house where wine
presses and other agricultural impedimenta have been set out in honour of
the secular saint of the vine. On their way out visitors are offered the
chance to buy a magnum of the local red. The label says 'Gargantua'.
A kilometre or so down the road sits the abbey of Seuilly where Rabelais and
his brothers may have been sent to school by their father, a Chinon notary
(or apothecary, or inn-keeper). It is also the place where, in the first
book, Friar John first appears defending the abbey close against the forces
of the King of Lerne. The abbey is closed now, and used as a conference
centre. But today someone had been busy: in the garden behind lay an immense
quill pen, 17 metres long, made of plywood, its white paint drying in the
sun. It was plainly the plume of Gargantua.
As his birthplace shows, Francois Rabelais was not a gentleman. But he was
certainly a scholar. Enrolled as a monk into the Franciscan order he
transferred to the more benign, modern regime of the Benedictines of
Maillezais where he set himself to learn Greek, then considered a shocking,
pagan language.
In early middle age, after a tour of the universities and a spell in Paris
learning to despise the medieval orthodoxy of the Sorbonne, he threw off his
monk's habit and descended on Montpellier in 1530 to enrol in the famous
medical school. It was one of the few places in Europe licensed to practise
the new art of anatomical dissection, or equipped to deal with the repulsive
consequences (as the present anatomical museum reminds us) of the new
plague: syphilis. Here in Montpellier the modern pilgrim was able to catch
up with him, thanks to a hazy organisation called Les Rencontres de
Dionysos, the creation of a whirling dervish of an Irish literary tippler,
Dr Redmond O'Hanlon, of University College, Dublin.
By means of a cunning combination of brain-work with gullet-work. O'Hanlon
had tempted a clutch of Rabelais specialists from France, England and the US
to a seminar called Rabelais et Dionysos; vin, carnaval, ivresse at the Paul
Valery university. The days were to be devoted to academic debate, the
nights to slaking the throat in the company of a succession of grateful but
bemused wine-growers in the surrounding hills of the Languedoc.
Evidence of Dr Rabelais' own reputation for extraordinary scholarship came
quickly to hand. Outside Montpellier, stands the beautiful Chateau de
Flaugergues owned by the viticulturist Count Henri de Colbert. Among the
16th and 17th century vellum-bound books in his library is a two-volume
history of Montpellier by a family ancestor, Charles Degrefeuille, published
in 1739. It contains the story of Rabelais' encounter with a certain
chancellor Duprat who was attacking the medical school's privileges.
According to legend, Rabelais opened his petition by addressing the
chancellor's secretary in Latin. When the secretary called a Latin
interpreter, Rabelais spoke to him in Greek. A Greek-speaker was summoned.
The doctor switched to Hebrew. A professor of Hebrew was unearthed and
Rabelais addressed him in Arabic. Finally, with a speech in Syriac - a form
of Aramaic used by some eastern churches - the doctor clinched the contest.
On hearing the story the chancellor was charmed and the privileges restored.
For this feat, Rabelais' portrait was placed in the hall of the school and
his doctor's robes thenceforward placed round the shoulders of each
graduate.
Rabelais took his medical degree within months of arriving in Montpellier
and went to practise at the Hotel Dieu hospital in Lyons, then the
intellectual capital of France. There he fathered a son, Theodule, and a
book Pantagruel. It was the beginning of his gross, great satire against
medieval, monkish scholasticism and hymn to the intellectual and sensual
liberation of Renaissance Man.
'Beuvez tousjours, ne mourrez jamais.' Was Rabelais drunk when he wrote?
Modern scholars say there is no evidence for it. Was he a boozer? If so, he
could hardly have held the post of doctor at Lyons or, later, as secretary
on important ambassadorial missions to Rome. But anyway, what constituted a
boozer in 16th century France?
Rabelais' prose, scholarly and vulgar, defined French as Chaucer's had
defined English, and poured out just at the moment when the printing press
was spreading. His heirs include Sterne and the modern French writer Georges
Perec - but above all James Joyce (though some find Joyce's wordplay anaemic
by comparison).
'People who love Rabelais with all their heart read him as if he'd written
the day before yesterday,' said Jean-Paul Sartre. The English novelist John
Cowper Powys called him the sanest of all great writers - and perhaps the
only sane one.
Over the years, Rabelais' work has been mined by marxists,
deconstructionists and other ideologues and mystics. Today, according to Dr
Richard Cooper of Oxford, there is no real controversy left. His fellow
participants in the Rabelais revels agreed that beneath the punning, insults
and obscenity, the doctor has a humanist message to convey - which is partly
why his books were condemned and censored.
That does not mean, however, that the academic playground has been entirely
stripped of rides. Prof Francois Rigolot of Princeton University kicked off
with a happy hour's discourse on rhetoric and ambiguity, taking as his text
Friar John's pun in Book I: service divin, service du vin.
Marie-Madeleine Fragonard, a professor from Montpellier, talked about
obscenity in the Renaissance. She explained how con might be traced back to
the Greek kuon (dog) and reappear in the German konig, and how the syllables
'cu' and 'ul' had ancient symbolic meanings, as shown by the names of
mythological heroes such as Mercury, Hercules and Bacchus.
Dr Carol Clark analysed the infant education of the giant Gargantua. What
was meant by the episode in which the ladies of Grand-gousier's court
squabble over the baby's enormous, inquisitive member? It was, she
suggested, from their eloquent banter that the infant was learning the
rhetorical style of a Renaissance prince. Once he was transferred to the
instruction of men Gargantua grew into a silent, hesitant adult.
For flights of Rabelaisian fancy there was none to match the gaunt and
passionate figure of Claude Gaignebet, an anthropologist from Nice.
Black-haired, grey-bearded and wild-eyed, with a battered volume of the
masterwork under his arm, Gaignebet is the last survivor of that school
which regards the five books as arcana, as riddles to be unpicked. His
device is to manipulate the calendar to expose the keys and clues to what he
says is the doctor's real persona, that of latter-day evangelist who reveals
the true history of the Christian religion. Gaignebet, with his immense
knowledge and exotic views, sometimes amuses, sometimes charms - and often
frightens - more orthodox experts.
Whatever Rabelais' true purpose, it is plain that he has been swallowed and
regurgitated by the voracious characters he created. It is his own fault.
Commercial lobbies shamelessly invoke the name of Rabelais (there are discos
and cafes named after him) yet it is the character of Gargantua that they
are celebrating.
When Jacques Blanc, president of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, stood
before the wine-growers of the Mediterranean in Narbonne and declared that
wine does not lead to alcoholism, merely to an ivresse of the heart and the
passions, he was talking in truly Rabelaisian fashion. But the scene before
him was gargantuan: 500 diners, already gorged on oysters and sparkling
wine, facing fresh fistfuls of cutlery, with seven glasses apiece waiting to
be filled, roaring their approval while teams of vignerons paraded on stage
in their medieval gowns to receive trophies in the shape of Silenus, the
goatish mythical father of Bacchus.
A few miles away stands the most eloquent memorial of all to the spirit of
Rabelais the devout, divine libertarian. Valmagne is a well-preserved gothic
abbey church of 1257, as high as the cathedral of Notre-Dame from which
Gargantua stole the bells. The monastery was confiscated from the
Cistercians at the time of the French Revolution and passed into private
hands. Apart from a statue of the Madonna holding a headless child and a
cross made of twisted vine root, the church has been stripped of devotional
trappings. In each bay that formerly housed a side-altar, stands a
40,000-litre wine barrel. There are 18 of these oak tuns in all for storing
the output of the vineyard. The empty church is cool but airy, the perfect
temperature. Service divin has become service du vin.
Rabelais, lawyer, doctor and writer died as a parish priest in Paris in
1553. He prescribed only one rule for his utopian (and co-educational)
monastery, the 9,332-room Abbey of Theleme which Gargantua built for the
heroic Friar John. It was: Do What Thou Wilt.
His instruction has been faithfully followed in this second-time-around
anniversary year. But who is to complain? Only, perhaps, those who are tired
of hearing the words 'rabelaisian' and 'gargantuan'. For there is another
adjective, one by which Rabelais better deserves to be remembered. It
denotes wisdom, generosity, curiosity, spontaneity, hospitality and
humanity. The word is pantagrueliste.
