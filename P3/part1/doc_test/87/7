After finishing the first chapter of Ulysses and embarking on the rest of the 
book, Karen Kenyon, author of "Joyce's Dublin" (May 7), will find that the 
novel offers many interesting spots worth visiting in and around the Dublin 
area. In fact, all of James Joyce's novels can be used as tour guides of 
turn-of-the-century Dublin. City parks, universities, pubs, libraries and 
government buildings discussed in the novels are still in existence, and 
visiting them brings an interesting life to the masterpieces in which they are 
featured. To discuss one building in one chapter in "Ulysses" hardly uncovers 
the mystique of touring Joyce's Dublin. Yet Joyce's novels are not simply tour 
guides of Dublin. His works are artistic masterpieces of style and form that 
have reshaped modern literature.
