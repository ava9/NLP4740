<P>
Mary McCarthy, a novelist and essayist who battled the intellectual elite and 
questioned the value of history and even the worth of the novel itself, died 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "The Company She Keeps," "Cast a Cold Eye," "The Oasis" and "The 
Group" -- probably her best known work -- was 77. She died at New York Hospital 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted a spokeswoman for Miss McCarthy's alma mater, 
Vassar College, who said the famed literary figure had been battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
With a steely pen and sharp tongue, Miss McCarthy touched a multitude of 
subjects in a career that began shortly after she was a Vassar student in the 
early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
There she had hoped to pursue a career in the theater but soon discovered she 
had no acting talent. She chose to write instead, and began reviewing books for 
the Nation and the New Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Even then her willingness to do battle was apparent as she became co-editor of 
a critical book about book critics. 
</P>
<P>
In a McCarthy biography, Doris Grumbach wrote that the McCarthy signature was 
to "attack in every direction, without concern for the barriers of established 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she turned out nine volumes of fiction and two classic books 
about the art and history of Venice and Florence, compiled reports from Saigon 
and Hanoi into two books and wrote of the trial of Capt. Ernest Medina, who 
ordered the destruction of My Lai in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Vietnam, she opined that "the worst thing that could happen to 
our country would be to win this war." 
</P>
<P>
She also produced works on Watergate, collected her essays on literature and 
theatrical criticism into several books and turned out memoirs and 
autobiographies. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote about subjects as diverse as the pretentious world of academia ("A 
Charmed Life") and terrorists ("Cannibals and Missionaries"). 
</P>
<P>
Her acidity touched four generations, including the current one. When asked in 
an interview for "Contemporary Authors" whether the women's movement had 
produced any distinguished writing, she answered simply "no." 
</P>
<P>
Although sometimes critical of Miss McCarthy for not stretching her own 
creative abilities further, Norman Mailer once called her "our first lady of 
letters." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Alfred Kazin, a chronicler of New York's Jazz Age intellectuals, Miss 
McCarthy had an "unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency 
in any literary effort and every person. To this weakness she instinctively 
leaped with cries of pleasure -- surprised that her victim, as he lay torn and 
bleeding, did not applaud her perspicacity." 
</P>
<P>
Although she first made her mark among the brawling New York intellectuals of 
the 1930s, she managed to reach a wider audience only in 1963 with her novel 
"The Group." 
</P>
<P>
The spicy best-selling chronicle of the lives of eight college graduates 
starting out in the 1930s was made into a movie in 1966 starring Candice 
Bergen, Joanna Pettet and Hal Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
More recently she touched a new generation in a celebrated literary feud with 
Lillian Hellman by declaring, on national television, "Everything she (Hellman) 
writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hellman sued for libel, but died in 1984 before the suit reached the trial 
which Miss McCarthy had eagerly sought. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her writing was autobiographical, beginning with "The Company She 
Keeps," published in 1942, a series of interconnected short stories about the 
people she knew in New York during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Memories of a Catholic Girlhood," published in 1957 and now considered a 
landmark in autobiographical writing, recounted her sordid childhood in 
Minneapolis, where she was brutally mistreated by relatives after her parents 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Miss McCarthy was born the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy and Therese 
Preston McCarthy, who died within a day of each other during the flu epidemic 
of 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, who was 6, and three younger brothers were entrusted to the care of Aunt 
Margaret and Uncle Meyers, whom their ward later described as sadistic and 
miserly guardians who dressed the children like paupers, fed them a diet of 
root vegetables, forbade reading and, at night, taped their mouths shut "to 
prevent mouth breathing." 
</P>
<P>
"How I Grew," published in 1987 as a sequel to "Memories," described her rescue 
at 11 by her maternal grandparents, who took her west to Tacoma, Wash., and 
enrolled her in the fashionable Annie Wright Seminary. The seminary, where the 
contrary student embraced atheism, prepared her for Vassar, where she hobnobbed 
with the bright, wealthy Eastern society girls she used as models for her 
characters in "The Group." 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Paris in 1962 and divided her time between a comfortable Left Bank 
apartment and her home in Castine, Me. In recent years, she occupied a creative 
writing chair at Bard College in Annadale-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
One week after graduation in 1933, she married Harold Johnsrud, an actor. The 
marriage was brief and in 1938, Miss McCarthy married her professor, the 
eminent critic Edmund Wilson, who encouraged her to write fiction. They had one 
son, Reuel, before a bitter divorce in which each accused the other of battery. 
</P>
<P>
She met her fourth husband, James West, while on a trip to Warsaw, divorced her 
third husband, Bowden Broadwater, and married West in Paris in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Miss McCarthy was often hailed as a feminist before her time. But she always 
refused that label, saying equality between the sexes was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to give more," she told an interviewer in 1987. Her belief was 
simple: women should learn to think for themselves and act accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of awards she won were the prestigious Edward McDowell Medal 
and the National Medal for Literature. In May, she was inducted into the 
American Academy of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Stock, in "Fiction and Wisdom," wrote that "though Mary McCarthy's 
novels are not all equally successful, each has so much life and truth . . . 
that it becomes a matter for wonder that she is not generally named among the 
finest American novelists of her period." 
</P>
<P>
Less sanguine was the author herself. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at age 74 on the eve of the publication of "How I Grew," she proved 
she could be as cold and hard on herself as she was of others. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a self-assessment, she replied: "Not favorable."
