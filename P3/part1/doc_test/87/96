CLUES TO CHANDLER'S TROUBLED LIFE

Dashiell Hammett in "The Maltese Falcon" gave the world Sam Spade and the 
private detective as a literary sub-genre. Then a curious and troubled figure 
named Raymond Chandler, in a short but blazing series of novels, extended the 
form and became the principal poet of all the knights in frayed trench coats 
walking alone down mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Chandler centenary was widely celebrated in 1988 and one of the events was 
a profile done for Melvyn Bragg's "The South Bank Show" on London Weekend 
Television. Produced and directed by David Thomas, edited and hosted by Bragg, 
"Raymond Chandler" gets its first U.S. showings tonight on Bravo cable at 5 and 
10. It will be shown again at the same hours on Nov. 24 and Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidently no footage on Chandler and only a handful of stills and 
family album pictures. To compensate, Thomas uses actor Robert Stephens to play 
Chandler and to read from his letters and essays. With his horn-rim glasses and 
center-parted hair, Stephens bears a close resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
Although born in Chicago, Chandler did most of his growing up in England after 
his father deserted the family and his mother returned to live with relatives 
in South London. He attended Dulwich College, to which Bragg's camera pays a 
charming visit. One of the dorms is called Marlowe and it seems inevitable that 
that's where Philip Marlowe got his name. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Chandler always felt more a displaced Englishman than a native 
American, although his command of the American vernacular was superb. In his 
early days in London, he wrote standard poetry and sharp-tongued reviews but 
could not make a living at either and ended up as a quite successful oil 
executive in Los Angeles until drinking cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
Adrift in middle age, he started writing for Black Mask and other pulp 
magazines and found what he should have been doing all along. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with his principal biographer Frank McShane, literary historian 
Matthew Broccoli, producer John Houseman, Robert Mitchum (who twice played 
Marlowe) and San Diego columnist Neil Morgan, an acquaintance during Chandler's 
last days in La Jolla, confirm what a troubled life he led. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, 17 years older than he, was an invalid for years. He never conquered 
his problems with alcohol and, after little more than a dozen years of 
brilliant productivity, Chandler seemed a burnt-out case. His last novel, 
"Playback," was not successful, and an uncompleted manuscript, "The Poodle 
Springs Story," lately completed as an homage by Robert B. Parker, had few 
traces of Chandler's earlier energy and bite. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "The Big Sleep," "Farewell My Lovely," "The High Window," "The Lady in the 
Lake" and "The Long Goodbye" may well be the most influential (e.g., imitated) 
body of work in American crime fiction. An impressive list of actors -- 
Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum, Dick Powell, Robert Montgomery, George Montgomery, 
Elliott Gould -- have played Marlowe. And the books as well as the films have 
introduced generations to Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Even now there are streets in Hollywood where the ghost of Marlowe seems to 
reside, although you look in vain for the drive-ins Marlowe used to pass on 
Ventura Boulevard, "offering food that would poison a toad." 
</P>
<P>
It is a melancholy documentary but inescapable for anyone who cares about crime 
fiction and its ongoing debt to Chandler.

private-eye novels, including "Farewell My Lovely," but they made him the most 
copied author in American crime fiction.
