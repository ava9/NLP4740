Nikolai Gogol (1809-52) wrote The Government Inspector in 1834 as a satire
on corrupt and craven bureaucrats in Czarist Russia. Now at the Tricycle
Theatre, the Dublin-Belfast theatre company Dubbeljoint has transplanted a
new version of the play to the peaty environs of county Ulster late last
century. At best it is a red-blooded bucolic show; but at worst, the
Inspector palls.
Gogol's classic of mistaken identity is a gift for situation comedy, ready
to be filled out by Marie Jones' rejigged version; and 19th-century Ireland
is a fine place for this drama of ossified class and parochial values. But
what emerges on stage is more knockabout than thinkabout.
A small provincial town, guilty as sin over a local beef swindle, has been
tipped off about an Inspector from the capital. The provincials paddling in
the peat bogs decide that a new stranger in town must be their man: 'He's
incognito' - 'No he's not, he's in the hotel.' The bemused stranger catches
on and milks a situation where the burghers feel obliged to laugh at his
jokes and ply him with bribes of sex and money. This faux-Inspector's
servant is convinced that Swift's Modest Proposal has been written into the
local bye-laws and that he is living amongst cannibals. Any mention of beef
sends him raving.
The harsh Irish accents make Gogol's jokes sound starkly aggressive instead
of lightly cynical. At the moment, everything is overdone; the squeamish
provincialism James Joyce found even in Dublin is flogged to death. The
actors try too hard, shout too much, and need to tone down.
But there are some delights: Dan Gordon's playing of the faux-Inspector, and
Eileen Pollock's (the Mayor's wife) sex-crazed delight at his arrival in her
house; Mark Lambert as the troubled Mayor is a chaotic presence, oscillating
between civic propriety and old-fashioned grovelling. Next time the
Inspector should be a Brussels functionary or GATT investigator. Pam
Brighton directs.
