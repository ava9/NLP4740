relieve traffic congestion

DUBLIN'S long-suffering commuters may soon find relief from the traffic that
chokes the city centre at rush hours. After years of prevarication over
public transport issues, a government green light is expected soon, for the
construction of a IPounds 500m (Pounds 463m) Light Rail Transit (LRT) system
for the city.
Detailed proposals are being drawn up for the project to be presented to the
EC Commission in the submission for the 1994-98 tranche of EC Structural
Funds (ESF) for Ireland.
Ireland is anticipating a doubling of ESF payments to some IPounds 6bn in
the next tranche, and rail systems for Dublin and nationally are top
priorities for funding.
Mr Dick Doyle, an economic adviser to transport minister Seamus Brennan,
said: 'The minister is very strongly behind the (LRT) plan. It has
cross-party support and the Dublin councillors are behind it.'
He said that 50-75 per cent capital funding by the EC would be required, but
that the system would then be able to operate without subsidies.
Major contracts will be up for grabs for engineering works, rolling stock
and even operation of the system itself. At least five different proposals
have been submitted to Mr Brennan for consideration since he first made
public the government's interest last year.
These include proposals from GEC in the UK, Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swedish-Swiss group, Annsaldo in Italy and Aer Rianta in Ireland.
Professor Simon Perry, the Dean of Engineering at Trinity College Dublin,
and the man who co-ordinates the Irish Universities Transport Studies Group
(IUTSG) says that an LRT system is 'ideally suited for Dublin's problems'.
'It is light enough to be laid on top of existing roads, can use existing
rail routes, and is less likely to have its routes blocked by car traffic
than alternatives such as guided buses'.
Route blockage is already a big problem for Dublin's 800 buses in the
narrower of the city's Georgian streets.
Dublin's city centre, is bounded on three sides by two canals that arc
around to join the River Liffey, which flows through the centre.
This boundary, known as the inner cordon, forms a rough circle with a radius
of a mile-and-a-half.
Into this seven square-mile area, containing some 27 bridges, 55,000 cars
stream every day, reducing traffic flows to a crawl during the rush hour.
Serious bottlenecks occur not only at the bridge crossings over the river
and canals, but at most road junctions in and out of the city.
A 10-mile car trip from an outer suburb can take over an hour during peak
traffic flows The Dublin Bus company estimates that, even with the existing
bus lane system, its vehicles are slowed to average speeds of less than 3
miles per hour inside the inner cordon during rush hours. Car ownership in
Ireland is increasing by some 3 per cent a year.
Most of the city's present traffic problems can be traced back to two
transport studies completed more than 20 years ago: one by a Professor Miles
Wright, and the other by the Dublin Corporation.
Both studies envisaged an increasing role for road-based private transport
and planned four 'satellite' towns to the west of Dublin to disperse
housing, factories and offices and ease traffic congestion to the centre.
The centre and these new urban suburbs were to be linked together by a new
100-km network of motorways.
Professor Wright wrote at the time: 'There is every sign that Irishmen, as
sturdy individuals and democrats, will wish to use their cars fully.'
A road-based transportation strategy, relying on the private motor car, thus
became embodied in successive Dublin Corporation transport policies. Public
transport was relegated to a secondary role, the only exception being the
building of a commuter rail line, known as the Dart, which serves the
coastal suburbs north and south of the city.
The problem, however, was that as the new western satellite towns grew up,
jobs did not grow at the same pace, and most of the transport infrastructure
plans remain to be implemented. The result has been that since 1967, the
proportion of people using public transport to enter the city centre has
fallen from 54 per cent in 1967 to only 34 per cent today.
In areas served by the Dart however, commuters still prefer to use public
transport. Indeed it has been the Dart's success, run by Irish Rail, which
has largely led to the government to finally consider an LRT system as a
long-term solution for the capital's traffic problems.
According to Professor Perry, the first phase of a commercial LRT system
could be built relatively cheaply and quickly using old abandoned railway
routes. 'What existed in terms of rail-based corridors are still there,
mostly with the right-of-way intact, and lend themselves ideally for a
modern system' he said. The first phase, linking the major southern suburbs
to the city centre would cost some IPounds 150m, he said.
