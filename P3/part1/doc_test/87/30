THE LETTERS OF ARTHUR BALFOUR AND LADY ELCHO 1885-1917 edited by Jane Ridley
and Clayre Percy Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 370 pages
THE correspondence between Arthur Balfour and Mary Elcho has had a migratory
career. The confidential letters which they wrote to each other for more
than 50 years - or such of them as remain, for some were burnt, others have
pages torn away, or made illegible by heavy deletions - were sent from
Whittingehame, Balfour's home, to the British Museum, and then, at the
request of Mary Elcho's family, were returned to Stanway, the house where
most of them were written. There they were stored away. Because many of the
letters are private in character, and some marked 'Burn' or 'Destroy', I
doubted whether they would ever be published.
That they now appear is a bonus, for Mary Elcho's writings are a delight.
She was the most endearing of the female 'Souls', that group of high
spirited friends so starry in their youth, and sadly quenched by the tragedy
of the Great War. A natural writer if a little discursive, she has a
delicious spontaneity in describing the happiness of her daily life - her
beloved children, her Chows, ('How I love Fluffkins, Puffkins'), and merry
life at Stanway with her many guests. She always writes with affection and
sometimes emotion; her letters during the Great War are the most poignant I
have read.
Balfour's replies are coolly factual: they consist of timetables of his
activities, updated reports on his almost perpetual ailments, and lists of
dazzling 'social engagements.' 'Now you have my diary disguised as a
letter,' he once wrote. His cautious pages are filleted of all feeling - and
yet the relationship between himself and Mary is always present, tense like
a coiled spring.
Mary Elcho had always wanted to marry Arthur Balfour since they first met,
when she was 17 and he was 31. Mary was beautiful, intelligent, and her
vivacity attracted many suitors. When she was 21 she married Hugo Elcho, a
clever, droll character, keen on gambling on shares and horses. Like many
men of his class and time, he sought glamorous mistresses and had a long
liaison with the Duchess of Leinster, considered the greatest beauty of her
age. However, he and Mary both appreciated each other and loved their seven
children.
Eight years before he met Mary, Balfour had fallen in love with May
Lyttelton, a pretty, high-spirited girl who may not have been aware of his
feelings and had been engaged to another man. At her sudden death in 1875,
Balfour placed his mother's emerald ring in her grave and with it, so he
told his friends, his heart. Soon afterwards he communicated with her
through mediums, and was to receive affectionate spirit messages from her
until he died.
When Charlotte Gere and I were writing on the Souls 10 years ago, we had the
immense good fortune to be welcomed by Lady Elcho's two surviving daughters,
Lady Plymouth and Lady Mary Lyon. They absolutely adored their mother, who
had, in Souls parlance, given them a golden childhood. They had both known
Balfour well. It was they who, in great distress, withdrew the letters from
the British Museum after a biographer of Balfour had quoted from them to
establish that Balfour and Mary were lovers. (My one reservation about this
otherwise well edited book is the publication of letters not meant to be
preserved; that they survive at all is probably due to Balfour's inertia.)
The affectionate artlessness of Mary's letters was, they saw, vulnerable to
misinterpretation, and her frequent use of nursery language, such as 'I'll
box your ears,' or 'You deserve a good spanking' should be taken lightly and
not interpreted as any kind of chastisement. They were adamant that Mary and
Balfour had never been lovers in the accepted sense; that their relationship
was platonic, and that Balfour had always told Mary that the true romance of
his life was May Lyttelton.
After reading all the letters, I am convinced that their opinion is right.
What does emerge is a mutual affection that hovers between romance and
friendship, and as sustained by Mary's romantic yearnings and memories;
'Twenty years ago we walked arm in arm together, and you came to dinner, and
saw me in a low gown, and told me I had a jolly throat.'
Mary was deeply in love with Balfour, and Laura Tennant spoke of her
'weaponless worship.' In 1887 it seemed that Balfour might reciprocate her
feelings. He was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland and just before he
left for Dublin, he and Mary met at his house in Carlton Gardens where
occurred 'a small very private and personal incident . . . first kiss (gear
changing),' recalled Mary two decades later.
Such an episode was tentative; later there were kisses and caresses and
nothing more; whether this was due to Balfour's moral scruples, or the fear
of commitment, or even the hazard of a child we will never know. Or was he,
in the end, being faithful to the memory of May Lyttelton? Lady Randolph
Churchill said of Balfour that he 'liked to stir up emotional warmth, to
love, and to be loved, but that he was unmasculine  - not homosexual - just
a man who liked a lot of smoke and rather little fire.' She understood him
well, and, as an American, she was a good observer of the vagaries of love
in a very cold climate.
