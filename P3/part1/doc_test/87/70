The recent bombing in Co Tyrone has given a sad, topical edge to Sean
O'Casey's 1923 The Shadow of a Gunman at Leicester. The production carries
its topicality with great tact; it makes the play's issues current yet
preserves the historical moment which O'Casey recorded.
O'Casey based this play, originally On The Run, around a series of raids on
republican 'safe houses' in north Dublin over the Easter weekend, 1921.
O'Casey had links with the IRA through his secretaryship of one of its
constituents, the Irish Citizen Army; and since 1920 the IRA had been
conducting insurgency operations. O'Casey was staying in a dilapidated
Georgian house raided by British forces; he was untouched, but another
tenant was taken away under suspicion of manufacturing bombs.
That real life incident survives in Shadow: a poet and a travelling salesman
share a room in a republican tenement; other inmates drift in and develop
the nationalist cause from various positions: labourers, landlords and
shopgirls. The house is raided, and explosives found in a girl's room.
What emerges is a play about how people make political belief intimate with
their lives, about degrees of activism. O'Casey jokes coolly, bringing the
troubles back home: 'a land mine exploding under your bed is the only thing
that would lift you out of it.' Elsewhere the play's tone alters to a
resigned shrug at the state of Ireland: 'After a bit, a gunman throws a bomb
as carelessly as a schoolboy throws a snowball.' Shadow has the excitement
of Conrad's Secret Agent and the tenderness of Joyce's Dubliners.
Paul Kerryson's scrupulous direction meets the technical demands levied by
O'Casey's staging notes: the poet 'bears upon his body the marks of the
struggle for existence and the efforts towards self expression' and is well
interpreted by John McCormack. Russell Dixon as the salesman, all blarney
and belief, turns in a natural, easy performance, as does Angela Clerkin as
a lovestruck girl willing to hide explosives in her room. Denis Quilligan is
a model of unvarnished respectability as a worried tenant appealing to the
IRA to resolve a domestic broil.
The set follows O'Casey to the letter, creating a decayed room with
collapsible beds; but Charles Cusick-Smith's design successfully
incorporates a bright mural in a rural idyll spattered with blood.
Shadow of a Gunman closed after three nights at The Abbey Theatre, Dublin in
1923. The first night box office was 13. The Irish Times wanted less tragedy
and more satire from the play to increase its longevity. But 70-odd years
on, its plain disillusionment has assumed an aspect of inevitability: 'I
believe in the freedom of Ireland, and that England has no right to be here,
but I draw the line when I hear the gunmen blowin' about dying for the
people, when it's the people that are dyin' for the gunmen'.
