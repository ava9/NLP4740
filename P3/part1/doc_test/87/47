A hundred years ago, an Oxford don asked a mother if he might photograph her
three daughters. 'What I like best of all,' he wrote, 'is to have two hours
of leisure time before me, one child to photograph and no restrictions as to
costume . . . I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked (but,
if the worst comes to the worst, and you won't concede any nudities, I think
you ought to allow all three to be done in bathing drawers, to make up for
my disappointment).'
This was Lewis Carroll, a respected academic, addressing the prim wife of
another Oxford fellow. Was the famous children's writer a Victorian
innocent, or was he a 19th-century Humbert Humbert, driven by forbidden
desires, drawing the guileless into his web?
Tomorrow, Alice's Adventures Under Ground, a new play about the darker side
of the great storyteller, opens at the National Theatre. Written by
Christopher Hampton, author of the successful 1980s drama Les Liaisons
Dangereuses, and directed by the radical choreographer Martha Clarke, it is
based on intimate letters and diaries and fixes on Carroll's own dangerous
liaisons with little girls.
This is the most sensational aspect of Carroll's life. Biographers have
always fought shy of it, while passages in Carroll's diary casting light on
the troubled side of such friendships were altered or torn out after his
death. But it is an issue which not only lies at the heart of the creation
of the Alice books. It also raises topical questions about what makes adults
write children's books at all, and about how adult fantasies mould a
society's vision of childhood, and so condition children's rights and lives.
Carroll grew up in the 1830s, when the Victorian cult of childhood was
beginning to grip the nation. It was an English phenomenon - compare the
simpering innocence of Dickens's girl heroines, or Tess of the
d'Urbervilles, or Little Buttercup with their worldly European counterparts
like Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, Carmen - and it was rooted in Victorian
repression of sex.
This made pre-sexual girls an obvious focus. Many famous Victorians fell for
them - Ruskin wrote love letters to a nine-year-old, the vicar-diarist
Francis Kilvert rhapsodised about girlish thighs and buttocks, and Lewis
Carroll was fixated with little Alice Liddell.
In our post-Freudian age, the sexual undercurrents seem blatant and these
friendships unhealthy. The truth was more ambiguous. A man like Carroll
loved children instead of women because they were safely pure and thus
sexually undemanding. He found in them a focus for emotional satisfaction
which never threatened his ideal of chastity. His love probably had
something of the sexual frisson of a schoolgirl crush; it fuelled the
imagination but was never meant to be realised.
Carroll turned his obsession into a new form of literature. For Alice
Liddell, he wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and gave it to her for
Christmas 1865. It was a hit in the nursery because it was funny, amoral and
dismissive of adults. It was a hit with parents because it recreated the
lost imagination of childhood. These two features made it the first
children's classic. Its mix of subversion and nostalgia has shaped every
children's book written since.
Carroll was a stuttering bachelor mathematician whom a buttoned-up society
pushed into real eccentricity. He was thin as a stick and stiff as a poker,
he said and ate little, and listed his faults as 'indulging in sleep in the
evening'. He fled instantly from any gathering where his children's books
were mentioned, yet spent several weeks a year on the beach at Eastbourne,
carrying a supply of safety pins with which to persuade pre-pubescent girls
to hitch up their skirts and paddle in the sea.
Carroll disciplined his emotional self into non-existence, then poured his
vengeful frustration into fantasy. The Alice books, where an untouchable
little girl keeps aloof from the threats of sensuous, violent,
uncontrollable figures like the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, depend
on a distaste for sexuality. The dream of the Wonderland garden suggests a
guilt-free Eden before the Fall.
After Carroll, these echoes began to sound through children's books and give
the genre its mythic, lasting appeal. By the 1900s Freudian undertones came
close to the surface. Peter Pan is about the triumph of a sexless boy over
the masculine, virile Captain Hook, marked by the phallic symbols of
twitching iron hook and fat cigar. Barrie, too, liked children, not women;
his marriage was unconsumated and his Neverland, where no one grows up, is
another prelapsarian wonderland. So is the riverbank of The Wind in the
Willows: Kenneth Grahame told president Roosevelt that the book was 'clean
of the clash of sex'.
By the 1950s, the cult of children was being replaced by the cult of
adolescence, but Carroll's Victorian idealisation of childhood still held
sway. A novel like Lolita is a teenage descendant of Alice in the aura of
innocence surrounding the abused heroine, in the surreal wonderland of
American highways and motels, in Nabokov's wordplay.
After the Bible and Shakespeare, Carroll is the most quoted author in
English. His letters to little girls are little-known, but their liquid flow
of emotion and badgering sentiment - 'I send you seven kisses, to last a
week'; 'Haven't I a right to be affectionate if I like?' - complement the
rigour of Alice. They suggest the link between adult fantasies and fears,
and great children's writing.
Martha Clarke has long specialised in evoking the world of fantasy, and
theatre, which can more effectively win sympathy for different perspectives,
is perhaps a better place than biography to explore this touchy side to
Carroll's story.
In Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Hampton staged a historical reconstruction
which also reflected the pleasure-seeking, 1980s me-generation. Alice's
Adventures Under Ground - Carroll's original title, rejected because it
sounded like 'a lesson book about mines' - is just right for the
self-doubting, child-obsessed politically correct 1990s. It should provoke,
as Liaisons did, literary, historical and social debate.
*Jackie Wullschlager's book 'Inventing Wonderland', about the lives of Lewis
Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, will be published by Methuen next spring.
