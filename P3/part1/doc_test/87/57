The Story of Charles Steward Parnell and
Irish Nationalism
By Robert Kee
Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20, 659 pages
Charles Stewart Parnell was either nervous about covering his tracks or a
master of cool detachment. From a hotel in Paris - just as British prime
minister William Gladstone appeared on the brink of embracing Home Rule for
Ireland - the Irish nationalist leader wrote three letters to his secret
lover, Mrs Katharine O'Shea.
They were, says Robert Kee in his biography of Parnell, matter-of-fact;
obsessed with 'his cold, his vest and the taking of Turkish baths'. Yet
Parnell was in an 'extraordinary' situation. On temporary release from
prison for his nephew's funeral in 1882, 'he had, only a few days before,
been reunited for a day and a night with the woman he loved so passionately
that it seemed at times as if nothing else would ever be of importance to
him again'. Their two-month-old child, whom he had just seen for the first
time, was desperately ill and might die while he was away.
More than a century later, such self-confidence and ability to look beyond
the immediate political fray is sorely needed, as Albert Reynolds and John
Major, the Irish and British prime ministers, discuss the future of the six
counties that make up Northern Ireland.
Parnell's great achievement was to give the majority of Irish people a sense
of unity and purposefulness that eventually propelled the larger portion of
the country towards independence. But his story is one of tragedy - for him
personally, when his career crashed amid the scandal of his affair with Mrs
O'Shea, and for Ireland, because never was the time more propitious for a
relatively peaceful resolution of the Irish 'problem' than in the 1880s.
Parnell's legacy was an intensified defensiveness among northern Ireland
Protestants - few of whom were nationalists - that has scarcely diminished,
and the mobilisation of supporters of Ulster's union with the UK.
Nationalists now are split between supporters of IRA paramilitaries and of
constitutional politics; between those who overtly want unification and
those, particularly in the south, who regard it as financially and
politically impossible.
Parnell's strategy was two-pronged. First, he built up an Irish Home Rule
party at Westminster that, because of its size and expertise in
obstructionist tactics, had to be heard by Liberal and Tory governments.
Second, he knitted the strands of Irish nationalism. He acquiesced to the
violent tactics of Fenian extremists but without explicitly supporting them.
He combined land reform and nationalist movements and often fudged the
meaning of 'home rule' - whether it meant an Irish parliament subordinate to
Westminster or a clean break with the UK. He was imprisoned by the British
as part of their efforts to maintain order.
Admittedly Parnell's task in respect of Ulster was easier than that of his
modern counterparts. Though there were riots in Belfast in protest at
possible home rule, the nine counties then comprising the province were less
overwhelmingly unionist. And there were 400,000 Protestants living elsewhere
in Ireland - including Parnell himself - which strengthened the argument for
treating Ireland as a whole.
Nevertheless, Parnell's career was a balancing act requiring considerable
astuteness. A setback was the murder by nationalist extremists of the chief
secretary to Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his under-secretary, T H
Burke, in Dublin's Phoenix Park soon after Parnell's return from Paris. The
revulsion in Britain delayed debate on home rule.
But just as Major recently denied talking to the IRA while contacts were
continuing, Parnell had a channel of private communication with Gladstone
via Mrs O'Shea, who wrote copious letters to Downing Street.
A more serious problem than the killings was his private life. Kee's book
tests carefully many of the myths surrounding Parnell and Mrs O'Shea. (Did a
rose really fall from her bodice for him to rescue on their first meeting?
Kee is not convinced. Certainly she was never called 'Kitty' by friends, as
many suppose.) But he does not disappoint, providing a racy account of
flights via fire escapes and the circumstantial evidence to suggest that her
husband - Captain William O'Shea, also an Irish nationalist MP - knew for
many years of the relationship. Kee's description of Parnell is of a
character bordering on the improbable: incredibly he despised the colour
green, used in nationalist emblems.
Such was Parnell's affection for Mrs O'Shea, believes Kee, that he was eager
for a deal with Gladstone so he could retire to Eltham, south London, where
she lived near her elderly Aunt Ben, who was not allowed to know of the
affair lest she should cut off her niece from a rich inheritance.
When Captain O'Shea divorced his wife after Aunt Ben's death, all these
deceptions could no longer be maintained. Parnell misjudged the scale of
outrage, particularly in predominantly Catholic Ireland, and underestimated
his own fallibility as a politician. In the tense months that followed, his
party split and the momentum behind its cause was lost. A year later Parnell
died of a coronary thrombosis.
Where Kee fails is in providing an assessment of Parnell's place in Irish
history. Even without his sudden downfall, the course of events might have
been little changed. Opposition to home rule in the Commons and Lords was
deep-seated. Parnell seemed prepared to accept an Irish parliament with
limited powers that would have been unacceptable to many Irish. Thirty years
and much bloodshed followed before the Irish free state was established.
Northern Ireland is still gripped by near civil war. There never seems an
ideal time for the Irish to determine their fate peacefully.
