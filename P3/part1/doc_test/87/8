'AN AGED man is but a paltry thing . . .' wrote WB Yeats. That surely was
not true of his brother Jack the painter who died at the ripe old age of 85
in 1957, active as an artist to the end. 'His last drawing,' his biographer
Hilary Pyle tells us was done 48 hours before his death, 'a tiny gay
swirling sketch of two roundabout ponies'.
Jack Yeats was in his sixties when he painted some of the great works on
which his reputation rests and which may now be located through use of the
three volumes of the definitive catalogue of his work in oil. It has been
compiled in the wake of her biography of the artist (1970, revised edition
1989) by Hilary Pyle.
Yeats was acclaimed in 1945 by the Irish art critic Thomas MacGreevy as
Ireland's greatest painter - 'the national painter', he affirmed 'in the
sense that Rembrandt and Velasquez and Watteau were national painters'.
While not wholly disagreeing, Samuel Beckett - also a passionate admirer -
jibbed at the attempt to confine Yeats's genius within nationalistic
boundaries.
'He is', wrote Beckett, 'with the great of our time, Kandinsky and Klee,
Ballmer and Bram van Velde, Rouault and Braque, because he brings light, to
the issueless predicament of existence, reduces the dark where there might
have been, mathematically at least, a door'.
Is such rhetoric more relevant to Beckett's plays than to Yeats's painting?
Extravagantly phrased as the encomium is, some of the colour plates of the
late oil paintings reproduced here go far to justify it. Yeats began as an
illustrator, working as a young man for Punch and other journals, turning to
water-colours and drawings, and then into a bold fluent exponent of the
medium of oil.
His late manner is as different from the work of his youthful period as is
Dubliners from Finnegans Wake. He moved in 1917 to Ireland from England
where he was born and lived there for the rest of his time. He loved the
landscape and the country people in whose life he found an inexhaustible
vein of inspiration. His work was rich in studies of the Irish landscape
with its rivers, sea, cliffs and beaches.
In his old age these natural forms with the human and animal figures that
inhabit them are transformed by a luminous palette richly applied to give us
a transcendental vision. Yeats's closest kinship - in his maturity - is with
the chromatic canvases of Turner and the apocalyptic fugues of Kokoshka.
His painting 'Tinkers' Encampment; The Blood of Abel' (1940) has a crimson
patch of blood in the foreground lit up by a small girl in blue with a
torch. Figures of men and donkeys are converging on it from the crowded camp
sited on a mountainous strip on the far side of a river. Painted during the
Second World War, it was the closest Yeats ever came to a direct political
statement.
More typical of the late manner is 'Come' in which a farmer stretches out
his arms beckoning a horse towards him. Man and beast are shown linked in a
strange, wild amity.
Yeats bore witness in his paintings and his eccentric fictional writings to
the survival of that romantic Ireland which his brother lamented was dead
and gone. He produced a fine set of illustrations for Synge's The Aran
Islands. But the most frequent subjects in the vast body of work now
catalogued are horses. There are times when Yeats makes Munnings seem like
an amateur.
When the Irish Free State evolved WB Yeats became a senator, 'a smiling
public man', Jack remained a republican; but although the brothers diverged
in their affiliations, their admiration and support for each other's art
never wavered.
Pyle has been both thorough and scholarly. It was the greatest stroke of
luck that the dealer Waddington had a gallery in Dublin and discovered Yeats
comparatively early. Yeats had his first exhibition with Waddington in 1943,
and stayed with him for the rest of his career. This catalogue, for which
the Waddington Gallery has provided much of the information, is inscribed in
Victor Waddington's memory.
