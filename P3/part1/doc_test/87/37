The newly formed Trinity Theatre opens its first program with a blast of 
unaccompanied Irish singing -- first in Gaelic, then in English -- by a woman 
named Jacintha Friel. Wearing a warm shawl, warbling her plaintive tunes, she 
transports her listeners across the water. 
</P>
<P>
Next up on the program, titled "Voices From Joyce" and "Hughie," is Matthew 
Sullivan's thoughtful recitation of the last great speech from James Joyce's 
"The Dead" -- which filmgoers heard last year in the closing minutes of John 
Huston's film of the same name. Sullivan's delivery is beautifully clear and 
understated. 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said for Maria Hayden's performance of a monologue that Joyce 
wrote for Anna Livia in "Finnegan's Wake." Although director Jim Kerrigan 
places it into context in a brief introduction "so you're not totally lost by 
the inaccessibility of it," most listeners won't be able to make heads or tails 
of it. Hayden's stance and voice are full of oomph -- and the piece is fairly 
short. But generally this is language that should be read (with footnotes), not 
recited. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene O'Neill's one-act "Hughie" follows intermission, picking up on the same 
theme (the "shades" among us) as the excerpt from "The Dead." Kerrigan's 
gambler is properly scruffy, but he swallows too many words and his morose 
moments lack weight. As the night clerk (who says he hailed from Ireland, 
instead of the text's Saginaw), Sean O'Connor is blissfully bored by Kerrigan's 
patter. But he doesn't support the man's sudden change of mood near the end of 
the play.
