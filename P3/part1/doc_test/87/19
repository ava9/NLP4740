Like many another, I love the Gate Theatre, and my love is mixed with both
gratitude and wonder. Gratitude, because no single theatre has done more to
extend my ken of world drama. Wonder, because it is tiny and stages its
marvels on a shoestring without being able to pay its performers. Imagine,
those of you who have not ventured there, what it is to climb upstairs above
a Notting Hill pub and to discover a real masterpiece - a masterpiece of
which you had not even heard - of modernist/Romantic/baroque/Renaissance
drama, vividly performed. Yes, riches in an upper room; blessed poverty.
Now, after some months' closure, it is slightly less poky. Even the stairs
seem wider. The foyer has been enlarged, and is now a handsome deep crimson;
and the auditorium (where the stage used to be) has wider rows, seating 132
instead of 56, while the stage (where the audience used to be) is better
equipped; and I am told stage and audience areas are reversible. Backstage,
technical and box-office facilities are all said to be improved; and air
conditioning has been installed. Not all is yet perfect; on press night
offstage noise was more audible than before. But an invaluable theatre has
been altogether strengthened.
The Gate keeps extending our range by extending its own. It re-opens with a
season of 20th-century world theatre, and first with Ramon Maria del
Valle-Inclan's 1924 play Bohemian Lights. Though plays by Valle-Inclan have
been performed in London before, he is still scarcely known here. In Spain,
however, a white scarf is draped around his statue in Madrid each year; and
he really must be good, because the press release says that Michael
Billington calls him 'the most pioneering Spanish dramatist of this
century'. But . . .
Unfortunately, poor Valle-Inclan (d. 1936) here has been elbowed out of the
way by translator David Johnston and designer Richard Hudson - who both seem
to insist 'I am the ballerina of this show.' The play is a grotesque
post-Goya vision of the Madrid he knew, torn by civil disturbance, as
reimagined by a blind and drunk poet on the last night of his life.
Johnston, however, has transferred it firmly into the Ireland of 1915 - so
firmly that it is often impossible to tell what the Spanish original could
have been like.
I can take (say) Phedre translated into the India of the British Raj,
because it is easy to find the more traditional Phedre. Valle-Inclan, by
contrast, is a rare bird in this country; and the folk who have just
introduced me to his work have made him out to be an alternative James Joyce
writing on a highly specific view of Dublin.
Yet the real virtuoso turn is Richard Hudson's set, which has neither Madrid
nor Dublin on its mind. It has windows within doors, cupboards within doors,
doors within doors; it has trapdoors, and a grave; and what its ceiling does
in Act Two nearly gets a round of applause. Its rectangular proscenium area
is skewed at an angle of 20 degrees; it has a raised midground, and a lower
rear area; plus an ascending curtain. It is also covered with handwritten
prose which not infrequently distracts from the play. Too bad they did not
give it a curtain-call of its own; it probably could have done a dance.
The director, the usually exemplary Lawrence Boswell (artistic director of
the Gate), must take blame for these two over-clever top-layers.
Nonetheless, he honours Johnston's Irish version, and fleshes it out with a
cast of 18. Bohemian Lights, when you can concentrate on it (mainly in the
final hour), is full of irony about its protagonist: he is a blind man who
is all vision, a drunkard who is a poet, a family man who roams the streets.
In a final blaze, he talks of distorting the traditional classical vision in
a hall of mirrors - by looking at the world through the bottom of a glass
tankard.
But his drunkenness here, and his vision, become so specifically Irish, and
the play becomes so much about the troubles of Dublin in 1915 - with Yeats
present as a character, and people referring to Parnell and Ulster - that we
lose track of Valle-Inclan's intention and get caught up instead in the
politics and sociology of Ireland. Most of the acting, led by Tony Rohr and
Ray Callaghan as the poet and his croney, is excellent; but much of the
speaking is too loud. The intensity of delivery does not lead us into the
play, but creates another barrier between it and us.
At the Gate, W11, until October 23
