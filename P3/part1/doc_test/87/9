BARBARA TUCHMAN WAS SEEN WHERE IT COUNTED

"If a man is a writer," Barbara Tuchman once said, "everybody tiptoes around 
past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female 
housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not 
professional.' " 
</P>
<P>
When she died Monday, Barbara W. Tuchman had won two Pulitzer Prizes and had, 
at the age of 77, yet another book, "The First Salute" on the best-seller 
lists. But Tuchman was still very much a part of the locked-door theory of 
education and knowledge. She didn't have a Ph.D. She had used that time slot in 
her early life to marry a nice man and produce three children. By this harmless 
(some might even say productive) activity, she had rendered herself invisible 
to the history Establishment. She worked steadily, did reams of research, wrote 
marvelously readable books, but the more she did, the more "they," the guys 
inside the ivy-covered walls, couldn't/wouldn't see her. . . . 
</P>

Well, it's nothing new. In 1928, beside herself with exasperation, Virginia 
Woolf lectured about the locked doors of the university system. She conjured up 
the fictional university of "Oxbridge," where women might hang around on the 
margins of things but still might not take a degree. She railed at male 
academics who thought they had it nailed; who thought they controlled the 
knowledge, the culture, of the time. So furious was she that she fell back on 
the time-honored female occupation of making fun of how those scholars looked: 
". . . Others, though not past middle age, seemed creased and crushed into 
shapes so singular that one was reminded of those giant crabs and crayfish who 
heave with difficulty across the sand of an aquarium." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Woolf went on to be a very famous novelist whose books are still in 
print, while few of those on the faculties of Oxford and Cambridge from that 
time (which remember, in those days, she was not allowed to attend), are 
remembered by anyone at all. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, a lowly British journalist named Brenda Maddox visited the 
preeminent James Joyce scholar, Richard Ellmann, in his Oxford digs, 
respectfully asking if he thought there might be material for a book on Nora 
Barnacle, Joyce's wife. Ellmann said no, Nora wasn't important, and besides, he 
was a Ph.D. and he'd already done a book. But Maddox went on, wrote her book 
(which won a passel of prizes) and incidentally uncovered a raft of Joyce 
letters that the great scholar had suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
Whew! Lucky for everybody that Brenda Maddox was locked out, not the owner of a 
Ph.D., to all intents and purposes invisible. Otherwise, somebody might have 
gotten embarrassed. Just as, when Barbara Tuchman wrote "March of Folly," 
taking as her subject the "wooden-headed" errors committed by men in leadership 
positions, all the way down through history from Troy to Vietnam, some men in 
current power might have taken offense (or God forbid!) even changed their 
ways, except that Tuchman was locked out, degreeless, still invisible, even 
with both her Pulitzer Prizes, her secure niche on the best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, by the way, is about men and women. It is about systems of "Us" 
and "Them." When I was a first-grader at St. Dominic's Elementary School, the 
nuns taught us that the whole world was divided into Catholics and 
non-Catholics. (That system, so convenient in the first grade, ceased to apply 
when our age hit double digits.) Armenians, historically beset upon from all 
sides, have evolved a system of Armenians ("Us") and "Odars" (everybody else). 
In public America, the system has narrowed down and narrowed down; our world 
has become a place of momentous conflict between Some Guys. For the working 
classes, it's the Rams and Raiders crashing into each other on Sunday 
afternoons, with multiple injuries, and winners and losers. (And "invisible" 
ladies: cheerleading if they're young, making Super Bowl buffets if they've 
already borne children.) For intellectuals, our world is pretty much described 
and defined to us by White Guys, usually from the American East. Some of them 
own toupees; some have earned Ph.D.s. They're very nice, by and large, until 
somebody tries to open their doors, get inside their system. Then they get a 
little peevish. (Who can blame them?) 
</P>
<P>
But outside these systems, this grid of knowledge-as-football -- of leadership 
as Super Bowl contest between "Us" and some "Evil Empire," all that sort of 
thing -- "invisible" people keep doing their own work and redefining the 
universe in ways that the system can't see. Maybe -- listen to this! -- maybe 
Barbara Tuchman wasn't invisible; maybe her fellow historians locked inside 
their university walls were blind as bats, dopey as crayfish heaving with 
difficulty across the sands of the cosmic aquarium, totally impervious to and 
unaware of the lovely, delicate Tuchman fish swimming in circles above all 
those crabby scholars. 
</P>
<P>
More and more "invisible" people keep coming into view these days. A whole 
Latino exhibit, for instance, down at the County Museum. Frank Romero, a 
Chicano Guy who's been drawing pictures of cars all his life, suddenly gets his 
cars inside, pinned up on Establishment walls. Gilbert Lujan hauls an 
honest-to-God real Chevy inside those hitherto almost always locked doors, and 
suddenly this Chevy is visible, even though Romero and Lujan didn't exactly 
make it by the academic route. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Partly, all this is written in bad faith, by a genuine Ph.D. who believed in 
the system and has an unreadable 535-page doctoral dissertation to prove it. 
But when I was in graduate school at UCLA in the '60s, a lot of bright Bruins 
and Trojans thought that they were going to change the world. Out there on the 
margin, making canapes and giving parties to further their husbands' promotions 
-- in between having a total of seven children -- two invisible faculty wives, 
having, as Tuchman once described her own condition, "no status whatsoever," 
wrote their first and second and third novels. Today, Diane Johnson is a 
MacArthur Prize winner; Alison Lurie has her Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the message is this: Wake up, Boys! Unlock those doors! Let's have a 
conversation or a dance instead of the same old intellectual football game. 
There's a bigger world out there than you know, something beyond your 
Establishment credentials. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Barbara Tuchman missed out by never being quite accepted 
by the history Establishment. But other voices from the invisible world are 
whispering, shouting, calling out: It's the Establishment who missed out in not 
quite having accepted Barbara Tuchman.
