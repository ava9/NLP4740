THE NEW OXFORD BOOK OF SEVENTEENTH CENTURY VERSE edited by Alastair Fowler
Oxford Pounds 25, 831 pages
SPARE A thought in your New Year meditations for an old friend who has just
been retired after 56 years' service - The Oxford Book of Seventeenth
Century Verse. Of all the Oxford Books it was the most influential,
promoting the 20th century revival of Donne, Herbert and Marvell. It was not
quite first in the field: the appearance of an earlier anthology, edited by
Herbert JC Grierson in 1921, prompted TS Eliot to write his famous essay,
The Metaphysical Poets. This was superseded in 1934 by the Oxford Book
Grierson edited with Geoffrey Bullough.
'Donne's 'Songs and Sonets', not alone in virtue of their content and 'wit',
but in their rhythms, their suggestion of speech rather than song . . . mark
a new fashion in poetry, a shifting of the centre of gravity . . .' wrote
the editors in their preface, claiming that this new fashion dominated the
period. That claim has, over the past 50 years, been the subject of
continual debate in departments of English.
The question was, for instance, widely discussed in the Cambridge journal
Scrutiny. In 1936 there appeared, from one of its editors, FR Leavis, the
book Revaluation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry, advocating a
new critical rating for several of the poets in the Oxford book and taking a
swipe or two at its editors in the process. Nor was the discussion confined
to academics in universities. It provided inspiration for poets. Eliot,
Auden, MacNeice, Empson found fruitful models in the Oxford book. For a
while it seemed as if the terms 'metaphysical' and 'modern' were synonyms
where poetry was concerned.
It was, surely, reasonable after more than half a century to appoint an
editor of a later generation to make a fresh Oxonian selection of poetry to
represent this wonderfully rich period. Professor Alastair Fowler was the
man chosen for the job; he is, as was Grierson, a Scottish academic, and his
approach to literature is historical.
Fowler is a foremost authority on the development of literary genres, an
interest which gives him a rather different perspective from his
predecessors. He points out that the underlying poetic genre for the whole
period was epigram in the Greek sense. Typified by brevity and a closing
'point', epigram is the standard brick with which many a 17th-century poetic
structure, great and small, is built. Epigram is to be discerned as much in
a passionate love-poem by Donne as in those more leisurely, ceremonial
country house poems in which the period delighted - Jonson on Penshurst,
Marvell on Appleton House, Cotton on Chatsworth, and their offshoot, the
garden poem. Fowler describes these Estate poems as examples of English
Georgic - a much more fruitful concept when thinking about the poetry of the
period than 'metaphysical'.
The main difference between the old and the new anthologies is that whereas
Grierson and Bullough were metaphysical fundamentalists, Fowler is an
ecumenical liberal and he has opened the door to an even wider variety of
poets in kind and gender than the previous editors. The question arises: has
this breadth involved a sacrifice of depth, of excellence?
Well, all the familiar names are here including Shakespeare, Ben Jonson,
Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Milton, Dryden, Cowley, Herrick. But mingling with
these truly great is the Leveller poet and pamphleteer, Gerrard Winstanley
with 'The Diggers' Song' and so are even more obscure figures, the waterman
Edward Taylor, the alcoholic Richard Brathwait and the lunatic James
Carkesse.
Other newcomers include women poets ignored by the editors of the original
Oxford book - that fine American poet Anne Bradstreet, and Lady Mary Wroth,
who wrote despairing love-sonnets; also, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Finch,
Mary Astell, Elizabeth Tipper, and the mysterious Emilia Lanier. The latter
was AL Rowse's candidate for Shakespeare's dark lady. She had not been
discovered in time for the Grierson anthology, and even if she had, would
not have got into it. Another recent poetic find is Cowley's epic The Civil
War, parts of which Fowler has included.
But in spite of these crucial differences, frequently there is a duplication
between the two anthologies, and it is revealing to compare their
presentation of the same poem. Fowler has modernised all spellings and use
of capitals whereas the earlier editors tried to preserve the appearance of
the original texts. Thus in Bishop Henry King's 'Exequy' to his wife who
died in her twenties, Fowler has 'But hark] My pulse, like a soft drum,/
Beats my approach, tells thee I come . . .'; whereas Grierson and Bullough
have, 'But heark] My Pulse like a soft Drum/ Beats my approach, tells Thee I
come . . .' The latter seems much stronger - not least because of the pun on
'Thee'. Here the grieving bishop equates his beloved with God, a resonance
lost if you down-grade the 'T' to lower case.
But Fowler has done a difficult job well. Younger readers will receive a
comprehensive introduction to the period; older readers will surely want to
have both.
