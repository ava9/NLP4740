Pinter Festival: the words are proclaimed on banners around Dublin. For
three weeks this May, Dublin's Gate Theatre is presenting a festival of
Harold Pinter's plays. Each week, a pair of his plays (one long in the
evening, one short in the afternoon) is being given, in new productions; the
playwright will direct one of them himself; several distinguished actors
(including Ian Holm, Penelope Wilton, Michael Pennington) are involved.
But why Dublin? Pinter's plays are not well known there, and have not been
performed in recent years. The idea came from the Gate Theatre's director,
Michael Colgan, and probably developed as a sequel to the theatre's recent
Beckett festival. Pinter is the modern playwright who has learnt most from
Beckett. (Surely even the famous Pinter pause derives from Beckett.) Pinter
spent time in Ireland as an actor in the 1950s, working with the
actor-manager Anew McMaster, about whom he has written a memoir, Mac.
I believe that Pinter also picked up on the speech-patterns and poetic
refractions of Irish modernism: Yeats, Joyce, and, above all, Beckett. Hence
the alternations of lyricism and irony, the ambiguous meditations on time
past, the sudden non-sequiturs and waits and hesitations, the richly
suggestive use of ordinary parlance. John Gielgud once told Pinter that he
had thought that playing No Man's Land would be like playing Chekhov, 'where
you must ignore the audience', but that in fact he had discovered it needed
a consciousness of the audience, a manipulation of them, as in Congreve or
Wilde - yes, two other Dubliners.
Colgan has chosen and paced the festival's six plays well, so that each
week's pair shows contrasting facets of Pinter. The first week presented The
Dumb Waiter (1959, 50 minutes) and Betrayal (1978, 95 minutes, including
interval). The Dumb Waiter occurs in one of Pinter's most airless rooms, and
is just for two hired killers. Betrayal is about a triangle of relationships
between Robert, his best friend Jerry, and Robert's wife Emma; in ten
scenes, over nine years, set in both London and Venice, it retrospectively
surveys the love affair between Emma and Jerry.
The Dumb Waiter was directed by Joe O'Byrne, Betrayal by Kevin Billington.
Both realised the strong vein of humour in Pinter's writing, and the Dublin
audience responded with ready laughter. Because some of his playwright
contemporaries have been more overtly concerned with satirising various
forms of Englishness, it is easy not to notice, when watching his plays in
England, that Pinter is often satirising Englishness too. Seen abroad, his
characters reveal their nationality more plainly, and amusingly.
Even the pauses that occur between Robert and Jerry in Betrayal became funny
in Dublin, because they expressed the emotional constipation of these
upper-middle-class Londoners - their fatuous politeness, their
stuffed-shirted inability to refer to a spade as a spade. Jerry (Stephen
Brennan) in particular became more hilariously slow-witted; and, when Robert
at one point remarked 'Didn't she?', Brennan delivered a tiny but superb
triple-take, gradually and befuddledly adjusting to all the possible
implications.
English stupidity was also excellently evident in David Herlihy's account of
Gus in The Dumb Waiter, bringing out the dark pun in the title: dumbo Gus is
waiting for he knows not what - not until it is too late. Brief though it
be, The Dumb Waiter defies categorisation. (A sign of Pinter's early
mastery.) Here it is a black comedy about two killers who are pawns in
someone else's game, here an existential waiting-for-Godot tragedy about the
cruel pointlessness of existence (Gus: 'Who is it upstairs?'; Ben: 'What's
one thing to do with another?'). Now a surreal, Ionesco-like, sketch in
which nonsensical events become both disturbing and absurd; now a kind of
thriller in which events add up in a pattern virtually too grim to
contemplate.
Ian McElhinny - who in The Dumb Waiter was the dour and uninquisitive Ben -
also, in Betrayal played Robert: an astonishing double-act. He makes Robert
snide and urbane, as oblique about his emotional dealings as some character
in le Carre. His very tightness of manner actually makes him much more
touching in the one scene when he speaks with Emma of her infidelity with
his best friend. Emma was Jeananne Crowley, a tad too muted, but lightening
in looks and bearing to very telling effect as the play moves back in time.
The Pinter Festival continues at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, until May 21
