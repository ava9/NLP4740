ROBERT, MY FATHER
by Sheridan Morley
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
We are lucky to have Sheridan Morley's voyage round his father before any
other. It gives an uncritical account of his life, with intimate anecdotes
that might not be widely known, and a positive anthology of witticisms.
Unapologetic in its filial loyalty, it records his dramatic activities
ranging from the Stokes Oscar Wilde to TV commercials. Never a star of the
Gielgud-Olivier type - and never ambitious to be - the quality in all his
work is likeableness, though as one critic said, his parts 'all end up
looking and sounding uncommonly like Mr Morley himself'. Alan Ayckbourn
wrote when Morley was in his How the Other Half Loves, he 'is an actor who
rapidly gets very bored and . . . treats theatres as one huge game organised
by himself.'
Morley was the only son of an eccentric retired cavalry major. Trained at
RADA (where he 'never really learned how to act') he made his inconspicuous
debut in Russell Thorndike's Doctor Syn. He then wrote a comedy, Short
Story, which was miraculously accepted for production by Dame Marie Tempest
and from then on, writing was as obsessive with him as acting.
Characteristically, Sheridan was named, not after the playwright, but after
the character Morley was playing at the time. Challenged in the Garrick bar,
Morley said that having a theatre critic for a son was 'like serving in the
Israeli army and waking up to find your son was an Arab'. He has been a
friendly Arab here.
