  [Text] Overall drug consumption rose from three to nine 
percent in the country's border zone, where 5.3 percent of the 
total population (nearly 200,000 persons) is addicted to some 
type of stimulant. This was revealed by a poll taken by the 
Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology. 
  At a press conference, Roberto Tapia, general director for 
that field in the department, and Rafael Velasco, coordinator of 
the National Council Against Addictions, established the fact 
that the sample taken in Monterrey, Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, and 
Matamoros indicates higher consumption among the adult 
population than the youth, and among males than females. 
  Of the 200,000 consumers, only 11.4 percent are between ages 
12 and 18: in other words, eight adults for each adolescent, and 
five males for each female. The drug most consumed is marijuana, 
followed by cocaine and, to a lesser extent, heroin, inhalants, 
and hallucinogens. 
  Indicating the figures on overall drug consumption in the 
aforementioned towns, the specialists explained that Tijuana, 
with a record of 10.1 percent, is the town with the highest 
rate; whereas Monterrey, with 2.8 percent, is the one with the 
lowest incidence. On the other hand, Ciudad Juarez stands at 8.9 
percent; and Matamoros, at 5.8 percent. 
  Both specialists gave a reminder that, five years ago, a 
poll 
of this type was taken, and that similar methods were used in 
the current survey. This made it possible to learn the trend in 
drug consumption during the past five years. 
  In this connection, they noted that, in Ciudad Juarez, drug 
use rose from 3 to 9 percent; in Matamoros, it doubled; in 
Tijuana alone it was 20 percent; and in Monterrey, it showed a 
constant rate. 
  The increase observed in Ciudad Juarez is due to consumption 
of all drugs, primarily cocaine, the use of which quintupled 
during the past five years. In this locality, marijuana use 
quadrupled, and that of heroin and other inhalants tripled. In 
the case of hallucinogens, the demand was 1.5 times greater than 
the rate reported in 1988. 
  As for Matamoros, the increase was due mainly to an almost 
100 percent rise in marijuana and cocaine use, causing this 
district to become the largest consumer of inhalable substances. 
The increase was 1.6 times larger than between 1988 and 1993. 
  In the case of Tijuana, the increments were due to cocaine 
use, which rose 60 percent, and that of marijuana, with a 20 
percent rise. In Monterrey, no variations were noted in the 
prevalence of consumption. Marijuana use predominated, and there 
was a decline in the consumption of other substances. 
  With regard to the educational level of addicts, Roberto 
Tapia and Rafael Velasco noted that the majority have basic 
primary and secondary level schooling. The population using 
marijuana and cocaine is fundamentally male. 
<H5>  Consumption of Medical Drugs </H5>
  As for the consumption of medical drugs, the poll taken by 
the Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology 
reveals that the total prevalence on the northern border 
averaged 15 percent. The rates were 17.2 percent in Ciudad 
Juarez, 15.8 in Matamoros, 14.8 in Tijuana, and 14.1 in 
Monterrey. 
  The investigation shows that the use of medications without 
a 
doctor's prescription is greater in Ciudad Juarez, whereas in 
Monterrey only 16 of every 100 persons reported this occurrence. 
  In conclusion, the medical report claims that, of all the 
pharmaceuticals used, the largest percentage is represented by 
the group of nervous system depressants (tranquilizers), with 
8.6 percent. They are followed by opiates (analgesics, 
narcotics), with 4.9 percent; and other sedatives and 
stimulants, recorded at 3.0 percent, respectively. 
  The Health Secretariat's epidemiology director and the 
coordinator of the National Council Against Addiction stressed 
that there was a fourfold increase in consumption of medical 
drugs between 1988 (the date of the last sampling) and 1993. 
  Although the growing use of these substances is 
intensifying, 
the specialists emphasized that, "fortunately," Mexico has not 
yet reached the prevalence occurring in countries like the 
United States. There, the results of the pertinent polls, taken 
in 1990, indicated that 10 percent of the total population had 
consumed marijuana during the previous year. This figure is not 
comparable to the one reported on Mexico's northern border: only 
1.2 percent. 
  Roberto Tapia and Rafael Velasco concluded by stating that 
the situation is similar in the case of cocaine use because, 
whereas in the neighboring country to the north 3 percent of the 
population consumes the drug, in Mexico only 1 percent of the 
zone's population used it during the previous year.
