  [Excerpts] Almost all the heroin produced illicitly in 
Mexico is smuggled into the United States. During 1992, the 
Mexican alkaloid accounted for approximately 23 percent of the 
drugs circulating on the U.S. black market: a proportion lower 
than 33 percent, the number reported in 1988. This announcement 
was made yesterday by Manuel Quijano, vice chairman of the UN's 
Internal Narcotics Inspection Board, upon submitting that 
agency's annual report. 
  At a press conference, he added that, during the past three 
years, a control program in Mexico also has reduced the illegal 
opium poppy crops to their lowest index in 10 years. During 
1992, the Mexican authorities reported the eradication of 11,583 
hectares of opium poppy plants. According to reports, opium 
production declined from seven tons in 1989 to four tons in 
1992. [passage omitted] 
  The Mexican authorities seized 38.8 tons of cocaine in 1992. 
It is estimated that 60 percent of the alkaloid entering the 
United States from Colombia passes through Mexico. [passage 
omitted]
