  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 26 March--Drugs worth $4.5 
million were seized by the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) 
detailed to Chihuahua State, during a counternarcotics operation 
in which 1.5 tons of marijuana were intercepted, a warehouse was 
seized, and a presumed drug dealer was remanded for crimes 
against health in all their forms. This announcement was made 
here today by the PJF deputy commissioner, Javier Norona 
Guerrero. 
  He explained that, during the operation, headed by the 
force's commander in the zone, Armando Alarcon, and backed by a 
special group from the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic (PGR), 131 packages of the aforementioned drug were 
intercepted moments before they could be shipped to the United 
States. 
  Norona Guerrero added that the investigation conducted by 
the 
PGR personnel ended with the capture of Ramon Moreno Gomez, aged 
27. 
  Seven PJF agents participated in the operation, called 
"Lightning," backed by an agent from the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, successfully intercepting the drugs. 
According to Eduardo Mancera, group chief of that police force, 
this dealt a severe blow to the international drug Mafias. 
  He noted that the PJF agents seized the drugs from a 1978 
Dodge pickup truck without license plates, as it was leaving a 
warehouse located in the Colonia Industrial, at 2379 Montevideo 
Street. The vehicle was confiscated by the PGR, which took it to 
that office's facilities in Ciudad Juarez. 
  He claimed that, if the marijuana had reached the United 
States, it would have supplied 200,000 addicts. 
  The subject under arrest and the drugs were placed at the 
disposal of the authorities.
