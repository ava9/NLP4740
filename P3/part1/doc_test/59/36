  [Excerpts] In antidrug operations conducted within the past 
24 hours, agents from the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic confiscated over three tons of marijuana, 104 kg and 
180 grams of pure cocaine, and one kg and 184 grams of heroin, 
with a total black market value exceeding 315 million new pesos. 
  Reports sent to the Federal Judicial Police Directorate, 
headed by Commander Adrian Carrera, and to the force's 
operational directorate, under Victor Patino Esquivel, indicate 
that the operations took place in nine of the federation's 
states. A total of 20 presumed drug traffickers were captured, 
and nine automotive vehicles used to transport the drugs were 
seized as well. 
  The federal detectives foiled the purchase and sale 
transaction involving 104 kg and 150 grams of pure cocaine, in 
Tamaulipas State, following the arrest of Daniel Salinas 
Villarreal, who was driving a sedan type car with state of Texas 
plates. [passage omitted] 
  The department's agency in Michoacan State reported the 
largest confiscation of cannabis indica, after the capture of 
five presumed drug dealers in the town of Tepaltepec, with one 
ton and 175 kg of that drug in their possession. The marijuana 
was located in what is known as a collection center, on Jalisco 
and Felipe Carrillo Puerto Streets. Confiscated on that site 
were seven hydraulic jacks, presses, roles of plastic adhesive, 
and automotive vehicles used to transport drugs. Manuel Ramirez 
Cortes, Manuel Ramirez Barajas, Arnoldo Cortes Magana, Arturo 
Cravez Garcia, and Carlos Cruz Ruelas, found engaged in 
compacting marijuana, were arrested. [passage omitted]
