  [Excerpt] During antidrug operations conducted in 13 
federative states, over 6 tons of dried and packed marijuana 
about to be smuggled into the United States for sale and 
consumption were discovered and confiscated by Federal Judicial 
Police agents. The drugs were concealed in shipments of frozen 
cucumbers, tomatoes, chayotes, avocados, and alfalfa, as well as 
in boxes of detergent and toothpaste. According to reports, 49 
presumed public poisoners were arrested during the operations. 
  In making this announcement, the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic [PGR] disclosed that 20 vehicles 
equipped with special compartments for concealing and carrying 
drugs were confiscated in the operations, and are now at the 
disposal of the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. 
Also seized were two firearms, 32 useful cartridges of various 
calibers, and implements for "processing" narcotics. 
  The PGR added that the operations were carried out in 
Michoacan, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Guanajuato, 
Oaxaca, Coahuila, Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Guerrero, 
and Veracruz. No incidents or confrontations between 
representatives of the law and criminals were reported. 
  It was specified that the most significant confiscation 
occurred in the municipality of Tiquicheo, Michoacan, where 
Felipe Araujo Arellano was arrested. He was carrying 3 tons and 
194 kg of cannabis indica in the body of a tractor trailer 
truck, concealed under 700 bags containing frozen cucumbers. He 
had purchased his shipment in the town of Nuevo Leon, and was 
attempting to take it to Reynosa, Tamaulipas, from which it was 
to be sent to the state of Texas, in the U.S. [passage omitted]
