BORDER PATROL'S DRUG WAR ROLE IS QUESTIONED

<P>
Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol, longstanding gatekeepers against illegal 
immigration, increasingly are taking a role in the effort to staunch the flow 
of illicit drugs through the nation's frontiers, particularly along the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
From California to Texas, green-uniformed border guards are seizing more 
cocaine, marijuana and other controlled substances than ever before, a fact 
that officials say is traceable to the rising quantities of drugs entering the 
United States from Mexico via the almost 2,000-mile international boundary 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol's widening anti-drug presence -- most agents have been given the 
legal authority in recent years to make drug arrests -- has sparked a debate 
about whether narcotics interdiction is an appropriate mission for an agency 
principally charged with enforcing immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on Friday a U.S. District Court judge in San Diego rejected as 
unconstitutional a proposal by federal prosecutors to expand the Border 
Patrol's legal charter to include illicit drug checks at the freeway 
checkpoints on Interstate 5 and Interstate 15 running north from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
From its birth, however, the Border Patrol has taken a contraband-fighting role 
-- starting with its Prohibition-era duties in deterring liquor traffickers. 
The agency, created by Congress in 1924 with the appointment of 450 "former 
mounted guards, policemen, sheriffs, (and) gunslingers of various types," 
according to an official history, now finds itself on the front lines of the 
nation's high-profile war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Seizure statistics reflect the trend. During the most recent fiscal year, 
border agents recorded more than 5,000 drug seizures, netting $1.2 billion 
worth of cocaine, marijuana, heroin and other prohibited substances. In fiscal 
1982, the Border Patrol made fewer than 500 seizures nationwide, confiscating 
slightly more than $5 million worth of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning anti-drug profile of an agency that annually records almost 1 
million or more immigration-related arrests -- making it by far the nation's 
most prolific arresting body -- has generated rising concern among immigrant 
advocates and others who worry that officers trained in a host of exhaustively 
complex immigration matters are ill-equipped for the added task of narcotics 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
An independent study released in March by the RAND Corp. and the Urban 
Institute, two public-policy research bodies, found that "competing new 
missions" for U.S. immigration authorities -- including additional drug 
enforcement -- resulted in a reduction in manpower directed at implementing 
aspects of the sweeping 1986 immigration law reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"You're sort of boot-strapping this agency into becoming a major player in drug 
interdiction when they don't have the skills," said Charles Wheeler, director 
of the National Immigration Law Center, a Los Angeles-based immigrant rights 
group. "I have no problem with responding to drug interdiction in a major way, 
but not taking the Border Patrol and adding this to the 400 roles that it 
already has." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities disagree, contending that the nation's 3,800 border guards -- 
most of whom are posted along the international boundary while some are 
assigned to inland stations -- are equal to the interdiction task. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we are not only adequately trained but superbly trained" for 
drug-related and other responsibilities, said William L. Bonnette, acting 
assistant commissioner for the U.S. Border Patrol in Washington. He said that 
the patrol's 18-week training course included instruction in a "full range of 
police sciences," including narcotics interdiction, and that U.S. drug experts 
have provided supplemental preparation. 
</P>
<P>
In the immigrants rights community, there is mounting concern about the 
now-frequent tendency of officials and others to link two distinct 
border-related issues -- undocumented immigration, which is widely viewed as a 
victimless crime, and drug trafficking, an offense that carries a strong social 
stigma. 
</P>
<P>
The constant joining of the two issues "results in an increasingly widespread 
feeling among Border Patrol agents that all immigrants are narco-terrorist 
criminal types, when in fact the vast majority are honest, persevering and 
hard-working people, fleeing abject poverty or civil strife," said Peter Schey, 
executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, a Los 
Angeles-based advocacy group that defends immigrants rights. "It also plays 
into the hands of xenophobia and other anti-immigrant feelings." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. officials say, it is increasingly difficult to separate the 
traffic of human and drug contraband, as the two have become increasingly 
entwined in the border area. That, they say, has made the border a much more 
dangerous place, both for guards and migrants, particularly in the San Diego 
area, the most heavily traveled crossing zone. 
</P>
<P>
"The interdiction of drugs and illegals is almost synonymous," said Duke 
Austin, Washington-based spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, parent body of the Border Patrol. "You simply don't know when you 
encounter people crossing the border whether they are carrying drugs or not. . 
. . I think there's no question that the character of the old cat-and-mouse 
game at the border has been changed because of the potential for drugs and more 
profit. The border patrolman has to be much more cautious now than he was a few 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Border Patrol officials reject any suggestions that their treatment of 
immigrants may be tainted by suspicions of rampant drug-trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"We always stress that the people we deal with are guests in our country, and 
we try to treat them like guests," said Stuart Gary, a patrol agent at the 
checkpoint along Interstate 5, who spoke as he directed a drug-sniffing dog, 
Astor, to check a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the patrol's more pronounced profile in drug enforcement, officials say 
that agents generally are not deliberately attempting to find contraband 
narcotics. While some agents have been assigned to various interagency drug 
efforts, such as the border-wide Operation Alliance, Border Patrol agents 
typically seize drugs as they conduct their normal enforcement rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Border agents are finding more drugs, authorities say, because smugglers -- 
responding to the U.S. enforcement squeeze placed on the South Florida 
trafficking corridor since the early 1980s -- are transporting more and more 
cocaine and other drugs into the United States via the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out there doing a normal job, catching people, and we essentially 
stumble on the drugs," said Ted A. Swofford, supervisory Border Patrol agent in 
San Diego, home to about 750 patrol agents, the largest contingent nationwide. 
"We don't have drug patrols." 
</P>
<P>
Added Ben Davidian, regional commissioner in Los Angeles for the INS: "We 
didn't go looking for the drug war. It came to us." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. Border Patrol agents, patrolling the often-vast open stretches of 
land between legal ports of entry, seize an estimated 60% of all contraband 
drugs impounded annually in the border area. U.S. Customs Service officers, who 
are stationed at the ports of entry and conduct aerial anti-drug patrols, are 
responsible for finding the bulk of the remaining seized contraband. 
</P>
<P>
Yet officials concede that resourceful traffickers repeatedly thwart 
enforcement efforts. Smugglers respond efficiently to pressure by finding other 
smuggling routes and methods. Despite the efforts of the drug war, authorities 
seize perhaps 10% of all illicit drugs bound for the U.S. market, according to 
an estimate by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The ingenuity of the border contrabandistas was displayed vividly earlier this 
month when authorities unearthed an extensive underground smuggling chamber 
along the boundary line between the border towns of Douglas, Ariz., and Agua 
Prieta, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
While lawmen long have discovered drugs hidden in vehicles and on the persons 
of undocumented border-crossers, officials say they have noted a recent upsurge 
in the volume of drugs being packed in by so-called "mules," hired men usually 
traveling in groups with bags strapped to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, authorities in San Diego seized 1,000 pounds of marijuana being 
brought into the United States in mule-train fashion. A year ago, Border Patrol 
agents recovered 10 duffel bags containing 950 pounds of cocaine that was being 
brought into the United States via the rugged border canyons in San Diego. 
Three weeks later, agents stationed at the Border Patrol checkpoint near San 
Clemente along Interstate 5 discovered 800 pounds of cocaine in a 1983 
Oldsmobile sedan. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's court decision, the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego was seeking 
use of the checkpoints as "dual purpose" facilities, to be used for both 
immigration and drug checks. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems associated with alien smuggling are clearly no more important 
than the scourge of drugs," Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole explained 
in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge J. Lawrence Irving rejected the proposal as an unconstitutional 
infringement on constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. However, U.S. officials say they will probably seek the dual purpose 
authority in a future case.
