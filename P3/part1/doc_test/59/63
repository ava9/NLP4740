  [Text] Mexico, Federal District, 4 May (EFE) -- The Mexican 
Judicial Police have seized 5.8 tons of marijuana worth $36 
million, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
reported on Wednesday. 
  The operation was conducted in La Paz, capital of Baja 
California Sur State, some 1,250 kms northeast of Mexico City. 
  According to the available information, the seizure was made 
at a La Paz loading terminal during the inspection of a trailer 
that had come from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa State, one of 
the states with the highest incidence of narcotrafficking. 
  According to the driver, the truck was bound for the 
California border, where the drug would have a commercial value 
of $36 million. 
  The PGR is holding the truckdriver pending a decision on any 
penal action against him for crimes against the public health. 
It has also begun investigating the plan and possible 
accomplices of the prisoner, as well as the place of origin and 
the destination of the drugs.
