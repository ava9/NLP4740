  [Text] Over 200 million new pesos' worth of cocaine base, 
packaged marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin (the latter 
shipped to Mexico from Thailand) were incinerated yesterday in 
Baja California and Sonora States by authorities from the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR], the National Defense 
Secretariat, various State Human Rights Commissions, and the 
health sector. 
  Jose Antonio Ochoa Palacios, the PGR's representative in 
Baja 
California, reported the burning of the following drugs in the 
Fifth Infantry Battalion's facilities located in the town of 
Tijuana's settlement of El Aguaje de la Tuna: approximately 8.5 
tons of cannabis indica, 4,237 grams of Thai heroin, 15.5 kg of 
methamphetamine, and 38 kg and 585 grams of pure cocaine. The 
drugs presumably were intended to be smuggled into the United 
States for sale and consumption. 
  According to reports submitted to the PGR's assistant 
attorney for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera 
Morales, the drugs in question, with a market value totaling 
several tens of millions of new pesos, were seized by Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] agents assigned to both Tijuana and 
Tecate. The PJF's deputy commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, 
remarked: "The drugs burned were confiscated within the past two 
months." 
  The event was attended by Ruben Dario Castillo Ferrara, the 
district garrison commander; Ricardo M. Legario Z., commander of 
the Fifth Infantry Battalion; Jorge Avelaez Palacio, director of 
the SSA [Secretariat of Health and Assistance] Health Center in 
Tijuana; and Eduardo Garcia Alcaynes, from the PGR's Internal 
Comptroller's Office, among others. Representative Ochoa 
Palacios underscored the resolute participation of all the 
state's social and institutional sectors in the battle against 
the drug traffic. 
  Carlos Jaime Pratt Straffon, the PGR's representative in 
Sonora, for his part, reported that approximately nine tons of 
compressed marijuana were destroyed at the Hermosillo Hunt Club 
and Firing Range facilities located at km 26 of the Bahia de 
Quino highway. These drugs also were presumably intended for 
shipment to the northern part of the country and, subsequently, 
to the United States. 
  Like Ochoa Palacios, Pratt Straffon addressed that state's 
attorney general, Wenceslao Cota Monteya, the State Human Rights 
Commission inspectors, Hector Contreras Perez and Jesus Arturo 
Pena; as well as the Foreign Relations Secretariat's regional 
representative, Alejandro [surname missing]. Straffon emphasized 
the valuable, determined participation of the civilian society 
and the military, state, and municipal authorities in the daily 
battle being waged against the grave, increasing drug 
trafficking problem, afflicting everyone alike. He added that 
the nearly nine tons of cannabis indica incinerated had been 
seized during the past 60 days by federal agents under orders 
from the force's assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moralla 
Amador.
