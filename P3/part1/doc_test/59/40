  [Text] Upon arresting six presumed drug traffickers at the 
international airport in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and at the Oaxaca 
State capital airport, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents 
confiscated over 5 million pesos' worth of ephedrine, 
psychotropic pills, and white heroin. The latter was nearly 100 
percent pure, and sufficient to prepare 18,000 doses. 
  The representative of the Attorney General's Office [PGR] in 
Oaxaca, Manuel Figueroa Lange, announced that PJF personnel 
under orders from the deputy commissioner, Juan Jose Tafoya 
Gonzalez, arrested Erasmo Jesus Cruz Esperon, Jorge Efrain 
Garcia Cardoso, and Jose Antonio Varela Fuentes in the residence 
at Independencia and Garcia Vigil Streets, in the city of 
Oaxaca's first block. They had in their possession 260 grams of 
white or Thai heroin, considered by experts as one of the most 
toxic drugs on the narcotics market. 
  According to the report submitted to the PJF's general 
director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the accused were closing a 
deal for the purchase and sale of the drug, which, based on 
laboratory tests, was estimated as sufficient for processing 
18,000 doses. The authorities noted that the drug, of unknown 
origin, causes immediate addiction among those consuming it: 
hence the significance of the confiscation. 
  It was specified that the heroin was distributed in five 
packets, to be sold both in our country and the United States. 
The investigations to determine the origin of the narcotic are 
being continued. 
  For its part, the PGR branch office in Jalisco, headed by 
Raul Garza Serna, reported that Gabriel Rodriguez Cervantes and 
Jesus Herrera Lopez were captured at the Guadalajara 
international airport. They were carrying, in four suitcases, 
over 50.5 kg of ephedrine and several dozen psychotropic pills. 
The drugs were bound for Tijuana, Baja California. 
  It was added that the aforementioned persons were captured 
after the investigative agents had discovered on the inspection 
conveyor belts that the four bags contained a white, crystalline 
powder resembling cocaine. It proved to be ephedrine, a chemical 
precursor used for processing amphetamines and cocaine base. 
  At the same airport, during another search, Alejandro Ortiz 
Torres was arrested. He was carrying over 17 kg of compressed 
cocaine in a traveling bag, and was also bound for Tijuana.
