  [Excerpt] Cocaine base and packed marijuana worth over 12 
billion new pesos, and intercepted by Judicial Police agents in 
Coahuila State, were incinerated yesterday by the Attorney 
General's Office [PGR] in the municipalities of Saltillo, 
Torreon, Ciudad Acuna, Piedras Negras, and Monclova. 
Furthermore, during operations conducted in Baja California, 
Sonora, Baja California Sur, Jalisco, and Nuevo Leon, the police 
authorities arrested six presumed public poisoners, seizing more 
than 2.5 tons of cannabis indica intended to be taken to the 
United States for sale and consumption. 
  The Attorney General's Office representative in Coahuila, 
Maria del Refugio Martinez Cruz, informed the assistant attorney 
for branch offices and inspections, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, 
that four tons and 182 kg of pure cocaine, and slightly over 
3,000 kg of packed marijuana, were burned. The incineration took 
place in the town of Saltillo, in the presence of 
representatives from the National Defense Secretariat, the 
Mexican Navy, and the health sector, as well as from state and 
municipal governments. 
  The official noted that, in the other aforementioned 
municipalities, various amounts of cannabis totaling seven tons 
and 825 kg were destroyed. They had been seized in operations 
conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel under 
orders from the force's deputy representative in the state, Juan 
Carlos Alvarado Aranda. 
  It was emphasized at the drug burning ceremonies that the 
authorities had confirmed their steadfast intention of pooling 
efforts so as, together, to combat society's common enemy: the 
drug traffic. 
  Moreover, the PGR representative in Sonora, Miguel Angel 
Cortes Ibarra, reported that federal agents under orders from 
the assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, had 
intercepted a trailer truck at the highway inspection point 
located at Km 120 of the Hermosillo-Nogales route. It was 
carrying 1,709 kg of pressed marijuana, presumably intended to 
be taken to the town of Nogales, Arizona, for marketing. 
  According to the report submitted to the PJF's General 
Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Macario 
Ramirez Arcega was placed at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office. He was driving a vehicle with Federal 
Public Service registration 325-UBB. In the body of this vehicle 
203 packages and 64 bags containing the aforementioned amount of 
drugs were discovered. [passage omitted]
