  [Excerpts] Following a charge implying the existence of 
appalling deals between federal agents and drug traffickers, the 
residents of the Indian communities in Juarez Valley have chosen 
to remain silent because of their fear. 
  "This is a very critical matter that is being treated 
superficially.... I refuse to say anything": That comment was 
made by the Zaragoza community commissioner, Porfirio Silva, 
who, six months ago, publicly charged that "in the region it was 
easier to obtain a kilo of marijuana than one of tortillas." 
  The movement of drugs (claimed in the accusation as 
occurring 
in most of the 17 Indian communities comprising the valley) is 
an activity not confirmed thus far by any evidence gathered by 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents during their raids in that 
area. 
  In its crackdown on the drug traffic, the department has not 
managed to seize marijuana or cocaine shipments after several 
raids reported to have taken place since July. 
  Those negative statistics represent a strong motivation for 
the community residents, from Zaragoza to Guadalupe, not to opt 
for making any new charges regarding such activity. 
  However, State Judicial Police [PJE] officials and municipal 
employees operating in those municipalities have also been 
remiss in issuing any further reports. 
  For example, the state agents have not repeated their 
intervention in any operation, nor reported any unusual movement 
on trails or in settlements since August, when one of their 
fellow officers was captured by PJF members. 
  "Since then, there has never been any kind of cooperation; 
and, besides, we represent an agency dealing with common crimes. 
We have devoted ourselves to that alone," declared the PJE 
commander in Guadalupe, Octavio Frescas. 
  The federal police arrested one of his agents in August, 
accusing him of having protected the landing of a small plane 
presumably loaded with drugs: something that could never be 
proven. [passage omitted] 
  According to the town hall secretary, Eduardo Ramos, 
Guadalupe, regarded for years as one of the municipalities used 
by drug traffickers for landing their planes, is, nevertheless, 
a safe place now. 
  "It is so peaceful here that we do not even know the federal 
police," he remarked. [passage omitted] 
  The commissioner of the Juarez Reforma Indian community, 
Jesus Olivo, who resides in the village of Caseta, a site 
notorious for drug trafficking, even asserted: "Movements of 
that type have never occurred here." 
  Another community representative, Antonio Flores, from San 
Isidro, also claimed that the drug traffic in the region "is a 
thing of the past," although he was among those who witnessed, 
and did not deny, the public charge submitted to Mayor Francisco 
Villareal. 
  Described by Silva as a region "serving as a springboard for 
drugs," Juarez Valley was explored by PJF agents weeks later, 
after the mayor had met with the PGR [Attorney General of the 
Republic] representative, Teresa Jardi Alonso, according to 
reports issued at the time. 
  The agents' invasion was announced in August by the 
assistant 
representative of the Attorney General's Office, Samuel 
Terrazas. However, no results have been reported from the 
maneuvers to date. 
  At the PJE office in Guadalupe, Commander Frescas indicated 
that, throughout their tours, countless trails and settlements 
"known in their entirety only to the natives" were detected. 
  He added: "There are very long and varied trails, but it 
cannot be claimed that they are being used by `narcos.'" 
  According to the residents themselves, the PGR helicopter 
flights have been intensified in that area during the past few 
days. Nevertheless, there has been no report to date of the 
discovery of landing strips, trails, or drug seizures involving 
considerable volumes of drugs.
