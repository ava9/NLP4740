  [Excerpts] In various antidrug operations conducted in 14 
states and the Federal District, Judicial Police agents seized 
35 liters of hashish, or marijuana oil, slightly over five tons 
of cannabis indica, 207 kg of cocaine base, 234 kg of the 
chemical precursor known as ephedrine, one kg and 300 grams of 
heroin, and 1.5 kg of the substance called "crystal." The same 
investigations led to the arrests of 66 persons linked with the 
drug traffic, from whom the agents seized a total of 11 
heavy-caliber firearms, over 1,000 cartridges, and 32 automotive 
vehicles equipped for transporting drugs. 
  According to the briefing reports sent to the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] General Directorate, headed by Commander 
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the most significant operation took 
place in the warehouses of a transportation company on the 
border in Tijuana, Baja California. There, the police found two 
plastic drums holding 35 liters of hashish resin, a highly toxic 
drug. 
  Upon his arrival to pick up the drug shipment, Agustin 
Corrantes Sanchez, who was loading the drug containers onto his 
pickup truck, was arrested by federal agents. With information 
he provided, the federal prosecutor's office ordered the arrest 
of his boss, who answers to the name of Jorge Abraham Zazueta 
Felix. Both subjects claimed that it was only a shipment of 
anti-oxidant used in the manufacture of lard. According to 
experts on the subject, to obtain hashish a ton of marijuana is 
required for each liter of the toxic substance. This means that 
at least 35 tons of cannabis indica were used to produce the 35 
liters confiscated. 
  Moreover, on the site known as "La Escondida," in Arramberi, 
Nuevo Leon, the Federal Judicial Police and municipal police 
seized two tons and 367 kg of dried and packed marijuana, bound 
for the border at Reynosa, Tamaulipas. From there, it was 
intended to be shipped to the United States. Arrested in the 
operation were the presumed drug dealers, Silvano Aguilar Colin 
and Filomeno Ruiz Martinez, who had concealed the drugs in the 
false bottom of a truck body. [passage omitted] 
  The PGR agency in Nayarit, for its part, announced the 
arrest 
of Peregrin Villagomez Bazan and Luis Alberto Gamez Hernandez in 
the vicinity of Ixtlan del Rio. They were carrying 182 kg of 
very high quality cocaine in five suitcases stored in the trunk 
of a sedan type vehicle. 
  In Quintana Roo, PJF personnel discovered 21 kg of the same 
alkaloid scattered on the Cancun beaches at a site known as 
Caleta de Manati. Presumably dropped by an airplane, the drugs 
were intended to wait for pickup by the fliers' accomplices, who 
would sell them. 
  The department's agency in Baja California, for its part, 
reported the seizure of 234 kg of the chemical precursor known 
as ephedrine. It was detected underneath the seats on a 
passenger bus driven by Jose Manuel Moctezuma Torres, Ramon 
Rosales Fernandez, and Gabriel Garcia Linares. [passage omitted]
