  [Text] Government leaders yesterday said they agreed to a 
proposal by anti-narcotics officials to introduce money 
laundering law provided it did not constitute an infringement on 
the freedom of the individual. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in 
principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest 
people from converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal 
currency. 
  "In principle, the idea of preventing money laundering 
should 
do no harm to society. But we have to look into details of the 
proposed law to see whether the freedom of the individual would 
be compromised in the process," Chuan said. 
  The prime minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB) had yet to submit its proposed anti-money 
laundering legislation to the Cabinet. 
  On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he 
approved of the proposed law in view of complaints by anti-drug 
officials that, without such a law, drug traffickers would 
continue to flourish from their illegal trade. 
  ONCB officials say many major traders in illicit drugs are 
beyond the reach of the law because law enforcement officials 
normally do not have hard evidence to link them to the crime. 
They say a money laundering law would make it much more 
difficult for drug traffickers to convert drug proceeds into 
legal assets. 
  The government's support for the idea came after it was 
alleged that at least eight MPs were involved in the trade of 
marijuana. 
  Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong Siriprichaphong has been accused by 
the United States' Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of 
involvement in the shipment of 45 tonnes of marijuana to the 
United States between 1977-87. His assets in the United 
States--a house and a luxury car--have been seized under an 
order by a district court in California although US law 
enforcement officials have yet to formally charge him with any 
crime. 
  Chuan, asked to comment on reports about a thesis written by 
an ONCB investigator which says eight MPs were involved in the 
marijuana trade, said he had seen the document, which lists 
certain lawmakers among other suspected drug traffickers. 
  But the prime minister added that there was "no hard and 
fast 
evidence. Some of them closely linked to local influential 
people or those who are suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking." 
  He said he was told by ONCB officials that they could not 
find enough evidence to initiate legal action against most 
people on the list of suspected drug traffickers. 
  Chuan said he had instructed ONCB officials to take action 
without fear against anyone involved in the illegal drug trade 
as long as there was sufficient evidence. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he agreed that 
Thailand should have a money laundering law which would help 
anti-drug officials fight drug dealers more effectively.
