  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
0900 GMT on 20 January reports that "the Lebanese border unit of 
the Galilee District Police last night seized 10 kg of heroin 
believed to be worth over $1 million. Our correspondent in the 
north Yo'av Aviv reports that the drugs were seized from an 
Israeli drug dealer who had smuggled it from Lebanon in the 
Metulla region." 
  Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 23 January carries a report by 
Shmu'el Tagar on page 4 which states "last Friday night 10 kg of 
marijuana were seized from an apartment in one of Elat's new 
neighborhoods." The report notes that the Elat police have 
detained three persons suspected of smuggling the drugs from the 
Sinai for distribution in Elat and the rest of Israel, adding 
that "this morning the three will be brought before an Elat 
judge for extending their remand." 
  Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 27 January in a 
report by Raine Marcus and ITIM on page 14 reports that "a man 
and woman suspected of dealing in marijuana in Tel Aviv's 
Sheinkin area were remanded for a week by Tel Aviv Magistrates 
Court yesterday." The report notes that "detectives found two 
kilograms of marijuana in a pillowcase and an additional four 
grams elsewhere in the apartment, but both suspects deny any 
connection to the drugs." THE JERUSALEM POST adds that "after a 
period of drought Tel Aviv is now flooded with marijuana, 
according to a senior narcotics squad officer. In the last two 
months alone detectives in the greater Tel Aviv area have seized 
30 kilograms of marijuana, apparently grown in Sinai, said the 
officer." Later on in the report, the paper writes: "In Petah 
Tiqva yesterday, police acting on a tip off found 12 kilograms 
of marijuana in an abandoned building. Nobody has come forward 
to claim the drugs and police are looking for the owner." 
  "In Haifa yesterday, Egged member Aharon Zalmanovitz, 35, of 
Nahariyya, was remanded until February 6 by the Haifa 
Magistrates Court on suspicion of smuggling and dealing heroin. 
Police found 1.3 kilograms of heroin in Zalmanovitz's 
apartment."
