<P>
Mexico's controversial drug czar, Javier Coello Trejo, was removed from his 
post Monday after repeated charges that federal anti-narcotics police under his 
authority committed widespread human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Coello, 42, was named Monday night as federal attorney general for the 
consumer, a position that officials portrayed as a promotion but which, in 
reality, is far less powerful than his old job. 
</P>
<P>
As deputy attorney general since December, 1988, the robust, chain-smoking 
Coello has overseen the Mexican Federal Judicial Police assigned to combatting 
narcotics production and trafficking. Heroin poppy and marijuana crops are 
grown illegally in Mexico, and the country is a major transshipment route for 
U.S.-bound South American cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
During Coello's tenure, Mexican police have seized a record 75 tons of cocaine 
and jailed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, reputedly the top cocaine 
supplier to the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
American officials have lauded Coello's aggressiveness in fighting narcotics 
trafficking and his close cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been great. This is a blow," said a U.S. official. "The whole success of 
the large cocaine seizures can be attributed to his planning and management of 
these operations." 
</P>
<P>
But at home, politicians and human rights activists have been far more critical 
of Coello's leadership. Half a dozen governors have protested violence 
committed by the Federal Judicial Police in their states, as has the National 
Human Rights Commission, created by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Americas Watch human rights group issued a report in June 
charging that "federal narcotics police are accountable for a large number of 
cases of murder, torture and abuse of process in Mexico today. Extortion and 
robbery are also frequent elements of federal police operations." 
</P>
<P>
And last month, in special hearings before a subcommittee of the U.S. House 
Committee on Foreign Relations, Deputy Asst. Secretary of State Sally G. Cowal 
said that "chief among our human rights concerns in Mexico is mistreatment of 
detainees by Mexican police, particularly the Mexican Federal Judicial Police . 
. . (which) has traditionally enjoyed considerable immunity from prosecution 
for its human rights abuses." 
</P>
<P>
Rights activists applauded Coello's removal but said the government must go 
further to restructure the police and judicial system, particularly to 
eliminate the use in court of confessions extracted in police custody. They 
said they believe Coello was removed to ease international criticism of Mexico 
as the government tries to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said Coello is to be replaced by Jorge Carrillo Olea, an 
army colonel who has been serving as director general of national security.
