  [Excerpt] With the capture of 19 presumed drug traffickers, 
agents from the Attorney General's Office, in counternarcotics 
operations conducted in Baja California State, seized five tons 
and 639 kg of dried, packed marijuana with a black market value 
of $30 million, or 90 million new pesos. The large confiscation 
makes this state appear to be a "drug paradise." 
  During the action taken by members of the Federal Judicial 
Police and the National Institute To Combat Drugs, several 
collection centers for the grass that arrived from various parts 
of the country were dismantled. Included was a shipment brought 
in by charter from Mexico City, which those responsible were 
preparing to send to the United States. Also seized were seven 
vehicles outfitted to transport the marijuana. 
  Arturo Ochoa Palacios and Commander Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, 
the institution's representative and the Federal Judicial Police 
deputy commissioner in the state, respectively, gave a detailed 
account of the operations. 
  The largest seizure took place in the town of Tijuana, where 
federal agents confiscated a shipment of 2,966 kg of the grass, 
distributed in 369 rectangular packages concealed among 
perishable products. They were found in a warehouse of the 
Olivos Industrial Center, situated on Extension Road, lot 100, 
which was being guarded by Eleazar Ruiz Diaz and Ruben Alfonso 
Chavez Baez. 
  In another warehouse located at 10 Sancho Panza Street in 
the 
La Mesa precinct's Los Espanoles subdivision, of the same town, 
the public poisoners had hidden 1,401 kg and 900 grams. There, 
Noe Covian Sandoval, Alberto Maciel Benitez, and the brothers 
Cuauhtemoc and Cipriano Covian Garcia were arrested. They had 
unloaded the drugs from a tractor trailer truck of the Kenworth 
make, with a tanker, that had arrived from Guadalajara, Jalisco, 
driven by Jose Manuel Armendariz Torres. 
  Captured in the same town were Eusebio Rodriguez Quintero, 
Eugenio Hernandez Hernandez, and Luis Garcia Rodriguez, who had 
in their possession a marijuana shipment weighing 1,319 kg and 
400 grams, distributed in 455 packages. 
  The drugs were to be marketed at a machine shop located in 
the town's central section. Hence, a surveillance operation was 
mounted, until the aforementioned individuals were caught while 
setting the price. They had extracted a package of the drugs 
from a moving van, to show as a sample. 
  Later, with the information given by those in custody, 
another accomplice, Victor Hugo Garcia Elvira, who had been 
assigned to carry the drugs to Tijuana, was captured. [passage
