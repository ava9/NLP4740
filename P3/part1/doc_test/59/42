  [Text] Pursuing the guidelines of the government 
antinarcotics policy in 1992 and 1993, the Armed Forces and the 
National Police [PNP] seized 17 tonnes of drugs, worth over $100 
million. 
  In drug enforcement operations during the first two months 
of 
this year alone, 4,369 kg of drugs, including cocaine paste and 
cocaine hydrochloride, have been seized. 
  The Armed Forces had sole responsibility for the struggle 
against terrorism until 1991, while the PNP were responsible for 
drug enforcement. 
  This situation changed in 1992 when President Alberto 
Fujimori's administration stated that the Armed Forces and the 
PNP, under a single command, would handle the planning, 
implementation, and supervision of drug enforcement to increase 
efficiency. 
  According to a report by the Interior Ministry and the Joint 
Command, 8,000 kg of narcotics, including 595 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride and 7,471 kg of cocaine paste, were seized in 
1992. Additionally, 185,895 kg of chemicals used to process 
drugs were destroyed. 
  Joint military-police operations in 1993 were crushing: 
8,432 
kg of cocaine paste and 441 kg of cocaine hydrochloride--as well 
as 90 metric tons of chemicals, including sulfuric acid and 
sodium carbonate--were seized. 
  The success of the antinarcotic strategy during the first 
two 
months of this year is undeniable because 3,733 kg of cocaine 
paste, 6 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 31 metric tons of 
chemicals have been seized. Some 99 percent of this was seized 
in a single operation two weeks ago in the Boca Manu-Madre de 
Dios area. 
  The National Customs Superintendency Antinarcotics Brigade 
represents another significant pillar of drug enforcement in 
Peru, seizing 822 kg of narcotics between 1990 and 1993. In 
1993, this special unit seized 293 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, 
24 kg of cocaine paste, and 400 kg of chemicals. 
  It must also be mentioned that cocaine hydrochloride is 
worth 
$75,000 per kg and cocaine paste is worth $1,500 per kg on the 
international market. 
  The drugs seized in 1992-93 by the Armed Forces and the 
PNP--16,000.879 kg--is worth about $100 million. 
  The PNP Antinarcotics Directorate reported that 3,180 
operations were carried out and 4,195 traffickers were captured 
in 1992. In 1993, 5,000 traffickers were arrested during 3,640 
operations. 
  The Air Force intercepted 34 small planes used by 
trafficking 
rings to carry drugs in 1992. In 1993, another 29 small planes 
and 28 airstrips were seized. 
  Within the context of drug enforcement in Peru, 67 metric 
tons of drugs have been burned during the past 13 years by the 
Interior Ministry Executive Agency for Drug Control (OFECOD). 
  Of this, 12,000.054 kg of narcotics, including 11,191 kg of 
cocaine paste, 537.400 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 325.850 
kg of marijuana, were burned in 1993. This is the largest 
quantity of drugs burned recently. 
  Additionally, 60,310 kg of cocaine paste, 2,554 kg of 
cocaine 
hydrochloride, 4,696 kg of marijuana, 26 kg of opium, and 7 kg 
of poppy, among other drugs, were burned between 1981 and 1993. 
The smallest quantity of drugs, involving barely 1,441 kg, were 
burned in 1987. Of this, 1,125 kg was cocaine paste, 5 kg 
cocaine hydrochloride, and 311 kg marijuana.
