  [Excerpts] A total of six tons and 875 kg of packed 
marijuana, 19 kg and 650 grams of seed of the same drug, and 
seven kg of poppy seed, with a total market value exceeding 7 
million new pesos, were seized yesterday by agents from the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]. They were 
engaged in antidrug operations in 10 of the nation's states, 
which enabled them to capture 21 presumed drug dealers, 
including a Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent. 
  During the activities, the federal agents under orders from 
Commander Adrian Carrera confiscated 13 automotive vehicles used 
to transport drugs, and five heavy caliber firearms. 
Concurrently, the PGR personnel destroyed a marijuana and poppy 
plantation located on an area of 50,000 square meters and 
containing about 450,000 plants. It was situated in the 
mountains of Guerrero State. 
  This accumulation of drugs was intended for the narcotics 
markets in the states of California, Texas, and Arizona, and 
represented millions of doses. 
  The department's local office in Baja California, headed by 
Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacios, reported that, in a simultaneous 
operation conducted with public safety personnel in Tijuana, the 
PJF seized one ton, 348 kg, and 600 grams of marijuana 
discovered on the streets of Guadalupe Victoria in that town's 
Colonia Guerrero. Arrested in the operation were Samuel Mendoza 
Valdez and Ubaldo Campa Mejia who, according to preliminary 
investigation 561-94, were waiting for other members of their 
criminal organization to arrive with a vehicle to smuggle the 
drugs into the United States. 
  In that same state, in the vicinity of Tijuana, a shipment 
of 
cannabis indica weighing one ton and 74 kg was intercepted. It 
was being carried by Gonzalo Banuelos Montano on a fifth wheel 
type truck, hidden under hundreds of drums of gypsum from 
Tonala, Jalisco. [passage omitted] 
  Another ton, 236 kg, and 900 grams of marijuana was seized 
by 
federal agents in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where they arrested 
Miguel Angel Loa Rodriguez, Gabriel Melchor Ontiveros, and 
Griselda Garcia Nunez. They were carrying the drugs in the false 
bottom of a platform installed on a pickup truck. Confiscated 
with the drugs were two rifles, a 22 and a .410 caliber, as well 
as a 22 caliber revolver, concealed in the back of the vehicle's 
cab. Presumed to have been heading for San Antonio, Texas, the 
subjects were captured on a trail near the Rio Grande. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the state representative, Joel Ortiz Hernandez, 
in the municipality of Tecpan de Galeana, located in Guerrero's 
sierra area, approximately 450,000 marijuana and poppy plants 
were destroyed and incinerated.
