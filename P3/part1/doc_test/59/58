  [Text] Mexico City, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Secretariat of National Defense reported that various national 
institutions are conducting counternarcotics operations this

  Mexican troops have conducted operations in Mexico, Sinaloa, 
Durango, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Oaxaca, 
Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Guerrero, Zacatecas, 
Aguascalientes, San Luis de Potosi, Guanajuato, Queretaro,

  In the communique, the Secretariat of Defense indicated that 
these operations were not carried out solely in Guerrero State, 
where local media reported a "massive troop presence." 
  The communique indicated that operations staged in 21 states 
on 1 June resulted in the arrest of 10 local drug traffickers, 
the destruction of 2,242 drug crops, four drug traffickers' 
camps, and a marijuana drier. 
  Officials also incinerated 323 kg of marijuana seeds, 30 kg 
of poppy seeds, and two kg of cocaine and confiscated 233 
firearms and two vehicles. 
  The institution said that in addition to the 
counternarcotics 
operations, authorities will also apply the "Federal Law on
