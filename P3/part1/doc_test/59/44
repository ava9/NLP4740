  [Text] Yesterday, with reconnaissance, inspection, and 
detection flights, the air teams from the Attorney General's 
Office [PGR] discovered two marijuana and poppy plantations in 
Baja California and Sinaloa States. Presumed drug trafficking 
groups were growing over 200,000 drug plants on these 
plantations. The confiscation of farm implements, fuel, gun 
loaders, and useful cartridges was also announced. No arrests 
were made. 
  Reports sent to Mexico City by Arturo Ochoa Palacios, the 
PGR 
representative in Baja California, state that, on the boundary 
of the communities of Real del Castillo and Viejo Enecua, in the 
municipality of Mexicali, a marijuana plantation on 
approximately 15,000 square meters was discovered. 
  Mario Ruiz Massieu, assistant attorney for local offices and 
inspection, was informed that, on that expanse, 7,500 seedbeds 
were located, each with 25 plants, ready to be transplanted to 
solid ground. Found on the site, adjoining the Ojos Negros 
highway, were picks, shovels, hoes, machetes, axes, a jug 
containing gasoline, two 22-caliber rifles, and useful 
cartridges. 
  Continuing the investigation, agents under orders from 
Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] deputy 
commissioner, also confiscated a pickup truck with state of 
California registration 2JDE320, and a filled loader for a 7.62 
caliber rifle. These items were left at the social 
representative's disposal. 
  Moreover, Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, the PGR's 
representative in Sinaloa, reported that, in the hamlet called 
Las Playitas, in the municipality of Sinaloa de Leyva, a mixed 
(marijuana and poppy) plantation was located. The 21 drug crops 
being grown there were destroyed manually and incinerated by 
federal agents. 
  It was added that the community had participated in the 
discovery of those crops, since it reported in a telephone call 
that groups of persons acting suspiciously were often meeting on 
that site. This prompted the Federal Judicial Police to 
intervene, resulting in the destruction of the illicit plants. 
  The PJF deputy commissioner in this state, Eduardo Salazar 
Carrillo, informed the force's general director, Adrian Carrera 
Fuentes, that hoes, shovels, fumigation pumps, fertilizers, and 
insecticides were also discovered and seized on that site. 
  The PGR stressed in conclusion that, in both cases, the 
investigations are being continued to identify and capture the 
crop owners, as well as those who provided their services to 
plant and produce the drugs.
