'I AM a thorough softy when it comes to animals. I love them. Dogs and cats
are my passion. Their love is unchanging, unconditional and unbounding in
warm kisses and wiggling bodies.'
What ever happens to screen goddesses when they retire? Like pet-lovers
Doris Day and Brigitte Bardot, whom no journalist today can approach without
a written affidavit that he is dotty about moggies or doggies, Palm
Springs-based Ginger Rogers has given up humanity for a larger love. Make
that two larger loves; for she also has religion. 'I owe my health and
happiness to it,' she confides. And she says farewell to the reader with the
single word 'Blessings.'
Thinly disguised as an autobiography, Ginger My Story is a guide to the
dottinesses, woolly thinking and PR postures a screen diva is encouraged to
subscribe to during a long, long career. They give her by retirement age an
understandable readiness to retreat from humanity. Between 1930 and 1965, in
which time she made 70 films, Rogers lived in a world where the adulation of
others was her daily bread and where make-believe kept edging off the screen
into her life.
Her book alternates well-polished mythopoeic anecdotes, like the one about
the blue ostrich-feather dress that got up Fred Astaire's nose in Top Hat's
'Cheek by cheek' number, with a screen diva's usual have-I-missed-anyone-out
roll call of males in her life. These seem to have included absolutely
everyone: from silent star Lew Ayres (first husband) to Cary Grant
(unrequited love) to the indefatigable Howard Hughes (late of Katharine
Hepburn's autobiography).
I wish I liked Miss Rogers in print as much as on screen. Her early film
career, before a Best Actress Oscar for Kitty Foyle gave her delusions of
grandeur, was a delight. She was a fresh, mickey-taking presence. But this
book is ponderous when it is not fluffy. Much goody-two-shoes complimenting
of her peers goes together with bits of unattractive bitchery. (Do we need
two stories of Fred Astaire's toupee falling off?) The final pages savour of
valedictory smugness as our heroine passes from one award ceremony to the
next, thanking her fans, waving at her autograph-hunters and moving at last
towards the uncritical love-glow of her cats and dogs.
Edith de Rham's Joseph Losey shows how one distinguished American film-maker
dealt with all that Hollywood flummery. He walked out on it. Losey left
America in the 1950s, banishing himself to England with a little
encouragement from the House Un - American Activities Committee. HUAC had
been showing an unhealthy interest in Losey's supposed Communist sympathies.
If he had such sympathies, the Wisconsin-born director soon transmuted them
into something rich and strange. He found the perfect screenwriting partner
in Harold Pinter and produced a series of baroque, sardonic visions of the
British class system in films like The Servant, Accident and The Go-Between.
Miss de Rham does not exactly warm to Mr Losey, but then who did? He
presented a morose and misanthropic exterior that brightened up only on the
film set. But he was a movie artist of beguiling mystery. The obliquity of
his work was its richest feature - making one regret that he never realised
his cherished project of filming Proust - and Losey's move to Britain and
later Europe added subtle layers of old-world enigma to the new-world
idealism with which he was born.
Miss de Rham is scanty with source notes and relies on clippings more than
confidants. But she provides at least one revealing witness. Losey's
favourite actor Dirk Bogarde testifies to the human Losey by recalling
everything from crying fits to an illness bout that made the film-maker hand
over directing reins for ten days on The Servant to Bogarde himself. What
are the auteur theorists going to say about that?
Some auteurs have cast-iron claims to the title. If a man writes his films
as well as directing them, like the 1940s screwball comedy specialist
Preston Sturges (The Palm Beach Story, The Lady Eve), no one can deny him
authorship. But what about Preston Sturges On Preston Sturges? Did Preston
Sturges write that?
Not quite. Edited and arranged into autobiographical shape from Sturges's
diaries and letters, the book is a pretend-memoir devised by his widow
Sandy. It is still a pacy, delightful read, full of detail and persuasively
modelled on the whipcrack-witty style of PS's own movie dialogue.
