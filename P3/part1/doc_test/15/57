Tom Tellefsen, chairman of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., and his band of 
trustees brought in $500,000 this week toward their goal to raise $8.3 million 
for Adventure Island, the Los Angeles Zoo's soon-to-debut attraction. That 
leaves $1 million before the public grand opening May 5. 
</P>
<P>
With confidence, GLAZA is putting invitations into the mail to about 1,000 for 
the Preview Gala for both children and adults April 30. Betty White Ludden, Jim 
and Gloria Stewart and Mayor Tom Bradley are among those receiving them, along 
with corporate leaders and their kids and grandkids. Adventure Island, totally 
funded by individual and corporate/foundation donors, will showcase the wonders 
of Southwest animals. 
</P>
<P>
For the party, Someone's in the Kitchen Catering will pour out genuine Western 
cuisine and the Reinsmen will blast the rustic songs. Zoorific Theater will be 
there to tell tall tales about sea lions, sidewinders, scorpions, prairie dogs, 
cougars (the mascots of Adventure Island). The kids there on the first night 
will get the inaugural opportunities to use the interactive teaching devices as 
well as see the animal nursery and the theater for daily animal shows.

YOU'RE THE STARS: Oscars, Emmys, Tonys and Grammys aside, United Way calls 
givers their stars, and George F. Moody, general campaign chairman, and the 
United Way Campaign Cabinet say "You Are the Stars" when they host what is 
anticipated to be a victory celebration April 13 at the University Sheraton. 
Clarence Brown, director of media affairs, notes, "We expect to reach our 
$89-million goal this year, so we expect a big turnout -- 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
It's expected to be the largest amount ever raised by United Way. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATE: Doheny Mansion in Chester Place will be the place April 14 for a 
gala "Celebrate" for Sister Magdalen Coughlin, retiring president of Mount St. 
Mary's College. Caroline W. Nahas and David L. McIntyre co-chair the black-tie 
affair. It's intended to salute Sister Magdalen's community contributions. 
She'll continue her task of fund raising for the college, but relinquish the 
day-by-day running of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
EASTER MONDAY: Easter Monday came and went without the traditional Presentation 
Ball presented by Social Service Auxiliary. That's because the prominent 
affair, long held on Easter Monday, moves to June 5 this year when 31 young 
women from communities throughout Southern California will be presented to 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Jayne Sullivan is ball chairman, and with her husband, Roger Sullivan, will be 
presenting their fifth daughter. The ball committee meets April 12 to finalize 
plans, and among those involved will be June Ganey, Evelyn Vodhanel, Anne 
Porteous, Marge Hegener, Marjorie Pings, Nancy Gibbs, Mary Lou Workman, Helen

same sight that greets the President as he steps through his own front door.
