WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT 
</P>
<P>
Dense, satisfying, feverishly inventive and a technical marvel, this 1988 
live-action/animation blockbuster hit is a sort of inked-in film noir with 
outrageous sight gags. Bob Hoskins stars as a seedy gumshoe, and the film's 
mystery plot involves a last, great roundup of cartoon stars. Directed by 
Robert Zemeckis, with Oscar winner Richard Williams as director of animation.
