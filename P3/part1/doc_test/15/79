IT'S A DOCUMENTARY

I feel I have to respond to some of the Feb. 18 letters about the movie "Roger 
&amp; Me."

Only a fool (or a member of the motion picture academy's documentary board) 
defines documentary as objective nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
From "Nanook of the North" to "The Thin Blue Line," documentary has inhabited a 
region between fiction and journalism. Documentary is a form designed for 
filmic essays, and it encourages partiality and bias. I don't know anybody who 
walked into "Roger &amp; Me" expecting an impartial overview of the situation 
in Flint, Mich. I expected to see one man's view of that situation, and that is 
what I saw.

<P>
Letter writer Tony Thomas chastises Warner Bros. for having a profit motive in 
releasing this film. Warner deserves every penny it makes from "Roger &amp; 
Me," and I can only hope it will be encouraged to back many more projects that 
will have an equally irritating effect on Thomas and his ilk.
