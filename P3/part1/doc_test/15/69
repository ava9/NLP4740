Roger Craig, the San Francisco 49ers star running back, has had a steady stream 
of modeling and acting jobs since he started appearing in Macy's California 
Passport fashion shows. Now he's doing ads for Calvin Klein underwear and for 
various drinks and shoes favored by jocks. And then there are his TV-host and 
exercise-video careers. If you think he's ready for a starring role in a movie, 
you're right: Craig plays a cop in a Roger Corman action film due out next 
month.

NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: Guy Greengard, the genial owner of the Mr. Guy store who 
left Rodeo for Canon Drive less than a year ago and recently filed a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy petition, says it isn't over yet. "The location just hasn't worked 
out traffic-wise," he told Listen. But he added that he will probably open 
another, smaller store soon.

VAL'S PALS: Italian fashion king Valentino will be wined and dined Beverly 
Hills-style when he arrives in town Nov. 25 to celebrate the recent opening of 
his store at Two Rodeo Drive. Reported plans include Swifty Lazar's dinner at 
Spago, Betsy Bloomingdale's lunch at home and Barry Diller's dinner at an 
undetermined location. The capper is Valentino's own cocktail party at the new 
store Nov. 28, with a cast of several hundred including "so many stars it will 
look like the Academy Awards," says his new West Coast spokeswoman, Laurie 
Bodor.

BACK TO SQWEAR ONE: Although he says he enjoyed helping pioneer the brightly 
colored wardrobes the New Kids on The Block wear in their Coca-Cola 
commercials, designer William Beranek, who co-founded L.A.-based Sqwear with 
designer Henry Duarte, will step out on his own this holiday season. He has a 
new line of contemporary men's apparel under the William B. label, to be 
carried at J. C. Amber in Hollywood and Traffic in Los Angeles. He's gone 
mainstream, but Beranek assures Listen his star-wardrobing days are not 
numbered. Late night talk show host Arsenio Hall and singer Stevie B. have 
placed orders between $220 and $600, he says.

THE 18-K HEDGE: What recession? Gianmaria Buccellati, designer and owner of the 
Buccellati jewelry and silver company, unveiled about $20-million worth of his 
latest designs, including diamonds and gold worked to resemble a delicate 
Venetian lace choker ($309,000). "Yes, there is a little contraction (in 
business)," he said, "but I'm a worldwide jeweler, so one day if it's not good 
in the United States, it is in Japan or France or Italy." COMPILED BY THE
