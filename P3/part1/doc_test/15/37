A HOLLYWOOD ENDING FOR THE WHEELER OSCAR SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the moment, the brightest star on Hollywood Boulevard is William Kaiser, a 
41-year-old former hospital administrator from Tuxedo Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In a private awards ceremony Friday in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel -- the location of the first Academy Awards ceremony 61 years 
ago -- Kaiser surprised 84-year-old art director Lyle Wheeler by reuniting him 
with the Oscar he won in 1959 for "The Diary of Anne Frank." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler was assisted to the podium by his son, Brook, and he graciously 
accepted the award for a second time, on this occasion from actress Terry 
Moore, who worked with Wheeler on eight films, including "Daddy Longlegs" 
(1955) and "Peyton Place" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe I was ever going to see even one of these again," Wheeler 
said, looking down with moist eyes at the golden statuette -- now worn and 
pitted by time -- clutched tightly in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he planned to do with the Oscar, Wheeler evoked laughter and a 
warm applause from the small crowd of friends, family and press when he said, 
"Well, I want to put it someplace where it won't be stolen." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kaiser stood proudly and silently behind, letting Wheeler soak up 
the attention, while realizing a personal dream of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, who flew into Los Angeles only three days earlier, depleted most of his 
savings account of 16 years to come up with the $21,250 necessary to purchase 
the Oscar from a Long Beach couple who stumbled across Wheeler's 24-karat 
plated statuette -- and four more just like it -- three years ago at a storage 
facility auction. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, considered the "dean of art directors," has worked on more than 400 
films and was nominated for 29 art direction Academy Awards over his 50-year 
career. He won five of them, his first for "Gone With the Wind" in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
After financial setbacks forced Wheeler out of his home and into a Santa Monica 
hotel room, he packed his belongings -- including all five of the Oscars -- 
into cardboard boxes and placed them in storage. As Wheeler plummeted deeper 
into debt, his storage bill soared to more than $30,000, until the storage 
facility finally auctioned off his goods to pay his bill. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser was having dinner with his wife, Joan, when he heard on the evening news 
that Wheeler's Oscars were in the possession of the Long Beach couple who were 
planning to auction them off. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his room at the Orchid Hotel in Hollywood Tuesday night, Kaiser 
recalled the moment with a trembling voice: "I couldn't believe it. My wife 
turned to me and said, 'Oh, do you know who he is?' 'Know who he is? Every 
other movie on television has his name on it!' All kinds of emotions flooded 
me: I was angry, I was depressed, I was moved. But mostly I felt very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser, whose words run together faster and tighter than thoroughbreds 
rounding a turn at Churchill Downs, is a man with a boyish face that lights up 
when the theater lights go down. He is an encyclopedia of movie trivia who 
worked as a film librarian for a year before earning a nursing degree to make 
ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbearable to think of Lyle reduced to the situation he was in without 
his Oscars," he said. "Tears came to my eyes. I decided right there to act, to 
do everything I could within my power to restore those Oscars to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser tracked down Malcolm Willits, an acknowledged Hollywood artifact expert 
who conducts monthly auctions from his Collector's Book Store, one of the 
world's largest collections of Hollywood memorabilia, on Hollywood Boulevard at 
Vine Street. Since last March, Willits has auctioned or sold six Oscars for an 
average price of $12,000. Willits was to auction the "Anne Frank" Oscar on 
March 7 on behalf of the Long Beach couple until a temporary restraining order 
was issued to Willits by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court order was intended to prevent February's 
scheduled auction of a duplicate of producer Mike Todd's 1956 best picture 
Oscar for "Around the World in 80 Days," put up for sale by his grandson, Cyrus 
Todd. (The original is reportedly locked in a Swiss bank vault belonging to 
Elizabeth Taylor, Todd's wife when he received the award.) Oscar recipients 
sign an agreement upon acceptance that requires them or their heirs to offer 
the gold-plated statuettes back to the academy for the sum of $1 before ever 
attempting to sell or dispose of them. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Todd matter was settled, Willits decided to pull the "Anne Frank" 
Oscar off the auction block. But he did not remove it from private sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The academy bylaws were not carried down from Mt. Sinai by Moses, and they're 
not constitutional," said Willits, who received a 20% commission for sale of 
the "Anne Frank" Oscar. "They're forcing people who want to sell Oscars to 
skulk in back alleys, where real values can't be established. I don't like the 
academy telling us what we can and can't sell. We've never coerced anyone into 
selling an Oscar. They come to us. It's a free market, and I'm an auctioneer." 
</P>
<P>
(In a judgment Friday, the restraining order was upheld and Willits was issued 
a permanent injunction, effectively barring the further sale or auction of the 
Todd Oscar. Willits is considering an appeal.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not condone the sale of Oscars," Kaiser said. "In fact, I'm adamantly 
opposed to them. In this case, I think it was a necessary evil (to participate 
in the purchase). It was the only avenue I had available to restore Lyle's 
Oscar to him." 
</P>
<P>
Although the academy has gone to great lengths recently to prevent the sale and 
auctioning of statuettes, executive administrator Bruce Davis said: "Any 
arrangement that results in the return of Lyle Wheeler's Oscars to the hands of 
their rightful owner is justified with the academy." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there is a move afoot by a group of older Academy members to 
grant Wheeler an honorary Academy Award during Oscar ceremonies Wednesday 
night. "We feel that Lyle has been maligned by the academy," said 
actress-journalist Vanessa Brown, 61, a longtime academy member. "We feel he 
deserves to be honored with a humanitarian award while he's still living." 
</P>
<P>
At press time, the academy had no plans to present its Gene Hersholt 
Humanitarian Award this year, a spokesman said. The board of governors, which 
selects recipients for the award, last met Feb. 13, two days before the Oscar 
nominations were announced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bounty paid for the "Anne Frank" statuette is the most ever for an Oscar. 
Kaiser, who earned about $37,000 a year as a hospital administrator and nurse 
before he quit his job in December, used the money he and his wife had been 
saving since their marriage 16 years ago to honor Wheeler with the award. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not upset where the money is going," said Joan Kaiser Wednesday from her 
home in Tuxedo Park, as she prepared to fly the couple's two children to 
California to be with their father. "We're not taking food out of our mouths. 
It was savings we had in the bank. Bill has always loved movies, and this is 
just a natural extension of his passions. I always knew he would end up in 
Hollywood somehow." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bill is just an extremely generous movie fan who feels that an 
injustice has been done," said 31-year-old Brook Wheeler, who plans in April to 
move his father into the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement home in Woodland Hills for indigent and ill people from 
the entertainment industry. "We can't understand why he's doing this, but 
that's because we're so jaded out here. I sort of wondered why other members of 
the entertainment industry, who are aware of this situation, haven't come forth 
to reckon with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis reported that since Wheeler's story was made public last month, a number 
of former award winners have contacted the academy to inform him they are 
making arrangements to bequeath their Oscars back to the academy upon their 
deaths. Wheeler, too, has stipulated that the "Anne Frank" Oscar will be 
returned to the academy when he dies. 
</P>
<P>
One Oscar purchased in a Willits' auction was returned this month. Universal 
Studios theme park in Florida paid the previous record, $17,715, for Thomas 
Little's 1941 black-and-white interior-decoration Oscar for "How Green Was My 
Valley." When the parent company in Universal City got wind of the purchase, it 
reacted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I returned the Oscar personally to (academy president) Richard Kahn on behalf 
of MCA," said David Weitzner, Universal's president of worldwide marketing. 
"We're more sensitive to these issues on the West Coast. I'm an academy member 
and take my membership very seriously. If we had known that it was being 
purchased, we never would have approved the sale." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach couple, Sherry, 42, and her live-in companion, Tom, 31 (they do 
not wish to reveal their surnames), say they have no immediate plans for the 
remaining four Wheeler Oscars. The couple are reportedly going to use their 
share of the $17,000 they received for the "Anne Frank" Oscar to remodel their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could afford to give up something so valuable, we would," said Sherry in 
a telephone interview she initiated Wednesday. "We couldn't be happier that the 
Oscar is going back to Lyle. And people are happy for us, too. They say, 
'Congratulations, you deserve it.' We're not bad people. But the press has 
turned us into monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing the "Anne Frank" Oscar and returning it to Wheeler, Kaiser said 
he hopes to kill the market for future Oscar sales. Willits, who recently put 
his entire memorabilia collection up for sale, has not made it clear whether he 
will give up Oscar auctioning if his store sells. 
</P>
<P>
"People sit there in their easy chair and say, 'Oh, if I had those Oscars I'd 
give them back,' " Sherry said. "But they wouldn't. It's human nature. Money 
isn't what life is all about, but it's important. It's what we need to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much talk of money," Kaiser said. "There's a moral issue involved. 
A human issue. People have to think more about other people. You can't put a 
dollar sign in front of everything. There are some things that just don't have 
a monetary value." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser quit nursing three months ago to pursue his dream of working in film or 
television production. When asked if the purchase of Wheeler's Oscar was a 
publicity stunt to launch his career, Wheeler's shining eyes went blank. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be naive, but when I called Willits, I figured he probably had already 
received 100 offers just like mine," Kaiser said softly. Willits told The Times 
that he had received no other offers to purchase any of Wheeler's Oscars for 
return to him. "I suppose I didn't know what I was doing," Kaiser said. "I just 
knew what I had to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good. Yeah, I feel good about this whole thing. I'm just glad I was 
able to get the Oscar and return it. I felt like if I could just hand the Oscar 
to Lyle and see a smile on his face, that would be enough. If nothing else 
comes of it, I will always carry this feeling with me -- what I was able to do 
for somebody else."
