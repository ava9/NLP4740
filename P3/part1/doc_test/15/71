Rogers Communications, Canada's leading cable TV operator, has finally won
Maclean Hunter, a leading Canadian and US cable and publishing group, with a
bid worth about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn).
Rogers yesterday raised its five-week-old offer from CDollars 17 to CDollars
17.50 per share and extended the expiry date from March 15 to March 31.
This delay was needed because the US Federal Communications Commission must
rule on Rogers' proposal to sell-off Maclean Hunter's US cable interests, a
ruling which could not be received by March 15.
Maclean Hunter shareholders will get CDollars 17 a share, plus 50 cents a
share to be paid via a special dividend from Maclean Hunter, assuming the
Rogers' bid is completed. But they will not share in the proceeds of the
sale of Maclean Hunter's US cable network.
Both Mr Garfield Emerson, chairman of Rogers, and Mr Ronald Osborne,
president of Maclean Hunter, said the price was fair. The Maclean Hunter
board recommended the offer to all its shareholders. Maclean Hunter's poison
pill shareholder protection plan will be waived.
Rogers has said it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable interests to reduce
debt assumed for the takeover. It has also said it may sell Maclean Hunter's
Canadian publishing interests, since its primary aim was to get control of
Maclean Hunter's valuable Canadian cable business concentrated in southern
Ontario.
