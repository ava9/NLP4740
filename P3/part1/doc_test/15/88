MICHAEL BOLTON, RONSTADT WIN POP GRAMMYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Bolton was named top pop male vocalist over the late Roy Orbison, the 
evening's sentimental favorite, and Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville were cited 
for best vocal by a pop duo as the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards telecast got under 
way Wednesday evening at the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz great Miles Davis was certain of one award even before the three-hour CBS 
program began. Along with former Beatle Paul McCartney, the celebrated 
trumpeter was to be honored with a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, who has won four previous Grammys, also picked up his fifth and 
sixth Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
During pre-telecast ceremonies -- in which 61 of the evening's 77 awards were 
announced -- Davis was saluted for best jazz instrumental performance by a big 
band during 1989 and for best jazz instrumental by a soloist, both in 
connection with his album, "Aura." 
</P>
<P>
The Recording Academy was also scheduled to give two posthumous Lifetime 
Achievement Awards during the telecast to singer Nat King Cole and pianist 
Vladimir Horowitz. Dick Clark was to be presented with a Trustees Award, for 
achievements in the non-performing side of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of the National 
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, a nonprofit organization formed to 
represent all segments of the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt was one of the evening's other multiple winners. She was saluted 
for best female rock vocal and traditional blues recording, sharing the latter 
with John Lee Hooker for their duet on "I'm in the Mood." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists who received multiple awards included British soul-dance group 
Soul II Soul and composer-arranger Dave Grusin. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul won the R&amp;B group vocal award for the single "Back to Life," 
and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for "African Dance," a selection from the 
group's "Keep on Movin' " album. The group, however, lost in the more-prized 
best new artist category to the duo Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
Grusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more. They were for 
the background score of the film "The Fabulous Baker Boys," instrumental 
arrangement for the suite from the film "The Milagro Beanfield War" and 
instrumental arrangement with a vocal for the rendition of "My Funny Valentine" 
in "'Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Traveling Wilburys, the veteran rock superstar quintet that was widely 
viewed in the recording industry as the betting favorite in the competition for 
key album of the year, were also honored during the pre-telecast portion of the 
program for the best group vocal in rock. 
</P>
<P>
The group consists of rock veterans Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom 
Petty and Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour's "Cult of Personality" single was named best hard rock 
performance of 1989, shutting out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock 
band Guns N' Roses. The latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly 
racist remarks in a song, "One in a Million," that was included in its "GN'R 
Lies" album, which was a contender in the hard-rock category. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the 
self-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday, 
handing out leaflets that branded "One in a Million" as racist for its use of 
racial epithets, and New York rap group's Public Enemy's "Welcome to the 
Terrordome" as anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy -- whose "Fight the Power" single was a nominee in the rap 
category -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others for possible 
anti-Semitic attitudes since a controversial interview by Professor Griff, the 
group's former "minister of information," that appeared last May in the 
Washington Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Both Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of 
Public Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category Wednesday is likely 
to stir criticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to 
think of Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. In picking up his first 
Grammy for his contributions to the "When Harry Meets Sally" film sound track 
album, Connick defeated past jazz Grammy winners Joe Williams and George 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
Two names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee 
Jones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. They teamed up 
on a version of "Makin' Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in jazz, blues and rock fields, was 
named best female jazz vocalist for her album, "Blues on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
The Pat Metheny Group was honored for jazz fusion performance for the fifth 
time since the category was initiated in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Chick Corea, who had won seven previous Grammys, was honored for best jazz 
group instrumental for his album, "Chick Corea Akoustic Band." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown was named best male R&amp;B vocalist, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's 
"If You Don't Know Me by Now" was named best R&amp;B song. 
</P>
<P>
In the country field, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Will the Circle Be 
Unbroken, Volume Two" was associated with three awards. The band itself won a 
Grammy for best group vocal, defeating the Judds, who had finished on top in 
this category two of the last three years. The band also shared a Grammy with 
Bruce Hornsby for best blue grass recording, while Randy Scruggs was cited as 
best country instrumentalist for his work on a song, "Amazing Grace," that 
appeared on the "Circle" album. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Crowell's "After All This Time" was declared best country song. 
</P>
<P>
The Indigo Girls' debut album was judged the top contemporary folk recording. 
The traditional folk Grammy was awarded to the Bulgarian State Female Vocal 
Choir, a group that had made a considerable pop splash during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance. 
</P>
<P>
The late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word 
recording for her, "It's Always Something." 
</P>
<P>
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was named best musical cast show album. 
</P>
<P>
In the composition categories, Carly Simon's "Let the River Run" (from the film 
"Working Girl") was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's 
"Batman" theme was voted best instrumental composition.
