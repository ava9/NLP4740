A UC San Diego chemical oceanographer who has concentrated on finding solutions 
to ocean pollution has been named as co-recipient of the nation's most 
prestigious environmental science award. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Goldberg of UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, will 
receive the Tyler Prize tonight at a dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg shares the $150,000 prize with Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist in 
West Germany, who in 1982 co-wrote the scientific paper that originated the 
ideas behind what was later termed "nuclear winter." 
</P>
<P>
The paper proposed that a nuclear war would have the previously unanticipated 
result of sending so much smoke into the atmosphere that it would threaten life 
worldwide by blocking out the sun. The director of the prestigious Max Planck 
Institute for Chemistry in West Germany, Crutzen also was instrumental in the 
early recognition that man-made chemicals might deplete the Earth's protective 
ozone later. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining Scripps in 1949, Goldberg has dedicated his career to monitoring 
ocean pollution and finding ways to remedy it. He worked to get the state 
Legislature to ban toxic tributyl tin marine paints in California and proposed 
and inaugurated the widely used program to monitor pollution by measuring the 
levels of contaminants in mussels. 
</P>
<P>
"Edward Goldberg is the most innovative, influential scholar to ponder, 
investigate, write and speak about ocean pollution problems," said John W. 
Farrington, professor of environmental sciences at the University of 
Massachusetts, in commenting on the award. 
</P>
<P>
Established to honor landmark discoveries confirming humanity's capacity to 
upset the global environmental balance, the Tyler Prize was endowed in 1973 by 
Alice C. Tyler and her late husband, John C. Tyler, who founded Farmers 
Insurance Group. The prize is administered by USC. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Prize winners are selected by a committee of scientists from nominations 
received worldwide. There have been 25 recipients, including UC San Diego 
founder Roger Revelle in 1984.
