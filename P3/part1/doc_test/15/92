FT  27 APR 92 / Executive pay rises attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Institute of Management has criticised executives after a survey
found that directors of big businesses awarded themselves pay rises
averaging 9.3 per cent last year.
The institute survey, published today, found that employees received rises
of about 8 per cent while middle managers were awarded about 6.3 per cent.
Mr Roger Young, BIM director general, said directors of large companies
should heed the example of managers. 'They must take a long hard look at
their remuneration packages and ask themselves if their increases are
justified.' He added: 'Now we are in recession they must be seen to be
tightening their belts along with everyone else.'
He warned that directors who continued to reward themselves far more than
their employees would 'have to answer for it'. He said: 'The politics of
envy will ensure that increases in taxation will greatly reduce their real
earnings.'
