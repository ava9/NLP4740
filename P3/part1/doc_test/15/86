Rogers Communications was yesterday considering a delay in the expiry date
for its CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.08bn) bid for Maclean Hunter, the
Canadian publishing and cable TV group, from March 15 to the end of the
month because a US regulatory ruling will probably not be received by next
week.
Rogers, Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, applied on March 3 for
fast-track approval by the Federal Communications Commission of its proposed
acquisition of Maclean Hunter's US cable TV business and licences. This is a
key step in Rogers' plan to acquire all of the group, including the US and
Canadian cable interests and Canadian publishing businesses.
Rogers has said it would eventually sell the US cable licences to help pay
for its overall bid for Maclean Hunter. But the FCC indicated it could not
process Rogers' application in time for the March 15 expiry date. It
promised to disclose its timetable late yesterday.
The extension of the expiry date would give Maclean Hunter more time to
organise a counterbid.
Shares deposited under the Rogers offer cannot be withdrawn after March 8
unless the offer is subsequently amended. Rogers was to hold its annual
meeting in Toronto today.
Rogers and Shaw Communications, Canada's third biggest cable TV company,
have now agreed to swap some of their cable systems. The result would be
that Rogers would take control of the key Toronto area in return for selling
two western Canada systems.
