After gangs, drugs and alcohol became a way of life, David Mendenhall decided 
it was time to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
The road to sobriety has not been an easy one, but with determination 
Mendenhall has been clean and sober for the past year and a half. In honor of 
his turnaround, the Culver City Council presented him with a commendation and 
proclaimed Nov. 26 David Mendenhall Day. 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall, 19, who lives in Culver City, said the biggest lesson he's learned 
is the importance of time and how to work with it even when times are hard. "I 
want to set a good example," he said. "I want to be someone who has made a 
difference in the community." He also attributes the turnaround to his 
involvement with the American Youth Awards program. Since 1973, the program has 
honored and awarded youths who have made positive impressions and achievements 
in society. At Saturday night's 1990 American Youth Awards ceremony at the 
Culver City Auditorium, Mendenhall was the recipient of the organization's 
highest award, the Founder's Award, given to a youth with a negative past who 
has turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote and produced a play for the evening. "I took my own life 
experiences and put it into a play, which will hopefully inspire other kids to 
make better lives for themselves," he said. "Every kid has a chance and they 
just have to take it."
