  [Abstract] A comparative analysis of the effect of air 
pollution young pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and spruce 
(Picea obovata L.) trees of the Central Urals focused 
on releases from the primary source of pollution of the 
Revdinsk- Pervouralsk Industrial Center -- the Sreduralmedzavod, 
a copper- processing plant. The principal components of the 
pollution over the past 50 years have been compounds of sulfur, 
nitrogen, copper, arsenic, and lead. The study involved six 
sectors -- three with stands of the pine, three with stands of 
the spruce. The sectors were 4, 15, and 25 km from the plant. 
Biometric characteristics of the stands fell the closer the 
study was to the plant. The atmospheric pollution was found to 
have a greater effect on the growth processes of the spruce. 
Electrophysiological studies indicated that the conductive 
properties of the trees were reduced and that the membrane 
system for the transport of water and ions in the tree trunks 
(the site of placement of the electrodes) was poorly developed. 
Overall, the spruce appeared to be more sensitive to the 
pollution than did the pine. References 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.
