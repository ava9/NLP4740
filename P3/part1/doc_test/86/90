SPEAKING OUT: A BOND WITH THOSE WHO COME AFTER US

When we first moved into our turn-of-the-century house -- my first house, 
actually -- and started the endless process of getting it into shape, it was 
discouraging to discover that while the original structure was remarkably solid 
and well-built, most of what had been changed or added over the years had been 
done poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Bad plumbing, shoddy electrical work and careless carpentry greeted us at every 
turn. In most instances cheap materials had been used, and fixtures improperly 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the day that water started flowing from the kitchen ceiling. We 
weren't certain which fixture upstairs was responsible until one day a guest 
took a fragrant-pine bath. 
</P>
<P>
As I watched the green water dripping into a bowl on my kitchen counter, and 
smelled the pine mingling with the garlic and herbs in my potage as it simmered 
on the stove, I wondered what sort of horror we were about to uncover. How 
could the bathtub be draining into the kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
The explanation was quite simple: the trap had been improperly located under 
the tub. It had rotted out and needed to be replaced. But to reach it, half the 
bathroom and a chunk of the kitchen ceiling had to be torn out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Did They Skimp? 
</P>
<P>
We decided that we might as well have the entire bathroom remodeled. As we 
began to plan for this work, we again asked ourselves the question we had 
already asked so often: 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't the effort made to do the job properly at the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
One probable answer was that doing the job right would have required additional 
outlays of time and money. And if the quality of the work in the house had been 
adequate for the lifetime of the people who had done the work, why should they 
have bothered with additional time and cost? 
</P>
<P>
As we gradually transformed our home over 10 years, the question of how the 
work should be done arose over and over. Each time we had to make a decision, 
we faced the same issue: 
</P>
<P>
How far beyond our own life span -- or house span -- should we be thinking? 
</P>
<P>
It would have been easier not to think about what we would be leaving behind 
for the people coming after us. But our own frustration at what we were finding 
made us determined to do everything the best way we could and to spend some 
extra money, if need be, to give our unknown friends-of-the-future something of 
value to work with, and work in. 
</P>
<P>
We also took stock of our landscaping attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow-Growing Trees 
</P>
<P>
I had wanted to plant fast-growing trees and shrubs, although I knew that the 
faster they grow, the shorter their life span. I was thinking only of myself. 
They certainly would have lasted long enough to give me pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
It took some reassessing of my own values before I saw the importance of 
planting slow-growing trees. Now I love the idea. And when I walk around my 
suburban neighborhood, I think often of my debt to those who, long ago, planted 
the majestic, slow-growing trees whose branches are like arms of friendship 
reaching across the generations. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, I asked myself why people should want to think of, or live 
for, those coming after them. I wondered what would persuade someone to do 
this. I asked myself how I would define the feelings I have now that make me 
want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Implausible as it may seem, I think it is the feeling of "parenting." 
</P>
<P>
When people have children, they always want to build for the children's future. 
They save and plan and do all in their power to make sure that their children 
are provided for. They care for their worldly goods so that they can pass them 
on intact, they care for the wisdom of generations so that their children will 
not forget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Will Inherit 
</P>
<P>
They do this because they love their children, and it is in the nature of love 
to stretch and transcend limits. I think that those who come after us are, in a 
very real sense, our children. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of human beings and creatures who have not yet made their 
appearance in the world will be inheriting from us. So clearly, the edge of the 
family circle can't be defined by time and space. Its circumference transcends 
all boundaries of past and future. 
</P>
<P>
We are so deeply indebted to past generations that we can't afford not to be 
deeply aware of those coming along after us. How much do we love them, what are 
we leaving them? Are we building the "house" well? 
</P>
<P>
Having said all this, there is one thing we did to our house that may, I fear, 
never be forgiven. We took up the oak floor in the hall and dining room in 
order to lay a classic, English-style black-and-white checkerboard floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see them now," I said to my husband, "standing here wringing their 
hands, moaning about how nobody in his right mind would rip our oak flooring to 
lay vinyl. Maybe we shouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed a Letter 
</P>
<P>
John reminded me that this was our house, our work of art. And I reminded 
myself of the difference between technical excellence and original style -- 
reminded myself that one of the most vital ideas we can ever pass to our 
"children" is that of the sanctity of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the installer came to lay the tiles, I gave him an envelope, 
and he obediently inserted it under one of the tiles in the dining room. It is 
a letter addressed to whomever tears out the black-and-white floor. 
</P>
<P>
It is both a greeting and an apology from their friends from the past, begging 
their indulgence for our one greatest liberty with "their" house. And 
expressing regret that they obviously hadn't liked what we had done. 
</P>
<P>
But at least they will know we were thinking of them, and that we cared.
