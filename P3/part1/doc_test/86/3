  [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, 
Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and 
other leading comrades of the party Central Committee planted 
trees, including the Huashan pine, lacebark pine, and weeping 
willows, at the Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park in Beijing's suburbs 
this morning. Thus, new trees were planted in this park, which, 
known as the garden of 10,000 gardens, has witnessed many 
vicissitudes of life. 
  The first Sunday of April is a voluntary tree-planting day 
for all people in the capital. At 1000 in the morning, Jiang 
Zemin and other leading comrades of the party Central Committee 
arrived at a hill beside the scenic Haiyuekaijin area in the 
Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park in the company of Chen Xitong, secretary 
of the Beijing municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, Beijing 
mayor; and Xu Youfang, minister of forestry. They then planted 
the Chinese pine, poplar, and willow trees symbolizing the hope 
of the future. 
  Planting trees with the leading comrades today were 50 Young 
Pioneers, who welcomed Jiang Zemin and the other comrades by 
saying in unison in their children's voice: "Little pine trees, 
grow up quickly with green needles and new branches; you are 
nurtured with sunshine and dew, grow up quickly, grow up 
quickly...." 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Chen Xitong 
planted a Huashan pine together. Chen Xitong told Jiang Zemin: 
"The trees planted by party Central Committee leading comrades 
last year are growing luxuriantly." Jiang Zemin smiled and 
said: "In planting trees, we are promoting a spirit. The 
post-planting management depends completely on park workers, and 
we are very grateful to them." Then, Jiang Zemin asked: "How 
many trees do we plan to plant today?" Chen Xitong answered: 
"Eighty trees, pines and willows." 
  After planting a tree, Jiang Zemin gladly gave these 
reporters an interview. Jiang Zemin said: Planting trees is an 
important task that can bring benefits to people of this and 
coming generations. We should step up our efforts to publicize 
the importance of tree planting and to enhance all citizens' 
awareness in this regard. He then said: Through years of 
effort, the percentage of forest covering our country has 
increased to 13 percent. We have made tremendous achievements 
in this respect. Compared with advanced countries, however, we 
still lag far behind. So we should persist in planting trees. 
  While planting trees, Premier Li Peng talked about its 
significance. He said: Thanks to more than 10 years of effort, 
people in various parts of the country have now attached great 
importance to tree planting, and people have enthusiastically 
taken part in such activities. As a result, we have scored 
gratifying achievements. However, we should also note that 
cases of felling trees or even destroying forests have occurred 
in some localities. We should step up education in this regard 
and manage forests according to law. The tree-planting momentum 
is pretty strong in some places, but the survival rate is not 
high. This calls for protecting trees and planting more trees 
to increase the survival rate. In some localities, a 
responsibility system is instituted under which barren hills are 
contracted out for tree planting. This practice is worth 
popularizing. 
  While planting trees with a spade, Li Peng inquired about 
Beijing Municipality's conditions. He asked Beijing Mayor Li 
Qiyan: "What are the price parities between the three different 
kinds of stocks issued by Beijing?" Li Qiyan answered: "They 
are as low as 1:3 and as high as 1:8." Then Li Peng said: 
"People should know that buying stocks involves risks." 
  Chairman Qiao Shi of the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee planted three Huashan pine trees in a row, 
without wiping the sweat from his forehead. When he planted a 
lacebark pine, two Young Pioneers brought a bucket of water for 
the pine. He said "we should plant trees conscientiously." 
Discussing environmental protection with comrades from Beijing, 
Li Ruihuan said: "Tremendous changes have taken place in 
Beijing these years. But there is still much to be done, and it 
is all the more necessary to step up work in environmental 
protection." Comrades from Beijing believed that environmental 
damage is mainly caused by people. Li Ruihuan said: "The 
quality of people is crucial. When people's quality is 
improved, many things can be done easily." 
  After planting trees, Jiang Zemin and other comrades wrote 
some words of encouragement for children on their notebooks. 
Jiang Zemin wrote: "Plant trees and educate people" and 
"Yuanmingyuan Park has witnessed many vicissitudes of life." Li 
Peng wrote: "Study hard and be a good successor." Li Ruihuan 
wrote: "Study well" and "Make progress every day." Li Huaqing 
wrote: "Try to be an outstanding student" and "Study well to be 
a successor." 
  Following this, Jiang Zemin and other comrades toured the 
Yuanmingyuan Memorial Hall. Jiang Zemin said: Planting trees 
at Yuanmingyuan Park today is of great significance. China had 
been bullied and humiliated by big powers for some 100 years in 
modern times. Since the founding of New China, the Chinese 
people have stood up. Yuanmingyuan is called a ruins park, with 
a view to letting people see the bitter history of how this 
bright pearl of the Eastern culture was ruined by foreign 
robbers. This will educate people in patriotism. Now we are 
planting trees here and renovating the park because we want 
people across the country and foreign friends to see the 
development and changes of our country. 
  Other leading comrades who participated in today's tree 
planting included Ding Guangen, Tian Jiyun, Li Lanqing, Li 
Tieying, Yang Baibing, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, Wang Hanbin, Ren 
Jianxin, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Luo Gan. Early this 
morning, more than 180 ministers, vice ministers, and other 
leading comrades from departments directly under the party 
Central Committee and the State Council and from the three 
general departments of the People's Liberation Army and the 
Beijing Military Region joined servicemen and people of the 
capital in voluntary tree-planting activities.
