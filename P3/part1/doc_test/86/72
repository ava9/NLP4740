GARDENING: PLANTS RETURN TO NATURE IN BOTANIST'S CORNER OF SUN VALLEY

Located in Sun Valley -- an apt location if only for the name -- is the 
Theodore Payne Foundation for Wildflowers and Native Plants. The nonprofit 
organization was incorporated in 1960 to carry on the work of its founder, 
botanist Theodore Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Payne, who studied the nursery and seed business in his native England, moved 
in 1893 to Southern California, where he continued to practice his trade. The 
botanist soon became interested in preserving the natural flora of his new 
home, particularly the wildflowers that were being lost to development even 
then. 
</P>
<P>
He cultivated the seeds of nearly 500 native shrubs, trees and flowers, and 
sold his plants at a succession of nurseries which he owned and operated for 
nearly 60 years. He wrote articles and frequently lectured on the subject of 
preserving wildflowers and native plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left His Mark 
</P>
<P>
Payne left his mark on many of the Southland's botanical gardens: He landscaped 
a wildflower garden in Exposition Park; inspired the Santa Barbara Botanical 
Garden, Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden, and worked with landscape architect 
Ralph Cornell in the development of what is now Torrey Pines State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the foundation maintains three major goals: to make native plants and 
seeds available to the public, to teach about the culture and uses of native 
plants, and to preserve rare and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-acre facility includes a nursery and growing yard and selling area, 
nature trails and an alder-and-sycamore-canopied picnic ground. Headquartered 
in a converted house, the foundation offices contain a library, bookstore, 
meeting rooms and a seed room. The phone never stops ringing; calls from 
frantic landscapers searching for natives are deftly handled by propagator Jan 
Busco, who maintains a protective attitude toward her plants. "They are in no 
condition to sell," she states about wooly blue curls. "Maybe in another 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The seed room, complete with an ancient seed cleaner, dusty cabinets and 
refrigerators that house the seeds, is the place where Payne's primary work 
continues today. Leading a tour group into the tiny, cluttered former garage, 
horticulturist Melanie Baer declares: "One of my divine inspirations in life is 
seeds. They have such persistence." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the tour of the grounds, Baer points out Payne's favorite California 
native, the Matilija poppy, and the California flannel bush, both of which 
should bloom in May. Moving into the cutting garden, she rattles off the 
scientific names of several of the 40 varieties of lilacs, most of which are in 
fragrant bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Several rare and endangered species are preserved here, including the Catalina 
ironweed and a manzanita that is now extinct in nature. "Why should we preserve 
them?" Baer asks rhetorically. "Because we don't know enough about them or what 
their benefits will be. We just don't want to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
Although the gardens are equipped with watering systems, they are watered only 
occasionally. Native plants, Baer reminds the group, are adapted to be drought- 
resistant. "We aren't doing anything revolutionary here," she says. "We're just 
trying to emulate natural conditions." 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic example of the foundation's success in emulating natural conditions 
is "Wildflower Hill," currently displaying a colorful array of at least 25 
native wildflowers. The project was started five years ago when volunteer Kevin 
Connelly began clearing the hill of invasive mustard and grasses. The hill then 
was seeded with wildflowers, and nature took over. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hill has not been reseeded in more than a year, it offers a larger 
display than was seen last year. "This self-perpetuating garden is a good 
lesson for reseeding," Baer observes. An easy zigzag hike up the hill offers a 
delightful assortment of blooms, including poppies, lupine, owl clover, cream 
cups and many more. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation operates a 24-hour wildflower hot line from March through May: 
(818) 768-3533. Updated weekly, the recorded message provides information about 
the location and types of wildflowers in bloom throughout the Southland. Its 
publications include "Exploring Wildflower Country," several maps, general 
information about where to find wildflowers, and the information-packed "A 
Southern California Nature Calendar" by Elna Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the foundation celebrates Poppy Day 
with a full range of activities, including educational displays, guided hikes, 
a sale of selected plants and books and other resources required to create a 
drought-tolerant garden. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore Payne Foundation is located at 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley, 
Calif. 91352; (818) 768-1802. Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through 
Saturday. Tax-deductible memberships and volunteer opportunities are available.
