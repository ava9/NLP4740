FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK Christmas tree buyers go
up-market - Customers want bushier varieties that do not drop their needles

Hormone therapy for Christmas trees might sound a bit far-fetched. But the
novel technique is being tested for the first time in the UK as part of a
drive by growers to respond to the demands of an increasingly discerning
public.
For decades British customers have been content to buy a traditional Norway
spruce at Christmas and sweep up the needles as they drop off in centrally
heated living rooms. But now the market - which takes over 5m trees worth at
least Pounds 50m a year - is demanding varieties with no 'needle drop' and
developing a taste for bushier or more scented types, with less spiky
needles.
Hormone therapy, already used in Denmark, involves spraying the central
leader, or main spike, of the Christmas tree to inhibit its growth and allow
the side branches to become more bushy.
Mr Joseph Noblett, a dealer based near Preston in Lancashire, plans to try
it out on top-priced Noble firs on several plots in Scotland next year. He
sells about 30,000 trees a year, most of which are Lodgepole pines from
Scotland - similar to Scots pines but with darker, straighter needles. Bushy
growth on these trees can be encouraged through seed selection without the
need for expensive hormone treatment.
'We believe there's been a significant growth in the market for Lodgepole
pines in the last couple of years, particularly in the north of England and
the Midlands,' he says.
Enthusiasm for the Lodgepole is a bonus for woodland owners, who have used
the trees for the past two decades as a 'nurse species' to force the growth
of Sitka spruce, the main timber tree. Lodgepoles are good at taking up
nutrients from deep, peaty soil, which they then transfer to the Sitkas as
their roots inter-link.
Normally they wither and die after 25 to 30 years as the Sitkas shade them
out, says Mr Bruce Taylor, forestry manager with Bell Ingram, a firm of
chartered surveyors, which manages 25,000 acres of commercial woodland on
estates in northern Scotland. However, the more recently introduced Alaskan
variety of Lodgepole is proving suitable for the Christmas tree market and
can provide landowners with a net return of up to Pounds 3 a tree when
harvested after seven to 10 years, once its 'nursing' role is over.
'The Lodgepole's main asset is that it holds its needles,' Mr Taylor
explains. 'It can be cut in October and still have its needles in
mid-January. The Norway spruce has to be cut in December, otherwise the
needles will fall off.'
The cost of Lodgepole or Scots pines is the same as or slightly more than
that of Norway spruces. Yet despite the recession, the biggest growth in the
market has been in the more elegant and expensive Nordmann and Noble firs,
according to the British Christmas Tree Growers' Association. These have
softer needles, stronger branches and a more pronounced scent and they
command a retail price of about Pounds 5 a foot, compared with Pounds 2 a
foot for a Norway spruce.
'People are keen to have real trees, and there's quite a lot of money
about,' says Mr Tony Richardson, the association's secretary. The market
share of the Nordmann fir has grown from 5 per cent to 15 per cent in the
past five years, while that of the Norway spruce has dropped from 75 per
cent to 60-65 per cent. As growers have learnt to shape Lodgepole and Scots
pines for the Christmas market, their share has risen to about 10 per cent.
Less than a fifth of the trees on sale in Britain this year are imported -
mainly from Denmark and Belgium. This is partly because expert Danes have
begun to grow Christmas trees in the UK and partly because British producers
are improving their methods.
Woodland managers like Bell Ingram are urging landowners to take advantage
of the Christmas market and increase production. Otherwise, they believe, UK
supplies of pines like the Lodgepole could become scarce because of the
decline in new timber plantings that followed the abolition of tax
concessions in 1988.
'The market is being built up just now, but it might disappear again,' says
Mr Taylor.
