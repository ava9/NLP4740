Middle Peak, in the middle of the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County, is 
the place for a summer saunter if you like tall trees. Encircling the peak are 
big specimens of silver fir and cedar, plus Coulter, sugar, Ponderosa and 
Jeffrey pines. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuyamacas' geographical location between coast and desert makes these 
mountains an unusual ecosystem. The 4,000- to 6,500-foot peaks host rich 
conifer forests. Cuyamaca Rancho State Park protects much of the mountains, 
which are a delight for bird watchers because desert, coastal and mountain 
species are all found in the range. 
</P>
<P>
Centerpiece of the park -- and of the Cuyamaca Mountains -- is a chain of three 
forested peaks: North, Middle and Cuyamaca. Cuyamaca Peak, at 6,512 feet, is 
the highest summit in the range and offers the best views. Most of North Peak 
(5,993 feet) is on private property. Middle Peak (5,883 feet) has the best 
trail network and the tallest trees. 
</P>
<P>
The hike around Middle Peak uses several trails; one good path that ascends the 
north side of the peak is Sugar Pine Trail. Utilizing this trail and a couple 
of others, it's possible to make several loops of varying distances around 
Middle Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: This hike begins at a parking area off California 
79 in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. The parking area is opposite the Boy Scouts' 
Camp Hual-Cu-Cuisi. If you're traveling California 79 south to the state park, 
the trailhead is about 10 miles from Julian. If you're heading north on 
California 79, the trailhead is located 5 miles north of park headquarters and 
1 1/2 miles north of the entrance to Paso Pichacho Camp/Picnic Area. The 
parking area is located at a nearly right-angle bend in the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the trail is easy to spot; it's the road across from the parking 
area that leads through the Boy Scout camp. The unsigned beginning of the trail 
is more difficult to find. Look on the left (west) side of California 79 for a 
path that parallels the highway. Can't find it? Walk 75 yards or so north up 
the highway, then head left, dip in and out of a roadside drainage ditch, and 
you'll pick up the trail heading north. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Minshall is the name of the unsigned trail that parallels California 
79. Looking east, the most obvious geographical feature is Cuyamaca Reservoir. 
Before the dam was built creating the reservoir, Cuyamaca Lake, as it was 
called, was a sometime affair. Indians never trusted it as a dependable water 
source, and the Spanish referred to it as la laguna que deseco, "the lake that 
dries up." During dry years like this one, there's more meadow than reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
After half a mile, the trail skirts Lakeland Resort and turns west. Signs 
inform you that you're now on the way to Middle Peak and that you're entering a 
state park wilderness area. Your path, a retiring dirt road now known as Sugar 
Pine Trail, begins ascending into the pines. At lower elevations, the pines mix 
it up with oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
A short mile's ascent on Sugar Pine Trail brings you to a junction with Middle 
Peak fire road. If a 3-mile loop is plenty for you this day, turn left on the 
fire road and follow it down to the Boy Scout camp and the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, continue on Sugar Pine Trail past some fine specimens of Southern 
California's largest native pine. The bark of these trees is reddish brown and 
deeply furrowed into scaly plates. Sugar pines have larger branches and cones 
than their somewhat similar-looking Middle Peak neighbors, the Ponderosa pines. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing the halfway point of the hike, the trail passes the stone foundation 
ruins of an old cabin, turns southwest and comes to a signed junction. 
</P>
<P>
You join Middle Peak Loop Road, which at first curves west, then heads south. 
Middle Peak itself is possible to ascend, but trees and shrubs prevent any kind 
of view of Cuyamaca country. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Peak Loop Road descends out of the pines to Milk Ranch Road. Bear left 
on this dirt fire road, which crosses oak-dotted meadowland. You'll get a 
feeling for the "rancho" part of the state park. The dirt road becomes gravel, 
skirts the Boy Scout camp and brings you back to California 79 and the 
trailhead.
