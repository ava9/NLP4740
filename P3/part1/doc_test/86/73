JUNE LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the June Mountain ski area seems to be a secret, that's all right with the 
folks who live in this alpine village or come here for a quiet holiday. Let the 
downhill hot-doggers and apres-ski people have their fun over the ridge at 
Mammoth Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
June Lake is host to couples looking for seclusion and families who just want 
to spend some time together. 
</P>
<P>
Many accommodations include kitchens, enabling guests to cook for themselves 
rather than dining out. 
</P>
<P>
A ski school for children offers special instruction for 3- to 12-year-olds. 
For novice skiers there are packages with equipment, lifts and lessons. Of the 
35 runs down June Mountain, 35% are designed for beginners, 45% for 
intermediates and 20% for advanced skiers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, beginners are guaranteed to learn to ski or they get the first 
lesson again for free. 
</P>
<P>
June's ski area has become a haven for snowboarders, who look like out-of-water 
surfers riding down the slopes on single wide boards. A new challenge for them 
is a 450-foot chute called the Half Pipe, where snowboarders show off their 
acrobatic skills along the chute's high sides. Snowboard lessons and rentals 
are available, and championship races are set for January. 
</P>
<P>
June Mountain ski area in the eastern Sierra is just off June Lake Loop Road 
(California 158), a narrow highway flanked by sheer slopes, lakes that are 
sometimes frozen and the tall pines of Inyo National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
First-time skiers arriving at the parking lot may be frightened by the steep 
terrain in front of them, but most of the runs begin and end higher up the 
mountain, including flat, wide areas for beginners and gentle, rolling trails 
for intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
The base lodge is June Meadows Chalet, a four-minute ride up the mountain face 
in novel QMC (Quad Mono Cable) tram cars that hold 20 passengers. They climb 
more than half a mile to the chalet, where six chairlifts continue to the 
10,135-foot summit of June Mountain and slightly lower Rainbow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
The rental shop, ski school and snowboarding chute are at the chalet, which 
features a cafeteria where breakfast and lunch are served. Meals also are 
served on the sun deck during weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Non-skiing visitors can take the QMC Tram to the chalet to eat and sightsee. On 
Friday and Saturday evenings, special buffet dinners are offered between 5:30 
and 9 p.m. A round-trip ride on the tram costs $7, children $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Skiers pay $35 for an all-day lift ticket, children 7-12 years old pay $17. 
Kids 6 and under and seniors 65 and older ski free. 
</P>
<P>
A detailed booklet for both June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain ski resorts is 
available by calling (619) 934-2571. For current snow and ski conditions at 
each area, call (213) 935-8866 from Los Angeles, (714) 955-0692 from Orange 
County or (619) 231-7785 from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging facilities for June Mountain are scattered in the village of June Lake 
and along June Loop Road. After a snowfall, that road is closed at the 
electrical power station near Silver Lake and becomes a scenic trail for 
cross-country skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Nordic skiing also is popular on trails groomed by the U.S. Forest Service east 
of U.S. 395 by June Lake Junction, the turnoff for California 158 to the 
village and downhill ski area. If those trails are melted, cross-country skiers 
go a few miles south to the Obsidian Dome Trails at the Glass Flow Road 
turnoff. For details, contact the ranger station: (619) 647-6525. 
</P>
<P>
Skis, poles and boots for both nordic and downhill skiing can be rented in June 
Lake at Ernie's Tackle &amp; Ski Shop. Snowboards, toboggans and discs for 
sledding also are available. Call (619) 648-7756 for rental rates and shop 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The village does not offer many diversions for shoppers, although you can visit 
the Tree Wizard Gallery to watch Gary Burns fashion artworks from wood burls. 
He carves them with power tools in a workshop at the rear. Also displayed in 
the gallery are batiks and pottery created by Burns' wife, Sallee. 
</P>
<P>
The Tree Wizard Gallery is adjacent to the Country Store, the tourist 
information center for June Lake. It is on California 158 just beyond the huge 
balancing boulder that marks the entrance to town; look for the Mobil gas sign 
and BP gas pumps. Hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. You also can call (619) 
648-7584 for visitor information. 
</P>
<P>
The Country Store rents videotapes and sells post cards, sweat shirts and other 
June Lake souvenirs. A short stroll up the road is Geri's Gift Box next to 
Schat's Bakery. The major place to buy groceries is the June Lake General 
Store. 
</P>
<P>
Two restaurants in town are open in winter -- the Sierra Inn Steak House and 
Coffee Shop, and its neighbor, the Tiger Bar and Cafe. Both serve breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the June Loop Road and beyond the ski area is Carson Peak Inn, 
considered June Lake's best restaurant. It opens daily at 5 p.m. for dinner. 
The popular Mountain Rose dinner house has closed. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen varied accommodations are scattered along the highway, beginning with 
Boulders Lodge at the top of town and ending with Whispering Pines Motel &amp; 
Cabins and Dream Mountain Resort near where the road is closed off after a big 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
Whispering Pines has kitchen-equipped motel rooms that sleep four for $55 a 
night on weekends, $45 midweek. A-frame cabins that sleep up to eight and have 
kitchens are $125 on weekends, $115 midweek. Call (619) 648-7762 for 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The major booking company for lodgings is June Lake-June Mountain Reservations. 
Call toll-free (800) 648-2211. 
</P>
<P>
Two other services arrange accommodations, especially condominiums: June Lake 
Properties Reservations, (800) 648-5863, and Rainbow Ridge Realty and 
Reservations, (800) 462-5589. 
</P>
<P>
Get to June Lake from Los Angeles by driving north via Interstate 5 and 
California 14 (or Interstates 10 and 15) to join U.S. 395. Continue north about 
15 miles beyond the Mammoth turnoff to California 158, then go west two miles 
to the village. Round trip is 650 miles.
