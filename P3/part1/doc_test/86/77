Wells Fargo to Buy Torrey Pines: Wells Fargo signed a definitive agreement to 
acquire the seven-branch Torrey Pines Bank, headquartered in San Diego County, 
for $74.5 million. The deal, which works out to $31 a share, or 2.7 times the 
book value per share of parent Torrey Pines Group, calls for 52% of shares to 
be exchanged for Wells Fargo stock and the balance to tendered for cash. Torrey 
Pines, with six branches in San Diego County and one in Riverside County, had 
total assets of $443.4 million as of June 30.

FOR THE RECORD

Price Misstated -- The price that Wells Fargo has agreed to pay for Torrey 
Pines Group -- expressed as a multiple of book value per share -- was misstated 
in Tuesday's Business section. An official of Torrey Pines, a seven-branch bank 
holding company based in San Diego County, had said the $31-a-share purchase 
price was 2.7 times Torrey Pines' book value. However, Wells Fargo said Tuesday 
that, by the time the deal closes, Torrey Pines' book value will be $13.02 per 
share, making the price per share only 2.38 times book value per share.
