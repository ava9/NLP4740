  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
applying rare earth to over 800,000 ha of forests, a world 
record, according to an official from the Ministry of Forestry. 
  Rare earth elements are a new type of growth regulators. By 
using scientifically-made fertilizers mixed with rare earth 
elements to dress seeds, dip roots or spray leaves, the growth 
of trees is promoted. 
  China started to use rare earth in agriculture and forestry 
in the 1980s, the earliest in the world. In 1992 the technology 
was popularized and applied to over 30 strains of trees, 
including walnut, date, pear, Chinese chestnut and Chinese 
hawthorn as well as grape vines. 
  Research results show that the output of a fruit tree 
cultivated with fertilizers containing rare earth elements 
increased by 10 percent to 40 percent. Besides, the fruit 
contains more sugar, Vitamin C and other nutritious elements. 
The 50 pilot counties in Beijing municipality and the Provinces 
of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Henan invested about 
one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars) in the application 
of rare earth to fruit production, and they managed to increase 
their output of fruit by a total of 50 million kg, worth 100 
million yuan. 
  Scientists also found that by applying rare earth, pine 
seeds 
will germinate earlier and pine trees will grow more quickly. 
Besides, by spraying rare earth elements on them, deciduous 
trees in north China remain green longer in the autumn. 
  In recent years the ministry of forestry, and provincial and 
city departments of forestry have taken various measures to 
popularize the technology of applying rare earth elements, 
including holding training classes, lectures, exhibitions and 
on-the-spot teaching.
