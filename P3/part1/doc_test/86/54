Chestnuts roasting on an open flame do it for some people. But for Isaac 
Urquidi, it's the scent of roasting pine nuts that takes him back to 
Christmases past. 
</P>
<P>
Half Mescalero Apache and half Basque, Urquidi's family celebrated the season 
as a Christian holiday and in traditional Indian fashion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the family's Apache roots that led them each year to a river bank lined 
with cottonwoods near the small eastern Arizona mining town in which they 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
There, they and other Apache families celebrated winter ceremony, with 
traditional "give-away" gift exchanges, prayers to Mother Earth and the cooking 
of tamales, meats, chilies, corn tortillas, corn soups and pine nuts on an open 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell of pine nuts, even to this day -- even thinking about it right now 
-- reaches my senses, and I feel a little bit homesick," said Urquidi, a social 
worker with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Cazabat, a Creek Seminole from Oklahoma, was raised a Methodist, but her 
parents also passed on traditional Indian ways. Now she works as a banking 
automation consultant, and she too encounters a nostalgia of blended traditions 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Like many American Indians from distant cultures who live in this polyglot 
megalopolis, Cazabat and Urquidi will counter their homesickness by joining up 
to 5,000 other Indians in Bell Garden's Ford Park on Saturday for the fifth 
annual Childrens' Christmas Party. 
</P>
<P>
The party is dedicated to children of the Indian community, and includes such 
non-Indian touches as Santa Claus and elves. Afterward, the adults will throw 
themselves a pow wow with traditional dancing and food. For Cazabat, the 
highlight is conversing with people in her Creek language. "It's like taking a 
quick trip home," she said. BOB SIPCHEN
