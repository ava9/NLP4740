Garlic Caused a Strike: The Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Plant and Garden News 
reports that garlic, which has proven to be an excellent companion planting to 
apple trees and other members of the rose family for warding off borers, may 
have caused the first strike in history.

Garlic was a food staple of Egyptian slaves building the pyramids. Denied 
garlic, they refused to work. The reason for the garlic shortage isn't clear, 
but "perhaps it was due to its use on mummies." On March 30, 1989, the New York 
Times reported that a recently unearthed mummy sported a ring of garlic about 
the neck -- the assumption being that, as with apple trees, the garlic helped 
to ward off insects and so aided preservation.
