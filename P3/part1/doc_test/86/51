The invigorating scent of pine, great views and a dramatic ridgetop trail are 
some of the highlights of a hike atop Pine Mountain. The mountain, which 
straddles the Mt. Pinos and Ojai ranger districts in Los Padres National 
Forest, is composed of several 7,000-foot-plus peaks, each offering a different 
back-country panorama. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness-bound travelers have always had a difficult task in deciding what to 
call the rugged mountain terrain arranged in a very wide semicircle around Ojai 
and Santa Barbara. The padres left behind many names, but none of them took. 
Geologists aren't much help either. They call the land the "Transverse Ranges 
Geomorphic Province." Unlike other areas of Southern California, there isn't a 
single dominant mountain range, but a number of smaller ones with names such as 
Sierra Madre and Santa Ynez, Pine and Topatopa. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever this land of great gorges, sandstone cliffs and wide blue sky is 
called, it's guaranteed to please. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Peak and Reyes Peak Trail, as well as a nearby camp and creek, are named 
for an early California family that began ranching in the Cuyama Valley in the 
1850s. One descendant, Jacinto Reyes, was among the first forest rangers of the 
Santa Barbara (later Los Padres) National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
For most of its length, Reyes Peak Trail stays atop, or contours just below, 
the ridge top connecting Reyes to its sister peaks. The well-constructed 
footpath is shaded the whole way by white fir, Jeffrey, Ponderosa and sugar 
pines. Inspiring views are offered from uninspiringly named Peaks 7,091, 7,114 
and 7,416, as well as from the saddles between the summits. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From U.S. 101 in Ventura, exit on California 33 
and head north 47 miles (32 miles past Ojai) to the signed turnoff for Pine 
Mountain Recreation Area. Follow the narrow paved road past some campgrounds. 
After six miles, the paved surface ends, and you'll continue east one more mile 
on a dirt road (suitable for most passenger cars) to road's end, where there's 
a modest amount of parking. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Follow the dirt road (closed to vehicles beyond the trailhead) about 
150 yards. As the road curves southeast, join the unsigned eastbound trail that 
begins on the east side of the road. The trail descends slightly and soon 
passes below the pine- and boulder-covered summit of Reyes Peak (7,500 feet), 
high point of the Pine Mountain massif. Pine and fir shade the trail, which 
alternately follows the ridge line and contours just below it. 
</P>
<P>
You'll look down to the northwest at the farms and ranches of Cuyama Valley, 
and beyond to the stark sandstone Cuyama Badlands. 
</P>
<P>
There are occasional pine-framed views of Mt. Pinos (elevation 8,831 feet), 
highest peak in Los Padres National Forest. From the ridgetop, you'll be able 
to peer southwest down into the Sespe River gorge. 
</P>
<P>
After about 1 3/4 miles of travel, you'll be treated to a view of the canyon 
cut by Potrero John Creek. The eroded cliffs at the head of the canyon recall 
Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park or Cedar Breaks National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Peak Trail continues east through pine and fir forests. After two more 
miles of travel, you'll spot an orange, triangular-shaped, metal forest-service 
marker. 
</P>
<P>
Drop into and switchback out of a hollow and arrive at signed Haddock Peak. The 
peak offers good views to the south and west of the Ojai backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
From the peak, the trail descends in earnest. Almost 2 miles of travel brings 
you to Haddock (pronounced hay-dock) Trail Camp, located on the banks of Piedra 
Blanca Creek.
