investment forest - A New Zealand company hoping to attract environmental
investors with a new type of pine tree

Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's second biggest company, believes it has
found a solution to the depletion of the world's natural forests and the
increasing shortage of timber. It is called the radiata pine.
The pine is being developed by Fletcher Challenge in its New Zealand and
Chile plantations to produce a rapidly growing supply of high quality wood
for construction.
It is the main attraction of a new class of share that the company has
created to realise the value of its forestry assets. The shares, known
variously as targeted, letter or alphabet stocks, have been used by US
companies such as General Motors and USX to separate out specific activities
without restructuring or floating them off. Fletcher Challenge claims to be
the first large non-US company to adopt the practice.
Existing shareholders are receiving one forest division share for every four
ordinary shares. 'For an investor who wants liquidity on an international
scale, just wants to invest in forestry and wants to be on the fast growth
side, this is the unique investment today,' said Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief
executive.
Trading in the shares in New York begins next Monday, but began last week on
the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. It has already added about
15 per cent to the recognised value of the forest assets, taking them to
about NZDollars 3bn (USDollars 1.6bn).
'I would consider any initiative that does that to be a great success,' said
Mr Fletcher.
The 400m new shares represent half of Fletcher Challenge's total forestry
assets worldwide, or 244,000 hectares of solid wood forests in New Zealand
and Chile and the related log trading business.
The radiata pine accounts for 95 per cent of these plantations. It can
produce a large, quality sawlog, for making solid wood products, in 25 to 30
years. Fletcher Challenge has been developing it over the past 15 years to
be disease-resistant and to contain as few knots as possible.
The company estimates that this type of high-value pruned log will account
for about 26 per cent of the forest division's total harvest by 2015,
compared with about 2 per cent now, as plantations mature. At the same time,
the overall harvest volume is expected to double to about 4m cubic metres.
The emphasis is on quality, rather than the volume of producers of timber
for pulp. The New Zealand radiata pine grows by 25 to 30 cubic metres a year
compared with 10 to 12 cubic metres in plantations in the southern US and
three to five cubic metres in the natural forests of north west US.
The company hopes to attract investors interested in the environment, said
Mr Fletcher. The way to save the rainforests 'is to plant fast-growing
plantations'.
It expects the price of wood to rise as demand grows with an increase in
population and per capita income, especially in Asia. At the same time, the
supply of large logs is declining because much of the best quality timber
has already been cut, particularly in south east Asia, and because
conservationist pressures are reducing felling in natural forests, notably
in the US states of Oregon and Washington.
'In contrast to most commodities, where real prices have declined over time,
here's a commodity where nature is constraining the supply side and there's
a reasonable prospect of increasing real prices,' said Mr Fletcher.
The company has signed agreements with environmentalists in New Zealand,
saying it will not cut down natural forests to plant the radiata pine but
will use poorer quality farmland prone to soil erosion, which the trees
should help prevent. Adding to the environmental attractions, it says one
hectare of radiata pine extracts nine tonnes of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere every year.
