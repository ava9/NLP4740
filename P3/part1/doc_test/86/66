TUJUNGA: FOR 13 YEARS, LUDOVIT SALKA HAS BEEN WATCHING PEOPLE HE SAYS BELONG TO

<P>
Atop a mountain in the Tujunga Hills, Ludovit Salka stood hunched behind a 
small pine tree, peeping into the next yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Now!" he said, his 6-foot, 200-pound frame nearly shaking with excitement as a 
middle-aged man emerged from a garage and entered the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is Monday! People should be at work!" he whispered loudly. "What are 
they doing?" he asked, then answered his own question: "Producing drugs!" 
</P>
<P>
Ludovit Salka has spent the better part of the past 13 years watching, 
photographing and taking notes on his neighbors' movements. The 72-year-old 
Czechoslovakian immigrant is convinced that the entire middle-class 
neighborhood surrounding his comfortable Estepa Drive home is part of an 
elaborate ring that produces "tons" of cocaine, PCP and other illegal drugs. He 
believes members of the "ring" are trying to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Salka has told nearly everyone who will listen -- police, fire and health 
officials, City Council members, county supervisors and Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley -- about the elaborate clandestine drug labs. He also has told them 
about the underground tunnels used to transport drugs all over the city, and 
about the toxic fumes emitted from the labs. The fumes, he says, have killed 
huge pine trees in his yard and driven away the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say such claims are as far-fetched as they seem and, except for the 
effect on Salka's neighbors, could be dismissed as nothing more than harmless 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Salka earned the dubious distinction of being the first person ever 
in Los Angeles County to be prohibited by a court order from using the 911 
emergency number to report narcotics activities. The Los Angeles Police 
Department sought the order after he called a record 582 times during July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual step," Deputy City Atty. Mary E. House said of the restraining 
order. "But this is an unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Salka said the fumes also make it impossible for him to stay overnight 
in his home, and for the past seven years he has slept in his rickety brown van 
in various parking lots on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The fumes are so deadly," he said with a pained expression, rattling off a 
list of illnesses he and his wife say they have suffered as a result. "I only 
call when my life and the life of my wife are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Jeffrey Harkavy said of Salka, "He's a very tortured and 
tormented man, but there's just no foundation in reality" for his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Salka has pursued his claims doggedly, and, ironically, has created a 
textbook example of how to use the legal system and governmental agencies to 
combat a neighborhood problem, real or perceived. 
</P>
<P>
His crusade, neighbors say, has made them feel under siege and powerless, 
despite attempts to fight back in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfortunate," Jackie Tanker said. "He knows how to use the legal 
system really well. It's sad we have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Salka's neighbors have won a series of restraining orders against him dating to 
1982, court records show. He has been convicted of illegal burning and served 
134 days in jail for violating terms of a probation order. Other cases, some of 
which were dismissed, have dealt with charges of disturbing the peace. The 
court cases number at least 14 -- all related to Salka's belief that his 
neighbors are manufacturing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that Salka normally starts out representing himself in 
legal proceedings, but is then ordered by a judge to hire an attorney. 
Neighbors complain that he has managed to delay cases for years, by requesting 
continuances, firing attorneys and attempting in vain to subpoena the entire 
city attorney's office or Foothill police division. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Linda Paugh and 17 other residents of Salka's neighborhood won a 
restraining order prohibiting Salka from harassing and molesting them. But they 
say it and other similar orders have not stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been the victims," said Paugh, who lives directly across from Salka on 
a cul-de-sac in the 7200 block of Estepa Drive. "We have been punished on a 
day-to-day basis. It's just been a nonstop battle." 
</P>
<P>
According to Salka, Paugh is the "ringleader" of the drug conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 feet, 11 inches, wearing shorts and with her hair pulled back, Paugh looks 
more like a high school cheerleader than a drug dealer. Sitting at her kitchen 
table, the walls covered with photographs of her new grandchild, she sorted 
through a mound of court papers and photographs and the business cards of all 
the governmental agencies that have investigated her and her family over the 
years because of Salka's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I'm going to put this all in a box and burn it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with Salka began around 1977, when Paugh and others noticed increased 
police patrols in their quiet hilltop neighborhood. She asked one of the police 
officers what was going on and was told that she and her neighbors were being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it just kept getting worse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Paugh and others began receiving regular calls and visits from the Police 
Department, the county Health Department and others investigating Salka's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the Health Department in my house about six times," said Dennis 
Nicholson, who lives next to Salka. "I've had the narcotics squad, the police 
came up regularly. Virtually every city agency has been up here." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the increased police activity, Salka began patrolling the streets 
in his van, apparently trying to spot and interrupt drug activities, Paugh 
said. Even now, he drives slowly up and down the streets, parks in front of a 
house and watches. 
</P>
<P>
Then came what they dubbed "smell-o-meters" -- homemade noisy contraptions that 
apparently are supposed to detect drugs in the air. He also has made attempts 
to prove scientifically that drugs were being produced. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he has walked up and down Estepa Drive in the early morning, 
swinging a lantern or shining a flashlight into houses, causing dogs to bark. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 Salka tried to smoke the drug dealers out -- literally. On several 
mornings during that summer Paugh and her neighbors awakened to the stench of 
rubber burning and saw thick black smoke coming from Salka's yard. 
</P>
<P>
Salka served a 21-day jail sentence for illegal outdoor burnings, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
Paugh, an accountant, and Dan Drake, a friend of hers who is an auto mechanic, 
said Salka constantly photographs them and their visitors and jots down the 
license plate of every strange car parked on the street. 
</P>
<P>
But his nighttime sermons are perhaps the most disconcerting of all Salka's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in his yard, which overlooks the street, Salka shouts at the top of 
his voice the addresses of his neighbors followed by a rambling diatribe 
accusing them of being murderers, drug manufacturers and criminals, Paugh said. 
"My daughter never had company over, and he was the reason why," she said, 
recalling the impact Salka's accusations had on her life and the lives of her 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 California law requires that homeowners disclose to buyers all defects 
as well as all litigation that involves the property. 
</P>
<P>
So when Jim and Jackie Tanker bought their house across the street from Salka 
three years ago, the seller had to tell them about their new neighbor's 
behavior. But they had no idea the problem was so extensive. 
</P>
<P>
"He met us on the first day and told us there were people manufacturing drugs 
in the neighborhood . . . that we should join forces with him," Jim Tanker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, the Tankers were added to the enemies Salka shouted about 
nightly. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, in connection with a court proceeding for violating a restraining 
order, Salka was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. A court-appointed 
doctor found him competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not crazy," Nicholson said. "He's just obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his home, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and slacks and a tie, 
Salka does not look the part of a madman. 
</P>
<P>
But he readily admits to the behavior his neighbors describe. "What am I 
supposed to do? I have to shout because I get no help from nobody," he said, 
accusing the police, fire, and health departments of conspiring with the drug 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
On request he displays photographs he has taken that he believes prove his 
claims, letters he has written to officials requesting assistance and a neatly 
drawn map of his neighborhood: Red arrows indicate what he says is the flow of 
toxic fumes being shot from drug labs toward his house. 
</P>
<P>
Salka and his wife, Kristina, 67, own a seven-room house on a wooded 3/4-acre 
lot. Salka built the home and decorated it with ornately carved antique oak 
furniture, red Persian rugs and brightly colored couches that seem brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
But Salka no longer sleeps in his house. Nor does he entertain company there. 
"After a while the house feels like a gas chamber," Salka said in a lilting 
Czech accent. "We have to flee to escape a certain death." He returns every 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Kristina Salka claims to have suffered temporary blindness from the fumes. She 
said when the fumes are too strong, she leaves the house, walking with her dog 
in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Salkas say that even outside the house, they fear for their lives. 
Kristina Salka said she has been the target of drive-by shootings many times. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they follow me for 2 1/2 hours," she said in broken English. 
</P>
<P>
A retired real estate broker and mechanical engineer, Salka served with Axis 
forces during World War II and immigrated to the U.S. in 1952. Now he spends 
much of his time and "a terrible amount of money" attempting to prove what many 
others, including many city agencies, have dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Every police officer in the Foothill area knows Ludovit Salka or knows of 
Ludovit Salka," said Detective Jim Soles. "Never has it ever been . . . found 
that what he is complaining about is happening in his neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1985, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
conducted at least six investigations into Salka's claims and found nothing. 
The city Fire Department and the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
also investigated, with no result. 
</P>
<P>
But Salka vows to continue his fight. "I've been to court 14 times and to jail 
seven times," he said, almost proudly. 
</P>
<P>
In one criminal court case he submitted letters from 30 people supporting his 
claim, and says there are at least 20 others who support him as well. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse R. Williams, a private investigator, wrote that he "experienced a burning 
sensation in my nostrils and throat" when in the neighborhood. "It is my 
opinion someone in this neighborhood is working with toxic chemicals." 
Williams, whose company, Delta Investigations, is based in Sacramento, was paid 
by Salka, and some of the others who have written letters in support were hired 
by Salka through newspaper ads. Neighbors and others have dismissed their 
testimony as meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the restraining orders against Salka, his surveillance activities 
continue and neighbors say they have run out of options. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a very sick man and we're really not sure what to do at this point," 
said Paugh, who has lived in her house for 25 years. "It is not just a hoax. . 
. . He is very serious -- that's the saddest part of it. He does believe it." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, they are incredibly tolerant people," Harkavy, the deputy city 
attorney, said of Salka's neighbors. "Mr. Salka is fortunate that these people 
are working through the legal system and not taking matters into their own 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear that he may one day turn away from the system that he has placed 
so much faith in, perhaps becoming violent. Drake, Paugh's frequent visitor who 
has been watched and photographed by Salka, said, "His obsession is dangerous."
