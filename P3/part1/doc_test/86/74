Last year I decided I would like to create a reasonably colourful autumn bed
in a rather neglected shady strip at the edge of the lawn.
The previous year I had planted some Aster ericoides, Aster x frikartii
Monch, Dendranthema Clara Curtis and Lysimachia clethroides which had become
reasonably established. But the area was a tangle of old bush paeonies,
giant scabious, Acanthus spinosus and ground elder. All of which would need
pruning or clearing. I decided to replace them with white flowering plants.
The question was where to buy them.
I decided to try to obtain the new plants by mail order, as buying locally
was both time-consuming and not always successful. Being a novice, I had no
idea of the jungle I was about to enter.
If I were asked to offer advice to people like myself, about to embark on a
journey through the catalogues, one word would spring to mind: beware] The
differences in pricing, the quality of the goods, the standard of packing
and promptness of despatch (to say nothing of willingness or even ability to
answer inquiries) is astonishing. The route to happiness lies in not
expecting too much, preferably not expecting anything at all.
After extensive reading, I decided to restrict my purchases to four species:
Japanese anemones, dahlias, Kniphofia and digitalis. Having chosen my
varieties, I examined the price-lists of five suppliers - all reputable
well-known names, but varying from the small to medium-sized plant
'specialists' to the large national suppliers. I was immediately struck by
the range of prices asked for the same plant. The price of one variety of
Japanese anemone varied from Pounds 2.10 to Pounds 3.25 per plant. The
prices in the catalogue of the company asking Pounds 3.25 were from 75p to
Pounds 1.50 above all their competitors. I struck it off my list.
I put a selection of plant orders together and prepared to fill in the
forms. I now had to work out how much they wanted for postage, packing and
insurance. One company wanted Pounds 1 p &amp; p for each plant with no discount
for quantity. I removed it from my list. Some suppliers charge p &amp; p
according to number of plants bought, others by the value of the order.
Sometimes the system can work against the supplier's interest. What do you
do if Pounds 6 is charged per Pounds 75 worth of goods and you want Pounds
80 worth? Buy an extra Pounds 6 p &amp; p? No, you reduce your order.
Then there is VAT. Some sellers do not include VAT in their prices and some
do. The exercise became for me an intellectual puzzle: how to establish
value for money, and obtain the best buy for the minimum outlay.
To some extent, and to some people, particularly the experts, price is
secondary. One gardener told me that he had paid Pounds 5 for one seed of a
variety of a tree that he particularly wanted.
If you want a plant, you will pay the price. So it was with me for a giant
red Kniphofia, the order for which went off with the others to the supplier
at the start of February last year with a request for some enticing-sounding
Anemone tomentosa.
I heard nothing until the middle of March, when my three Kniphofia were
safely delivered (beautifully packed), but instead of the Anemone tomentosa,
came an apology and a token for Pounds 8.25. I rang to say I would prefer my
money back and was reminded that this grower did not refund sums of less
than Pounds 10 - why didn't I come and choose something else at their
nursery] It's only 60 miles away.
Every supplier understandably demands payment with order, and, of course,
the buyers' payments are tucked away in the sellers' deposit accounts until
he or she supplies. If they will not refund when they cannot deliver and one
cannot collect, presumably they have your money forever.
Moreover, if the plants arrive a long time after the order is placed, the
customers' money is a free loan. My last order, value Pounds 77.21, was
delivered on May 6, three months after it was placed.
In spite of the delay, I eventually set out my new plants. Some of them
bloomed. The Digitalis purpurea alba were 50 per cent purple; the six Little
Maid creamy dwarf Kniphofia did not send up a single flowering shoot; the
'Honorine' anemones looked lovely, but the Queen Charlotte turned out to be
much darker pink than I expected and there is no sign of a flower from the
Whirlwind semi-double white.
The 10 Eveline dahlias (which, according to the catalogue, should have been
creamy white with lilac-tipped petals) turned out to be scarlet streaks with
a white base and the Hayley Jane looks yellow to me. The slugs got
Kennermerland.
I am pleased with the colour effect, even though it is not what I planned.
It is not all the growers' fault; I was also pretty stupid, such as planting
a Eupatorium purpureum believing it to be a Eupatorium rugosum and sticking
three Dictamnus alba too close to giant dahlias, where they sulked and
refused to grow.
The catalogues, however, could be more helpful. You see a beautiful
illustration of a flowering shrub and know how lovely it would look in a
spot you have available for it - but the book does not tell you that it will
not flower for at least three years, during which time it will be making its
roots. Nor does the catalogue (or the nurseryman, for that matter) tell you
that those lovely gentians will pine away in your alkaline soil.
Some simple, truthful statements ought, it seems to me, to be an obligatory
part of the catalogue description.
I was grateful to the supplier who, when I wrote explaining that none of the
rather puny plants he had sent me had wanted to grow, wrote back and
apologised, saying it had been a bad year for propagating and refunded all
my money. I now trust him and will buy from him again.
The Plant Finder, published by Headmain in association with the Hardy Plant
Society (Pounds 10.99, 734 pages) contains more than 55,000 plant listings,
tells where they can be obtained and whether nurseries or plantsmen offer a
mail order service.
