ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
PINING FOR AN OLD-FASHIONED TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One of the more visible and pleasant signs of the holiday season is the 
Christmas tree. Most public places and office buildings, including the lobby of 
The Times, display one. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the generosity of one company, 230 Santa Ana schoolchildren with 
fine attendance records have received a tree as a gift this year. The 6- to 
7-foot firs were given to the children by the school district and J.M. Peters 
Co., a Newport Beach developer. Children from needy families were singled out. 
Had they not been rewarded with the gift, the children might not have had a 
tree this year. 
</P>
<P>
Their trees will not be exactly like the 17-foot specimen in the lobby of 
Orange County Edition of The Times in Costa Mesa. That tree is perfectly 
shaped, right up to its top branches. It is a dark, healthy-looking green. 
</P>
<P>
Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that Mother Nature was given a 
little help: where the tall fir was a little sparse, branches had been nailed 
to its trunk to fill in, held up with wires. The tree came with instructions: 
"Paint green and flock ends." We are surprised they didn't add: "Spray with 
pine scent daily." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow all this takes some of the mystique away. It's a little like plastic 
surgery: more fun if no one knows about it. And it's something like gazing at a 
beautiful sunset and saying, "Now, if it just had a little more red right 
there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the perfection of a tree, it brings a certain happy feeling to the 
holiday season. We're glad that the Santa Ana schoolchildren will get to share 
that, too.
