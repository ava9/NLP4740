The gnarled but picturesque Torrey Pine tree, the rarest species of pine in the 
United States and a revered part of the coastal landscape just north of La 
Jolla, have been jealously guarded from human harm here like a jewel in a 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Torrey Pines that cling to a 4-mile stretch of sandstone bluffs 
face a new threat. Weakened by two years of drought and several days of hellish 
heat in late summer, they have been hit by a bark beetle infestation which, if 
unchecked, could seriously deplete the Torrey Pines State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The pest, called the "confused five-spined beetle" because of the aimless path 
it bores under the bark of a tree, has already killed a dozen Torrey Pines at 
the 1,750-acre park and threatens to lay low more than 100 others. State 
officials worry that the problem could spread even further into the park's 
Torrey Pines population, estimated at 7,000 trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Concern 
</P>
<P>
"We're deeply concerned and a bit alarmed at the extent of the infestation," 
said Bob Wohl, supervising ranger at the reserve. "It's located in the heart of 
the park, the areas with the highest visibility and the most prominence." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the pines along the San Diego County coast, the trees exist in only 
one other place in the world -- on Santa Rosa Island, one of the chain of 
Channel Islands southwest of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials are hopeful that rain will continue through the winter, 
bolstering the health of the pines and increasing the production of sap that 
typically wards off the pests. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the rain we've had since Thanksgiving Day and the tremendous drop in 
temperature will knock the beetles off," Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Counterattack 
</P>
<P>
If the pests are still prevalent by spring, however, authorities probably will 
begin a counterattack, even though park policy encourages a laissez faire 
management approach to help maintain the reserve's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tippets, a state park ecologist, said officials would probably begin by 
thinning out unhealthy trees. Bark on infested pines probably would be stripped 
to create an inhospitable environment for the beetles. If necessary, some of 
the affected pines might be cut up and hauled out of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that some weakened and fallen trees have served as 
incubators for the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Insecticides would be considered only as a last resort. Tippets said chemicals 
typically prove only partly successful and could potentially kill insects that 
may prey on pests like the beetle. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle, Ips paraconfusus, hardly looks like a feared invader. Less than a 
quarter-inch long, the insect has a dark brown body with tiny rounded antenna. 
The slow-moving, winged insect is capable of wandering among several trees 
during its lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects of Insects 
</P>
<P>
It devours the cambium layer, the thin coat between the bark and inner hardwood 
that serves as the circulatory system for the tree, processing photosynthetic 
products as well as nutrients tapped from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A male finds a susceptible tree -- typically one weakened by drought or aging 
-- and sends out a sex attractant that lures female beetles. Together, they 
hollow out a larval chamber in the tree where the female lays eggs. The hatched 
larva do most of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of needles that characterize the Torrey Pine begin to drop. If the 
larva circumnavigate the trunk, severing the cambium layer connecting roots and 
branches, the pine eventually will die. 
</P>
<P>
On a tour of the grove, Wohl pointed to a graying tree. Reaching up, he grabbed 
a small branch and with an easy twist pulled off a ring of bark, ready proof 
that the tree had been infested. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say what we're talking about here is a doomed tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Noted 
</P>
<P>
Wohl said rangers first noticed problems in April, when the needles on several 
trees began to brown and drop off. The problems persisted through the summer 
and Wohl said several days of 100-degree temperatures produced a "blast furnace 
effect on the trees." 
</P>
<P>
By Labor Day, experts had isolated the beetles as the problem. In mid-December, 
a state forest pathologist conducted tests. He agreed that the drought had 
weakened the trees enough to allow the beetle infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the battle between a human immunological system and foreign bodies, 
Torrey Pines fight a continuous war with the beetle and other pests. A healthy 
flow of sap serves to repel the invading hordes, pushing their eggs out or 
encasing an attacker in a coat of resin. 
</P>
<P>
"The bark beetles are always here, but the trees can normally repel them," Wohl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has spread to several of the most prominent spots in the park that 
feature some of the oldest and most beautiful pines, which can live about 300 
years. Beetles also have spread to several trees surrounding the park 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given a New Name 
</P>
<P>
Once known as the Soledad Pine, the trees were renamed in 1850 by Dr. C.C. 
Parry, a botanist for the U.S. Mexican Boundary Survey. Parry chose the 
botanical name, Pinus torreyana or Torrey Pine, in honor of his former botany 
professor, Dr. John Torrey. 
</P>
<P>
In 1883, Parry returned to the site and began urging that the land be acquired 
to preserve the species from what he feared would be certain extinction at the 
hands of man. The City of San Diego designated 369 acres as a public park in 
1899. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Browning Scripps acquired adjacent groves in the years that followed, and 
those lands were added to the park in 1924, when it was enlarged to nearly 
1,000 acres. In 1979, a 154-acre extension area was formed on the sloping 
hillside to the north of Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous infestations. Most recently, bark beetles killed 18 
trees in 1984 and 1985. Eventually, rains helped bolster the surviving trees, 
and they repelled the beetles. 
</P>
<P>
Some authorities suggest that the Torrey Pines State Reserve's trees have been 
weakened not only by the recent drought, but by increased competition for water 
among the proliferating pines.
