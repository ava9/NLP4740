MR BOB YOUNG, founder of the Young Group, the coalmining company, is to step
down as chairman as part of a survival package which also involves the loss
of its USM quotation. He will remain as chief executive.
The package includes a Pounds 2.4m additional overdraft facility to meet
working capital requirements.
The company, which has sites in the UK and Venezuela, also announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 245,000 in the year to November 30 1991, against a
restated loss of Pounds 89,000 for the 1990 year. Turnover was Pounds 41.5m
(Pounds 36.9m) with earnings per share of 2.98p (0.2p). The board proposes
passing the final dividend making a total of 2.6p (5.2p).
Shortfalls in reserves on some opencast sites resulted in exceptional
provisions of Pounds 485,000 against future losses. And output from
Venezuela was below expectations due to equipment problems.
Young Group began negotiations on the package after it announced on March 3
an unexpected fall in profits and increased working capital requirements.
The company said it had not been possible to refinance on conventional
terms. The major shareholders had offered immediate finance on terms which
did not comply with Stock Exchange rules, obliging the cancellation of the
USM quotation.
If the proposals are accepted the shares would be traded under Rule 535(2).
The shares, suspended on Wednesday, resumed yesterday closing at 4p, against
the 35p suspension price.
The Group's bankers are to receive as security for 50 per cent of the
additional facility a cash deposit of Pounds 1.2m from the major
shareholders and directors. Warrants will be issued in consideration of the
additional facilities, an adjustment made to the conversion rights of the
convertible preference shares and a free issue of warrants made to all other
ordinary shareholders.
If fully implemented, Mr Bob Young's holding would be much reduced to 15.9
per cent while the largest shareholders will be BIL Securities (Far East)
and 3i Group with 39.2 per cent and 22.1 per cent.
