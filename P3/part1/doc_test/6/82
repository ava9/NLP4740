FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company which raised Pounds 42m through a
rights issue last month, boosted pre-tax profits for the year ended June 30
by 10 per cent to Pounds 10.7m.
Earnings per share increased by 25 per cent to 21.8p (17.4p), helped by the
company's buy-back of 5.2m shares from Markheath, another property company,
for Pounds 13.1m in November 1992. Net assets were 409p a share (411p).
Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said yesterday that the company was
well pleased with the results: 'Against the backcloth of a really difficult
year we have held our net asset value and improved both the profits and the
dividend. We have put the company in a position of low gearing, with
sufficient resources to benefit from this point in the property cycle.'
Operating profits rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 15.6m on turnover ahead at
Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 41.6m).
The latest operating figure includes a charge of Pounds 1.52m for litigation
costs arising from a dispute over the acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH
in 1986. No further costs are expected.
Most of the gain at the operating level came from higher rental income. The
company said the contracted rent roll was up 6 per cent to Pounds 19.3m
(Pounds 18.2m). It had no developments in progress or vacant buildings of
any significance.
Shares of profits from associates were Pounds 157,000 compared with a
previous loss of Pounds 518,000.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 5.1m. Mr Davies said
this reflected increase in borrowings following the share buy-back and the
purchase of new properties.
Net borrowings were Pounds 66m (Pounds 46m) at the year-end, giving gearing
of 43 per cent (28 per cent). However, borrowings had fallen since the
rights issue, although the group has spent Pounds 21m on acquisitions, Mr
Davies said.
A final dividend of 12.4p (11.6p) is proposed, giving a total for the year
of 16p (15p).
