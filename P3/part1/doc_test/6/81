ROPNER, the Darlington based mini-conglomerate, reported pre-tax profits
down from Pounds 7.51m to Pounds 5.53m last year as it continued pruning its
peripheral businesses.
Property profits for 1990 were slashed to Pounds 394,000 (Pounds 5.02m).
Engineering profits fell to Pounds 537,000 (Pounds 727,000) and
contributions from shipping to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 2.91m).
The insurance brokerage side, since sold, suffered a loss of Pounds 979,000
following a loss of Pounds 954,000 the previous year.
The lower profits were, however, in line with forecasts as the outcome for
1989 was boosted by an exceptional contribution of Pounds 3.6m arising from
the disposal of investment property.
The setbacks were partially offset by a surge in investment income to Pounds
2.11m (Pounds 105,000) and by a fall in interest payable to Pounds 815,000
(Pounds 2.09m).
Turnover was down 44 per cent to Pounds 35.39m (Pounds 63.52m).
The figures reflected both a slowdown in activity and the effects of
withdrawal from several businesses.
Following the disposal of its property development activities, the group
sold Hozelock, its garden products division, in June.
Ropner Insurance Holdings, its insurance broking business, was sold in
April.
The disposals leave the group with shipping, engineering and property
investment as core businesses.
'We feel that we have now achieved the optimum profile of the group,' said
Mr Roger Winter, finance director. The disposals - together with the sale of
two ships - brought an extraordinary gain of Pounds 8.31m, and increased the
consolidated net asset value of the group to Pounds 39.11m from Pounds
26.14m in 1989.
Due to the restructuring, the group has about Pounds 17m in cash. This
should further increase its investment income this year while the trading
climate for engineering remains grim and no significant rises are expected
in investment property or shipping, Mr Winter said.
Earnings per share fell to 15.8p (16.8p) and a final dividend of 4.75p is
recommended for a total of 8.25p (7.5p).
