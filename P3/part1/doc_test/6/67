London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, suffered a
20 per cent fall in profits at the pre-tax level in the year to March 31
from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 22.3m.
However, a tax credit of Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 8.53m charge) and a Pounds
500,000 reduction in minority interests to Pounds 2.03m resulted in a net
profit of Pounds 20.8m, up 24 per cent from Pounds 16.8m last time.
Shareholders' funds were 24 per cent higher at Pounds 319.2m (Pounds
258.2m), excluding the Pounds 33m by which the market value of listed
investments exceeded the balance sheet figures.
The company's properties increased in value by 16 per cent to Pounds 379.8m,
adjusted for sales and acquisitions.
Lord Rayne, chairman, said that there was a 'perceptible' increase in tenant
interest. 'Although this fragile recovery appears to be progressing,
creative investment possibilities with significant growth potential remain
rare, but efforts continue to be focused on identifying suitable
opportunities,' he said.
LMS said a number of unusual factors had contributed to the results.
Gains from property disposals and venture capital investments, together with
the release of prior years' provisions for corporation tax, more than offset
the Pounds 2.7m negative effect of ceasing to treat First Leisure
Corporation as an associated undertaking; the non-recurrence of the British
Sky Broadcasting Holdings guarantee fee received in 1993 (Pounds 2.9m); and
the fall in interest income from the group's cash resources of Pounds 2.7m.
The associated undertakings, which last time produced an attributable
pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.43m, had incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
631,000.
The main reason was the change in treatment of First Leisure Corporation
because LMS's holding fell below 15 per cent.
US venture capital investments produced gains of Pounds 4m, despite the
varying fortunes of the individual enterprises.
Net rental income from investment property increased from Pounds 29.5m to
Pounds 30m. LMS made a net gain on property disposals of Pounds 6.2m in
1994, compared with Pounds 2.24m.
Cash and listed securities totalled Pounds 190m on March 31; net borrowings
amounted to Pounds 70.7m, making gearing 22 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Earnings per share increased from 7p to 8.59p. The dividend is increased by
0.2p to 4.2p via a 3.4p final.
