59.4m loss

CREST NICHOLSON, the south-east of England-based housebuilder and property
developer which ran into trouble last year following the collapse in the
housing market, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 59.4m during the year to
October 31.
This compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.06m in the previous 12
months.
The losses were struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 39.8m due to
the write-down of the group's residential and commercial land and
developments to take account of falling property prices.
Resulting losses per share were 55.67p, against earnings of 3.86p. The group
announced a nominal dividend of 0.01p to preserve its share status under the
Trustee Investments Act 1961. Last time the final dividend was 4.65p for a
total of 7.65p.
The figures, however, were in line with expectations and the stock market
was encouraged by the announcement of a further reduction in group
borrowings from Pounds 117.6m in May to Pounds 54.7m at the year-end -
equivalent to 51 per cent of shareholders' funds. Crest's shares yesterday
rose by 6p to 37p.
Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, also revealed that house sales had
increased last month. Net reservations by house buyers were currently
averaging 33 a week, compared with 15 a week in December.
Mr Callcutt said the improvement was encouraging but that it was too early
to say whether the rise would mark the beginning of a recovery in the UK
housing market.
Last year the group made an operating loss of Pounds 6.9m on house sales
before write-downs of Pounds 28m. There was a further Pounds 11.1m
write-down in the commercial property division which made a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 10.9m. The group's contracting business however turned in a small
profit.
The big improvement, said Mr Callcutt, had been a big reduction in group
borrowings as a result of commercial property sales and a decision to reduce
house prices and increase sales to generate more cash.
During the year Crest sold a record 1,435 homes. Average prices however fell
from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 78,000.
The group's aim was to halve last year's interest charge of Pounds 12.6m
(Pounds 6.68m).
COMMENT
The market was right to be pleased with the news of a further reduction in
Crest's borrowings. The company has survived a difficult 12 months intact.
Bank facilities of Pounds 167m are more than adequate to meet foreseeable
requirements, say the directors. Pre-tax profits, given the severity of the
write-downs should also recover this year. Some market forecasts suggest
that Pounds 5m might even be achievable. A more cautious view is that
profits will be between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m. The share price does not
yet fully take account of the improvement Crest has made, but the upside
remains limited. There are better quality housing recovery stocks around.
