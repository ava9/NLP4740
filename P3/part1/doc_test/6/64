SHARES in British Aerospace (BAe) rose sharply, brushing aside the
announcement of Britain's largest ever corporate profits loss at just over
Pounds 1.2bn, for the year to December 1992.
The market had braced itself for the big loss from the UK's largest
manufacturer but was cheered by a lack of black holes in the figures, and
the higher than anticipated 4p dividend, against market expectations of a 3p
final.
There was strong demand for the stock and at the day's best, the shares were
up 17 at 269p, before coming off the top to close 13 up at 265p, after UBS
Phillips and Drew advised investors to switch out of BAe and into
Rolls-Royce. Turnover was a hefty 9.7m. Analysts also put the decline down
to a closer examination of the poor performance of the defence division.
Once again there was speculation that GEC could be considering a bid for
BAe, although this was largely disregarded by aerospace specialists.
Mr Paul Ruddle at NatWest Securities said: 'This marks a turnaround for the
group, and shows the management has got to grips with the problems.' He
retained his current year forecast at Pounds 60m, putting him at the bottom
of the range with brokers such as Hoare Govett, BAe's broker, said to be on
Pounds 125m and Smith New Court reported to be predicting Pounds 150m.
Analysts are due to have another meeting with the company tomorrow when
further details about the trading outlook are expected to emerge. Shares in
GEC eased 3 to 293p, while Rolls-Royce closed unchanged at 128p.
Kwik Save strong
Rumours continued to circulate around Kwik Save as the shares continued
their upward climb, yesterday adding a further 14 to 842p on talk of an
imminent bid from Dairy Farms. The shares' strength in recent weeks, in
stark contrast to a weak food retail sector, has been underpinned by the
continuing buying by the Hong Kong food group, which has taken its holding
in Kwik Save from 26 per cent to over 28 per cent this year.
Although Dairy Farms has always said it is a long-term passive investor in
Kwik Save, excitement was generated early on yesterday following market talk
in Hong Kong that Dairy Farms would make a big rights issue when it
announces results on March 16. With only around 8 per cent gearing, the
speculative implication was that the group was lining up a bid, with Kwik
Save the obvious contender. However, such a move would break all agreements
between the two groups.
UK food analysts, largely dismissive of a Dairy Farms bid, suggested that
the group may have been buying Kwik Save shares ahead of a possible rights
issue from the UK group, the proceeds of which could be used to buy stores
from Gateway.
New bid seen
There was almost universal support in the market for the necessity of an
increased bid from Airtours if it is to succeed in capturing its larger
rival Owners Abroad. The speculation followed the decision by the secretary
of state for trade and industry not to refer the bid to the Office of Fair
Trading.
Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett forecast that Airtours would probably
produce a cash incentive of around 17p on top of their current 113p a share
all-paper offer. Hoare's is advising Owners investors to sit tight in
expectation of a renewed offer, with Airtours a strong buy also.
Smith New Court believes Airtours may not be so generous, with analyst Mr
Bruce Jones suggesting an increased offer of 125p, with a possible cash
alternative. Some speculative investors thought otherwise, with the Owners
shares spurting to close 13 ahead at 129p in big turnover of nearly 9m.
Airtours put on 5 to 302p. Suggestions that LTU, the German travel group
which had planned a co-operative shareholding in Owners, might ride to the
rescue did not find much support among analysts.
ICI on alert
On the eve of its results due today, ICI shares put on a late spurt as
rumours abounded over the fate of the demerger and the threatened rights
issue. Analysts declared themselves none the wiser, as the shares first
languished on the belief that a Pounds 1bn cash call would be forthcoming
today, and then spurted forward as wild talk suggested that Glaxo was
putting together a bid for ICI's proposed bio-science division, Zeneca.
ICI shares added 8 to 1082p. Glaxo slipped a penny to 652p.
Bank shares continue to suffer from selling triggered by NatWest's poorly
received figures released on Tuesday. NatWest lost 8 more to 435p while
Barclays, the next high street bank to report, fell 3 1/2 to 424p.
Hambros was the pick of the merchant banks, moving up 8 to 316p.
Royal Insurance eased 2 to 285p in front of today's preliminary figures
which are expected to show losses sharply reduced at around Pounds 120m,
compared with last time's Pounds 373m loss. The main action in insurance,
however, was in Guardian Royal (GRE) which ran up 6 to 186p amid stories
that a buyer of 5m had been operating in the market; turnover of 9.3m in GRE
was the highest single day's business since November last year. GRE is
scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 3. A single big selling
order of 1.2m shares at 559p unsettled General Accident, 6 off at 567p.
Activity in the oil sector was concentrated on Shell and Royal Dutch.
Dealers reported heavy switching operations, out of Royal Dutch and into
Shell with the latter said to have been 8 to 8 1/2 per cent too cheap
against the Dutch group. Shell closed a shade firmer at 582p following
substantial turnover of 7.4m shares, ahead of today's preliminary figures.
Building stocks tended to lose ground on a mixture of rights issue fears,
broker sell recommendations and official statistics disclosing that UK
construction orders fell 9 per cent in the last quarter of 1992.
Yamaichi, the Japanese stockbroker, warned that 'there is strong evidence to
expect another wave of rights issues from the sector, similar to that
experienced in 1991 when 16 building sector companies raised a total of
Pounds 1.2bn'. Mr Scott Fulton, Yamaichi's building analyst, pointed out
that recovery hopes have seen the building materials and construction
sectors outperform the FT-A All-Share index by 21.6 per cent and 33.2 per
cent respectively since 'Black Wednesday'. Yamaichi pinpointed 'rights
risks' on five companies due to announce results in the next two months;
Amec, Mowlem, Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey. The building team at
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said 'we believe there are at least Pounds 1bn of fund
raising in the pipeline.'
Blue Circle Industries (BCI), a good market recently on renewed takeover
speculation, fell 7 to 225p, after 220p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have
reaffirmed its bearish stance. Several brokers have forecast a cut in BCI's
1993 payment.
Fears that the OFT may launch an investigation into the activities of
photocopier companies hurt several companies in the sector. Southern
Business Group, tumbled 34 to 79p, while Gestetner fell 11 to 131p.
A weighty tome on the UK property market from NatWest Securities found some
room for optimism that the sector had begun clawing its way back. Analyst Mr
Marc Gilbard added that there had been a significant shift in the market's
perception of valuing property stocks with net asset value being replaced by
dividend yield. NatWest is particularly keen on Land Securities off 2 at
482p.
