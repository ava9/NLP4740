RESULTS DUE
Results are beginning to come through from retail groups, whose financial
years generally end later than other companies to take in the January sales.
Today see figures from Laura Ashley and tomorrow from Next, fashion groups
which have both been through difficult times.
Laura Ashley should report a small profit of perhaps Pounds 2m, compared to
a Pounds 6.7m pre-tax loss. But this will be wiped out by exceptional items
as Mr Jim Maxmin, the new chief executive, gets to grips with the business,
taking the loss to high single figures.
Next, which reported a Pounds 223m net loss last year, is expected to make
Pounds 10m pre-tax, though reports of strong trading in the shops suggest
there could be a pleasant surprise. A final dividend is likely.
Tomorrow also see figures from Tesco, the supermarket group, for its year to
end February. Forecasts are for around Pounds 540m before taking account of
profits on property sales, compared to Pounds 417.1m, showing that the food
retailers are still beating the recession. Tesco will have had the benefit
of last year's Pounds 572m rights issue for a full year.
'Minus something large' was an analyst's reaction to a question about
Costain's 1991 results. More prosaically, estimates of pre-tax losses to be
announced by the construction and mining group on Wednesday revolve around
Pounds 30m, compared with a Pounds 5.5m profit.
While Costain might have made about Pounds 10m after paying interest, the
losses follow writedowns in the value of housing land and a Pounds 12m
provision for the Channel Tunnel contract. A below the line charge is also
expected after the sale of the investment property portfolio.
Hope of a final dividend died some time ago. While gearing will have been
helped by a rights issue and the property sale, some anxiety remains about
debt levels.
Land write-downs also apply to AMEC, the construction and engineering group,
which is expected to report pre-tax profits reduced from Pounds 63m to
little more than Pounds 20m on Thursday.
Another to benefit from a rights issue last year, the remaining cash-in-hand
should enable it to maintain an uncovered dividend. It might even gain some
praise for its tight control of cash on the contracting side.
Waterford Wedgwood, the crystal and ceramics group, is expected to post a
full-year pre-tax loss of IPounds 2m tomorrow. Brokers anticipate an IPounds
3m tax charge on profits in the Wedgwood ceramics division, making a
post-tax loss of IPounds 5m and earnings per share of around 0.6p.
The group's much-awaited recovery to profitability is being held back by the
continuing recession in the US and UK and slack demand for its up-market
products, and the outlook for 1992 is not encouraging. The future of the
loss-making Waterford crystal arm hinges on the outcome of a consultancy
report due by mid-year.
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, is expected to report full-year pre-tax
profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92m, only slightly down on last year's Pounds
94m. The performance of its UK hotels will be watched with interest, as will
any sign of a slow-down in Germany.
