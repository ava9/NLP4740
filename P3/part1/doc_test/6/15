THE MURKY recovery picture among Britain's retailers was further muddied
yesterday with two of the smaller high street groups reporting widely
different fortunes. Laura Ashley, the clothes and fabrics group, saw its
shares fall heavily after revealing a dramatic setback to its US operations
in briefings to analysts. It raised fears that the dividend, which was
passed at the interims, was unlikely to be paid for the full year.
Trading in the US reportedly dropped by up to 40 per cent at one stage in
the summer. It is believed that sales have since recovered, while in the UK
Laura Ashley told analysts that pre-Christmas sales were about 10 per cent
higher than the same period a year ago.
Despite this, analysts moved quickly to downgrade profit forecasts.
Kleinwort Benson slashed its figures for 1992-93 from Pounds 6m to Pounds 2m
 -only Pounds 320,000 more than the Pounds 1.68m profits the company made in
its first half. The shares tumbled 17 to 70p.
Tie Rack announced sales growth of 6 per cent for the year to date, which
would 'result in substantially increased earnings for the year ending 31 Jan
1993'. The shares jumped 11 to 83p.
TSB optimism
High Street bank TSB saw its shares rise on further consideration of its
results as the optimists view held sway. The shares rose 4 to 160p with 10m
traded, giving a rise of 8.5 per cent over two days.
Agency broker James Capel was an aggressive buyer of the shares, as was
securities house Hoare Govett which has raised its 1993 profit forecast by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 220m. The bull case is that TSB is either a recovery
play or a prime takeover target.
However Lehman Brothers, among others, is not convinced. The US investment
bank says: 'We would caution against expecting further significant progress
at the operating line . . . we prefer the more defensive stocks in the
sector, and of the recovery stocks would recommend a switch into Barclays.'
Barclays, which has its own detractors, was steady at 374p.
Euro Disney boosted
A surprise boardroom change at Euro Disney gave a boost to the shares but
did nothing to dispel the bearish view of many UK analysts. The shares added
28 to 778p in thin trading in London, although the stock was reported busier
in Paris. The appointment of Frenchman Mr Philippe Bourguignon, currently
the theme park's second in command, as chairman raised hopes that the park
might develop a more Eurocentric approach, and thus attract more visitors.
However, one UK leisure specialist said the appointment made no difference
to the fact that: 'the shares are far too highly rated and deserved to be
sold down to 400p.'
Vague takeover talk helped Cadbury-Schweppes to put on 7 to 459p. Hanson was
said to be eyeing the confectionery and food group after its failed bid for
RHM last year, but analysts were largely dismissive given Cadbury's high
rating and solid managerial record. Hillsdown was another name being billed
for a bid and the shares added 4 to 148p. Unilever advanced 6 to 1068p on
speculation that it will have positive news at meetings it is hosting for
analysts next week.
UK airports operator BAA was in strong demand and the shares jumped 15 to
772p. The stock advanced for the second day in a row having languished in
previous sessions on the back of disappointing traffic figures.
Most of yesterday's buying was said to have been carried out by Swiss Bank
Corporation. Mr James Halstead, the transport analyst at SBC said simply:
'The shares had been marked down so much and it presented an excellent
buying opportunity.' Turnover was just short of a million shares by the
close.
The price of BP shares slipped again on very heavy turnover of 14m shares
following a series of profit downgrades and negative broker notes on the oil
company. The shares slipped 4 to 228 1/2 p.
Lubricants and chemicals company Burmah Castrol fell 7 to 688p after UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew downgraded the company's 1993 profits forecast on growing
fears for the German economy.
UBS cut its forecast to Pounds 93m from Pounds 97m after reducing its
expectations for Germany's 1993 GDP from 0.4 per cent to 'substantially
negative growth'. Between 30 per cent and 25 per cent of Burmah's profits
are D-Mark-related.
Insurer Prudential closed 9 better at 296p on turnover of 6m as the market
responded enthusiastically to an announcement that new business increased by
13.3 per cent last year. Mr Charles Landa at Strauss Turnbull raised his
forecast for 1993 accruals profits by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn and
reinforced his buy stance.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw analysts to discuss the potential
benefits of treasury activity but its shares still fell 9 to 915p following
overnight declines on Wall Street. The stock consolidated after being pushed
up on the previous day on unsubstantiated stories that an encouraging
article was about to be published in a medical journal.
Second-line pharmaceuticals Amersham and London International rose 11 to
674p and 5 to 267p respectively on support by Hoare Govett.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel benefited from encouraging comments by
French analysts. The shares moved 12 ahead to 389p. NFC gave up 8 to 274p in
spite of a series of presentations in the City by the company.
Shares in Lucas Industries, a good market of late on bid speculation, eased
4 to 145p on a combination of profit-taking and a reported profits
downgrading by Hoare Govett.
British Aerospace continued to be boosted by reports that it would soon sign
a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace over its regional jet division. The
shares climbed another 8 to 185p. Smiths Industries put on 3 to 379p, with
NatWest Securities reported to have had the main buyer. Broker Albert E.
Sharp was said to have shown keen interest in Glynwed International. The
shares hardened 8 to 257p.
Shares in First National Finance Corp rose 11 1/2 to 68p after a positive
statement on future trading. The consumer credit group said it should see
better results this year despite posting losses for the year to October 31
of Pounds 31m. The group also announced an expected Pounds 45.8m rights
issue to cut debt.
BZW and NatWest Securities were recommending London Electricity and the
shares responded up 5 to 443p.
