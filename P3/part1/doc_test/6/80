Woolwich building society yesterday announced a 46 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 149m to Pounds 217m in the year to December 31,
due to lower provisions for bad and doubtful debts and improved performances
from its 11 operating subsidiaries.
Pre-tax profits for the society itself, the UK's third largest, were Pounds
226m (Pounds 177m).
The society said the overall provisions for the group were Pounds 143m
(Pounds 183m), of which the charge for loan losses was Pounds 123m (Pounds
145m).
The number of homes in possession almost halved during the year from 3,453
to 1,806.
Gross mortgage lending by the society rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 2.86bn
(Pounds 2.54bn), but net lending fell back slightly to Pounds 972m (Pounds
978m).
Total assets grew by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 25bn.
Despite the intense competition for savings, the society's net retail
receipts rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 893m) and it had an 18.5 per cent
share of the building society savings market.
Only three subsidiaries incurred a loss in 1993. These were: Banque
Woolwich, the French mortgage-lending subsidiary; Woolwich SpA, the
Milan-based wholesale funded mortgage lending company; and Woolwich property
services, the estate agency, which trimmed its losses to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds
11m). Overall pre-tax losses from the subsidiaries fell to Pounds 9m (Pounds
27m).
Mr Donald Kirkham, group chief executive, said he expected the estate agency
to move into profit this year, and both the European subsidiaries to be in
profit by the end of 1995.
Cost/income ratio for the group fell to 49.3 per cent (52.9 per cent).
During 1993, Woolwich issued a further Pounds 175m subordinated debt, which
contributed to a year-end result of wholesale funds up slightly at 23 per
cent (22 per cent) of total share, deposit and loan liabilities - still well
below the regulatory limit of 40 per cent.
Mr Kirkham said he expected a 'substantial volume of pent-up demand' to be
released this year, leading to a rise in the number of property transactions
to 1.4m (1.2m), and a 5 per cent increase in house prices by the end of the
year.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said the results were
'impressive and robust.'
Though the fall in provisions was less steep than that reported by some
other large societies, this reflected the fact that in 1992 Woolwich had had
a lower than average provision charge on assets.
