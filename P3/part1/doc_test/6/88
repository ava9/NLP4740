Countryside Properties, one of south-east England's biggest housebuilders,
bounced back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m for the 12
months to September 30.
During the previous year the group incurred an Pounds 11.7m pre-tax loss,
after making exceptional provisions of Pounds 14.8m to compensate for
falling property values.
Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, said the improvement in house buyers' confidence
had been sustained following the Pounds 16.8m rights issue in May.
The profits increase, however, was lower than analysts had expected and the
shares slipped by 8p yesterday to 141p. This compared with the rights issue
price of 106p.
As expected the final dividend is maintained at 2.7p, making an unchanged
total of 4.11p, covered by earnings per share of 5.9p (losses of 16.6p).
The number of homes built by Countryside in the period jumped from 751 to
1,295. Almost 70 per cent of production was sold to housing associations or
similar social housing organisations.
Government finance for grants to housing associations is to be reduced in
1994-95. Associations would seek to maintain building programmes by pursuing
better value for money from experienced builders, Mr Cherry said.
Housing had made a Pounds 6m profit, compared with a Pounds 4.7m loss. The
number of private sector sales had risen from 282 to 393. Sales by value had
risen by 49 per cent.
Lower interest rates had made the initial cost of buying a home the cheapest
'for almost 20 years.'
The decision to phase out mortgage tax relief, also announced in the budget,
had been anticipated and was unlikely to have an adverse effect on the
gradual recovery in the housing market, said Mr Cherry.
The company was launching a range of low-cost houses to meet growing demand
from first time buyers.
The commercial property division also returned to the black, with profits of
Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 861,000 deficit). Property investment reduced its
annual loss from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 1.3m.
COMMENT
Feelings among analysts were very mixed following Countryside's results.
Disappointment that profits were not higher was seized on by critics as
further confirmation that the company never quite delivers all that it
promises. There was also concern at the extent of Countryside's housing
association sales in an increasingly competitive market. On the other hand
the group's large landbank will stand it in good stead as the private
housing market recovers. Profits from private house sales could easily
double this year. The sale of the group's property investment portfolio
would also dramatically improve the balance sheet, where gearing is
currently 100 per cent. Profits of Pounds 9.5m would put the group on a
prospective p/e of 13, which still looks cheap given the quality of the
landbank; but there are doubters.
