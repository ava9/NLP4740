Poor trading in the UK together with a loss of Pounds 8.8m on the disposal
of discontinued activities left ACT Group's interim pre-tax profits at
Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 11.5m.
The City had, however, anticipated the decline after a profits warning in
June. Strong underlying growth, principally in revenues and profits outside
the UK, helped push the share price of the Birmingham-based computing
services company up 5p to 103p.
Operating profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 9.89m
(Pounds 11.5m), including losses of Pounds 497,000 (Pounds 1.99m profits)
from discontinued activities. Sales were Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 107.6m) of
which Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 43.1m) related to discontinued businesses.
After tax of Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 2.88m) losses per share were 1.41p,
compared with earnings of 5.24p. Adjusting for the exceptional items
earnings came out at 4.05p (4.41p). An unchanged interim dividend of 1.75p a
share will be paid.
The group had net cash of Pounds 8.87m at the end of the period, only
slightly down on the Pounds 9.05m of 12 months previously. It intends to use
some of these resources to buy back up to 10 per cent of its stock at prices
which will enhance earnings.
ACT has been increasingly focusing on its chosen role as a supplier of
financial services software. Some 62 per cent of sales are now made abroad.
In the first half, overseas profits rose to Pounds 10.3m from Pounds 5.95m,
while UK profits fell to Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 4.6m).
Mr Michael Hart, managing director, said the UK fall was the result of an
extra Pounds 1.5m spent on research and development, a sharp decline in the
market for several of the group's products including the Quasar portfolio
management system and slow equities markets which had hit revenues at NMW,
the stock processing bureau.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said the group had shown resilience. He added
that trading had improved and he anticipated a sound second half.
