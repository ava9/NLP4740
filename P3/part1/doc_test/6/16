FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hadleigh Industries falls Pounds 1.15m into
red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hadleigh Industries Group, the USM-quoted industrial holding company, ended
the year to March 31 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.15m.
This compares with a profit of Pounds 1.77m last time and comes from
turnover down from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 29.5m.
The result reflected an unsettled year for the company - the accounts for
the first half were restated and some principal board members were replaced.
Of this year's loss some Pounds 400,000 represented property revaluations,
exceptional items and provisions for reorganisation costs.
The company said gearing had been reduced from 85 per cent to 70 per cent
during the year and steps had been taken to dispose of all investment
properties.
Losses per share came out at 8.7p (17.2p earnings). There is no final
dividend so the total for the year is 1.25p (6.5p).
