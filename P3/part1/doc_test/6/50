FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Brabant Resources Pounds 205,000 in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brabant Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas company, suffered pre-tax
losses of Pounds 205,000 for the half year to June 30, against profits of
Pounds 33,000.
The company also announced the acquisition of a package of producing assets
from Monument Oil and Gas for about Pounds 2.53m cash, payable in two
instalments.
Turnover declined to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.33m) and there were operating
losses of Pounds 407,000 (Pounds 111,000) because of problems with the
Claymore Field compressors, which Mr Nigel Swiffen, chairman, said had now
been solved.
The pre-tax result was after net interest received of Pounds 202,000 (Pounds
325,000). Losses per share emerged at 1.2p (0.2p earnings).
