red

MR GRENVILLE Dean, chair-man of Merivale Moore, the property group,
attributed the 'debility of the company' - of which he controls 'about 20
per cent' - to 'the fraught and failing UK economy'.
The company plunged from pre-tax profits of Pounds 615,000 to losses of
Pounds 13m in the year to June 30 and its net asset value fell from 245.5p
to 77p. No final dividend is being paid (7.75p), leaving the total at just
1p (10.5p) for the year.
The greater part of the losses - Pounds 9.63m (Pounds 1.23m) - were
exceptional write-downs in respect of property values.
He said that net debt was about Pounds 50m, roughly the same as last time,
although in September 1991 the company bought 130 luxury residential flats
in London's St John's Wood from Norwich Union for Pounds 20m. So far 50 had
been sold.
This represented a dilemma for the company - repay the debt or trade out of
the recession. Mr Dean said his policy was a mixture of both, but that
purchases were likely to be one-off and only if they were of very good
value.
Otherwise, the priority was to reduce the debt and, to this end, some
low-yielding residential 'family silver' had been sold. Mr Dean suspected
that there had been some 'technical breaches' in its banking facilities as
cover had weakened, but that its banks were 'quite happy'.
Turnover was halved to Pounds 30.3m (Pounds 78.8m) and net rental income was
almost halved to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 4.13m) after asset disposals. Total
income emerged at Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 14.1m). Operating losses were Pounds
3.35m (profits Pounds 1.84m).
Below the line there was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 7.74m (Pounds
148,000) relating to write-downs on long-term investment properties. This
resulted in retained losses of Pounds 19.7m (profits Pounds 169,000).
Losses per share totalled 144p (earnings 12.7p).
