NORTHUMBRIAN FINE Foods, the snack food manufacturer which earlier this year
postponed interim results and suspended its shares, is raising Pounds
785,000 net through a rights issue to fund the marketing and operating costs
of launching a new biscuit.
The reorganised USM-quoted company also reported that, hit by non-recurring
charges, it had swung from profits of Pounds 154,645 to losses of Pounds
5.66m pre-tax for the year to March 31.
The 8-for-25 rights issue is of 11.57m new ordinary shares at 8p a share. It
is being underwritten by Wise Speke.
Northumbrian plans to spend Pounds 300,000 of the proceeds on a television
advertising campaign for its new Dunkers, shaped-for-dunking, biscuit.
Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive since June, said: 'This is not a survival
rights. We are raising new money for a business plan.'
Turnover last year rose to Pounds 21m (Pounds 15.9m), helped by the first
full-year contribution of its Biscuits for the Connoisseur distribution
business.
The group returned operating profits of Pounds 103,413 (Pounds 832,526) but
before a total of Pounds 4.69m (Pounds 450,000) in exceptional charges
mainly reflecting the loss on the disposal of lossmaking Lees of Scotland.
Net interest payable was Pounds 660,847 (Pounds 422,718), reflecting debt of
more than Pounds 6m (about Pounds 3m). Prior to the rights the group had
Pounds 4.6m in recently restructured debt giving gearing of 108 per cent.
This is set to fall to 80 per cent post-rights.
The board does not recommend a dividend and paid only a 0.75p interim in the
previous period. Losses per share emerged at 15.68p (earnings 0.97p).
Directors plan to propose the reduction of the share premium account at the
annual meeting.
Intangible assets unchanged at Pounds 2.9m are now worth 44 per cent of
total assets. The company said its high proportion of intangibles, valued at
directors' estimates of brands, reflected a decline in tangible assets to
Pounds 5.47m (Pounds 9.78m) mainly related to the disposal of Lees.
Northumbrian bought the quoted confectionery and chocolate maker for Pounds
4.8m in 1991. Negotiations for its sale, including debt of almost Pounds 3m,
had delayed the interims and caused the share suspension in February. The
consideration was Pounds 1.15m and the new owners have an option to buy the
Lees brand, one of the intangible assets, for Pounds 1m within four years.
