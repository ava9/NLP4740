GEORGE WIMPEY, the large contractor and Britain's second biggest
housebuilder, yesterday announced its first pre-tax loss for at least half a
century.
The group - after provisions of Pounds 46.4m mostly against UK and US
housing land and a separate Pounds 12m provision against the Channel tunnel
construction contract - incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.1m. This
compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 43.3m in 1990.
It was the worst setback for the company since it was acquired in the 1920s
by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, founder of the modern-day Wimpey group.
Wimpey's shares, in spite of the expected profits decline, rose 16p
yesterday to 147p. The share price has risen a third since February 12 when
it stood at 110p.
The stock market, which has been encouraged by Wimpey's success in reducing
borrowings through disposals, was further cheered yesterday by its decision
to maintain its total dividend payment for last year at 10.5p.
Wimpey had to transfer Pounds 53.8m from reserves to cover dividend payments
and a Pounds 23.5m after-tax loss. The company made a loss per share, after
exceptional items, of 7.53p. This compared with earnings per share of 8.31p
in 1990.
Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, who said he had recently detected
flickers of life in the UK and US housing markets, defended a unanimous
decision by directors to maintain dividend payments.
He said it was the responsibility of companies in cyclical industries, such
as construction, to smooth out peaks and troughs and maintain a steady
reasonable return to shareholders - provided the balance sheet could afford
it and it did not impair future profitability.
At the end of last year Wimpey had reduced net debt by almost Pounds 100m to
Pounds 206.4m. As a result, gearing had fallen from 48 per cent to 35 per
cent.
Since the summer the group has raised Pounds 300m from commercial property
sales and the disposal of its waste management and offshore engineering
businesses. The group had identified another Pounds 100m of potential
disposals of which about half was expected to come from sales of investment
properties in the US.
Mr Dwyer said he was particularly encouraged by tentative signs of a revival
in the UK and US housing markets. Wimpey's UK house sales in the first 2 1/2
months of this year were running about 10 per cent higher than the company
had budgeted for. 'I believe we are now at the bottom of the cycle,' said Mr
Dwyer.
