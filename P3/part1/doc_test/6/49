Malaya Group, the fast expanding USM-quoted motor retailer, reported a
reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 378,000 for 1993, down from Pounds 982,000.
During the first full year of a planned expansion in the London and the home
counties, the group grew from two franchises at the start of 1993 to 10 by
the end of the year, with eight new and used car outlets. The group has also
been appointed the concessionaire for Bugatti in the UK.
The board said the restructuring and development, initiated by its new
management in the latter part of 1992, 'progressed wholly in line' with its
expectations.
Reflecting the expansion, turnover increased sharply to Pounds 49.7m (Pounds
8.35m), including Pounds 38.5m from acquisitions. At the operating level
losses fell from Pounds 692,000 to Pounds 331,000.
The reduced pre-tax loss was struck after a Pounds 43,000 profit on a
property disposal and reduced net interest costs of Pounds 90,000 (Pounds
290,000).
Losses per share were cut to 0.54p (4.93p).
In view of the loss, which the company said was in line with expectations,
no dividend is recommended.
In June Malaya raised Pounds 9.7m net of expenses through a placing and open
offer. The group said the remaining planned acquisitions in London and the
home counties would be funded from existing resources. It added that it had
experienced improved trading conditions since the start of 1994 and 'looks
forward to a return to profitable trading.'
