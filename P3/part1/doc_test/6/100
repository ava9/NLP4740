FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Property Trust calls for Pounds 2.6m as
losses slow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Property Trust reported sharply increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.95m
for the year to March 31, against Pounds 3.14m previously.
The results, which reflected a slowing of losses in the second half, after a
deficit of Pounds 6.32m in the first six months, were accompanied by a
proposed Pounds 2.6m rights issue.
The group, which reorganised its capital earlier this year, also confirmed
its move to the main market.
It yesterday forecast that, subject to the completion of a property sale,
pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 would not be less than
Pounds 400,000.
In the 12 months under review, turnover rose sharply to Pounds 9.52m (Pounds
1.32m) but cost of sales took Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 285,000) and provisions
for lower property values came to Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 1.3m).
An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.75m comprised Pounds 695,000 written off
an investment property and Pounds 1.06m against other investments and loans.
Losses per share jumped to 104.7p (56.3p). An extraordinary charge of Pounds
78,000 related to costs of the capital restructuring.
Shareholders will be offered three new shares for every two held, at 25p
apiece. Payment is in two instalments, with 10p due on acceptance and the
balance by next March.
The shares fell 1p to 21p yesterday.
