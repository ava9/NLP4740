AUKETT Associates, the London and Glasgow-based architect, made its first
trading loss in its 20-year history and reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds
3.88m for the year ended September 1992. Last time there were profits of
Pounds 360,000.
Turnover plunged to Pounds 8.53m (Pounds 16.05m) as the depressed state of
the property sector knocked fee income. In addition, the group absorbed
Pounds 2.74m in redundancy charges, bad debt provisions, and property
write-downs, on top of high interest charges.
There is no final dividend. Aukett passed the interim pay-out, and Mr Gerry
Deighton, chairman, said dividends were likely to resume only in the 1993-94
year. Losses per share were 20.77p (0.32p).
Mr Deighton said the group would sell its profitable Nathanial Lichfield
subsidiary, bought for Pounds 1.5m in 1989, to management for Pounds 1m
because it was the only means it had of reducing borrowings. Aukett would
write off Pounds 2.4m in goodwill leading to a net loss of Pounds 2m from
the transaction.
Results from DY Davies, the USM-quoted architect, also reflected the
depressed state of the sector as the group's pre-tax losses increased from
Pounds 426,000 to Pounds 484,000 in the half year ended October 31.
Losses per share were 8.3p (5.4p). There is no interim dividend.
