FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Orb to Pounds 13.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Orb Estates, the commercial property developer, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 13.8m for the year to June 30, compared with a restated loss last
time of Pounds 38.3m.
The company had returned to the black at the interim stage, with a profit
before tax of Pounds 8.23m.
The full-year result came on the back of turnover down 14 per cent at Pounds
11.3m (Pounds 13.1m). The board said profits were almost entirely made up of
exceptional items, including Pounds 14.5m credited in respect of the
company's capital reconstruction, as well as a Pounds 626,000 profit on the
sale of investment properties. Last year's figure included a Pounds 20.2m
write-off.
Operating profits were Pounds 2.92m, against losses of Pounds 3.6m after
losses at discontinued operations of Pounds 4.05m. Earnings per share were
1.98p (41.8p losses), taking into account the reconstruction and the share
issue in January.
