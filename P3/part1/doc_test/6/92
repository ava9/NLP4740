INVESCO, the UK-based fund management company, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 23m for the six months ended June 30, up sharply from Pounds 926,000
the year before, when exceptional charges offset almost all the company's
profits. Profits before exceptional items were Pounds 18.9m, against Pounds
14.7m.
Mr Charles Brady, chairman, said all areas grew except Invesco's UK
institutional fund management businesses. There, the company's business has
been hampered by civil charges filed against it by the Mirror Group Pension
Scheme in connection with assets it formerly managed on behalf of former
Maxwell company employees. That case is due to be heard in January.
He hoped that an out-of-court settlement could be reached. Invesco's
auditors qualified the accounts because of the claims and Mr Brady said he
did not expect the 1993 accounts to be similarly qualified.
Profits were helped by a Pounds 4m gain from the sale of Invesco's holdings
in a reconfigured investment trust formed after the dissolution of its
Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust - an unquoted companies fund which
experienced heavy losses - and the sale of the company's venture capital and
property management businesses.
The interim dividend remains unchanged at 1p per share. Earnings per share
were 7.1p against losses of 1.4p.
Mr Brady said the improved profitability also reflects strong growth in the
company's North American operations where there has been a surge in mutual
funds under management and strong growth in the management of
'money-purchase' pension plans. Development of those businesses has also
prompted a sharp rise in expenses to Pounds 65.3m from Pounds 50.4m. Funds
under management grew to Pounds 43bn (from Pounds 31m). North America
contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.1m (against Pounds 15.6m) while
Europe turned around to a profit of Pounds 2.3m from a loss of Pounds 4.2m.
Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of the company's European operations,
said it would be at least two years before Invesco's UK institutional
business recovers. The company needed to remain in that business 'because if
you cannot demonstrate your ability in your own market, you cannot convince
people in other markets'.
