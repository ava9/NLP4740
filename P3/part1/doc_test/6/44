FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional costs boosts Norcros

Norcros, the building materials and print and packaging group, reported a
substantial improvement in full year pre-tax profits reflecting higher
operating profits, the absence of exceptional losses and sharply reduced
interest costs.
Profits in the year to March 31 jumped to Pounds 17.1m from Pounds 2.63m,
restated for FRS 3. Turnover grew by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 378m (Pounds
352m) reflecting improvements in most markets.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 1.35m exceptional gain relating
to the discontinuing property division. In the comparable period there was
an exceptional loss of Pounds 7.59m on property disposals, offset by an
earlier Pounds 4.5m provision.
Earnings per share of 6.6p compared with losses of 2.4p. The final dividend
is maintained at 3.5p making an unchanged total for the year of 7p, as
forecast at the time of the group's rights issue in June 1993. The shares
closed 6p higher at 139p.
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, noted that the UK housing market showed signs
of growth last year while the commercial market continued to decline and
refurbishment expenditure fell slightly.
'Against this background, many of our businesses performed very well and a
majority of them produced improved sales and profits.'
Group operating profits, including a Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 2.1m) contribution
from associates, increased by 23 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 19.4m.)
In the core building products division operating profits were flat at Pounds
5.9m on turnover of Pounds 165.5m (Pounds 152.5m.)
The restructured ceramics division, including associates, posted increased
profits of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 5.6m) on turnover of Pounds 126m (Pounds
115.7m) while the print and packaging businesses lifted profits to Pounds
10.7m (Pounds 8.9m) on turnover of Pounds 109.9m (Pounds 101.9m.)
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 8.19m (Pounds 13.7m) as net borrowings
dropped from Pounds 120.2m to Pounds 68.7m representing gearing of 39.5 per
cent down from 94.8 per cent a year earlier. This reflected Pounds 19.4m of
property disposals and the successful rights issue last year.
COMMENT
Norcros' dividend payment, increased by last June's rights issue, remained
uncovered last year but that should be rectified this year as lower interest
costs, a slow improvement in operating margins and further property
portfolio sales help profits move ahead. However the management still has to
demonstrate that it can get to grips with the remaining building product
loss-makers and convert higher sales into more impressive margins. Pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 24m are expected this year producing earnings per
share of 8.8p. Although the shares have taken a tumble recently they are
still trading on a prospective multiple of 15.8 and look fairly priced.
