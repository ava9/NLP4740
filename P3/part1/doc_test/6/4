FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Inoco in the black with Pounds 2.56m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inoco, the USM-quoted property group, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.56m in 1993, compared with losses of Pounds 4.47m, restated in accordance
with FRS 3. There were profits of Pounds 834,000 at the halfway stage.
The turnround was largely the result of a reduction in interest charges from
Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 4.4m, reflecting net repayment of Pounds 11.9m of bank
loans and lower bank base rates. In addition, the 1992 figures included
exceptional losses of Pounds 4.1m on trading stocks and fixed assets.
Turnover, being gross rents received, improved to Pounds 9.97m (Pounds
9.46m) and operating profits rose from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 6.81m.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.21p (2.14p losses).
