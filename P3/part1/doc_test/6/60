FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 2.7m loss at Anglo St James
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE adverse conditions in the property market which led to a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 2.72m in the 18 months ended December 31 1991, Anglo St James
achieved some progress.
Mr Jeffrey Green, chairman, said important points were the merger of the
former company, Anglo-Park, with St James Estates, settlement of a
litigation claim for Pounds 1.75m, plus costs to be assessed, against a firm
of chartered surveyors, and a reduction of borrowings by achieving lettings
and disposals at 'acceptable levels'.
Since the year-end overall net borrowings have been cut by 27 per cent to
about Pounds 5.7m. The group continued to operate well within its bank
facilities, the chairman said.
In the 18 months the group incurred an operating loss of Pounds 1.03m
(profit Pounds 329,000 for the year to June 1990). But exceptional charges
of Pounds 1.56m pushed the pre-tax level to Pounds 2.72m (profit Pounds
404,000).
Trading losses were expected to be reduced significantly in 1992, a year of
consolidation, Mr Green stated. Rental income now exceeded interest payable
and made a substantial contribution towards overheads which had been reduced
significantly since the merger.
The exceptionals included the recovery from the legal action, less charges.
The principal items in those were provisions against investment properties
Pounds 1.62m and against properties held for resale Pounds 945,000.
Losses per share were 23.1p (earnings 4.4p). There is no final dividend to
leave the payment at 0.5p (3p for previous year).
