</HEADLINE>

ELECTRICITY issues were heavily traded as securities house Kleinwort Benson
was said to have carried out a large switch out of the Electricity Package.
Kleinwort was believed to have sold around 9,000 package contracts,
equivalent to 9m underlying shares in the regional electricity companies
(Recs), and bought into Yorkshire, Southern and Eastern.
There has been considerable switching recently ahead of the results season,
which begins in earnest with East Midland's full-year figures on June 15,
and ahead of the forthcoming break-up of the package in the late summer or
early autumn.
The Recs saw two-way business as some investors sold out on worries that the
impact of British Coal privatisation talks would spill on to the electricity
sector. Yorkshire gained 1 1/2 to 390 1/2 p with 4.2m traded, Southern lost
5 to 321p on turnover of 4.8m, and Eastern fell 9 to 276p on 3.5m dealt. The
package lost Pounds 90 to Pounds 3255.
Switching in banks
Clearing banks National Westminster and Barclays took separate paths
yesterday after securities house Kleinwort Benson advised clients to move
funds from the first to the second. NatWest lost 12 to 353p, while Barclays,
in spite of a downgrade of its long-term debt by credit rating agency
Moody's Investors Service, put on 5 to 386p.
Mr Norrie Morrison, of Kleinwort's banking team, said NatWest had
outperformed the market by 20 per cent since the general election and outrun
Barclays by more than 45 per cent since last July. 'We think the talk about
Barclays' exposure to property is a little over the top, and there is a very
significant upside there.'
Figures from Marks and Spencer were in line with expectations but, as
feared, the level of UK sales proved to be disappointing. To emphasise the
point M and S chairman Sir Richard Greenbury said the recession was not yet
over and sent shivers through the rest of the retailing sector.
The gloomy UK outlook prompted most analysts to downgrade their forecasts,
with cuts from the Pounds 775m level to around Pounds 755m. The shares
firmed a penny to 331p.
In similar vein, Argos also reported sluggish first-half sales at its annual
meeting, the shares sliding 6 to 278p.
Insurer General Accident reversed an intraday gain to close a net 9 off at
489p. Better than expected first-quarter results, accompanied by a positive
trading statement, had prompted an initial rise of 11.
However, the market then concentrated on the net asset value which, at
around 470p per share, was disappointing and showed the shares to be
slightly expensive. Also, Cazenove was said to have recommended a switch out
of GA and into Guardian Royal Exchange, steady at 158p.
Life insurer Britannic saw unusually heavy turnover as its own pension fund
halved its 8.8 per cent stake in the company by placing 3m shares in the
market. The shares were traded as a number of small agency crosses with
institutions at 895p.
The sale was prompted by the 1990 Social Security Act, which came into force
in January and demands that investment by a pension fund in its own company
is limited to 5 per cent of the fund's assets.
Yesterday's placing by company broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had been expected
and had been suppressing the price of the shares as potential buyers waited
to pick up stock at a discount. Britannic rose 5 to 910p.
Analysts said the next company in the sector to be affected is United
Friendly, where 19 per cent of the pension fund assets are in United stock.
United firmed 3 to 358p.
BP attracted US buying and bucked the general trend after stating that it
was selling its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada for CDollars 374m. The sale
is something of a drop in the ocean compared to BP's debts, but it took the
market by surprise and appeared to demonstrate that BP was serious about
getting its books straight.
Weekend press comment suggesting Hanson might buy a stake in BP, and also
firmer crude oil prices, helped the shares. BP gained 5 to 257p and was
actively traded with 15m shares changing hands.
There was talk that one of the market's leading agency brokers had attempted
to place 11m shares in Racal Electronics, although no deal was recorded by
the end of the day's trading. The shares slipped a penny to 61 1/2 p.
A recent buy note issued by SG Warburg Securities failed to sustain BT,
where the fully-paid declined 4 to 347p. Traders said there was some
nervousness ahead of BT's fourth-quarter figures, due next week, and that
Cazenove, the company's broker, had been an aggressive seller of the shares.
Theme park operator Euro Disney dropped 52 to 1268p on a French press
report, vehemently denied by the group, that attendances were well below the
level anticipated.
Rolls-Royce declined 5 to 168 1/2 p after Nomura weighed in with a 1993
profits downgrade. Leaving the 1992 figure at a low Pounds 105m, the
securities house reduced the following year's figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds
170m.
Mr John Lawson at Nomura said: 'The scale of the pick-up in civil spares is
still disappointing.'
News of a Dollars 50m order and, at the company's annual meeting, improved
demand lifted Simon Engineering 8 to 291p.
A sizeable amount of stock continued to overhang Pilkington following
Monday's bought deal between BZW and BTR. Pilkington ended 6 lower at 154p,
while BTR fell 8 to 488p.
The hard-hit US hotel industry weighed heavily on Bass, also affected by a
1.5m line of stock reported as being offered by Panmure Gordon. The shares
shed 16 to 637p.
United Biscuits slipped 9 to 419p after warning that first-half profits
would show an 'overall decline'. BZW promptly cut its 1992 profits forecast
by Pounds 9m to Pounds 218m.
USM-quoted TJ Hughes, the discount retailer, made an impressive market
debut. The shares closed at 90p, compared with the 75p issue price.
