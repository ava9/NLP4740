RECESSION IN its core markets of construction, property and housing forced
Higgs and Hill to make exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and report a
pre-tax loss in the year to December 31.
Announcing losses of Pounds 16.7m, against profits of Pounds 6.84m in 1990,
Mr John Theakston, group chief executive, summed up: 'It's not been a lot of
fun out there.'
Higgs is recommending a cut in the final dividend to 3p (14p) to make a
sharply reduced total of 9p (20p), which is uncovered. The company said the
final payment, combined with an 'appropriate' interim, should be seen as the
base for future dividends.
Turnover fell sharply to Pounds 345.2m (Pounds 488m) due to volume declines
in its main markets. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 6.97m (Pounds
18.6m). A reduced interest charge of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 4.35m) could not
prevent profits before exceptionals falling to Pounds 4.22m (Pounds 14.2m).
Construction was worst affected and turnover fell more than 25 per cent to
Pounds 309.4m (Pounds 422.3m). The fall was compounded by the closure of a
specialist engineering business and reduced management contracting.
Trading profits from property fell to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.48m) from
turnover of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 32.8m). Although the UK remained depressed,
the company's Spanish office developments performed well and three have been
pre-sold.
The housing division sold 235 units during the year, down from 280 in 1990,
and average prices declined more than 10 per cent to Pounds 100,000.
Provisions of Pounds 13.6m were made to cover falls in housing land values.
Following the provisions, average carrying values are at 20 per cent of unit
sale prices which should allow the company to maintain its gross margin.
Other provisions of Pounds 7.34m covered commercial property, redundancy
costs - staff numbers have been cut 35 per cent over the last 15 months, and
a loss on a contract for the US bank JP Morgan.
Extraordinary losses of Pounds 7.51m for closures and disposals took losses
attributable to shareholders to Pounds 19.7m. Combined with the dividend
charge, a Pounds 23.7m transfer from reserves was required.
COMMENT
Given the gloom from the construction leaders, Higgs and Hill's figures were
hardly surprising. Indeed, the shares gained 8p to 88p, partly on relief the
dividend was not cut further, and partly because the market appreciated the
thorough levels of provisions. But while taking the full hit may be in
vogue, predicting the company's recovery is more tricky. Its main
construction division cannot expect to avoid a further downturn in line with
the industry this year. Property also remains vulnerable in the UK and Higgs
and Hill's problem is that only one of its three businesses, housing, is an
early cycle recovery-play. Following the dividend cut, this year's pay-out
should total about 4.5p, suggesting a yield of 6.4 per cent. With forecast
profits of Pounds 2.5m this year, putting them on a multiple of 22, the
shares look fairly valued, even on net assets of close to 200p.
