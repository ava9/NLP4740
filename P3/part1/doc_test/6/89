TransAtlantic Holdings, the insurance and property group, yesterday
announced a 46 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 30.2m to
Pounds 44.2m in the first half to June 30.
Most of the rise was attributed to property investment income from the
group's shopping centres, which rose to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 14.4m), and to
its half share in the profit from Sun Life, which increased from Pounds
18.5m to Pounds 22.5m.
While Sun Life achieved a 19 per cent rise in new regular premium business,
to reach Pounds 68m, TransAtlantic sounded a note of caution about prospects
for 1994 as a whole.
It said that the life and pensions market overall was showing signs of
contraction and the year-on-year increase was not likely to be sustained for
the full term.
The board is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 6p. Mr David Fischel,
managing director, said this was in accordance with the group's normal
policy of proposing an interim dividend of half the previous year's total.
The group recorded an exceptional profit of Pounds 13.3m from the flotation
of Capital Shopping Centres, the regional shopping centre company in which
TransAtlantic retains a 75 per cent stake. There was an exceptional Pounds
400,000 loss relating to the disposal of investment properties.
Capital &amp; Counties, a wholly owned subsidiary of TransAtlantic which
includes CSC, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 12.8m) for
the first half. Income from property investment rose to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds
35.8m).
Alongside the flotation of CSC, Mr Donald Gordon, TransAtlantic's chairman,
highlighted the acquisition of the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford for
Pounds 162m in February. This contributed Pounds 4.2m of the property
investment income.
Earnings per share rose by 38 per cent to 8.26p (5.98p). The shares rose 3p
to 381p.
