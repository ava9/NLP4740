The continuing slide on the Madrid stock market has rattled the Spanish
government and forced Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to deny
persistent reports that he may soon be driven from office.
His office yesterday signalled his intention to stay, despite legal probes
into his government's security services that have prompted opposition calls
for his resignation.
'Speculation that the prime minister will stand down is completely
groundless,' said a senior aide to Mr Gonzalez.
His government has been rocked in recent days by judicial investigations of
an alleged misuse of reserve funds by interior ministry officials and of the
role alleged to have been played by former high-ranking security officers in
an undercover war against Eta, the Basque separatist group.
'The government has a clear programme for 1995, which includes important
economic reforms and major European responsibilities in the second half of
the year, during the Spanish presidency of the EU,' the official said. 'This
requires firm government and the prime minister has the parliamentary
support to deliver it.'
Mr Gonzalez's governing socialist party yesterday blocked an attempt by
opposition groups to open a parliamentary investigation of the scandals that
have involved the interior ministry and the security services.
The 'business as usual' message came as traders said Madrid's stock market
had clearly de-coupled from Wall Street and from the main European markets.
The market fell by nearly 4 per cent on opening yesterday, though it then
regained some ground, with the index finishing down 0.36 per cent at 283.59,
a new low for the year.
'This is the worst December for 10 years on the Spanish markets,' said Mr
Juan Bastos, chief executive of the Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. The fall
was 'absolutely driven by political sentiment,' he added.
Reflecting a high political risk premium, the 10-year Spanish Treasury bond,
which had yielded 8 per cent at the begining of 1994, has hovered between
11.50 and 12 per cent in the past few days, maintaining a spread of more
than 400 points against the German long bond. Tracking market sentiment, the
Treasury yesterday boosted the marginal yield on its one-year bills by
nearly half a point to 9.4 per cent.
The market nervousness coincided with a Madrid judge starting a legal probe
of hundreds of bank cheques, drawn from the interior ministry's reserve
account at the Bank of Spain, that were alleged to have been used to swell
the pay packets of ministry officials and security chiefs.
The investigation, which could lead to charges of widespread embezzlement of
public funds by a network of senior officials, is linked to a scandal
involving a former head of the Guardia Civil, Mr Luis Roldan, who became a
fugitive from justice in May when he had been accused of having enriched
himself illegally.
A second Madrid judge has re-opened a case involving a death squad
responsible for 23 deaths in the mid-1980s during operations against Eta.
The renewed investigation follow a decision by two police officers,
sentenced in connection with the squad, to provide further evidence that is
alleged to incriminate their superiors.
The judge remanded three former security chiefs in custody last week and he
is expected to indict more senior officials in connection with the case in
weeks ahead. Mr Jose Barrionuevo, a former interior minister, said yesterday
he would take legal action over press reports linking him to the death
squad.
