  [Text] This morning in Madrid, Spain's King Juan Carlos 
received Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs. Our minister also met Apolonio 
Ruiz Ligero, the state secretary for foreign trade. We have a 
phone report from Madrid by Andjelko Perincic: 
  The reception at the residence of the Spanish royal family 
Zarzuela, 20 kilometers from the center of Madrid, was also 
attended by Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and Croatian 
Ambassador to Spain Sergey Morsan, and Spanish Ambassador to 
Croatia Felipe Luis de la Pena. 
  Sources of the Croat delegation said that the atmosphere was 
very friendly and the meeting lasted twice as long as is 
customary. Minister Granic informed the Spanish king about 
attempts to reintegrate Croatia's occupied areas in a peaceful 
way, and noted problems and obstructions by the Serbs in the 
implementation of the Zagreb agreements. He also spoke about 
the problems relating to the implementation of the agreement on 
the Croat-Bosnian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and praised 
the Spanish blue helmets. 
  They also discussed cooperation between the two countries, 
in 
which respect the Spanish king lent support, particularly to the 
development of economic relations. The Spanish sovereign also 
sent greetings to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman and the 
Republic of Croatia and wished our country speedy admission into 
the European circle of countries. 
  At the Ministry of Trade and Tourism the two sides discussed 
exclusively economic cooperation and Spanish support for Croatia 
to receive financial aid as soon as possible. The Spanish side 
lent its full support to our initiative to be admitted to GATT 
as soon as possible, to obtain credits from the European Union 
[EU] PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
program, and to be admitted, with the credits obtained, into the 
EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], IMF, 
and the World Bank. Everything is ready for the signing of 
bilateral Croatian-Spanish treaties: On mutual protection of 
investments and avoidance of double taxation, while agreements 
on road traffic and tourism are to be signed today. While I am 
reporting this, talks between Croatian and Spanish ministers of 
foreign affairs, Mate Granic and Javier Solana respectively, are 
in progress.
