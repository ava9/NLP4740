  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Spain, the foreign minister has 
justified the NATO attack. Javier Solana said that the planes 
shot down violated the UN resolutions. Concern is now focused 
on the Spanish troops serving with the United Nations in the 
conflict area. The soldiers and the conscientious objectors are 
well, but on alert awaiting events. The Defense Ministry is in 
permanent contact with the forces in Bosnia and measures have 
been taken to avoid danger. Ana Medina reports: 
  [Medina] [passage omitted] The Spanish forces have continued 
with the tasks of escorting convoys because the Spanish 
positions are in areas controlled by Croats and Muslims, but 
convoys to Serb enclaves are suspended. There is also calm 
among the Spanish conscientious objectors, who are working far 
from the Serb firing line. The Principe de Asturias aircraft 
carrier is on alert at Rota base ready to depart if it is 
considered necessary. The Defense Ministry is in permanent 
contact with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command and the 
Spanish military command in Bosnia. The government supported 
the NATO action in the voice of Foreign Minister Javier Solana, 
who said that although on previous occasions air space had been 
violated, this time there was a special element because the 
intruding aircraft had bombed Bosnian territory: 
  [Begin Solana recording] Yes, this violation had special 
significance and it is a violation, which we consider to be 
important, of a UN resolution. Therefore, there was an emphatic 
action, as you were able to witness this morning. [end recording] 
  [Medina] The United Left, however, has criticized this 
operation which it considers to be an extreme and inopportune 
interpretation of the UN mandate that will not help the process 
of detente that has been achieved. 
  [Announcer] The prime minister has also just spoken about 
the 
latest events in the area. He spoke after visiting the 
president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, in the Pardo Palace 
[Madrid]. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports: 
  [Cespedes] Following the line of the allied heads of 
government, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez says that the NATO 
air attack is, he believes, the strict fulfillment of the UN 
Security Council resolutions: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] And I hope there will be no more 
violations so there are no incidents that create added tension 
at a time when there was an opening, and there still is, of a 
certain hope for peace in Bosnia after a long time. [end 
recording] 
  [Cespedes] Repercussions following the shooting down of the 
four Serb planes cannot be predicted. To speculate on this 
would be dangerous, although Felipe Gonzalez emphasized that so 
far there had been no negative reaction.
