  [Text] According to sources at the Moncloa Palace, Spanish 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has decided to postpone his 
official visit to Paraguay, due to take place at the beginning 
of next week. 
  Felipe Gonzalez's trip to Paraguay was scheduled for 16-18 
May. Ten days ago Gonzalez also postponed his trip to Romania 
and Bulgaria, due to take place last week, because of the 
political crisis unleashed by the flight of Luis Roldan, the 
former head of the Civil Guard, and by the fact that the former 
governor of the Bank of Spain and Manuel De La Concha, former 
head of the Madrid stock market, were sent to jail, as well as 
by the resignations of Interior and Agriculture Ministers Antoni 
Asuncion and Vicente Albero.
