  [Text] The Bolivian foreign affairs and finance ministers 
begin an official visit to Spain today in Madrid in search of 
business partners among Spanish firms for their state 
telecommunications, electricity, petrol, gas, air transport, and 
railway companies. 
  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga and 
Finance Minister Fernando Alvaro Cosio [name as received], have 
a full agenda including meetings with King Juan Carlos, Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Foreign Minister Javier Solana, as 
well as Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, Interior Minister 
Antoni Asuncion, and Trade Minister Javier Gomez-Navarro. In 
addition, they will have a business breakfast with Spanish 
businessmen. 
  Bolivia has started a program of state company 
privatizations 
in which the private partner will take total control of the 
management for an ongoing term and will be the sole owner of the 
profits. 
  Spanish aid for Bolivia is another item on the agenda. Since 
1989 Spain has granted credits to Bolivia worth $200 million, 
half of which have been used, while the rest is waiting for the 
Bolivian projects to be financed to be identified.
