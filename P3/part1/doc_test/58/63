THE SPANISH Government was yesterday trying hard to stave off a rise in
interest rates after agreeing to a 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta at
the emergency meeting of the EC monetary committee in Brussels in the early
morning.
By late afternoon, the Bank of Spain is understood to have injected some
Dollars 12bn into the interbank market to dampen strong pressure for higher
rates. The central bank, though, said it had not intervened in the foreign
exchange markets and the peseta showed some signs of stabilising around
Pta70 to the D-Mark, well down on its new parity of Pta68.4 but still
comfortably clear of its Pta72.6 floor.
The Spanish authorities are hoping desperately that the devaluation agreed
in Brussels would see the currency through at least the rest of the week,
until the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. Upward
pressure on rates in the interbank market showed there were still worries
about the fate of the Spanish currency ahead of the French vote.
Spanish officials went to Brussels on Wednesday night determined to remain
in the exchange rate mechanism and there was considerable satisfaction in
Madrid yesterday that this had been achieved. 'ERM membership is the biggest
asset Spain has,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief economist at Banco
Santander de Negocios.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, told MPs that the government had
been forced to devalue to protect itself against speculators. It had been
inevitable because after the exit of sterling and the lire speculators would
have turned against the peseta and an interest rate rise would have been
unable to prevent it.
Nevertheless, the devaluation badly undermines Madrid's long-standing
commitment to a strong currency and passes the burden of fighting inflation
on to the budget.
Mr de Pinies said he believed the Bank of Spain would need to raise its 13
per cent base rate by up to 2 percentage points if the French vote against
the treaty on Sunday, but warned that this would be 'a very dangerous thing
to do as we enter a recessionary phase in the economy'.
The other solution would be to devalue further, he said. But the 5 per cent
devaluation is already likely, to add at least one percentage point to
Spanish inflation this year said Mr Jorge Hay of Banco Central Hispano.
Business insisted that complementary moves by the government were necessary
to maintain the credibility of the new exchange rate. 'The devaluation means
nothing unless it comes together with a budget that sharply reduces the
public deficit and forces through salary moderation,' said Mr Guillermo de
la Dehesa, chairman of Spain's association of chambers of commerce.
Mr Solchaga is due to present his 1993 budget to parliament next month, a
task already hampered by huge overruns on spending and income shortfalls
this year. Draft proposals suggest the government has been considering a
nominal increase in spending of 8 per cent but this, yesterday, was
beginning to look distinctly expansionary. Mr de Pinies said Madrid should
now be looking at a 5 per cent increase 'at the most'.
Spain's public sector deficit in the first half of this year was 40 per cent
up on 1991 and 116 per cent higher in the month of July. The current account
deficit in the first half overshot official forecasts by more than Pta428bn
to stand at Pta1,405bn. The country is running the second highest trade
deficit in the west.
Yesterday's devaluation was the first since Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez'
socialist Government devalued immediately after coming to power in 1982.
