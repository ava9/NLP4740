  [Text] In Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is 
meeting Nurulstan Nazarbayev, president of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, with whom he will hold a joint news conference on 
his state visit to Spain. 
  Nazarbayev will have lunch with Gonzalez and will visit the 
Senate and the Madrid town hall during this second day of his 
official visit to Spain. 
  On 23 March, during the dinner held in honor of President 
Nazarbayev, King Juan Carlos I of Spain highlighted his 
appreciation of Kazakhstan's contribution to stability in Europe 
and the world -- a contribution made by joining the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty and by signing disarmament treaties. 
  Earlier, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and his 
Kazakhstan counterpart signed agreements that form the legal 
basis for cooperation. Solana announced that the Spanish state 
will guarantee credits of up to $25 million for Spanish exports 
to Kazakhstan.
