THE SPANISH government has been shaken by an official survey showing that
unemployment reached a record 3.05m people at the end of 1992, with nearly
half a million jobs lost during the year. The report said the jobless rate
seemed to be quickening.
The figures put Spanish unemployment at 20.06 per cent, the highest in the
European Community, and will fuel a simmering row in Spain over whether the
EC president, Mr Jacques Delors, was correct to warn recently that Spanish
unemployment could put a brake on the country's progress towards economic
and monetary union.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said the national statistics institute
survey's results were 'saddening and surprising'.
The figures catch Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's socialist government at
one of its worst moments in more than 10 years in office. An election has to
be held by the end of November and polls show the socialists losing support
to both the Left and Right, with incipient divisions in the party out in the
open.
