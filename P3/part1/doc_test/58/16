  [Text] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz is in Madrid as the 
first Hungarian head of state in our country. Following an 
official reception at the Pardo Palace, Goncz's official 
residence during the visit, the Hungarian president and his wife 
are having lunch with the King and Queen of Spain at the 
Zarzuela Palace. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Cespedes] President Arpad Goncz's visit 
fits in with the Spanish government policy of paying special 
attention to central and eastern Europe and coincides with a 
good period in Spanish-Hungarian relations. These [relations] 
are without problems; trade has increased three-fold over the 
last two years. This is a fact underscored by President Goncz 
recently at [Madrid's] Barajas airport where he said that his 
visit had a strong economic component. 
  [Goncz in Hungarian with superimposed Spanish translation] 
Our political relations are satisfactory and successful but I 
have brought with me a very big delegation--virtually an entire 
army--of businessmen. I hope that thanks to them the economic 
component of this visit will be enhanced. 
  [Cespedes] The trade balance currently favors Spain by five 
billion pesetas, that is a surplus of 153 percent. Spanish 
exports went from 4.8 billion pesetas in 1991 to 14.108 billion 
in 1993. 
  Spanish investment is planned in Hungarian wine companies. 
After the sale of 76 trains, by the Kaf company, there are 
possibilities that the Talgo [Spanish high speed train] will 
link Kiev, Budapest and Vienna. 
  The situation in Bosnia will be an important topic during 
the 
political talks that Arpad Goncz and [Spanish Prime Minister] 
Felipe Gonzalez will hold this afternoon. The Hungarian 
president has said that he hopes that the conflict will be 
solved without having to carry out the heralded air strikes.
