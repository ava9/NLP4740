  [Text] A few minutes ago Spanish Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana referred to the situation in Bosnia and to Russia. He 
went to Madrid's Barajas Airport to welcome President Boris 
Yeltsin at the start of a three-day visit to Spain, his first 
[official visit to Spain]. Good afternoon, Hector Arenas. 
  [Arenas] Good afternoon. Spanish Foreign Minister Solana 
said when meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin that Spain was 
informed throughout about the attack by NATO aircraft on Serb 
positions [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Then he said that the 
situation in that region remains delicate and the possibility of 
further allied attacks has not ended: 
  [Begin Solana recording] As you know, the situation is still 
delicate right now. The possibility of there being more actions 
has not ended, but I can tell you that our troops, the Spanish 
troops, who are quite some way from Goradze, are also, 
logically, on prealert. [end recording] 
  Solana also denied that Spain has decided not to offer any 
more economic aid to Russia during Yeltsin's visit. He added 
that they will be offered around $900 million in credit lines, 
agreements, and investment.
