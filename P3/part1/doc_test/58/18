<F P=106> ["I.C." report: "Spanish Advisers Believe That Cuban </F>
Economic Liberalization Proposal Does Not Go Far Enough"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The ideas submitted by the Cuban leaders 
to their Spanish interlocutors for reviving their economy are 
rather stopgaps for a crisis and are far from being a 
comprehensive and rapid reform plan, leading to a market 
economy, according to administration sources. A Cuban 
delegation led by Carlos Lage -- the regime's number three -- 
has been in Madrid since Monday [28 March] in order, according 
to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, to discuss "the measures 
which will serve to transform that system, liberalize the 
economy, and surmount the crisis situation." 
  State Finance Committee Chairman Lage is accompanied by 
State 
Council Vice President Jose Luis Rodriguez. Their main 
interlocutor in Madrid has been former Economy Minister Carlos 
Solchaga, who is supervising a team of experts comprising Bank 
of Spain officials and Argentaria executives, who are advising 
Cuba. 
  The two Cuban officials also met Tuesday with Gonzalez and 
with Economy Minister Pedro Solbes. Yesterday, they met in turn 
with Foreign Minister Javier Solana and with European Commission 
Vice President Manuel Marin, and, before returning to Havana, 
they have a meeting arranged today with Trade Minister Javier 
Gomez Navarro. 
  At a joint press conference with Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, Gonzalez did not analyze in detail the differences 
between the Cubans and their advisers on the path which the 
regime should take. However, he explained that the Spanish side 
"insists that the measures should be internally consistent." 
"They should not be disconnected from each other in such a way 
that the system is inconsistent." One of the Cubans' 
interlocutors specified that Lage, who is in effect Fidel 
Castro's prime minister, has not set himself overall economic 
aims steps to be taken accordingly, in accordance with a 
detailed timetable [sentence as published]. "They are tending to 
undertake uncoordinated initiatives in order to alleviate the 
situation," the same source added. 
  The new measures submitted by Lage to his hosts include, for 
instance, the introduction of taxation in a country devoid of 
taxes, and a greater opening up of the island to the outside 
world by facilitating air and telephone communications. 
According to Gonzalez, "greater freedom of movement outward and 
into the island itself" will be granted. He also wishes to 
encourage the setting up of small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
Some initial liberalizing measures were put into practice last 
summer. The liberalization process is being conducted very 
slowly. "On the Cuban side, they are trying to do this with the 
least social cost," Gonzalez explained. "They are concerned 
about the rate of the reform," he added. 
  The [Spanish] prime minister expressed once more yesterday 
his desire for the economic reform to bring about political 
change eventually. "A free economy calls for a society with a 
greater degree of freedom," he emphasized, although he 
acknowledged that there are exceptions such as Franco's Spain 
and, more recently, General Pinochet's Chile. 
  Nevertheless, he highlighted "signs of interest" on the part 
of the Cuban regime, such as the meeting which Robaina will hold 
in April with part of the moderate opposition. However, Lage 
did not announce any political change to his interlocutors. 
  For his part, Solana offered his services to the Cuban 
number 
three in order to inform U.S Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher of the economic changes which Cuba intends to set 
under way.
