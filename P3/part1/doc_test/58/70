  [Text] The Spanish Government, through the Diplomatic 
Information Office, has released a communique in which it 
expresses its profound consternation at the tragic massacre of 
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. The communique 
adds that the Spanish Government still believes that the peace 
process and the prompt application of the declaration of 
principles represent the only possible alternative in the face 
of the continuation of violence and clashes in the occupied 
territories. 
  The text also asks for a fresh effort from all the parties 
to 
restore a climate of harmony and calm, which will make it 
possible to achieve peace as soon as possible.
