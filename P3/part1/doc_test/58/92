  [Text] According to Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, 
Spain supports Malta's EU [European Union] membership bid and 
urges ending the dialogue phase in order to start the formal 
negotiations. 
  Javier Solana made a short visit to Malta on Monday [28 
March] where he met President Vincent Censu, the prime minister, 
and the foreign minister. 
  Solana believes that one should work in the areas of 
politics, economics, and the institutions to find ways that will 
allow this country to join the EU. According to Solana, the 
discussions of these three points essential for a rapid 
accession are progressing well, and the dialogue that started 
over the last few years is about to come to a conclusion. Malta 
applied for EU membership in July 1990.
