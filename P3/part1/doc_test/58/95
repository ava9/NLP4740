  [Text] At the German-Spanish summit in Schwerin, Helmut 
Kohl will perhaps complain to his friend [Spanish Prime 
Minister] Felipe Gonzalez that Gonzalez could have spared him a 
lot of trouble about the new European Union [EU] Commission 
president, if Gonzalez had run for this office himself in time. 
The Spaniard, on the other hand, could admit that the chief's 
chair in Brussels would have promised him a brighter future than 
the fate of his minority government, which is darkened by 
corruption scandals. 
  In fact, the two Euroenthusiasts, who have been inseparable 
for years, must now seriously discuss disturbances in their 
relationship. Until recently Gonzalez favored Ruud Lubbers as 
Commission president, when Kohl, together with Mitterrand, had 
already dropped the Dutchman. It is questionable whether Spain 
will now turn toward Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene. There are 
enough signals of bitterness in Madrid about the reckless 
rotation of the German-French axis. At the summit in Granada in 
1993, Gonzalez agreed with Kohl on a three-part coordination of 
the three consecutive EU presidencies of the three countries. 
Now he, as the junior partner, must realize that the two 
seniors first agreed on the further enlargement of the EU 
without him. 
  Spain's resistance against EU enlargement had caused outrage 
in Bonn, the echo of which has not yet vanished. The EU's 
enlargement to the north and the east makes Madrid fear that 
Brussels' generous subsidies for the south, of which Spain gets 
the lion's share, might abate. Since the establishment of a 
competitive economy is, however, lagging behind because there is 
a lack of capital and innovation, Madrid will have to ask for 
help for a long time to come.
