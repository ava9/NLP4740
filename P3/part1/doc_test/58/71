  [Excerpt] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl are currently traveling to Ruegen Island 
in the Baltic Sea, where they will continue their talks. 
Gonzalez and Kohl have just given a news conference. Pedro 
Fernandez Cespedes reports from Schwerin: 
  [Cespedes] Speaking at a news conference a few minutes ago, 
Felipe Gonzalez and Helmut Kohl expressed their agreement on the 
European matters which they will take to the EU [European Union] 
Council meeting, to be chaired by the Greek presidency, to be 
held in Corfu. It appears that there is agreement on the name 
of the person to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the 
Commission, although they did not reveal the name. They want to 
continue consulting with their EU colleagues. 
  Agreement between the two leaders was also highlighted by 
the 
Spanish prime minister, who said he feels closer to the German 
chancellor on matters relating to Europe than he does to the 
Spanish Popular Party. He also agrees that what is important is 
not the timetable for a single European currency, but economic 
stability and the stability of financial markets. [passage
