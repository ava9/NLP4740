  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in 
Seville this morning that after the massacre of 58 Palestinians 
on 25 February in a mosque in Hebron, the Spanish Government is 
shocked and Felipe Gonzalez has sent a telegram to the 
Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to express to him the sorrow of 
the Spanish Government. 
  The minister stressed that right now it is essential for the 
Washington agreements on the autonomy of occupied territorities 
to come into operation as soon as possible. Solana was 
confident that in spite of this catastrophe the peace process 
will not be slowed down but, on the contrary, speeded up. 
  Javier Solana recalled that Spain is committed to the Middle 
East peace process. He added that there is no decision in the 
direction of UN troops going to the occupied territories and he 
mentioned the meeting which the UN Security Council will be 
holding in New York this afternoon to produce a resolution or 
declaration.
