  [Excerpts] [Announcer] We return to the center of attention 
in the world today: the NATO summit. [passage omitted] 
  The Atlantic alliance's summit has already accepted the 
Partnership for Peace proposed by the U.S. -- a half-way formula 
to satisfy desires for security, although the East European 
countries consider it still not enough. The Balkans war is the 
other pressing question at this NATO summit and, in this regard, 
a toughening of the sanctions against the Serbs has already been 
agreed on, with the repeated threat of air strikes if the 
attacks do not cease. Meanwhile, Spain has succeeded in getting 
security in the Mediterranean on the agenda of the summit. 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is in Brussels. Our 
correspondent Nacho Hernandez also reports from there. Good 
afternoon. 
  [Hernandez] Good afternoon. In his speech Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez emphasized the points contained in this 
declaration: The importance of strengthening the transatlantic 
link and support for the initiative on Partnership for Peace. 
Spain thinks that this formula for the former members of the 
Warsaw Pact does not mean automatic application of Article V of 
NATO, which establishes immediate response by the Allies in the 
case of an attack. Foreign Minister Javier Solana: 
  [Begin Solana recording] We are all fighting for greater 
stability in Europe and logically in face of potential focuses 
of instability we must act. [end recording] 
  [Hernandez] In the [draft] final communique of this summit 
there is a reaffirmation of the decision adopted by NATO in 
August according to which allied aircraft would bomb military 
positions to end the siege of Sarajevo under the command of the 
UN Security Council. The sanctions will also be strengthened 
and there is talk of determination to put an end to the 
obstacles facing the UN Forces in Bosnia. It is not acceptable, 
the foreign minister said, for the blue helmets to have 
difficulties in carrying out their humanitarian aid missions. 
  Of great interest to Spain is the declaration included on 
stability in the Mediterranean. We reiterate, it says, that 
security in Europe is affected by security in the Mediterranean. 
Dialogue with the countries of the region will be promoted. 
Efforts directed to strengthening security in this region must 
be increased, the final declaration adds.
