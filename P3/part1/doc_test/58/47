  [Excerpt] The government and the management of SEAT said 
today that the Spanish car make will not disappear. According 
to Juan Manuel Eguiagaray Ucelay, the minister of industry and 
energy, the Spanish Government is willing to help SEAT, but 
without disregarding the European Union [EU] rules set down for 
competition and as long as the work force reduction of 4,500 
jobs wanted by Volkswagen is carried out in a nontraumatic way. 
  [Begin Eguigaray recording] The Spanish Government will of 
course have to contribute what it can; I underline, it will be 
done according to the rules. 
  The cut in the work force will cost all Spaniards -- through 
the state's budget -- some 30 billion pesetas, and if we have to 
add subsidies for technological equipment -- and we are quite 
willing to do so -- it will cost us more money. [end recording] 
  The government's subsidies are to be conditional on 
Volkswagen -- the parent company to which SEAT belongs -- 
fulfilling its promises regarding research, development, and the 
survival of the make and its distribution and repairs network.
