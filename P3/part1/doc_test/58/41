WHEN Mr John Major, UK prime minister, arrives in Madrid he will be firmly
told that he is killing the Maastricht spirit.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the premier who led Spain into the European Community in
1986, will also tell Mr Major that he is determined to keep the Maastricht
flame alive at the Edinburgh summit. The Madrid talks are likely to be the
toughest facing the UK premier in his pre-summit tour of Community capitals.
'Major has introduced a whole set of uncertainties over European union,' a
senior aide to Mr Gonzalez said. 'We stand four-square behind what was
agreed at Maastricht. We are very, very firm on this.'
Mr Gonzalez's platform has three planks: that the Community's budget should
be appreciably increased; that the richer partners should increase their
contribution to the budget; that the poorer partners should progressively
receive more in order to catch up. This is essentially the basis of the
so-called Delors II EC budget package agreed at Maastricht and it boils down
to north-south transfers in the form of cohesion funds.
While the Spanish government accepts that recession will introduce some
limits on Community spending it insists that these must be minimal and that
convergence must demonstrably remain as the life-force of the Brussels
budget. It views Mr Major's budgetary proposals as a blatant attack on the
economic cornerstone of European Union and all the more sinister since they
are made by a partner that has delayed its ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Gonzalez is likely to refuse any compromise on Community enlargement
unless there is a more generous approach on cohesion funds.
What most deeply irritates the Gonzalez government is the manner in which
the EC's northern tier, which is the net contributor to the Community
budgets, views the poorer Mediterranean rim, together with Ireland, as
'begging bowl' partners. Mr Gonzalez's long experience of leadership, and
Spain's ranking as by far the richest and biggest economy of the Community's
less developed members, makes Madrid the most articulate spokesman of the
convergence process that would erode economic imbalances that lie at the
heart of the European Union ideal.
'Spain may be net a recipient now but in 5 to 10 years' time it could be a
net contributor,' says Mr Carlos Alonso Zaldivar, the head of the Madrid
government's policy planning unit. 'What the UK and the richer members
forget is that we provide the markets that fuel EC growth.'
Spain has narrowed its gap with the Community's northern tier - between 1985
and 1991 its per capita gross domestic product rose by 6.4 points to 79.2
per cent of the EC average - although EC funds flowing into Spain in the
past six years have averaged only 0.3 per cent of the Spanish GDP. In
contrast Community transfers to Greece and Ireland over the period have
represented 3 per cent and 5 per cent of their respective GDPs.
In the meantime, Spain's trade balance with the EC, which accounts for 70
per cent of Spain's exports and 60 per cent of its imports, has deteriorated
sharply since joining the Community. A 1986 deficit of Pounds 935.9m in
trade with the EC had grown to Pounds 7.9bn by 1990.
Mr Major received a taste of Spanish feelings at last Friday's 'conclave' of
EC ministers in Brussels. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister,
said that Mr Major's package was 'not even rhetorically a compromise
proposal'. According to Mr Solchaga, 'nobody who wanted to demonstrate that
the spirit of Maastricht remains alive would have made such a proposal.'
