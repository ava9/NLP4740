  [Text] Havana, 27 May (NOTIMEX) -- Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, 
Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade, disclosed here 
today that Spain proposed Cuba step up the pace of the economic 
reforms aimed at reorganizing the island's economy. 
  In a brief news conference, Ruiz said he met with Vice 
President Carlos Lage and other members of the Cuban economic 
cabinet, who explained the difficulties in accelerating these 
changes. In any case, Ruiz added, Spain perceives that the 
measures adopted by the Cuban Government, such as the 
legalization of the possession of foreign currency and the 
increases in prices and fees, are not isolated and form part of 
a comprehensive package. 
  Ruiz lamented the drop in Cuba's capacity to export to Spain 
as a result of the current economic crisis and indicated that if 
the supply of Cuban merchandise increases, Madrid would be able 
to increase its purchases. According to sources close to the 
Spanish delegation, bilateral trade amounted to approximately 
$290 million in both directions. 
  On Friday, Cuba and Spain expressed their interest in 
extending their economic cooperation to areas other than tourism 
by signing an agreement for the mutual promotion and protection 
of investments. "This new generation agreement is very 
important because it establishes confidence, legal security, and 
an adequate framework for investors," Ruiz Ligero said after 
signing the agreement at the end of two days of talks. 
  Ruiz also signed with Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister for 
foreign investment and economic cooperation, the final document 
of the fourth meeting of the joint intergovernmental commission, 
which held sessions in Havana. The two officials highlighted 
the "simple, brief, smooth, and easy" way that the negotiations 
took place, indicating that they reaffirmed Havana and Madrid's 
political resolve to strengthen economic and financial ties. 
  "We have given ourselves the challenge of making sure that 
in 
the medium term, these relations will be good and that we will 
be able to lay the foundations for greater cooperation in the 
future," Ruiz stressed. He arrived in Havana on Wednesday. 
"The negotiations were very simple and we can present our 
economic sectors with substantial progress," the high-ranking 
Spanish official said. He also met here with Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina and other officials. 
  "The increasing way that the Spanish entrepreneur is in our 
market and in tourism investments bodes well for our work 
prospects. We are very pleased with the results of the talks," 
Melendez said. Sources of the Cuban delegation told NOTIMEX 
that "one of the basic conclusions is that investments are a 
fundamental element for the development of relations and 
everything possible must be done to increase them."
