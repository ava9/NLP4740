  [Text] The German-Spanish summit ends today with a private 
visit by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to the island of 
Ruegen. Before that, at a news conference, Chancellor Kohl and 
his Spanish counterpart summarized the results of the 11th round 
of government talks in Schwerin. The Spanish head of government 
flies home this afternoon. 
  [Correspondent J. Schlaewe] The first German-Spanish summit 
in one of the eastern German states was evidently blessed with 
very good fortune. Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez certainly 
noted complete agreement on virtually all European issues 
following their talks in Schwerin. This is particularly notable 
because Germany's [EU] presidency will be followed by the French 
and then the Spanish presidency. This provides new 
opportunities for shaping European policy. [Video cuts show

  [Kohl] These are important goals. I need only mention 
improving Europe's position as an investment location. Many 
proposals from the white paper can be cited here: work on a 
joint foreign and security policy to preserve stability and 
peace. Another important issue here is relations with the states 
undergoing reform in Central, East, and southeastern Europe. 
  [Schlaewe] However, the accession of the countries 
undergoing 
reform is not on the agenda either tomorrow or in the immediate 
future. 
  According to Felipe Gonzalez, another important topic of 
discussion was bilateral relations. Spain wants, among other 
things, to take part in the Eurocorps, which so far has been 
reserved for Germany and France. Both heads of government hold 
the same view about the automobile industry's problem child, 
Seat, VW's subsidiary in Spain. This cooperation could be 
supported but it is ultimately up to the company to resolve the 
crisis.
