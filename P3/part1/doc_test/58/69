  [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- At the end of two days of 
talks that also included the topics of trade and economic 
cooperation, Cuba and Spain signed today an Agreement for the 
Protection of Reciprocal Investments. 
  Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of Economic Cooperation and 
Foreign Investment [title as received], and Apolonio Ruiz 
Ligero, Spanish secretary of state for Commerce and Tourism, 
signed the document and the records of the 4th Meeting of the 
Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission in the presence of Vice President 
Carlos Lage and Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas. 
  Following speeches in which Melendez and Ruiz voiced great 
satisfaction about the results of the negotiations, the Spanish 
secretary of state told the press that Spain maintains a line of 
credit granted to Cuba in the amount of $40 million. 
  Apolonio Ruiz said he trusts that trade with Cuba will 
increase as a result of the agreements that have been signed and 
the Cuban Government's measures that promote an increase in 
internal demands through tourism and the people having an access 
to convertible currency. He added that trade between the two 
countries will also increase in the long run through an increase 
in Cuban domestic production. 
  Bilateral exchange declined in 1993 to $290 million, but the 
high-ranking Spanish official hopes it will increase this year. 
The 5th Meeting of the Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission will be 
held in Madrid in 1995.
