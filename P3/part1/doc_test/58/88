<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solbes: `EU Is Mistaken in Its </F>
Economic Analysis for Spain'"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Spanish Economy Minister Pedro Solbes 
Monday [16 May] described as pessimistic the economic forecasts 
for 1994 and 1995 made by the European Commission. The European 
commissioner for finance -- Denmark's Henning Christophersen -- 
presented these forecasts to the economic and finance ministers 
of the European Union [EU] yesterday. The Community's executive 
forecasts economic growth in the EU of 1.6 percent for 1994 and 
2.5 percent for 1995. 
  Solbes told the press that "Spain fundamentally disagrees 
with the European Commission with respect to economic growth, 
reduction of the public deficit, and inflation," and that this 
opinion is shared by the rest of the Twelve. 
  Christophersen estimated that Spain will have GDP growth of 
1.1 percent in 1994 and 2.3 percent in 1995, a public deficit of 
7.2 percent (1994) and 6.6 percent (1995), and an inflation rate 
of 4.8 percent this year and 4.6 percent next year. 
<H5>  1.3 Percent Still Stands </H5>
  However, the Spanish Government stands by its growth 
forecast 
of 1.3 percent for this year and between 2.3 percent and 2.6 
percent for 1995. 
  The Community's forecasts for Spain contrast with the 
optimism of the country's leading financial circles, most of 
which have revised upward their forecasts for that indicator. 
  Solbes stated that for the present the Spanish Government 
knows only the estimates issued by the Bank of Spain, and is 
awaiting the results of the national audit for the first quarter. 
  The atmosphere of economic confidence has developed in Spain 
since the provisional results for the first quarter -- which 
show that the economy grew by 0.5 percent of GDP over the first 
period of the previous year -- became known. 
  The improvement is attributed to the strong growth in 
exports, but also to a slight improvement in domestic demand. 
The Spanish minister insisted that the Commission is also 
mistaken about inflation, in setting a percentage of 4.8 percent 
for Spain, with "so emphatic an assertion that prices are not 
falling in Spain." 
  The Spanish economic authorities forecast an inflation rate 
of 4.2 percent for this year. 
  The Spanish minister maintained that "this assertion is just 
a half-truth," because underlying inflation (which does not 
include food) is falling, and wages are performing better this 
year than in the previous year. 
  Solbes specified that food prices performed very poorly in 
1993, owing mainly to the devaluation of the peseta. 
  With respect to the public deficit, the commissioner 
believes 
that Spain will end 1994 with a deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP, 
while the government forecasts 6.4 percent. 
  "This figure is quite realistic, because Social Security has 
performed better than expected. To talk about 7.2 percent makes 
no sense," Solbes said, rejecting the Commission's argument that 
the autonomous communities' enormous deficit will have a 
negative impact on the overall average. 
<H5>  Agreement on Employment </H5>
  The only point of agreement between Christophersen and 
Solbes 
concerns the unemployment figures, since they both agree that 
they will be around 22.3 percent over the next two years. 
  The Spanish minister did not rule out Spain's being able to 
create jobs with an economic growth rate of around 1.5 percent 
of GDP. 
  He pointed out that "it is possible in theory, although 
hitherto Spain has been unable to do so because of the 
rigidities of the labor market, now modified by the labor 
reform." 
  In order to revive the Community's economy, he emphasized 
that it is necessary to continue to lower long-term interest 
rates, and he even mentioned the possibility of Europe's 
departing from the U.S. model with regard to increasing interest 
rates, "because otherwise economic growth and recovery will be 
curbed."
