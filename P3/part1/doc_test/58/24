<F P=106> [Luis Ayllon report: "Government Makes New Credit for </F>
Moscow Conditional on Gradual Repayment of Current Debt"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The Spanish Government is prepared to 
grant the Russian Government new credit lines provided that 
Moscow begins to repay the debt of over 60 billion pesetas that 
it owes Spain, according to government sources. The government 
envisages converting into new credits 425 million hitherto 
unpaid dollars, as they are paid, and adding another $200 
million on certain terms. 
  Although the government was initially reluctant to grant 
Russia new credit facilities during President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has finally 
acceded to the wishes of the Russian authorities, who do not 
wish to return to their country empty-handed and without 
something to show Spain's political support for the current 
leaders. 
  Late on Friday [15 April], ABC has learned, the Spanish 
negotiators reached an agreement with the Russian delegation to 
mobilize over the next four years, through 1997, around $925 
million (around 130 billion pesetas), aimed at boosting economic 
relations between the two countries and Russia's development. 
  The accord will take shape today, when an agreement on 
economic and trading cooperation between the two countries is 
signed, but with a clause stating that all this will be done 
"while safeguarding the two sides' economic interests." 
Translated into everyday language, this means that Spain will 
not begin to put a single peseta more into Russian hands unless 
Russia has previously started to repay its debt, which now 
exceeds 60 billion pesetas. 
  In fact, the government has agreed with Yeltsin to convert 
into a new trade credit the unpaid $425 million, which belonged 
to the line of finance granted by Gonzalez to Gorbachev in 1991 
and inherited by the Russian Federation. So if the Russians 
repay $50 million this year, for instance, Spain will grant a 
credit to that amount. 
  But, in addition, as soon as repayments begin to be made, 
the 
government will start to supply another $100 million ($50 
million short-term and $50 million medium- and long-term 
credits), and if the Russians secure financing on international 
markets for Spanish enterprises' projects in Russia, they could 
obtain up to another $100 million from Spain. 
  It is expected that the remainder, up to the total of $925 
million -- that is $300 million -- will be contributed by 
private enterprises. 
  Gonzalez, who visited Yeltsin for an hour and a half at the 
El Pardo Palace yesterday and who will sign the Treaty of 
Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and Russia with him 
today, wished in this way to give a token of confidence in and 
support for the Russian president at a time when he is 
experiencing a difficult internal situation because of the 
economic crisis and the pressure which Communists and 
ultranationalists are exerting on him. [passage omitted]
