  [Text] [Announcer] Here in Spain the government monitored 
developments in the crisis via the cabinet established at the 
Moncloa Palace. When it was known that NATO's decision was not 
to attack at present because the Serbs were meeting the 
conditions of the ultimatum, Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
expressed the government's wish for the terms of this ultimatum 
to be applied and extended to the other cities of Bosnia. Valle 
Alonso: 
  [Alonso] In statements to Radio Nacional early this morning 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana ruled out air strikes in 
Sarajevo. Solana made these statements at the Moncloa [Palace], 
where he, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the 
defense minister, and the minister of the prime minister's 
office had been since 1900. Javier Solana, who was in constant 
telephone contact with his counterparts from the European Union 
and Spanish diplomats and Spanish military commanders in the 
former Yugoslavia, said that the NATO operation remains open and 
the Spanish contingent is well. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The whole operation remains open 
and 
remains ready to be put into effect if necessary. What I can 
tell you is, I stress again, that the situation on the ground is 
developing favorably, positively. The deadlines of the 
conditions of the ultimatum are being met. And I will emphasize 
once again that our forces and the Spaniards on the ground are 
well. [end recording] 
  [Alonso] Solana indicated that the Western European Union 
[as 
heard] is in favor of the initiative started in Sarajevo being 
extended to other besieged enclaves such as Mostar. According 
to the foreign minister, this stance is supported in full by the 
Spanish government. 
  [Begin Solana recording] It is the wish of the Spanish 
government, in collaboration with the European Union, to try to 
use this initiative which has been started to liberate Sarajevo 
to give a new impetus to the peace negotiations, which should 
spread to the whole territory of Yugoslavia. I can tell you 
that some initiatives are already underway. Yesterday and today 
we, many of the European ministers, were in touch with our 
Russian, Canadian and U.S. counterparts to try to put forward a 
new peace initiative as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  [Alonso] The foreign minister emphasized that yesterday the 
government kept in touch with the different parliamentary groups 
so that they could have the most detailed possible information 
on the latest developments.
