  [Text] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have said that Spain and Germany agree 
totally on European construction. At the end of the 10th 
Spanish-German summit held yesterday and today in the town of 
Schwerin, both leaders emphasized that it is more important for 
EU [European Union] countries to consolidate monetary stability 
and to further their economic recovery than to stick to the 
deadlines set for the introduction of a single currency. 
  Gonzalez and Kohl agree on Jacques Delors' replacement as 
president of the European Commission, but the name has not been 
made public. 
  Concerning the SEAT car factory, Gonzalez and Kohl hope that 
the crisis will be resolved, while keeping as many jobs as 
possible. Representatives of the Spanish Government and the 
German multinational Volkswagen will meet in Madrid this week 
and next to try to resolve the problem.
