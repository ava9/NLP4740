<F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Government Says That It Will </F>
Be Possible To Create 1,000 Net Jobs Per Day Over Next Two 
Years"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Minister of the Presidency Alfredo Perez 
Rubalcaba stated following the cabinet meeting yesterday that 
2,000 net jobs per day were created in May, according to the 
initial figures supplied by the National Employment Institute 
(INEM). According to him, Social Security has had 105,638 more 
contributors in the first five months of the year than at the 
end of 1993. 
  The government believes that this good performance by the 
labor market will continue in June. This could offset the 
adverse impact on employment that the entry of young people into 
the labor market on completing their education traditionally 
has. Last June, unemployment grew by 35,000, and the estimates 
at the Labor Ministry's disposal forecast that this figure will 
be offset. 
  Rubalcaba stated the the government anticipates that job 
creation will be consolidated as economic growth improves. Over 
the next few weeks, the government will study the new plan for 
convergence with Europe, which forecasts economic growth of 1.3 
percent for 1995 and twice as much for 1996, reaching 3.5 
percent in 1996 [year as published]. 
  This growth of GDP suggests that 1,000 net jobs per day 
could 
be created over the next two years. "That is why this assertion 
by the labor minister is something more than an election 
slogan," Rubalcaba stated. 
  The minister said that the cabinet received with great 
satisfaction the Community's assistance for the development of 
the most backward Spanish regions, totaling 4 trillion pesetas. 
"If the cohesion funds are added to the structural funds, it 
can be said that Spain will receive 6 trillion pesetas from 
Europe between 1994 and 1999." 
  These resources will have a direct impact on job creation, 
"and this has been included in the convergence program, whose 
revision will be presented in Brussels in July." 
  Rubalcaba stated that the structural funds have three aims 
-- 
to improve the production system, train human resources, and 
create water and power infrastructures -- although he said that 
the construction of transport infrastructures, which was the 
previous program's aim, will slacken. Some 77 percent of 
Spanish territory and 66 percent of the population, which falls 
within the so-called first objective, will benefit from this 
assistance. 
  The minister explained that "the aim is to promote public 
investment in the most disadvantaged regions and their gradual 
alignment with the Community average." These investments total 
7.58 trillion pesetas, half of which will be contributed by 
Europe and the remainder by the Spanish Government. 
  Andalusia is the autonomous community that benefits most, 
with 28.8 percent of the funds; Galicia has 13.7 percent; 
Castilla and Leon, 12 percent; Valencia, 11.2 percent; 
Castilla-La Mancha, 8 percent; the Canary Islands, 6.8 percent; 
and the remainder is shared out by Asturias, Cantabria, Murcia, 
and Ceuta and Melilla. 
  Most of these funds -- 34.3 percent -- will be earmarked for 
developing human resources and improving the quality of life 
through vocational training programs and environmental projects. 
Some 33 percent will be earmarked for improving the production 
system, with programs to assist industry, tourism, fisheries, 
and research. Some 24.8 percent will be earmarked for transport 
infrastructures, while 7.9 percent will be invested in water and 
energy. 
  With respect to Seat [automobile enterprise], the minister 
stated that, although this is not scheduled, it is not ruled out 
that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl will discuss this problem during the summit that they are 
to hold next Monday [6 June]. He emphasized that "Seat is not 
in danger," and stressed that "Volkswagen has never proposed 
winding up the make." He stated that "the Spanish Government 
will help to seek a solution and to save as many jobs as 
possible."
