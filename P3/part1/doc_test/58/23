  [Text] Madrid, 13 Jan (AFP) -- The newspaper EL MUNDO 
reported today that Cuban leader Fidel Castro has categorically 
rejected Spain's political-economic reform proposal, arguing 
that it seeks to impose pluralism and democracy on Cuba. 
According to EL MUNDO and as can be deduced from the report 
presented in the summer of 1993 to Castro by Carlos Solchaga, 
former Spanish economy minister, the Spanish Government advised 
Castro to implement a rapid transition to capitalism. According 
to the newspaper, Castro was also especially upset because 
Solchaga does not make the slightest mention of the U.S. 
blockade, blaming the Cuban system alone for the serious crisis 
affecting the island. 
  Carlos Solchaga's secret report recommends that Castro 
implement immediate reform in three areas: privatization of all 
commercial sectors and industries; reduction of state 
intervention to a minimum by introducing a market economy with a 
Western-style fiscal system; and allowing the free economic 
initiative of Cuban and foreign individuals and companies. 
  EL MUNDO goes on to say that Solchaga contradicts one of the 
Castro's main theories, according to which Cuba can overcome the 
crisis through the development of two profitable and 
well-organized economic activities -- tourism and sugar sales. 
EL MUNDO notes, citing Solchaga's report, that "the stagnation 
of the remaining productive sectors would prevent the chosen 
sectors from developing." 
  In its study of the Cuban ecomony, the Solchaga report says 
that the Castro government has been unable to generate wealth 
because of political factors. In his research, Solchaga refers 
to the situation of the Cuban economy as disastrous, emphasizing 
that "galloping inflation" and "huge budget deficits" have 
paralyzed the country. 
  According to EL MUNDO, Fidel Castro is aware that the 
economic changes proposed by the Spanish Government and the IMF 
would lead to a transition to democracy and pluralism. EL MUNDO 
notes that time and again Castro has explained that he will 
never give up the Communist Party's monopoly on power. Instead, 
he insists that "Cuba must learn from China and Vietnam." 
According to Castro, Cuba's future lies in "a democratic 
dictatorship like the ones in China and Vietnam, which have not 
abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine." 
  The document submitted by Spain has broken the usual 
unanimity within the Cuban system. According to EL MUNDO, 
Carlos Lage -- in charge of the Communist Party's financial 
affairs and third in command -- considers that the Spanish 
recommendation for transition is a valid option
