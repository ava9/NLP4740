  [Excerpt] The People's Party's [PP] executive committee is 
this evening analyzing the results it obtained, after having 
tasted victory. The PP has said that it will wait until the 
government reacts and draws conclusions for national policy 
after what has happened in the European elections. The PP does 
not intend at present to submit a censure motion. A news 
conference was scheduled to be held after the PP executive 
committee meeting. Antonio Criado is at PP headquarters in 
Madrid: 
  [Criado] The executive committee has been meeting for two 
hours, discussing the 12 June elections. Javier Arenas, who was 
a candidate in yesterday's elections, has just emerged and 
expressed his satisfaction at the result in Andalusia because he 
said that a political era has finally ended in Andalusia. As we 
said, this news conference has just begun. According to what 
RNE has been able to learn, the PP insists that results in the 
European elections are a clear response from the people and have 
domestic political consequences despite the European nature of 
the elections. The PP awaits the government's decision. They 
call on Felipe Gonzalez to take actions. 
  In statements to RNE, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's deputy 
secretary general, said that it would be silly for the 
government to try to carry on as normal not only by not taking 
on political responsibility but also without even knowing if it 
had sufficient support in the Congress of Deputies. He 
highlighted several scenarios ranging from a no-confidence 
motion to the calling of general elections and Felipe Gonzalez's 
resignation. Regarding the presentation of a censure motion, 
which it is up to the PP to submit, he said that he is not 
convinced by this. 
  [Begin Rajoy recording] I think that we as the party of 
opposition have to give an alternative and facilitate a way out 
of the present situation. I think that it is very difficult to 
facilitate that way out through the presentation of a censure 
motion that could have a political effect but that later in 
practical terms would come to nothing. Therefore, I don't rule 
out the presentation of that censure motion, but personally I do 
not think that it is the most correct formula to use to solve 
Spain's problems at present. [end recording] 
  [Criado] Mariano Rajoy also said that Felipe Gonzalez's 
continuation as prime minister is now no longer positive or good 
for Spain's general interests. Rajoy will give an official news 
conference tomorrow to discuss what was said during the 
executive committee meeting. [passage omitted]
