<F P=106> [Video report from Madrid by correspondent Sergey Dorenko on </F>
news conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 12 
April, including recorded extracts of Yeltsin remarks -- from 
the "Vesti" program] 
  [Text] [Dorenko] Today President Yeltsin and Felipe 
Gonzalez, chairman of the Spanish Government, summed up the 
results of the Russian president's official visit. Gonzalez 
thanked the visitor for interesting talks and reminded him that 
the new treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and 
Spain is a direct successor of the similar treaty of 1812. The 
Russian president said that our ties should be expanded on the 
basis of the treaty. 
  [Yeltsin] On the whole, we used to have abnormal relations. 
Two big states with enormous possibilities have a general trade 
turnover not exceeding 2 percent. This figure is smaller than 
in any other European country. Why is it so? It is Spain, 
after all. 
  [Dorenko] Staying in a NATO member-country, the president, 
naturally, could not fail to discuss the aggravation of our 
relations with the NATO bloc after the Bosnia bombings. 
  [Addressing Yeltsin at news conference] Boris Nikolayevich, 
at the moment you are on NATO's south flank. If NATO continues 
to bomb the Serbs while neglecting Russia's proposals, can 
Russia put pressure not only on the Serbs? Can Russia make 
others heed its views? 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, I think you have worded your question in a 
very correct way. I already voiced my displeasure to Mr. 
Clinton the day before yesterday and have told the Spanish 
leaders here that to sign the Partnership for Peace document 
while there is a kind of discrimination against Russia [changes 
thought], for instance, we are still unable to sign an economic 
agreement with the EEC. We have been eyeing this agreement for 
a whole year but we still cannot sign it. 
  Have we got any any resources for changing the situation? 
I think we have. We were the first to take the correct view as 
regards influence on the Serbs. I am sure, nevertheless -- and 
we have just been discussing it; the chairman, Mr. Gonzalez, 
also agrees -- that the end there must come only through 
political negotiation and not through force. The task there 
cannot be accomplished by means of force. That will be an 
everlasting war. When all's said and done, everyone should 
understand that. If things worsen now, the blame will rest with 
those who took the decision on those three bombing strikes. The 
blame will rest with them. 
  I consider that the statement is very tough and, it must be 
said, serious, including for the President of the United States 
and for NATO. I think that it will change the situation. 
  The main thing now in the situation of Yugoslavia after 
these 
three bombing strikes is to hold the Serbs back from greater 
confrontation and greater military action. And we are now 
making such efforts. Our Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin is now 
constantly with Milosevic. If necessary, Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev will fly there the day after tomorrow to restrain the 
Serbs from greater confrontation. If it proves possible to 
restrain them and to switch once again to the negotiating track, 
to the political level, the level of negotiation, that means 
there will be no more bombing. 
  As regards the linkage with this European, NATO document, 
Partnership for Peace, well, we are not so far making any direct 
linkage. But neither are we in any hurry to sign. 
  [Dorenko] The president said that for him Spain was an 
experiment in civic accord. And here is what Boris Yeltsin had 
to say about the Memorandum on Civic Accord in Russia: 
  [Yeltsin] We intend to sign it on 28 April, and so far we 
are 
not changing this date. Leaders of the State Duma, the 
Federation Council, and the government, as well as most 
political parties and public movements support the memorandum, 
although it is yet to be examined officially. Therefore I 
believe most of them will sign it on 28 April, and after that 
this document will be open for signing by anyone wishing to sign 
it. 
  [Dorenko] And now the president's sensational response to 
questions about the state of his health: Yeltsin invites all 
journalists to attend his medical examination. 
  [Yeltsin] I could wish everyone such health as I have at my 
age. A man who plays a rigorous game of tennis regularly for 
one and a half hours at a time, with professional tennis players 
for partners, a man who swims in the Black Sea in March, with 
the water temperature down just to four degrees -- can such a 
man be of poor health? A man who works 16-18 hours a day, 
practically without weekends -- you can only envy this. The 
communists, of course, are constantly spreading rumors. They 
would like to put me in a bad mood, make up stories -- but all 
this is not serious. Recently, when I read and heard about this 
I said to my doctors: Let us carry out the full one-day medical 
examination this year, in a clinic, witnessed by all the 
journalists wishing to attend. Let as send my blood tests to 
any laboratory, let them investigate how much of what I have in 
my urine, in my [words indistinct due to audience laughter]. So 
that, through all the stages of these clinical tests not just 
Russia but the whole world will know what do I have inside me. 
  And so, I can assure you -- I am not going to Barcelona for 
treatment. This is a planned visit. I will simply meet my 
doctors somewhere in their surgery -- just to thank them once 
again for the splendid operation they performed on me when I had 
some trouble with my spine after a plane crash. It was a 
splendid operation -- hardly anyone in the world could perform 
such an operation as they did. Therefore I will just thank them 
because I am not suffering any after-effects whatsoever. 
  [Dorenko] Tonight the president will meet with 200 Spanish 
entrepreneurs. Tomorrow he will visit Barcelona and return to 
Moscow. All the fresh information you may find in the Russian 
Television Vesti news bulletin.
