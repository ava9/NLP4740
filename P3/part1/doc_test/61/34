It was of little solace to the Cleveland Cavaliers that they became the first 
team in the National Basketball Assn. to clinch a playoff position Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers qualified for postseason action when Indiana knocked off 
Washington, but when the rejuvenated Philadelphia 76ers held off a late surge 
to earn a 100-97 victory at Philadelphia, it sent the Cavaliers reeling into 
second place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed shortly before the game by reports that center Mike Gminski had agreed 
to a contract that would keep him in Philadelphia for four more seasons, the 
76ers snapped out of a mild slump. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley scored 27 points and had 21 rebounds to lead the 76ers, but it 
was two free throws by Gminski with eight seconds left that clinched the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, trailing by 17 points in the second quarter, made a spirited 
rally, and baskets by Brad Daugherty and Mark Price cut the deficit to 98-97 
with nearly two minutes left. The only points the rest of the way were 
Gminski's. Craig Ehlo missed a three-point shot in an effort to tie, and 
Barkley pulled down the rebound at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the 6-foot 11-inch Gminski, who is 
eligible for unrestricted free agency at the end of the season, has agreed to 
terms. The paper said the announcement would be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gminski figured to get numerous offers, including one from the Lakers, if he 
decided to become a free agent. Good centers are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers had lost two games in a row, and Barkley had played without spirit in 
recent games. Moreover, the 76ers' once-comfortable margin over the Boston 
Celtics in the battle for the seventh playoff spot in the East was down to two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Barkley controlled the boards at both ends, enabling the 76ers 
to win despite shooting only 43.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers shot 55.2% but they were badly beaten on the boards and had 32 
fewer shots than the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had not been rebounding well," Barkley said, "ands I decided it was up to 
me to take charge. I finally got my share." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are 48-18 but trail Detroit, which is 47-17, by .007. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 112, Phoenix 111 -- The move of scoring champion Michael Jordan to 
point guard appears to be paying off for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
With Jordan leading the way, the Bulls followed the stunning win over the 
Lakers at the Forum Tuesday night with another victory at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 18 of his 32 points in the second half as the Bulls, who led most 
of the way, barely held on. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Bulls a 39-26 record and sole possession of fourth place in 
the tough Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat ended the Suns' five-game winning streak and dropped them 3 1/2 
games behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 107, New York 103 -- The Knicks' slim hopes of finishing with the best 
overall record became slimmer when they couldn't beat the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Edwards scored 26 points to lead the expansion team to its 11th victory 
in 66 games. The Heat made its last 19 free throws to prevail in a tight 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Miami led, 97-93, when Patrick Ewing scored five points in a matter of seconds 
to put New York ahead. Ewing sank a turnaround jumper, then stole the inbounds 
pass and converted it into a three-point play. He gave the Knicks a 98-97 lead 
with 2:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards hit a jumper, and Scott Hastings extended the lead to three with 
another jumper. The Knicks never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat shot only 41.1% from the field, but the Knicks weren't much better at 
42.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 115, San Antonio 94 -- The Pistons, after a tough game Tuesday night at 
Atlanta, were slow to begin at San Antonio. But Joe Dumars scored six of his 20 
points in a 17-3 second-quarter spurt that broke the game open, and the Pistons 
breezed into first place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
The win put the Pistons 30 games above .500 (47-17) for the first time in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer had 21 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, while Frank Brickowski 
had 20 points for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 101, Washington 92 -- Detlef Schrempf came off the bench at 
Indianapolis to score 22 points, and the Pacers dealt a severe blow to the 
Bullets' playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets, still without Jeff Malone, their injured leading scorer, fell 
three games behind Boston in the fight for the final playoff spot in the East.
