One-sided games are not unusual these days in the NBA, especially since the 
league added four expansion teams in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But to have a veteran team lose by 47 points on their home court is still a 
rarity. 
</P>
<P>
It happened Saturday night at Dallas when 17,007 fans spent most of their time 
booing the Mavericks during their 117-70 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
There were people who thought the Mavericks would be a contender this season. 
But morale sagged when their best player, Roy Tarpley, was suspended because of 
a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing only, 25-22, in the first period, Dallas hit rock bottom. In the 
second half the Mavericks committed almost as many turnovers as they scored 
points: 29 points and 25 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, who shot only 36%, had the lowest half and the lowest total in 
the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman was 11 for 16. Without him the Mavericks would have been 16 
for 59 (27%). 
</P>
<P>
The 47-point deficit was the second-greatest in Dallas history, one point less 
than 116-68 drubbing by Houston in 1981. The 70 points scored by Dallas was its 
lowest at home in franchise history and was the lowest scored by a team in the 
NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, who have been hearing boos at home for lackadaisical play were 
led by Xavier McDaniel with 22 points. They are 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 104, Golden State 91 -- There are few things in sports as exciting as 
watching Michael Jordan take control of a game. 
</P>
<P>
A national television audience and 15,025 fans at the Oakland Coliseum Arena 
saw Jordan take over in the middle of the third quarter Saturday and lead the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan triggered a 16-3 run that brought the Bulls from four points behind to a 
lead they never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
During the rally, Jordan stole the ball, grabbed rebounds, threw perfect passes 
and made acrobatic baskets. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth game in a Western swing for the Bulls that began Nov. 14 and 
will end tonight against the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who has had the flu and a knee injury, had his usual slow start -- 
making only one of his first nine shots -- but by the middle of the second 
quarter he was his usual self. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when 7-1 center Bill Cartwright was sidelined because of tendinitis in 
a knee, the Bulls needed rebounding. Jordan had 14 along with nine assists and 
29 points. After his poor start, he went 11 for 20 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
And, when the Warriors, who have struggled without a center most of the early 
season, pulled to 83-81 with 7:43 left, he scored eight points in a 21-10 
closing rush by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
New York 125, Milwaukee 108 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 11 of his 23 points during 
a 20-2 run by the Knicks in the second quarter at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led, 34-31, when Wilkins led the rally that gave the Knicks a 51-36 
lead. The Bucks lost Jack Sikma in the second quarter. Sikma injured a thigh 
and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing sat out the fourth quarter and failed to reach 20 points for the 
first time this season. He finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 85, Cleveland 75 -- All the injury-riddled Cavaliers had left by the 
middle of the third quarter at Richfield, Ohio, were five substitutes, one of 
whom was playing with a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, already without Larry Nance, Brad Daugherty and Tree Rollins, 
lost Mark Price and backup center Paul Mokeski with injuries in the third 
quarter. The only center left was Chris Dudley, who has a cast on his left 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 108, Boston 100 -- Moses Malone has had some big games, but this one at 
Atlanta has to rank with his best. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, a 34-year-old center in his 17th pro season, had 31 points and 18 
rebounds to lead the Hawks to the win over the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 111, Indiana 103 -- The Pacers were still celebrating a rare 
victory at Boston by the time this game at Indianapolis started. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 62-43, at halftime and when they settled down, it was too late to 
catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 112, New Jersey 98 -- After putting Ralph Sampson on the disabled 
list, the Kings won for the fourth time in 12 games in this game at Sacramento. 
Sampson is scheduled to undergo rehabilitation on his injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 107, Miami 88 -- Bernard King, playing mainly in the first and third 
quarters at Landover, Md., scored 26 points to lead the Bullets to an easy 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 81, Minnesota 73 -- J.R. Reid had 18 points and 18 rebounds at 
Charlotte and the Hornets beat the Timberwolves. DAN HAFNER
