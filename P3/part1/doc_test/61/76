Lyrics for $800, please. Answer: "Stephen Sondheim had him in mind when he 
wrote, 'Isn't it rich?-Aren't we a pair?-Me here at last on the ground-You in 
mid-air."'

Who is Michael Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
Yo, Mike, you can come down now. 
</P>
<P>
Last of the Wright Bros., Air Man, Holy Ghost of Hang Time . . . What else can 
we call him? His arms and legs, they're so pliable, and the way he bends them, 
so they look like they're coming at you from 800 different angles -- he's 
Gumby! 
</P>
<P>
Elgin, Connie, Doc, they were all electrifying in their day, but Jordan has 
turned it up a kilowatt with those tongue-wagging, crowd-gagging, arms-waving, 
legs-splaying, morale-shattering, reputation-flattering, bullet-headed tomahawk 
jams. These are indoor gyms; where's the wind beneath his wings blowing from? 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, Mike, did I ever tell you, you were my hero? You're everything I 
would like to be. Part of it, of course, is that you're going bald. Those of us 
who've blazed that trail always appreciate a superstar athlete with faltering 
follicles. You're our first bald sex symbol since Theo Kojak, if you don't 
count Beldar The Conehead. (Kareem is in another category because of those 
goggles. Every time he trots onto the court I keep expecting Han Solo and 
Chewbacca to follow.) That Nike deal is sweet, Mike, but Rogaine would pay you 
billions. Think of it: "Hair Jordan." Be still my foolish scalp. 
</P>
<P>
How do you like his numbers so far? He averaged 39.8 against Cleveland, and 
he's getting 34 against the Knicks -- plus 11.5 rebounds, a preposterous total 
for a guard. Not that it's new ground Jordan's plowing: In a three-game set 
against Boston in 1986, His Airship averaged 43.7 points, and last season in 
five games against Cleveland, he went for 45.2. Only Jerry West (46.3 in a 
six-game series against Les Boulez in 1965) ever averaged higher. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder CBS has devoted so much time and energy to Jordan. With Bird out, and 
Magic, by virtue of so many finals, having become the perennial closing act of 
the playoffs, CBS was eager for a new hook to hang its coverage on. Jordan is 
clearly ushering in the 1990s; if it's time to rock 'n' roll, he's Jerry Lee. 
So each little thing he does attracts camera overload. We see him before the 
game, pulling up to Chicago Stadium and climbing gingerly out of his Testarosa. 
We'll see Michael wanna-bes make their fashion statement wearing black high 
tops. Everyone in Chicago wears them; the Bulls cheerleaders, probably even 
Mike Ditka. We talk to his mother -- (CBS declared her Miller Lite's player of 
the game on Mother's Day. Society's approaching the point where you're nobody 
until you're the Miller Lite something or other; you might as well be dead. Any 
day now CBS Sports will name Noriega Miller Lite's dictator of the hemisphere 
and a $1,000 scholarship will be donated in his name) -- his father, his 
trainer, his doctor. How does he feel? What did he eat for breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
Could he always jump this high, or was he kidnapped by aliens, and injected 
with anti-gravity particles? We see television guys insinuate themselves into 
his life to make themselves invaluable to the hype; for example, Tim Brant 
breathlessly recounted a perfunctory conversation with Jordan: "Michael said to 
me, 'I gotta tell you, Tim' . . . " (Why is it every time Brant reports a 
coach's instructions to his players, someone's always spittin' or bitin' or 
sniffin' or scratchin' or clawin'? He makes every event sound like alligator 
wrestling.) 
</P>
<P>
The further Chicago advances in the playoffs, the more concentrated the CBS 
coverage. By the semis we'll get hour-long specials about where Jordan does his 
dry cleaning, and his exclusive ratings of the seven Santini Bros. If the Bulls 
reach the final, Jordan will anchor the evening news instead of Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
Most people can't fathom the Bulls coming this far. Without Jordan, they're 
Charlotte. They don't have any players who'd automatically start on every other 
team. In fact, none would start on more than a handful. Other nondescript teams 
have ridden an irrepressibly hot player to the NBA finals: the Warriors won in 
1975 with Rick Barry; the Rockets reached the final in 1981 with Moses Malone. 
But Barry had Jamaal Wilkes; Moses had Calvin Murphy. No guard has ever done so 
much with so little help as Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Switching Jordan to the point was the smartest thing Doug Collins did this 
season. (It's hard to tell how good a coach Collins is, since all he's required 
to say in huddles is, "Get the ball to Michael.") He has the ball in the middle 
of the court, which means he sees the whole floor. And he initiates the action, 
which means everyone else must react to him. He'll draw defenders to him like a 
magnet, then pitch off to a teammate as wide-open as a car wash. Think what the 
Bulls could do with a drop-dead shooter like the Bullets' Jeff Malone. (Malone 
and Terry Catledge or Mark Alarie for Will Perdue and Chicago's lottery pick, 
provided it's lower than No. 1, 2, or 3, hmmm.) 
</P>
<P>
Even with Jordan, though, it would take a miracle for the Bulls to win the NBA 
title. Which reminds me of a story: At the 1988 Final Four, Oklahoma Coach 
Billy Tubbs was answering questions at a news conference. Sitting next to him, 
moderating, was North Carolina's droll sports information director, Rick 
Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy," Tubbs was asked, "do you think God is on your side?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our side?" Tubbs responded, rolling his eyes. "I've never seen God in an 
Oklahoma Sooners uniform, have you? What number does he wear?" 
</P>
<P>
Quicker than a heartbeat, Brewer said, "No. 23."
