Magic Johnson of the Lakers won his second NBA Most Valuable Player award 
today, edging out Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the closest voting in 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who won the award two years ago, received 42 1/2 first-place votes and 
664.5 points from a panel of 85 writers and broadcasters. Jordan, the 
three-time scoring champion and league MVP last season, had 27 1/2 first-place 
votes and 598.8 points. Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz was third with five 
first-place votes and 362 points. 
</P>
<P>
Each voter selected a top five and points were awarded on a 10-7-5-3-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers point guard averaged 22.5 points, led the league in free-throw 
accuracy with a .911 percentage and was second in assists with 12.8 per game. 
He posted career highs in 3-point goals (59) and assists (988) and led Los 
Angeles to a 57-25 record and an eighth straight Pacific Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 10-year veteran, had a league-best 17 triple-doubles and decided 
three games with buzzer-beating shots. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan averaged 32.5 points, 2/10 of a point below his career regular-season 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning, that's what it's all about," Johnson said in a release from the NBA. 
"I may not be the greatest, but I'll tell you what: I've got a whole lot more 
diamonds (in championship rings) than a lot of guys who play this game and 
that's all I'm concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how I want to be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks was fourth with eight first-place votes 
and 200 points. Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets was fifth with two 
first-place votes and 179.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen players were named on at least one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of 65.7 points was the smallest since 1981, when Julius Erving of 
the Philadelphia 76ers beat Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics by 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson finished third in the MVP balloting a year ago behind Jordan and 
Boston's Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic is the best player around; I don't think there's any question about 
that," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He's a winner. He does whatever is needed 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Lakers in 1979, Johnson has helped them win five NBA titles, 
including consecutive championships in 1987 and 1988. The Lakers, bidding for 
three in a row, now are ahead 1-0 in their Western Conference title round 
against the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker guard suffered a partially torn left hamstring Feb. 8 and missed the 
All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that Magic Johnson is the best player in the 
game and the best player I've ever seen," said Bird, Johnson's rival going back 
to their NCAA championship game in 1979. "He plays the game the way I like to 
see people play and the way I like to play. He rebounds, passes, is a leader -- 
whatever it takes, that's what he does to win basketball games." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Pistons Coach Chuck Daly praised Johnson as a "coach's dream." 
</P>
<P>
"He can dominate any game from any position he wants to," Daly said.
