In this year of sports folly, it was difficult to imagine that anyone could
surpass the greed displayed by the owners and players whose squabbles over
money have shut down two of North America's four major league professional
sports, baseball and ice hockey.
Then along came Glenn 'Big Dog' Robinson.
Robinson, 21 years old, and 6ft 7ins, was an outstanding basketball player
at Purdue University in Indiana. He should have been making his professional
debut last night when his team, the Milwaukee Bucks, played its first game
of the 1994-5 season against the Philadelphia 76ers.
But Robinson could not have been expected to make much impact last night.
This is because he had only one day's practice with his new team, having
spent all but the final day of the pre-season engaged in a contract dispute
with the Bucks, who earned the right to choose him by virtue of being one of
the league's worst teams last year.
The dispute was over Milwaukee's refusal to accept Robinson's demand for a
Dollars 100m, 13-year contract. At Dollars 7.7m a year, the untested
Robinson was asking for more than double what the recently-retired Michael
Jordan, arguably the greatest player in the game's history, was worth just
two seasons ago.
Even in North America, where salaries in sport reached stratospheric levels
years ago, Robinson's demand was greeted with astonishment. An established
player who had led his team to a championship or two might be regarded as
avaricious if he asked for that much, but a newcomer who had yet to score a
single point in his professional career?
Robinson's hard-bargaining tactics were particularly distasteful because he
was seeking a king's ransom from one of the poorest clubs in the NBA.
Milwaukee is a small market by US sport's standards, and its team has
enjoyed little success lately, so the club cannot count on earning the vast
sums of money from television rights or merchandising sales commanded by the
big-city teams such as the New York Knicks or Chicago Bulls. Herb Kohl, the
Bucks' owner put it all in perspective when he said last week that he was
considering trading his ownership of the franchise in return for Robinson's
salary.
In the end, however, Milwaukee could not face the prospect of starting the
season without their marquee player, and on Wednesday the club signed
Robinson to a contract that will pay him Dollars 68m over 10 years. At about
Dollars 83,000 a game, that makes Robinson one of the highest paid players
in professional team sports.
The Robinson saga illustrates a flaw in the NBA's draft system. As in other
North American sports, the process by which the best college players are fed
into the professional game is designed to promote parity within the league
by giving the worst teams each year the first pick of the college stars.
In recent years there has been a dramatic inflation in first-year, or
'rookie', pay levels. In each of the past few seasons, the top selection of
the draft has invariably demanded - and received - more money than the
previous year's top selection. Consequently, the worst teams get the best
young players, but they are also saddled with the best young players'
increasingly immense salaries. And the worst teams (Milwaukee, the Dallas
Mavericks, or the Sacramento Kings) are often the poorest, by virtue of
their lack of success.
To improve, the bad clubs need to hire a star rookie, but to keep him they
have to cut the pay of their other players, or let some of their veterans
go, which only impedes the team's improvement.
It is not just the size of the salaries demanded that poses a problem, but
also the length of the contracts. Robinson has achieved guaranteed financial
security over the next 10 years - the length of an entire career in the NBA.
Yet, not only can the Bucks not know if Robinson will ever become the
superstar player the club badly needs, they also cannot possibly know how
long he will last in a league which places an increasingly demanding
physical burden on its top performers. Signing a young player like Robinson
to a 10-year contract is like buying a long-term mortgage on a house in the
middle of war zone.
Of course, the club did not have to pay the vast sums demanded by Robinson,
but the Bucks could not afford to have its star rookie sit out the season,
as happened in Dallas three years ago when the talented Jimmy Jackson
declined the salary offered by the Mavericks. Jackson missed an entire
season, and although he signed for the club a year later and was joined by
Jamal Mashburn, another top college player, neither Jackson nor the team has
since recovered from the disruption. In the last two years, the Mavericks
have finished 27th in the 27-team NBA.
Robinson's decision to sign was good news for the NBA. The league cannot
afford to do without players of his pulse-quickening skills and athleticism.
Last season was one of the dullest in recent memory, and the championship
was won by one defence-oriented team (the Houston Rockets) over another
defence-oriented team (the New York Knicks). In an attempt to restore the
game's lustre, the NBA has introduced new rules against dirty play and
intimidatory tactics that are designed to rid basketball of its more brutish
habits.
Although it is theoretically a non-contact sport, basketball has always
tolerated its share of bumps and bruises, crashes and collisions. In recent
years, however, some teams have been pushing the rules as far as they will
go, with players using their hands, elbows, shoulders, and hips to break up
attacks and disturb the flow of the game. This style of play has turned up
the temperature on court, leading all too often to the violent eruptions
that have earned the sport the nickname 'basketbrawl'.
Yet, as Fifa, world soccer's governing body, has discovered this year with
the introduction of its new rules against dirty play, the NBA is learning
that cracking down on rough and defensive tactics can mean cleaner, but not
necessarily better, games.
The chaos and confusion among players and referees over how to handle the
new rules made for some disjointed contests during pre-season exhibition
basketball last month. The always image-conscious NBA can only hope that
players will quickly adapt to the new rules, and that the new season will
not see too many repeats of the tedious free-throw shooting contests that
the fans have had to endure in pre-season games over the past few weeks.
