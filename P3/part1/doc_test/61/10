Michael Jordan warmed up for his showdown with Magic Johnson by rallying the 
Bulls to a 115-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Saturday night at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, who have lost 10 in a row, led 96-92 with six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan led the Bulls on an 8-0 run. Then, after the Hornets went ahead 
103-102, Jordan scored three points during a 10-0 run that ended the Hornets' 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 33 points, had nine rebounds, seven assists, two blocks and two 
steals to lead the Bulls to their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls and Lakers will play Tuesday night at Chicago in the first of their 
two regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that Jordan will be ready for this one. When Johnson was voted 
the NBA's most valuable player last season, Jordan wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain," Jordan said, "that I had an MVP season." 
</P>
<P>
While leading the Bulls to their four victories in a row, Jordan has averaged 
35.3 points, increasing his scoring lead over the New York Knicks' Patrick 
Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
During the four games, Jordan has averaged nearly 59% accuracy from the field 
and eight rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan likes to play down the individual battle between himself and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"We are progressing as a team," Jordan said. "We are developing a killer 
instinct. It won't be an individual battle between Magic and myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' Craig Hodges made five of six three-point shots to keep the Hornets 
from taking a solid lead. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 99, Milwaukee 96 -- The Heat sneaked up on the Bucks while they were 
still celebrating Friday night's surprise road victory over the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
With Rony Seikaly scoring 22 points, including a three-point play with 1:24 
remaining at Milwaukee, the Heat, winners of only five of their first 22, won 
their second in a row. They beat the Minnesota Timberwolves Friday night at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks are the first non-expansion team the Heat has beaten in more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Douglas made four consecutive free throws in the last 35 seconds to 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 104, Detroit 92 -- The Warriors are back. 
</P>
<P>
They followed up Friday night's victory at Portland by beating the NBA champion 
Pistons at Oakland. The Warriors have won four in a row after winning only four 
of their first 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, playing without Isiah Thomas, lost their third in a row. Thomas 
returned to Detroit after suffering a concussion during Friday's loss at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons also lost Bill Laimbeer three minutes into the second half when he 
threw the ball at referee Hue Hollins. He missed, but still was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
New York 118, Seattle 97 -- Every two or three days Patrick Ewing converts 
another team to the idea he is the dominant center in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
As Ewing led the Knicks, the only NBA team still unbeaten at home, to their 
ninth consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden, it was the SuperSonics' 
turn to be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, although he missed most of the second quarter because of foul trouble, 
had 30 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
While Ewing was on the bench, the Knicks' second unit outscored Seattle 19-6, 
and it was another romp for the Atlantic Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Ewing) has improved considerably over last season," Coach Bernie 
Bickerstaff of the SuperSonics said. "We couldn't do anything with him." 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 125, Orlando 116 -- The Magic gave the Spurs trouble for only a 
half at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, the favorite to be voted rookie of the year, had 21 points and 
16 rebounds, and Terry Cummings added 29 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We played just good enough to win," Cummings said. "But in this league you 
take what you can get. We fumbled a lot early and they rebounded well. My own 
game is just coming around." 
</P>
<P>
Washington 112, Dallas 108 -- Bernard King had his best night of the season, 
and the Bullets needed it. 
</P>
<P>
King scored 31 points and his two jump shots and two free throws in the last 96 
seconds thwarted the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, with Adrian Dantley leading the way, built a 65-57 halftime 
lead, but Dantley went sour in the fourth quarter. Rolando Blackman scored the 
Mavericks' last 13 points. DAN HAFNER
