Michael Jordan, who seemingly has crashed every barrier except Mach 1, broke 
the rules Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons, who played Jordan into a rare display of frustration 
Tuesday in Michigan, were on the receiving end when the pendulum swung back. In 
one motion, the alleged stability of a 14-point third-quarter lead and the most 
trustworthy of all Bad Boy defensive schemes, those so-called Jordan Rules, 
were sent crashing by the person they were designed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 47 points -- 31 in the second half -- as the Chicago Bulls 
rallied to beat the Pistons in Game 3 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals, 
107-102, at Chicago Stadium. The result seemed to say that Jordan still rules 
and said little about the worth of the Jordan Rules. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, it wasn't exactly a brilliant move that cut the Pistons' lead 
in the best-of-seven series to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit had held Jordan to 20 points on five-of-16 shooting in Game 2. It was 
another example of Detroit keeping the game's premier offensive player in 
relative check better than any other team. Chicago's answer was to have Jordan 
starting the offense at the top of the three-point circle with the ball in his 
hands, rather than waiting for point guard John Paxson to get it to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He can always score 47 points if he has the ball all the time," Coach Chuck 
Daly said after the Pistons surrendered more than 100 points for only the 
fourth time in 28 playoff games dating back to last season. "They completely 
abandoned their offense." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls -- who had 21 offensive rebounds, nine more than the Pistons -- 
laughed at such a notion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'd call it 'abandoned,' " Coach Phil Jackson said. "That's a 
good choice of words by Chuck, but we used the offense the same way, only off 
the dribble and putting Michael on top instead of on the wing. That stretched 
their defense a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Broke it, actually, rare a sight as that was. Having gone through all other 
possibilities, Detroit let Dennis Rodman try Jordan late, largely one on one. 
</P>
<P>
"They went with their best player, the defensive player of the year, and I 
think I am one of the league's best offensive players, frankly," said Jordan, 
speaking with the media again after saying that his Game 2 outburst had been 
blown out of proportion. "I took it as a challenge. I felt I had the advantage 
offensively. I'm sure they felt they had the advantage defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 13 points in the third quarter and 18 in the fourth. He was 
especially unstoppable when it mattered most, connecting on back-to-back jump 
shots from the right side 23 seconds apart with about seven minutes left in the 
game. That put the Bulls, who host Game 4 Monday afternoon, in the lead for 
good, 86-82. 
</P>
<P>
They had trailed, 67-53, with 5:48 remaining in the third quarter, Isiah Thomas 
having opened the half by scoring nine of his team-high 36 points. With the 
lead, Chicago had to hold on to beat Detroit for the second time in eight tries 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen's tip-in of a miss by Jordan gave the Bulls a 101-94 cushion 
with 1:03 to play. Forty-eight seconds later, after a three-point basket by 
Thomas, it was 105-102. 
</P>
<P>
A bad entry pass by Pippen at halfcourt after a timeout by the Bulls resulted 
in a jump ball and, subsequently, another Piston possession. Detroit called 
timeout with 8.3 seconds left. Even with Bill Laimbeer, an outside threat, 
having fouled out, there were still plenty of three-point possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Mark Aguirre, who had made nine of 13 shots and scored 22 points, sent 
the ball in to Vinnie Johnson, who passed it back to Aguirre on the right side. 
Aguirre launched a three-point shot that went long and hit the far side of the 
rim, bounding off to the Bulls. Jordan was fouled, and his two free throws gave 
Chicago its final margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago didn't beat us, we beat ourselves," Rodman said. "They played well, 
but not that well." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons had 18 turnovers that accounted for 30 points by Chicago, but 
Rodman's accuracy ends there. For once in this short series, Bulls other than 
Jordan played well. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen had 29 points -- 16 in the second half -- and 11 rebounds. Horace Grant 
had 10 points and 11 rebounds, helping Chicago to a 53-42 advantage in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it came back to Jordan. This was his game, no matter the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael was definitely more aggressive offensively than in those first two 
games," said Detroit's Joe Dumars, usually the first line of defense against 
Jordan, who averaged 40.2 points and shot 54% in the first two rounds of the 
playoffs but opened at 27.0 and 40% in the first two games against the Pistons. 
"When he's aggressive and playing like that, you just hope he misses a few 
shots and play him as best you can. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, with Michael hitting his jumper, it makes it really tough to stop him. 
In fact, it's almost impossible."
