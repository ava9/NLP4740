CHARLES BARKLEY IS ONE MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR 76ERS

Some people hold one clear image of Charles Barkley: that of the wild man, 
standing on a chair after the Philadelphia 76ers' April 19 brawl in Detroit, 
yelling to his teammates: "Hey, fellas! What do we think of the Pistons?" And 
the wild team basically telling Detroit what it could do with its championship 
trophy, with the wild man leading the profane cheers. 
</P>
<P>
That's one aspect to Charles Barkley. Here's another. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see (basketball) as a game," he said. "I see it differently. When I go 
to a hockey game, my wife goes to see the scoring and stuff like that. I just 
am looking at how fast those guys handle the puck, their hand-eye coordination. 
When I go see boxing, I don't see guys go get beat up. I just like to watch the 
combinations and things like that. You just see things differently." 
</P>
<P>
You may think Charles Barkley loud, rowdy, crude. You see the $35,000 in major 
fines he's racked up this season in five separate incidents involving: a) 
cursing; b) slapping; c) gambling; d) shoving; e) a free-for-all melee. And you 
may dismiss him as a thug. 
</P>
<P>
He fights Bill Laimbeer and laughs at opponents and gets technical foul after 
technical foul. He butts heads with teammate Rick Mahorn, his "Bump-n-Thump" 
partner, Cro-Magnon style. Don't ignore it, because it's the bit of madness 
that makes him unique. But it's not all. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing about Charles Wade Barkley on a basketball floor that's any 
different from Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or Michael Jordan, or any of the 
others in the league whose talents are such that they can carry a team to a 
championship. They live in that rarefied air where winning is obsessive and 
losing cuts to the bone. And they have power to control that fate somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"You just see things that other people don't see," Barkley said. "One problem 
(Coach) Jimmy (Lynam) has talked to me about is sometimes I think I'm playing 
along with myself. I'll try things and think, 'Well, he should have had that 
pass.' Jimmy says, 'Well, you would have had that pass, but he can't get that.' 
And that's the thing he's taught me. He says, 'Remember, everybody out there is 
not as good as you. So don't throw a guy a pass that you would catch, because 
your hands are so much better than everybody else's.' " 
</P>
<P>
Is that bragging? At face value, yes. But ask Michael Jordan if anyone can stop 
him one-on-one, and you'd get much the same answer. And, "It ain't bragging," 
former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson once said, "if 
you can back it up." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't been Barkley's best year statistically, but most anyone would 
settle for per-game averages of 25.3 points (sixth-best in the league), a .605 
field-goal percentage (second) and 11.6 rebounds (third), especially when it's 
the base for a 53-29 record and an Atlantic Division title. 
</P>
<P>
In the 76ers' two victories opening the best-of-five first-round series against 
Cleveland, Barkley has improved his game a couple of notches, averaging 35 
points and 14.5 rebounds going into Tuesday night's first road test. There are 
sellout crowds at the Spectrum again, watching his coast-to-coast drives. 
Basketball is fun in Philadelphia again. And Charles Barkley is a bona fide 
most valuable player candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Hall-of-Famer before he even gets in the Hall of Fame," Mahorn said. 
"He's just so intense and that makes everything happen because everybody feeds 
off his intensity. I appreciated him when I was playing against him because you 
give that person that kind of respect." 
</P>
<P>
So if Barkley has to carry the 76ers through the playoffs at the key times, 
that's no problem. For while no one is a bigger fan of Barkley than Barkley, 
neither does anyone expect more. 
</P>
<P>
"When your team needs it, you've got to say, 'Well, damn, you want to do all 
this stuff,' " he said. "So you've got to do it. It's easy to say it, but I've 
got so much confidence that I can do it. ... I didn't like the way (Akeem 
Olajuwon) played (against the Lakers in Game 2 of that series), 'cause I think 
he didn't. ... You see Michael Jordan? That's what you've got to do." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 4 3/4-inch Barkley is being guarded by Cleveland's 6-11 forward, 
John Williams, on the left side of the basket. Barkley drives. Williams goes 
with him. Barkley dribbles behind his back to free himself. Williams gives 
chase. They both go up, and Barkley hangs just long enough to score from the 
baseline. It is an amazing sequence. 
</P>
<P>
It surprised Barkley too. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I do things it just happens. It sounds like a cliche. I think 
God is in my body," he said. "I mean like the move I made ... when I saw the 
replay, I said, 'How did I do that?' When I took it behind my back and went up 
and brought it down and went on back up, it was like, 'Man, somebody else was 
controlling that shot.' I just believe ... I think it's a belief that you're 
going to make something good happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "I've never seen a guy like that. He's like a one and only. 
People talk about Michael Jordan but I don't think there's going to be another 
Charles Barkley who can do the stuff that he can do." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley says he's played better in the past, only that he didn't have 
supporting players, so no one noticed. This season has brought Mahorn from 
Detroit (via Minnesota), guard Johnny Dawkins from San Antonio and an improved 
Hersey Hawkins. Where the 76ers once had a reputation for talking loudly and 
playing soft, they now foul hard and play mean. 
</P>
<P>
Profane to each other, they protect each other. Barkley says Lynam, whom he 
calls "Little Knucklehead," should be chosen coach of the year, while 
dismissing the possibility that he himself should be MVP. 
</P>
<P>
They are a closer bunch, complete with symbolic gestures to promote unity. They 
took to wearing earrings when they got on a winning streak early in the season; 
now they are donning black shoes, Bulls-style, for the playoffs. Mahorn is 
trying to, in his words, "cram three years of playoff experiences into a week" 
of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
And Barkley is even more effective at the end of games. 
</P>
<P>
"My college coach (Auburn's Sonny Smith) told me once, he said, 'I have never 
seen a player who gets stronger as the game goes on and as the season goes on.' 
I just try to beat my guy up for two quarters, three quarters, and try to have 
something. Just willpower down the stretch. And a lot of it is just emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of players have emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of players have willpower. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true. It's something special that God has given me. A lot of guys 
can't ... they get tired and they just can't make things happen. ... I feel 
like I can raise my game late in the game. Maybe it's what you just said. Maybe 
the other guys are getting tired. But I believe that I can make plays, and it's 
just strictly desire." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dawkins: "When we get down at that end of the court, his eyes just light 
up. When his eyes light up you know he's ready to go. And his eyes light up 
every time we're at the offensive end." 
</P>
<P>
"You do, I think, find yourself at times standing there saying, 'Well, what is 
he going to do this time?' " Hawkins said. "But that's Charles Barkley." 
</P>
<P>
Bump and Thump are showering. Things are crashing in there. Loud words. Threats 
are being made. The two emerge. There seems to be one towel, but two persons. 
Bump, Barkley, has it. Thump, Mahorn, would like it. Barkley punches Mahorn in 
the chest. Mahorn picks up a basketball. Barkley picks up a scooper filled with 
ice. They stand toe-to-toe. 
</P>
<P>
Lynam is helpless. He pleads for order. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball is tossed. It hits the scooper. Laughter all around. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if Barkley and Mahorn have been together their entire careers, but 
it's only been a few months. The effect has been dramatic. Mahorn takes care of 
the really dirty work underneath, holding off the opposition's bigger 
rebounders and scorers. Finally freed after playing down low alone for so long, 
Barkley can freelance more defensively. Offensively, small forwards try to 
guard him. Very few can. 
</P>
<P>
"To play with him," Mahorn said, "you can't sit back and be in awe of him, but 
you can also sit back and appreciate that he's playing with you instead of 
against you." 
</P>
<P>
The last couple of years have mellowed Barkley everywhere except on the 
basketball court. His marriage 15 months ago and the birth of his daughter 
Christiana late last year have radically switched his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to the NBA I felt like all my goal was, was to do the best 
that I could," he said. "Have a nice career, and if we win a championship, that 
would be great. And then I think I started listening to other people when they 
said, 'Well, if you don't win the championship, you're not a success.' And 
that's not right. Because everybody's not going to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is my second legitimate shot. I feel like we do have the talent 
to win it all, and I'd be very disappointed. But like I said, I'm back in the 
thing where it's just fun now. I can live with whatever happens, if we do our 
best. We have beaten everybody in the league. So if we go out and do our best 
we have a shot at it all."
