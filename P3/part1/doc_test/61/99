This Laker habit of waiting until the last possible moment before commencing a 
spirited comeback, necessitated by a severe and prolonged fourth-quarter lull, 
was stretched to almost ridiculous proportions Tuesday night in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Procrastinators anonymous might be the answer, because the Lakers these days 
only seem to play well when the clock dwindles and their first-half lead has 
evaporated. This time, they trailed the Chicago Bulls by nine points with 2:42 
left before rallying for the fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Lakers about a minute and a half to catch the Bulls but, under 
uncommon circumstances, they could not overtake them and lost for the second 
straight time at home, 104-103, before a crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this season the Lakers have lost consecutive home 
games, but they did not have Magic Johnson when it happened in February. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Bulls swept the season series from the Lakers (45-20) for the 
first time since 1981, and the Lakers' hopes of catching the Cleveland 
Cavaliers or Detroit Pistons for the league's best record are growing dimmer. 
They trail Cleveland by three games, Detroit by two. 
</P>
<P>
These last two losses, particularly the manner in which they were absorbed, is 
a cause for alarm among the Lakers, who earlier had won two close games at home 
but lost in a similar manner to the Atlanta Hawks Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' comeback may have failed when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar missed a skyhook 
with three seconds to play and Byron Scott missed a long jump shot at the 
buzzer, but they really lost it after a lethargic four-minute stretch earlier 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We're just not getting the 
job done. We're dying in the fourth quarter. I am totally mystified. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pattern developing that I don't like. And I'm sure the players 
don't like it, either. Mentally, in the fourth quarter, we just aren't showing 
confidence. I never question their character, but we've got to have that 
passion we have at the end when we are still up by six points." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Lakers had a 91-86 lead with 8:08 to play after Michael Cooper 
made a jump shot. What followed, however, was a severe Laker drought in which 
they failed to score for nearly four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who received 21 points, a career-tying 16 assists and eight rebounds 
from Michael Jordan, took a 98-91 lead with a 12-0 run. The Lakers, during that 
stretch, missed all nine field goal shots. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson finally made two free throws with 4:25 to play, the Lakers 
trailed, 98-93. Soon thereafter, however, the Bulls would take a 102-93 lead 
after Jordan scored on a drive and center Bill Cartwright made a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
After a Laker timeout with 2:42 to play, the comeback began in earnest, 
culminating in a 9-0 run that pulled the teams even with a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green got it going by scoring a three-point play after rebounding Cooper's 
miss and drawing a foul while making the follow shot. After Jordan missed a 
shot, Byron Scott took a length-of-the-court pass from Johnson and scored on a 
fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was fouled by Jordan on the play. The referees ruled it a breakaway foul, 
meaning the Lakers would retain the ball after Scott's free throw, which he 
made. Now down by three points, Scott drew another foul, but made only one free 
throw to cut Chicago's lead to 102-100. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' half-court trap forced a missed shot by guard Craig Hodges, who 
had 21 points. On the Laker end, James Worthy and Johnson both had inside shots 
blocked, but the Lakers kept possession. Eventually, Worthy passed to Scott 
cutting through the lane for a layup to tie it, 102-102. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with 1:03 to play, it was the Bulls' turn to call time out and regroup. 
Naturally, they set up the play for Jordan, who was fouled by Worthy on a 
drive. Jordan made both free throws, regaining the lead for Chicago with 48 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers got the ball to Johnson, and he drew a foul on a jump shot with 37 
seconds left. But Johnson, who had not missed a free throw in the game, missed 
the second shot, making it 104-103 Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
On the Bulls' next possession, Hodges missed a jump shot and Cooper got the 
rebound with 17 seconds left, setting up a chance for the Lakers to win it with 
a final shot. 
</P>
<P>
Riley later said that Worthy was the first option, but the ball wound up in 
Abdul-Jabbar's hands with three seconds left. He was about 17 feet away from 
the basket, on the baseline, but had no choice but to shoot. His skyhook fell 
short, and Cartwright was fouled while getting the rebound with one second 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Even after all that, the Lakers still had a shot -- a final shot -- to win it. 
That's because Cartwright missed both free throws, giving the Lakers the ball 
at midcourt. Cooper inbounded to Scott in the corner, just beyond the 
three-point line. But Scott's jump shot failed, and so did the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it," Johnson said. "We just don't shoot well in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been happening the last couple games. We've been playing great first 
halves, but we just can't find the hoop in the fourth quarter. We're even 
missing the close shots. Everybody, including myself, has to look and see what 
the reason is." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, whose defense forced Jordan to make just seven of 20 shots, seemed even 
more concerned by the Lakers' fourth-quarter fade, followed by a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting in the third quarter, it's like we're not aggressive anymore," Cooper 
said. "I'm baffled myself. We aren't putting it in gear. There were times in 
the fourth quarter tonight when we could have put it away, but we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely concerned, because we are losing games we should not be 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, however, deserved this one. No longer a one-dimensional team, the 
Bulls received 21 points each from Scottie Pippen and Hodges, as well as 
Jordan. Jordan's defense also forced Johnson into making seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Lakers) made it tough for me to get off a shot," Jordan said. "But that 
enabled me to distribute the ball, and our guys hit the big shots when 
necessary. Not many teams get to sweep the Lakers in a season, so this was 
big." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley, who already has a pretty fair point guard, said the 
Bulls definitely benefit with Michael Jordan as a point guard. "He can do 
anything," Riley said of Jordan. "That's why he's so great, because of his 
versatility. When defenses start denying him the ball, then they just put it in 
his hands earlier. He watches somebody and models them. In other words, he 
knows how to even look like a point guard, even though he's never played the 
position. He can execute point guard and run an offense. . . . I would have him 
at point guard all the time, because he can create and pass and run an 
offense." . . . Michael Cooper recovered from a one-day bout of stomach flu and 
returned to the team Tuesday night. . . . The Lakers are off today and play at 
Sacramento on Thursday night.
