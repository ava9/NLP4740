AS A KNICK, VANDEWEGHE FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

For Kiki Vandeweghe, the chance to play for the New York Knicks, after spending 
his first nine pro basketball seasons in Denver and Portland, was an 
opportunity to carry on a rich family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe, was a popular guard for the Knicks in the 
early '50s, known for his relentless hustle and unselfish play. 
</P>
<P>
Kiki is a more gifted scorer than his father and should have a chance to win 
over the New York fans now that All-Star playmaker Mark Jackson will be lost 
indefinitely with a knee injury that may require arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good inside game with Patrick Ewing," said General Manager Al 
Bianchi, "and you try to surround that with as many good outside shooters as 
you can get. It's especially important in the playoffs when the game gets 
reduced to a half-court game. People talk about defense, but the bottom lime is 
putting the ball into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kiki, I had no concern about how he would fit in with us. I've known him 
for years. Johnny Newman and Kenny Walker wouldn't be human if they didn't 
wonder how bringing in another small forward would affect their role. But 
they're the type who can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
In his second appearance for the Knicks, March 2, Vandeweghe scored 23 points 
in 24 minutes against the Miami Heat. He is being used in a supporting role to 
Newman, but he is cutting into the minutes of Walker, an inconsistent shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Without Jackson, however, the Knicks will be hard-pressed to maintain one of 
the four best records in the Eastern Conference and gain a home-court advantage 
in the playoffs. They are being pressured from behind by Milwaukee and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing Mark is like cutting off your head," Coach Rick Pitino said. "It will 
be a very difficult experience, but we have a lot of confidence in (rookie) Rod 
Strickland. If he can hold up stamina-wise, he'll be all right and so will we." 
</P>
<P>
When the 1988-89 college season began, the top-ranked seniors by National 
Basketball Association scouts were Stacey King of Oklahoma, Pervis Ellison of 
Louisville, Sean Elliott of Arizona, Danny Ferry of Duke and Glen Rice of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
But scouts have re-evaluated the blue-chippers, with Ellison falling out of 
favor and Ferry now being viewed as no worse than a second choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Trouble with Ellison is that he seldom breaks a sweat," said one NBA scout, 
preferring anonymity. "Right now, I'd rate King and Ferry 1 and 1A. Both could 
play center for certain pro teams, but Ferry's great passing ability makes him 
more valuable as a forward." 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting scenario, of course, would have the Washington Bullets 
involved in the 1989 NBA lottery, winning the first pick and forcing General 
Manager Bob Ferry to decide whether to choose his well-rounded son or King, a 
more prolific scorer and superior shot blocker. 
</P>
<P>
It just might make sense for Ferry to serve as Danny's agent. Who knows better 
how to negotiate multi-million dollar contracts? 
</P>
<P>
With a shortage of proven big men among the 1989 graduating class, it is 
expected that juniors J.R. Reid of North Carolina, Dwayne Schintzius of Florida 
and Derrick Coleman of Syracuse will declare themselves eligible for the draft. 
Otherwise, look for NBA teams to take a first-round gamble on the likes of 
UConn's Cliff Robinson, 6-10, and Joe Calavita of Vermont, who ordinarily might 
be second-round selections. 
</P>
<P>
First-round sleepers: Arizona forward Anthony Cook, Houston forward Richard 
Hollis, Wisconsin guard Trent Jackson and Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker. 
</P>
<P>
One Grant too many: On draft day last June, Chicago forward Horace Grant was 
hoping the Bulls would draft his twin brother, Harvey, of Oklahoma. Picking 
right before the Bullets, the Bulls selected center Will Perdue of Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought with (Bulls forward) Scottie Pippen hurt, the Bulls might pick me," 
Harvey said. "But I really didn't want to play in Chicago because I didn't want 
to get caught up with people saying, 'Harvey had this kind of year. Now it's 
your turn.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dutch treat: While the Indiana Pacers rank as one of the season's major busts, 
the rapid improvement of rookie center Rik Smits, the native of the Netherlands 
who played at Marist College, bodes well for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I've done is to get the other guys to accept Rik," Coach 
Dick Versace said. "I told them, 'You're witnessing the changing of the guard 
at center. This kid is a worker. And, until further notice, I expect you to get 
him the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Detroit playmaker Isiah Thomas is being credited with being the man behind the 
scenes in the acquisition of his Chicago pal Mark Aguirre from Dallas in 
exchange for Adrian Dantley. Said Dallas TV analyst Bob Weiss: "If the Pistons 
win the title, should Isiah be voted NBA Executive of the Year?"
