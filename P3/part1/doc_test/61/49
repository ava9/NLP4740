FT  26 JUN 93 / Rebounds? No sweat: US sneaker makers face tough competition

It has been a wonderful week for Michael Jordan, America's best-known and
highest-paid sportsman, who led the Chicago Bulls to their third consecutive
National Basketball Association championship on Sunday night.
The 4-2 victory over the Phoenix Suns in the seven-game series was due in no
small measure to the 30-year-old's extraordinary athleticism. And the
hat-trick helped Jordan brush off media controversy earlier this month over
his enthusiasm for gambling.
It should also have been a great week for Nike, America's leading athletic
footwear manufacturer. Not only does it have Jordan under contract to
promote its products (paying him a reputed Dollars 10m to Dollars 20m a
year) but also Charles Barkley, a Phoenix Suns star known for his aggression
on the court.
Each player has his own Nike line - called Air Jordan and Air Force Max.
Basketball shoes are the largest single category of sporting footwear in the
US, accounting for some 29 per cent of the Dollars 6bn wholesale (nearly
Dollars 12bn retail) market, according to the Athletic Footwear Association.
'For Nike,' says one industry observer, 'the NBA play-off was a series made
in heaven.'
Yet Nike's week has been anything but a slam-dunk. Its shares fell sharply
after it warned that 1993-94 earnings were likely to be well below Wall
Street's expectations, and the market's gloom was compounded by a similar
statement the previous week from Reebok International, Nike's arch rival.
Both companies blamed general retail sluggishness in the US and recession in
Europe, while Reebok said its problems were compounded by weaknesses in its
line-up of basketball shoes this quarter.
But observers suggest other factors may also be at work, including pressure
on margins from intensifying competition in the mature US athletic shoe
market, and shifts in footwear taste among fashion-conscious young
Americans. The 1980s were the great boom era of the sports segment, as a new
generation of American companies, led by Oregon-based Nike and Reebok of
Massachusetts, rapidly overtook European rivals like Germany's Adidas by
offering shoes tailor-made for the fitness fads of the era, such as aerobics
and jogging.
The new shoes were not only comfortable on the feet but also looked stylish,
and the number of Americans buying them as fashion leisure wear quickly
outstripped sales to those trying to work up an athletic sweat. Today, only
one-third or fewer of US sneaker buyers use them for sport.
The boom plateaued at the start of this decade, owing partly to recession
but also to market saturation. The average American owns three pairs of
sneakers but, like mortals everywhere, has only one pair of feet to show
them off on.
So while sneakers now make up almost 40 per cent of the US footwear market,
the numbers sold last year dropped 1.8 per cent from 1991 and nearly 5 per
cent from the 1990 record of 393m pairs.
This maturity has encouraged the American manufacturers to focus much more
attention on foreign markets, which they reckon could be worth about double
the US one. Their brightest prospect is Europe, which seems gradually to be
adopting more casual shoe styles.
However, recession has temporarily put a damper on the European market, and
the effect on US companies' profits has been compounded by the recent
strengthening of the dollar against European currencies. At the same time,
the flat US market is producing much tougher competition at home, forcing
companies to trim prices to maintain market share.
This pressure on margins could intensify over the next few years, owing to
the growth of big new sporting goods superstores with the retailing muscle
to command keen wholesale prices. For example, Kmart, the discount stores
group, is building up a chain called Sports Authority, each branch of which
will sell up to 40,000 different items under one roof.
These forces seem likely to mean consolidation of the footwear industry,
since they favour the largest, best-capitalised manufacturers such as Nike
and Reebok.
So too do the concomitant pressures on the manufacturers constantly to come
up with better-engineered shoes in new designs and then pour tens of
millions of dollars into marketing them - particularly to the fickle young
Americans who make up a large proportion of their customers. For them, shoes
are as much a statement of personal identity as a means of locomotion.
Some analysts suggest that one factor in the sneaker manufacturers' sluggish
sales this summer may be a sudden, youthful enthusiasm (though still minor
in terms of the industry's revenues) for British-made Dr Martens shoes -
dour, military-style boots worn by the likes of singer Madonna and actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Dr Martens complement the 'grunge' look, and are the antithesis of the
sports shoe, such as Nike's extremely light Air range. It was these
sneakers, and the endorsement of Jordan, which allowed the company to
recapture US market leadership in 1989 from Reebok, which had the title for
the previous three years.
Reebok has hit back with its 'pump' range, which allow air to be pumped into
a shoe for a better fit. But despite gains at the expense of smaller rivals,
Reebok still accounts for only 24 per cent of the market, compared with
Nike's steady 30 per cent.
Reebok is vowing to overtake Nike by 1995 and it has a new weapon - its Shaq
Attack range of basketball shoes, named after a 7 foot 1 inch young star
called Shaq O'Neal.
O'Neal is one of the most promising talents in the NBA, but he plays for
Florida's Orlando Magic, a team that is not based in one of the premier
basketball cities, and he has yet to win any important pennants.
And, as Michael Jordan can attest, when people are buying dreams as much as
a pair of shoes, nothing succeeds like a three-time champion.
