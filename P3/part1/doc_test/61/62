The NBA's director of scouting, Marty Blake, says Hank Gathers would have been 
a first-round selection in the draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly how high he would have gone, I don't know," Blake says. "This is a 
year when you can't even pick a player of the year in college basketball. There 
are no Ewings, Robinsons, Mannings or Ferrys. The NCAA tournament and the 
postseason all-star games are going to decide a lot. But several teams that 
figure to pick in the 16th to 27th slots were interested in Hank." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blake disagrees with the notion that his "tweener" height of 6 feet 7 would 
have worked against Gathers, the Loyola Marymount center who died Sunday after 
collapsing during a West Coast Conference tournament game against Portland. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have been a good NBA player because of his great desire and 
intensity," Blake said. "He was a 6-7 guy who played like he was 6-9 or 6-10. 
How big was Wes Unseld? Six-seven. Give me a player, not a size or a position." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a prolific rebounder blessed with great hands, most likely would have 
played small forward in the pros. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blake also forecasts Bo Kimble, the Loyola Marymount guard, as a first-round 
selection. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, I circled March 7 on my calendar: The Kings vs. the Canadiens. Little 
did I suspect that the Kings would be in fourth place in their division, 
Montreal in third place in its, and both possessors of three-game losing 
streaks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Flying Frenchmen? Montreal has the worst power-play percentage in 
the NHL, a feeble 13.8%. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And how about a team motored by Wayne Gretzky allowing as many goals -- 282 -- 
as it has scored?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Allen underwent surgery for a hernia nine days ago but was back on the 
job at Cal State Long Beach the next day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Allen on his first recruiting class: "I thought we had a pretty good draft." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Allen on spring practice, which begins April 16: "We'll do a lot of evaluating 
and concentrate on basic fundamentals and conditioning. I have to get to know 
my players because we don't have any preseason games before we play at Clemson 
in September." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park expects Sunday Silence to run in the Californian on June 3 and 
the Gold Cup on June 24, before the $1-million invitational race against a 
field including Easy Goer on Aug. 4 at Arlington International. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock High is sponsoring the third annual Eagle Rock Relays from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Saturday at Occidental College, long one of the finest track and 
field facilities in Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All conference basketball tournaments should be eliminated, and the NCAA 
tournament thrown open to every Division I school. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's foolish even to try picking a Final Four. But it was last year, too. None 
of the four -- Michigan, Seton Hall, Illinois or Duke -- won its conference 
race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Oklahoma doesn't have a player on the All-Big Eight first team 
selected by Associated Press and only one, Skeeter Henry, on the second team. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper still leads the Clippers in three-point field goals with 13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had two of the best three-point shooters in the league in Craig 
Hodges and Ricky Pierce but sent them and Terry Cummings to the Milwaukee Bucks 
for Marques Johnson, Junior Bridgeman, Harvey Catchings and cash on Sept. 29, 
1984. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the nicest comeback stories in the NBA is New Jersey Net center Sam 
Bowie, who ranks ninth in the league in rebounding. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan is attempting more field goals than last season despite the 
Chicago Bulls' desire for more balanced shot distribution. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chip Engelland, formerly of Palisades High and Duke, led the World Basketball 
League (6 feet 5 and under) All-Stars in scoring during a recent tour of Italy 
against rivals of all shapes and sizes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, a recruit can be given one souvenir program at a game he is 
attending, but not two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Mario Lemieux is out of the lineup, I'm no longer studying the 
Pittsburgh Penguins' scoring summaries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most underrated boxing movie of all-time is John Huston's "Fat City." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not even counting his $10-million bonus, NBA Commissioner David Stern's annual 
salary of $3.5 million is nearly double those of baseball Commissioner Fay 
Vincent, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and NHL President John Ziegler 
combined. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This year, March Madness is that being dispensed by the baseball owners and 
players.
