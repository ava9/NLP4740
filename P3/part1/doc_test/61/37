When New York reporters covering the Knicks wrote early this season that 
seven-foot Patrick Ewing had developed into the best center in the NBA, it was 
greeted with some skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But Ewing has changed that. A disappointment early in his five-year pro career, 
the Knick center has become a dominant figure in the middle, both on offense 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had 33 points Monday at New York, but his defensive work was more 
important as the Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 109-106, on a controversial 
play in the final one-tenth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much time was remaining when Mark Jackson inbounded the ball to 
Trent Tucker, who turned and made a 26-foot, three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," Bull Coach Phil Jackson said. "There isn't time enough to 
get off a shot. That was a one- or two-second shot. A tenth of a second it was 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Referee Paul Mihalik said, "It was a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
The strange finish did not diminish the performance of Ewing. His exceptional 
play kept the Bulls from winning handily. 
</P>
<P>
He blocked eight shots and grabbed 12 rebounds. His presence prevented Michael 
Jordan from taking the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, only nine of 24 from the field, had 26 points. His jump shot gave the 
Bulls a 106-104 lead with 1:21 left. But Ewing grabbed a rebound and scored to 
tie the score with 65 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 92, San Antonio 89 -- Mark Price does not consider himself another 
Magic Johnson, but he always wanted to get a triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
He picked a good time for his first. Facing the tough Spurs at Richfield, Ohio, 
Price had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Cavaliers prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs lost their second consecutive road game, despite 28 points, 10 
rebounds and four blocked shots by David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 101, Dallas 90 -- Alex English scored 20 of his season-high 29 points to 
help the Nuggets build a comfortable lead, but Coach Doug Moe was not happy 
with his team's play at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we've hit rock bottom offensively, because we were terrible today," Moe 
said. "We weren't active, we stood around too much and we were totally out of 
sync." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 144, Golden State 105 -- The Warriors are as bad on the road as they 
are good at home. After winning six in a row at home, they were never in this 
game at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers scored 44 points in the first quarter and led, 86-48, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 111, Washington 105 -- Glen Rice scored 11 of his 27 points in the fourth 
quarter at Landover, Md., to lead a comeback by the Heat and end its 13-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets were led by Bernard King with 30 points, but he was sitting on the 
bench when the Heat wiped out a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 118, Charlotte 108 -- Tom Chambers scored 40 points, but the Suns had 
to go overtime to hand the Hornets their 15th loss on the road without a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets battled from a 69-52 deficit to force the overtime on a three-point 
basket by Rex Chapman with 23 seconds left. In overtime, Charlotte was 
outscored, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 105, Houston 101 -- The SuperSonics, who have been complaining about 
not getting a fair shake from referees, lost Coach Bernie Bickerstaff by 
ejection early, but outlasted the Rockets at Seattle. DAN HAFNER
