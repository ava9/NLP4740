The Milwaukee Bucks have been trying to convince the rest of the NBA that their 
fast start is not a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
The league should begin to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Humphries had 21 points and Frank Brickowski had 19 Tuesday night to lead 
the Bucks to a 99-87 victory over the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-10 run in the third quarter broke open a close game and gave the Bucks, 
the only team still unbeaten at home, their club record 11th victory in a row 
at home. It also put them into first place in the Central Division, ahead of 
the slumping Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have been beating the Bucks regularly in the last three seasons. 
Including three out of four in the playoffs last spring, the Bulls had won 18 
of the last 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls led most of the first half and led, 58-53, in the third quarter. But 
Alvin Robertson, who feels he is the unappreciated and unwanted Buck, scored 
six points in a 13-2 spurt that put the Bucks ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan had 31 points to lead the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we have done so well at home," Coach Del Harris said. "I 
don't think we have any home-court advantage. The players just work their tails 
off. We have a much quieter home crowd than most teams. They seem to be getting 
a little more into it with each victory. Maybe they are believing in us, too." 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 95, Detroit 86 -- The Pistons blamed fatigue for losing four of 
five on a tough trip West. Apparently, being home since Sunday failed to 
refresh them. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't score a basket in the first four minutes at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
fell behind and stayed there most of the game. It was the Pistons' first loss 
at home after eight victories and knocked them out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 27 points and 16 rebounds for the Spurs, who also had a big 
game off the bench from David Greenwood. Greenwood was summoned when Terry 
Cummings suffered an injured left knee and left the game shortly before 
halftime. Greenwood made six of his seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs shot only 44.6%, but the two-time NBA champions made only 40.3% 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' sharpshooting guards -- Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Vinnie 
Johnson -- were a combined 10 for 29. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 122, Indiana 96 -- The rumor is that the Pacers need a good trip West 
to save Coach Dick Versace's job. So far, so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Duckworth scored 15 points in the first half at Portland and the Trail 
Blazers scored their eighth consecutive victory. The Blazers improved the 
league's best record to 19-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers have three more games on the trip -- -- at Seattle, at Utah and 
against the Lakers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 113, Sacramento 90 -- Xavier McDaniel, obtained from Seattle last week, 
scored 20 points on 10-for-15 shooting at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson scored 11 of his 26 in the third quarter when the Suns broke it 
open. 
</P>
<P>
New York 109, Miami 90 -- A good way to end a slump is to score 20 consecutive 
points. The Knicks did that in the second quarter at New York, built a big lead 
and coasted to their first victory under new Coach John MacLeod after three 
defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were leading, 33-24, when Patrick Ewing led the Knicks' charge. They 
had a 53-24 lead before the Heat made a free throw on an illegal-defense call. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime the lead was 55-29 and the Heat was never able to make a game of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 119, Orlando 114 -- Hersey Hawkins scored from long range and Rick 
Mahorn did the job in close at Orlando to enable the 76ers to stretch their 
winning streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins scored 27 points, making five of six three-point shots, and Mahorn 
scored nine of his 18 in the last quarter to thwart a Magic rally. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn's three-point play on a driving layup gave the 76ers a 110-104 lead with 
1:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley had 28 points and nine rebounds for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 128, Washington 125 -- In a game involving two of the four players 
averaging more than 29 points, the Bullets' Bernard King outscored Orlando 
Woolridge, 34-33, at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, coming from behind in the last 2 1/2 minutes, won back-to-back 
games for the first time this season and improved to 5-15. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Rasmussen, the 7-foot center, made a 19-foot shot and an 18-foot shot in 
the last 95 seconds to play a key roll in the victory. He had 24 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 135, Golden State 117 -- The Malones combined for 78 points at Salt Lake 
City and the Jazz won for the 10th time in the past 11 games. Jeff had 43 
points and Karl had 35. DAN HAFNER
