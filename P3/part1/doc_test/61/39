PAT RILEY DOESN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE FASHIONABLE STAND WITH THE LAKERS

You can disregard all those obvious reasons, such as a rough road schedule and 
lack of an inside game, for the Lakers' worst slump in a decade. No, the 
problem could well be the dreaded GQ cover jinx. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion magazine for men made Laker Coach Pat Riley the cover story in its 
January issue, which, coincidentally or not, hit the newsstands at the same 
time the Lakers' road losing streak hit 6 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Riley profile was written by former Los Angeles Herald Examiner columnist 
Diane K. Shah. 
</P>
<P>
So, for those who cannot afford $3 for Gentleman's Quarterly, let alone the 
clothes advertised on its pages, a few of the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Riley always wears oxford cloth shirts at Laker games because they absorb 
perspiration. This custom came about after Riley wore a silk suit in the Boston 
Garden and sent the suit back to the tailor because of perspiration stains. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Riley still is somewhat bothered that, despite coaching the Lakers to 4 
National Basketball Assn. titles in 7 seasons, he has not been voted coach of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson is quoted as saying: "There's an ego factor with Pat that didn't 
used to be there. Wanting to be recognized as a good coach. He's not 
overbearing about it, he just needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Late last summer, during Riley's contract renegotiation troubles with owner 
Jerry Buss, he threatened to resign. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Laker hierarchy prepared a list of replacements. Billy 
Cunningham and Dick Motta topped the list. But the Lakers eventually decided 
that, if Riley left, they would turn over the team to assistant Randy Pfund for 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario was first detailed by the Copley newspapers last summer, but 
never confirmed by anyone in Laker management. Riley, of course, worked out his 
contract troubles and last week signed a 4-season extension. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many of Riley's idiosyncrasies were detailed. 
</P>
<P>
During a 10-game winning streak one season, in which everything was going well 
for the Lakers, Riley approached trainer Gary Vitti and complained that the 
chalk was too hard. He wanted softer chalk to write with. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers reported to Hawaii for training camp last fall, Riley wanted 
the rims of the basket painted bright orange and the bolts on the backboard 
replaced. Vitti had the rims painted, but the original bolts remained. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The letters Riley sends to his players every August, detailing goals for 
the season, are dunked into the nearest waste basket, according to team 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he has read the article, which was mostly positive, and has no 
problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was accurate," Riley said. "I'm a pretty obsessive, driven guy. A 
perfectionist. I admit to that." 
</P>
<P>
But well-dressed. 
</P>
<P>
Was that GQ for 4-H? When the magazine sent Josh Rosenfeld, the Lakers' public 
relations director, copies of the January issue, the box was addressed to the 
"Great Western Farm." 
</P>
<P>
When the Chicago Bulls met the New York Knicks for the first time in Chicago 
since the seemingly one-sided Bill Cartwright-for-Charles Oakley trade, Bull 
Coach Doug Collins said he expected Oakley to gloat over his success in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
But Collins did not expect to hear the same criticisms from Horace Grant, the 
Bulls' current small forward. Grant told Chicago writers last week that he 
shares Oakley's frustrations of playing a minor offensive role along side 
Michael Jordan, who scores about a third of the Bulls' points. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sympathize with what 'Oak' went through," Grant said. "I'd like to get 
the ball more, but I'm not getting it. It's frustrating. I know Michael is a 
great player, but he can't do it all. We need others to contribute. But I'm not 
getting the chance. Is that too much to ask?" 
</P>
<P>
Collins' reaction: 
</P>
<P>
"Charles (Oakley) averaged 10 shots for us last year. He's getting 9.8 for the 
Knicks this year. They're going well, and I'm happy for Charles. I like him, I 
really do. I'm a former player who understands the ups and downs of this 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to ever be a very good team, we're going to have to be more balanced. 
But people don't understand that with a guy like Michael Jordan it's hard to 
run an offense. He's so good, it distorts the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the new collective bargaining agreement, some veteran NBA players are 
looking forward to unrestricted free agency. One is the Sacramento Kings' Jim 
Petersen, who apparently can't wait to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends are calling and saying, 'Play here,' or 'Play there,' " 
Petersen said. "It's going to be a difficult decision to make. I know it's a 
business. My heart will speak loud, but the dollar value will in all likelihood 
win out." 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, however, Petersen also knows the Kings might trade him before 
losing him without compensation after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Russell (King general manager) has said he's determined to keep me, but 
there are no loyalties anymore," Petersen said. "You can't be so idealistic to 
think you can't be traded. I'm keeping my bags packed, if not literally, then 
figuratively. It will be sort of like a romance to see what you're worth on the 
open market." 
</P>
<P>
Al Bianchi, the Knicks' general manager, has $712,000 to work with under 
salary-cap restrictions. Bianchi has until August to use the money, which was 
made available when Pat Cummings left, and he has several options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Knicks need a quality backup center for Patrick Ewing. Eddie Lee 
Wilkens, the current backup, is not sufficient for a first-place team. When 
Ewing went down with a minor knee injury last week -- he missed only 2 days -- 
the Knicks were a mediocre team without him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Knicks have long sought to acquire Portland forward Kiki Vandeweghe, 
whose bad back has delayed any chance of a trade. Vandeweghe, however, is 
supposed to be activated by the Trail Blazers tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sources told Newsday that the Knicks still want to bring Golden State 
forward Chris Mullin back home to New York. Mullin will be a restricted free 
agent after this season and, if Mullin signs a 1-year contract then, he will be 
an unrestricted free agent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Portland forward Clyde Drexler was married last Friday in New Orleans. He met 
his bride, Gaynell Floyd, on a blind date last season. She obviously wasn't 
impressed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first date I asked him, 'How long have you been in the NFL?' " Floyd 
said. "At the time, I didn't know a thing about basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA continues to hand out stiff fines for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Including the exhibition season, there already have been 6 skirmishes. There 
were 3 alone last week, totaling $12,000 in fines. Those fights were 
Milwaukee's Jay Humphries vs. Indiana's Scott Skiles; the Knicks' Oakley vs. 
Atlanta's Doc Rivers; and Houston's Akeem Olajuwon's one-sided, one-hand slap 
of Miami's John Shasky. 
</P>
<P>
A troubled season for the New Jersey Nets was eased somewhat last week by a 
visit from the Indiana Pacers, who had lost 13 straight road games. As 
expected, the Nets breezed to a 17-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This means I don't have to . . . worry about my dog biting me," Net Coach 
Willis Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade rumor of the week: Dallas newspapers reported that the Mavericks were 
talking with the Boston Celtics about acquiring Kevin McHale. One account had 
Boston trading McHale for Sam Perkins, Detlef Schrempf and a first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic General Manager Jan Volk said he has not even contemplated trading 
McHale. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, however, apparently is on the market. His contract expires at the 
season's end, but he would have to take a hefty salary cut to fit into the 
Celtics' salary-cap restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there's some truth to all the trade talk," Perkins told Peter May of 
the Hartford Courant. "There just has been so much of it since I came to 
Dallas. I just have a gut feeling that if something doesn't happen by February, 
then it will by the summer. I just feel it's a move the franchise wants to 
make. I'm happy here, I'm settled. But I guess I may need to get unsettled." 
</P>
<P>
Things keep getting worse for the Pacers, who have the NBA's worst 
non-expansion record. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, who have lost 8 straight games, learned last week that center Steve 
Stipanovich will not return for at least another 2 months. Stipanovich has not 
played this season, having undergone left knee surgery on Nov. 18. The 
operation was to relieve pain in his left leg above the knee cap. 
</P>
<P>
"There still is pretty much pain," Stipanovich said. "It basically means it's 
going to be a few more weeks, at least, before I'll be able to do anything as 
far as rehabilitation. If everything goes well, I'll be able to play in 7 or 8 
weeks."
