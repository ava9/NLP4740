John MacLeod is too nice a man to say what he probably really feels about his 
firing last week as coach of the Dallas Mavericks. His wife, however, said what 
she thought of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Carol MacLeod raged against "spoiled" Maverick players and Dallas management, 
which she said misled MacLeod over the summer about his status. "These players 
make more money than God, but they never seem to be happy," said Carol MacLeod, 
who pointed out Dallas' 47-point loss to Seattle last week as the prime example 
of players quitting on her husband. "They've got a lot of things bothering 
them. But there are homeless people out there who can't find jobs or something 
to eat. . . . So, I don't feel sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
Maverick management incurred her wrath for, she said, not living up to 
assurances of MacLeod's job security this summer when he was mulling an offer 
to coach the New York Knicks. MacLeod ultimately turned down the job to remain 
with the potentially talented but combustible Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Donald Carter reportedly had told MacLeod his job was safe for the entire 
season, if not longer. When that handshake agreement was made public, Maverick 
executive Rick Sund expressed his displeasure to Carter, who apparently changed 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have told him, so he could've gone to New York," Carol MacLeod 
said. "They should've done that. But I think (the Mavericks) were getting bad 
press then and they didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Sund, the Mavericks' executive who had the final say on the firing, denied 
misleading MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to John at the time, 'I recommended you for the Knicks' job, but I can 
never say that you won't be let go here," Sund said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, MacLeod obviously wishes now he had taken the Knicks' job. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd say right now it was the incorrect decision," MacLeod said. "You can use 
hindsight right now. My decision to stay (in Dallas) was based on family and 
area. We liked it here. I felt last year, the job was unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
Right. This season, the Mavericks finished a steady disintegration that began 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference finals in 1988 
before losing, the Mavericks were distracted most of last season by Mark 
Aguirre's moping. They eventually traded him to the Detroit Pistons for Adrian 
Dantley, who moped the rest of last season and reportedly is not happy in 
Dallas this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the ongoing Roy Tarpley saga. Tarpley missed much of last season 
while serving his second stint in drug rehabilitation for cocaine use. This 
season, Tarpley was leading the league in rebounding when he was arrested for 
drunken driving. He currently is on the suspended list and out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe MacLeod, who coached the Phoenix Suns for 14 seasons before being fired 
after the 1986-87 season, is fortunate he did not have to endure the Mavericks' 
upheaval for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when it's difficult for a coach to reach the players," 
Maverick center James Donaldson said. "He said all he had to say. He could rant 
and rave, but it just wasn't registering." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls was credited with an assist recently, 
but it had nothing to do with basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan explains: 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle, last road trip, I was just walking up the street and a man came up 
and asked me for some dough so he could eat. I guess he knew I was Michael 
Jordan. Maybe he didn't. Doesn't matter. I gave him $100. I didn't have a $5 
bill or a $10 bill, and he had nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it made him feel when I gave him the money. But I know how it 
made me feel. How can anyone experience the warm feeling you get inside when 
you give something to somebody and not want to do it again?" 
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers' fast start can be attributed to several 
improvements, including the addition of power forward Buck Williams and the 
pleasantly surprising play of 6-foot-11 Cliff Robinson, the club's second-round 
draft pick from Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest change for Portland, 12-4 going into tonight's game against 
Orlando, apparently has been Clyde Drexler's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Talk was that Drexler, the prolific shooting guard, did not play hard for 
former Coach Mike Schuler, who was fired last spring. Drexler did not practice 
much during Schuler's tenure because of a variety of minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Adelman was promoted from interim to permanent head coach partly because 
of his ability to relate to Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
"Clyde has been just super with me," Adelman said. "From Day 1, he has worked 
very hard in practice. He has done everything we've asked him to. He's gone out 
of his way to help the young guys. I can't deal with previous situations. I can 
only deal with my own, and I think he's been fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler is playing like a happy man. During a recent seven-game winning streak, 
snapped Saturday in Denver, Drexler averaged nearly 24 points and shot 55% from 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the Phoenix Suns' 6-7 start can be attributed to point guard Kevin 
Johnson's injuries. But even with Johnson back, the Suns are not playing like 
the team that advanced to the Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is at power forward. The Suns let Tyrone Corbin go in the 
expansion draft, and they may regret it. Neither of the replacements Coach 
Cotton Fitzsimmons has used has been effective. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam started in the first eight games, but he lost the spot because of 
continued sluggish play. Rookie Kenny Battle started one game and responded 
with two points and one rebound. Tim Perry has started the last five games, but 
has been productive only against the expansion Orlando Magic, scoring 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being below .500, Phoenix still received this endorsement from Detroit 
Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "I still think they are a team that can win the 
conference (title). Cotton has done a good job turning them from strictly an 
offensive team into an all-around team. You don't always have to play your best 
basketball (in December)." 
</P>
<P>
Salary cap update: The prosperity of the NBA has led to a 35% increase in the 
money teams can use for player payrolls. Some teams have had problems not in 
exceeding the cap limitations, but in staying above the $7.9 million minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Nuggets, for example, were below the minimum before reworking 
Lafayette Lever's contract. That is not unusual, since teams in smaller markets 
do not have the same high revenues from attendance as teams in New York, Los 
Angeles or Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to believe (the cap) helped you with fiscal responsibility," Denver 
executive Pete Babcock said. "I still think it does, but on the survival side, 
it makes things more difficult. The disparity is in a (bigger) market, where 
you bring in $400,000 a night, compared with a (smaller) market, $200,000. But 
you have to have the same payroll." 
</P>
<P>
The raves keep coming in for David Robinson, the San Antonio Spur center who is 
the leading contender for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, has said that Robinson could become 
one of the game's all-time great centers. 
</P>
<P>
And K. C. Jones, now an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics, recently 
compared Robinson to Bill Russell.
