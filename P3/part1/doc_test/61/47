CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By evening's end, one Chicago Bull was in a hospital, the Chicago Bull had 
re-aggravated a groin injury, the highest-scoring Detroit Piston had strained a 
hamstring, two other Pistons had bloody mouths, and one particularly unpopular 
Piston was being cussed out by Chicago's coach and called "a thug" and "a 
gangster" by the Bulls' owner. 
</P>
<P>
In war, there are casualties. 
</P>
<P>
There also are victors, and spoils. The spoils in this case: Detroit, by virtue 
of Friday night's 103-94 disposal of Chicago, wins the Eastern Conference 
championship and gets to play the Lakers -- again -- for the National 
Basketball Assn. title, beginning Tuesday night in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit is going for one in a row. It has never won the NBA title since the 
franchise left Ft. Wayne, Ind., in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons spotted the Bulls a 12-point lead in the first period, then came on 
like gangbusters -- or gangsters, in some eyes -- behind Isiah Thomas' 33 
points to eliminate Michael Jordan and his gang in the best-of-seven series, 4 
games to 2. Jordan went out with 32 points and a limp because of his groin 
injury -- his bid to play the Lakers for the championship put on hold for at 
least another year. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the bad guys in the black hats, us, against the good guys in the 
white hats, the Lakers," said Piston center Bill Laimbeer. "This time, let's 
hope the bad guys win." 
</P>
<P>
A bad guy is exactly what Laimbeer was being called after Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a thug. He's a gangster. He shouldn't be in the league," said Bull owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf, not the only Laimbeer-hater in the crowd of 18,676 at Chicago 
Stadium that booed the Piston player's every move. 
</P>
<P>
It did not aid Chicago's cause that forward Scottie Pippen, the team's No. 2 
scorer during the season, played only 62 seconds. Pippen caught an elbow to the 
head -- "another cheap shot by that . . . Laimbeer," Bull Coach Doug Collins 
said -- and was taken to a nearby hospital with a possible concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom-used Brad Sellers did an admirable job in Pippen's place, scoring 16 
points, but once again, Chicago's offense was left up to Magic Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan this time took 26 shots -- not eight, as he did in Game 5 -- and made 
one shot that will be shown on highlight shows for years to come. Did he stop 
passing off? Not at all. Jordan also had 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
However, human being that he is, Jordan also committed eight turnovers, more 
than half of Chicago's total. He also made only 5 of 12 free throws, did not 
have an offensive rebound and was guilty of five fouls, which kept him from 
being as aggressive as he might otherwise have been late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Collins took him out with 23 -- Jordan's number -- seconds left in the game, to 
a thunderous ovation. The coach also used that moment to dash down to Detroit's 
bench and give high-fives to everybody on it. Laimbeer was still in the game at 
the time, so Collins did not have to be choosy about whose hands he slapped. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said: "We desperately wanted to go forward, but Detroit is a great team. 
All I can say is, it was a great series and a great lesson to build on. We got 
to this point, and there is nothing wrong with dreaming, so I'll just spend the 
summer dreaming about next year." 
</P>
<P>
Not blaming him a bit for thinking that way was Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, who 
said: "The Bulls may be the team of the future. They may be the team to beat in 
our division next year." 
</P>
<P>
Intending to pull out all the stops to keep the series alive, Chicago brought 
in everybody from Jordan's good friend, filmmaker Spike Lee, to an NBA 
semi-legend, The Original (as he bills himself) Dancin' Harry, who long ago 
provided timeout entertainment for the Washington Bullets and the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bulls really needed was some of the offense that Detroit had been 
denying them and everybody else. For a time, they had it going, but in the end, 
the Pistons had kept an opponent under 100 points for the 15th straight game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago overcame the loss of Pippen to take a 16-6 lead, with Jordan supplying 
two dunks, a beautiful assist to Horace Grant for a layup and a shot that will 
stay in eyewitnesses' minds for a long, long time -- a twisting, 
gravity-defying reverse layup over Laimbeer off a steal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls went ahead by 26-14, with Sellers doing his part, scoring eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with a dozen already, took a brief rest at this point with 2:36 
remaining in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
If only he never had to rest at all. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit went right out and ran off 12 straight points, making the score 26-26, 
and Chicago was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
When Craig Hodges hit a three-point jump shot with 8:34 left in the half, it 
was Chicago's first basket since the 3:58 mark in the first period. That's how 
much the team's offense suffers without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges ended up with 15 points, while Horace Grant had 13 points and as many 
rebounds. For Detroit, nobody came close to Thomas' 33 points, but Dennis 
Rodman did his job on the boards, getting 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas suffered a pulled hamstring muscle in his right leg during the second 
quarter, so neither he nor Jordan was at his best during the second half. And 
still they easily led their teams in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars and John Salley of the Pistons each ended up with bloody mouths 
during the course of a very physical, almost violent game, and James Edwards 
was struck by a crumpled cup thrown by a fan. No one from Detroit was seriously 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had 21 of his points in the second half, giving Detroit an outside 
attack to go with the dominating inside work of Rodman and Edwards. Daly moved 
Thomas to No. 2 guard in the second half, something he does periodically, and 
let Isiah shoot rather than quarterback the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit led by a basket at halftime, 49-47. In the third period, after Jordan 
missed two free throws, Laimbeer threw in a rare hook shot -- sort of a ground 
hook -- to give Detroit its largest lead to that moment, 62-57. By the end of 
the third period, the Pistons had widened their lead to nine, even with only 
one basket in the last 5 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls had a run left in them. Jordan completed a four-point play, two 
lay-ups around a missed free throw, and John Paxson followed with a three-point 
basket and a corner jumper for two. With 8:44 left, Chicago suddenly was within 
striking distance at 81-79, and the NBA's loudest arena was rocking. 
</P>
<P>
With a chance to tie, Jordan had his pocket picked by Dumars. The crowd settled 
down, and one-time hometown favorite Thomas rattled off six straight points for 
an 88-80 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Chicago never got closer than six. 
</P>
<P>
Excited about another shot at a pro championship to go along with the national 
college title he won at Indiana, Thomas said: "When we lost that last game of 
the NBA Finals to the Lakers, people said: 'Don't worry, next year you're going 
to have the best record in the NBA, you're going to get to the finals and 
you're going to win.' Well, we've done two out of three. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer pleaded innocent to charges of causing Scottie Pippen's head 
injury, claiming Pippen's teammate, Horace Grant, hit him. Replays were 
inconclusive to some, but not to Chicago Coach Doug Collins, who said: 
"Laimbeer hit him right in the face with his left elbow, and Scottie ends up in 
the hospital."
