FT  07 SEP 94 / Docklands rail set for evening service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Docklands Light Railway in London is to resume evening services on
October 3 for the first time in five years. This follows the completion of
the first stage of a Pounds 46m modernisation of its automatic train control
system.
The railway, which links the Canary Wharf office development with the City,
has shut in the evenings and at weekends to allow installation and testing
of the new system. Weekend services will resume next spring.
The recently-opened eastern extension of the railway to Beckton will remain
closed in the evenings until mid 1995.
