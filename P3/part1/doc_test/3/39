LONDON CITY airport yesterday organised its own air show in the Docklands.
In comparison with the Farnborough or Paris air shows it was a tiny affair,
but it marked a significant turning point in the fortunes of the airport,
built by its owner, the Mowlem construction group, 4 1/2 years ago.
The Pounds 35m project, which pioneered the concept of a business airport
dedicated to serving the City and the newly redeveloped London Docklands,
has been struggling to make ends meet.
Sir Philip Beck, the chairman of Mowlem, conceded yesterday that the airport
was still losing about Pounds 3m a year.
With the completion of a Pounds 7m extension of its runway, the airport can
now be used by a range of new turboprop aircraft, including the British
Aerospace ATP, the Swedish Saab 340B, the Franco-Italian ATR42, the Dutch
Fokker 50, the German Dornier 228, the Canadian de Havilland Dash 8 and Dash
7 and - more significantly - the BAe 146 regional jet.
Until it won government approval last September to extend its runway, the
airport was largely restricted to de Havilland Dash 7 short take-off and
landing aircraft.
The snag was that de Havilland decided to stop production of the aircraft -
and its range restricted services from London City to a limited number of
nearby Continental business centres such as Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
With the introduction of BAe 146 jet services and other new turboprops, the
airport has expanded its range to a radius including European cities such as
Stockholm, Rome and Madrid.
Already Air France has decided to operate daily flights using the ATR42 from
the airport to Paris. Crossair, the regional carrier which is 51 per cent
owned by Swissair, is introducing the first BAe 146 jet services into the
airport with a daily service from Zurich.
Mr Bill Charnock, the airport's managing director, says he hopes a number of
new operators will soon announce the opening of services into the Docklands
airport. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is being courted by the airport to start
an Amsterdam service.
The airport still faces a difficult challenge to become viaused it last
year, and Mr Charnock says the airport needs 450,000 to 500,000 passengers a
year to break even. He still hopes to achieve that target by the end of next
year or in 1994, especially now that the airport can be used by a wider
range of turboprop aircraft as well as the short take-off and landing BAe
146.
The airport last year lost one of its main carriers when British Midland
Airways decided to suspend flights after losing between Pounds 12m and
Pounds 15m over four years on its London City operations.
The recession and the decline in air travel caused by the Gulf war also set
the airport back - as it did Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, its three much
bigger London rivals, all owned by BAA, formerly the British Airports
Authority.
Perhaps the biggest handicap of all has been the continued obstacle of
access to the airport from the City.
The airport was promoted on the idea that an executive could reach the
terminal building much more quickly than if he or she had to travel to
Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted on the outskirts of the capital, and check in
only 10 minutes before flight departure.
The journey to the airport is supposed to take only 15 to 20 minutes from
the City. But takes much longer than that because roads in Docklands have
yet to be completed.
The Docklands light railway has been plagued by teething troubles. The
airport has been forced to warn passengers boarding its free shuttle bus to
the light railway that, while the rail journey into the City is supposed to
take eight minutes, 'new trains are currently being introduced into service
and serious delays sometimes occur'. In other words, we advise you not to
use the light railway.
The airport is also connected to the City, the West End and Chelsea by a
Riverbus service along the Thames. This is a picturesque and pleasant way to
travel into the heart of London but takes much longer than 20 minutes,
including waiting time for the shuttle bus and the boat.
The frequency of Riverbus services has been increased and road access should
be significantly improved next year when roads linking Docklands to the City
are completed by the spring.
One exhibitor at yesterday's airport show said: 'If it is to become a
successful business airport, it is absolutely crucial they get their act
together with the roads.
