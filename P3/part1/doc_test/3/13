FT  17 MAR 93 / Private sector may be paid to take over Docklands railway

THE government may privatise London's Docklands Light Railway by paying the
private sector to take it over. Government advisers are studying the move as
one of the most likely options for getting the loss-making railway into
private ownership.
Built in the 1980s for Pounds 77m, the Docklands Light Railway is being
extended and upgraded at a cost of Pounds 800m to increase capacity and
improve reliability.
Earlier this month, the Department of the Environment appointed the
consultancy arm of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, to draw up a list of
options for privatising the line within the lifetime of this parliament.
The government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the
private sector to build a Pounds 130m extension of the Docklands Light
Railway across the Thames to Lewisham in south-east London.
A straightforward sale or stock-market flotation of the railway is ruled out
by the losses it makes, currently more than five times its Pounds 3m annual
revenues. But Ernst &amp; Young believes the private sector could be offered a
'dowry' to take the railway off the government's hands.
This could stir up a controversy similar to the one that accompanied the
government's recent disposal of the Property Services Agency's projects
division to Tarmac, the construction group, with payments or guarantees
worth about Pounds 100m.
Another option would be to franchise the operation of the railway to the
company wanting the smallest subsidy to run it. But this could prove less
attractive than an outright sale because the government would remain the
owner.
The railway's performance, once notoriously unreliable, has improved sharply
in the past few months under a new management team headed by Sir Peter
Levene, former head of defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence. Last
week, Sir Peter announced that the railway was to pay Brown &amp; Root, the US
engineering group, Pounds 30m over the next three years to get the railway
running smoothly and cut its costs.
Mr Eric Anstey, Ernst &amp; Young's director of privatisation and utilities
services, said the railway could become profitable next decade if the
property market recovered and the Lewisham extension was built.
