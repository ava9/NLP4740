THE 16 MONTHS of negotiations culminating in yesterday's restructuring
proposals for Canary Wharf were among the most arduous and complex in any
insolvency to date.
Officials from central government, local authorities, the London Docklands
Development Corporation, London Regional Transport, the Docklands Light
Railway and existing tenants were involved in discussions co-ordinated by Mr
Nigel Hamilton, Mr Stephen Adamson and Mr Alan Bloom, the administrators
from accountants Ernst &amp; Young.
Mr Peter Totty, a partner at Allen &amp; Overy who drafted the voluntary
arrangement document circulated yesterday, said: 'The only case we've ever
had is that something is better than nothing.'
He said several important decisions were resolved only in the last few days,
including agreements by tenants not to sue and the agreement of Canadian
administrators. 'It's been quite a cliffhanger,' he said.
The collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the parent company, required negotiations to
reconcile English insolvency law with the equivalents in Canada and the US,
where the group had property develop-ments.
Lawyers and accountants have clocked up thousands of hours during the
process and are likely to receive more than Pounds 14m by the end of the
process - regardless of the eventual outcome.
'It has been a succession of meetings going on almost since day one,' said
Mr Hamilton. 'The biggest difficulty was recognising the aspirations of each
sub-group. We spent many long hours persuading, cajoling. We sat till 4am on
more occasions than I care to think about.'
Many of the most important negotiations took place between the dozen banks
supporting Canary Wharf in New York, Toronto, London and Luxembourg. They
came from different countries, with varying regulatory structures, tax
demands and requirements for provisions on losses.
Their loan exposures varied widely and each had bilateral loans with Olympia
&amp; York, rather than a single syndicated loan which would have made
co-ordination more simple.
Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank co-ordinated the bankers. He likened
discussions to pushing a jelly, and said he had held more than 40 meetings
with London Transport alone.
The bankers did not have things all their own way. The government refused to
allow them repayment of all the money they put up under the so-called
'drop-dead agreement' if the Jubilee line was not completed on time.
He said there had been no victory parties by those involved so far, but
added that if the agreement is approved after the end of next month: 'There
will no doubt be the odd celebration or two.'
