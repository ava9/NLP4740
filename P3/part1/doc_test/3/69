FT  21 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf 'excuse' on Tube plan

THE government may use the collapse of Canary Wharf as an excuse for
cancelling the Jubilee Line Tube extension, according to an administrator to
the insolvent office project in London Docklands.
Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday: 'It does
seem illogical that if you're talking about a Pounds 1.7bn extension cost
and you compare that with O&amp;Y's contribution that that would be the reason
for cancelling the whole project . . . It seems that the collapse of Canary
Wharf is being used as an excuse.'
Olympia &amp; York, Canary Wharf's developers, had agreed a contribution of
Pounds 170m toward the Jubilee Line extension, which the government believes
will enhance the value of the development.
The only immediate way in which Canary Wharf can make a significant
contribution to the project is by letting a building to the government and
putting the proceeds of any subsequent sale of the building towards the
extension, the administrators say.
However, the value of a single building would fall well short of Canary
Wharf's commitment to the Jubilee Line.
The administrators are also hoping that other beneficiaries of the Jubilee
Line, including businesses and the five neighbouring London boroughs, will
make a contribution.
No agreement was signed to help to fund the Jubilee Line extension before
the project went into administration, the administrators emphasised. They
would reconsider making any contribution to the Jubilee Line if the
government decided not to relocate 2,000 civil servants - probably from the
Departments of Environment and Transport - to Canary Wharf.
The government, which is considering two rival developments in the Docklands
for a possible relocation, has not said when it would decide.
Mr Adamson said he was 'carefully optimistic' about the project's prospects.
Serious interest had been expressed by half a dozen potential purchasers and
four had already signed confidentiality agreements.
He said it was possible that a bid would be made by a consortium of three
parties that combined property expertise, finance and the ability to exploit
the project's tax breaks, which might total Pounds 400m in enterprise zone
allowances, Pounds 400m of corporation tax losses and VAT savings on future
construction work.
The administrators are due to present proposals, which may be in a very
general form, to the project's creditors at the end of August. The
administration period is then likely to be extended.
The administrators said it was vital to avoid the liquidation of the
project, which would further damage confidence. 'Liquidation would have a
terrible effect on the rest of the Docklands and so many interested parties
that we don't think it is a probable scenario,' Mr Adamson said.
