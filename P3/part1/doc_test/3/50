for the hearts and minds of the tenants needed to fill the gaps

The opening of a new wine bar is a significant event in Canary Wharf's
struggle for the hearts and minds of tenants, following the east London
development's traumatic insolvency two years ago.
Last month's arrival of a Corney &amp; Barrow branch - a modernistic wine bar
that sports stock-market prices on wall-mounted television screens, clocks
on its ceiling and direct phone links to brokers - has helped counter
complaints about the lifelessness of the development.
The busy bar helped give Canary Wharf 'a City atmosphere', said a bank
employee. 'Life seemed to imitate an architect's drawing,' said an
advertising executive. 'The bar seemed to give a lift to the place.'
Corney &amp; Barrow is one of a number of new tenants which rejected the idea of
moving into the scheme in its early days but have decided to take the plunge
following the project's emergence from administration and the increase in
the number of its tenants. Eight retailers - mainly clothes shops - are due
to open by September and Canary Wharf hopes to achieve its target of
doubling the number of retail operations there to 40 this year.
It is in talks with 'more than one' food retailer to fill the gap which
Marks and Spencer recently decided not to fill. One of the reasons given by
Marks and Spencer for its change of mind was the fact that its emphasis on
fresh food was unsuitable for office workers lacking access to
refrigerators.
The attraction for potential retailers is the captive market of affluent
office workers, 30 per cent of whom earn more than Pounds 35,000. 'There are
quite a lot of youngish people earning good salaries,' said Mr Colin Evans,
chief executive of Austin Reed, the fashion group, which opens in August. By
autumn there will be about 12,000 people working at Canary Wharf.
Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, who was on a
marketing tour of the US this week, claims to be more flexible in his
approach to wooing tenants than Olympia &amp; York, the scheme's original
developers.
'We are being more responsive to what tenants want. It is not just take it
or leave it. I don't have the hang-up that O&amp;Y had that 'unless you have
your head office here, we don't want you'. We are happy to have back
offices.'
Sir Peter says one of the most important tasks is persuading potential
tenants to visit the development. 'You would be astonished by the number of
people who have not visited it. Everyone who comes down there goes away
converted.'
On the ground, not everybody is so sure. Tenants complain of 'feeling
marooned' and of having 'nowhere to take clients'. Travel times to work and
to meetings in the West End of London are also the source of frequent
complaints.
Nevertheless, there is a general feeling that life at Canary Wharf is
improving. The completion of the Limehouse link has speeded car journeys
from the City and by the end of the year the Docklands Light Railway will
increase its capacity to 6,000 people an hour and will start running at
weekends.
Confidence in the project is also helped by the establishment of the scheme
on a sound financial footing, after a consortium of 11 banks took it out of
administration last autumn. The banks have deferred repayment of Pounds 558m
of loans and interest until the year 2007 and put in an additional Pounds
278m of facilities.
Sir Peter talks boldly about filling Canary Wharf within four years. Doing
so is unlikely to be easy. Canary Wharf is in competition not just with the
City and West End, but with other schemes in Docklands, where another 2m sq
ft of modern space is available, at considerably cheaper rents than Canary
Wharf which is offering space at between Pounds 15 and Pounds 25 a square
foot.
Lettings in the Docklands area have increased recently. Over the past year,
a total of 800,000 sq ft has been taken up, more than double the level in
the previous 12 months, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered
surveyors.
There are some other signs of increased confidence, such as McDonalds'
application for permission to open a drive-through hamburger restaurant on
the Isle of Dogs.
However, five out of six of the largest office deals were to provide
disaster-recovery facilities for financial institutions, such as Citibank
and SG Warburg. These offices would only be used in the event of a
disruption, such as last year's Bishopsgate bombing, enforcing a transfer of
operations, and will do little to stimulate economic growth of the area.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley predicts an oversupply of space in Docklands for at
least three more years.
Unsurprisingly, there is no interest in building any more offices in the
area - although the London Docklands Development Corporation is examining
proposals for an exhibition centre and a 70-acre 'urban village' in the
Royal Docks.
Canary Wharf believes further development has merely been postponed. Sir
Peter says that once the existing space is let, it will look seriously at
the prospect of starting work on the next phase of office space.
