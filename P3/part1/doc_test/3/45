larger UK cities - Urban transport solutions, lessons drawn from Europe

THE OPENING of the Manchester light rail system sees trams finally return to
the streets of Britain's great cities. After the Second World War the notion
of street-running of railway systems was seen as cumbersome and intrusive,
and trams were replaced by motor buses in one city after another.
London's last tram ran in July 1952 and the last system to close was
Glasgow's, in September 1962 - leaving Britain bereft of trams, save for a
few ferrying tourists by the sea in Blackpool; (see page 4: Gone but not
forgotten).
The opening of the new era of the tram in Britain can be dated to a 1982
report into the options for a new railway to regenerate the London
Docklands. Transport planners working on the report drew lessons from cities
in Europe, such as Amsterdam and Zurich, that had retained and improved
their tram systems.
They proposed a new light rail system for east London which would feature
street running, including a stretch down the busy Mile End Road. As it
turned out, when it opened in 1987 the Docklands Light Railway did not
include any street running.
At the behest of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the new
railway was built as a highly-visible automatic system, wholly-segregated
from the streets on elevated track, with the aim of promoting the image of
high-tech regeneration of the area. But the fact that London Transport - the
premier urban transport operator in the country - had been thinking about
street-running tramways in the early 1980s altered perceptions of the idea
elsewhere in the country.
'We knew the big boys were thinking about it, so it must be OK,' commented
one planner in Manchester who began the conceptual studies for what was to
become the city's Metrolink system.
By the late 1980s, with construction underway on the Manchester system,
cities and towns throughout the UK began to see the modern tram as the
solution to their transport ills. By early 1990, 50 UK towns either had firm
plans or were considering proposals for a street-running light rail system,
with towns as small as Gloucester and Chatham hankering after modern trams.
But coming as they do with a price tag of Pounds 100m or more apiece, it
soon became clear that far from all these systems could be afforded - and,
as this realisation has sunk in, the promoters of some of the more marginal
schemes have begun to think in terms of cheaper options such as enhanced bus
priorities.
However, the government has indicated that the taxpayer can afford to start
one new light rail project each year, so some of the larger UK cities now
have a real chance of regaining their trams. System number two after
Manchester will be Sheffield, where main contractors Balfour Beatty have
already begun building the Pounds 230m 'Supertram' line from the city centre
to the Meadowhall shopping and sports complex.
Siemens is providing the vehicles which are expected to enter service on the
first section of line at the end of next year, with completion of a 29km
system in 1994.
In contrast to Manchester, which used mainly former British Rail lines,
Sheffield's system is mostly new alignments on streets. Next in the queue is
Birmingham, which has ambitious plans for a light rail network extending to
200km.
Detailed planning is underway on the first 21km route, which will use an old
railway alignment between the centre of Birmingham and Wolverhampton - 1995
is the best bet for an opening date. Modern trams could return to the
capital if Croydon's Tramlink proposals come to fruition. A Parliamentary
bill was deposited last November as the first stage to gaining planning
approval for a three-line, 29km system.
One hurdle to be jumped is the Pounds 140m cost: with so much Treasury money
going into the conventional railway system in London, there is a strong
predisposition in Whitehall to favour provincial light rail schemes in
preference to any in the capital. In Croydon's favour, though, are projected
passenger loadings of a completely different order to those expected in the
northern cities. Indeed, revenue could be as much as double Tramlink's
operating costs - which has led to hopes that just a little seed money from
public sources could tempt the private sector to shoulder much of the cost.
In the provinces, jostling behind Birmingham are Nottingham and Leeds, both
of which deposited Parliamentary bills last November. Nottingham's proposal
is interesting in that it could provide the first example in Britain of
light rail vehicles (modern trams) intermingling with British Rail trains on
the same track - an idea which has been shunned on safety grounds so far,
but which modern signalling systems could make feasible.
The practice is being pioneered in Karlsruhe, Germany, where light rail
vehicles already run on German Railways tracks. One scheme that was a
frontrunner in the British light rail race - but has slipped behind - is
Bristol's Avon Metro.
This is being promoted by a joint venture of private and public sector
interests who had an agreement with local bus company Badgerline, which was
earmarked to operate the trams. Badgerline has since broken-off to promote
its own scheme using guided bus technology from Belgian firm BN (now part of
Bombardier Europe), and it is unclear which system will win.
Also in the queue for funds is Manchester's Phase Two, which would see
Metrolink trams reach Trafford Park, Oldham and Rochdale. The cities so far
mentioned are the most likely candidates to gain latterday trams. Several
others - including Edinburgh, Kingston in the London suburbs and Glasgow -
have advanced plans, with the latter in particular having a fair chance of
seeing rails in the streets again by the end of the decade.
There is more realism in the British light rail movement about the chances
of getting projects built than there was a couple of years ago - and the
industry is now maturing beyond 'the flavour of the month' into a rational
answer to urban transport problems.
