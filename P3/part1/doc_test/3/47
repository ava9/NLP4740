A proposal to drop two of the six stations planned for the Pounds 100m
extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham in south London has
been attacked by the local MP, Charles Batchelor writes.
The Lewisham extension, given approval in the Budget, will be less
attractive to tourists if the Cutty Sark and Island Gardens stations are not
included, Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, said.
Docklands Light Railway regards the Lewisham extension as essential for the
long-term growth of revenues. The two stops would add tourist use at
weekends and in the summer.
