FT  02 APR 92 / People: Military precision for Docklands railway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The military are to be drafted in to make the trains run on time on the
troubled Docklands Light Railway. Ownership of the notoriously unre-liable
DLR was yesterday transferred from London Transport to the London Docklands
Development Corporation following lobbying by Olympia and York, the
beleaguered developers of the huge Canary Wharf office complex.
The new chairman of the DLR, Sir Peter Levene, has turned to the ministry of
defence where he was chief of defence procurement from 1985-91 for three of
four top managers.
Major-General Malcolm Hutchinson becomes managing director, after a 'long
and distinguished career in defence procurement'. Currently a member of the
Defence Prospect Team, much of his career was spent in REME, the army's
engineering corps. He was director of procurement strategy at the MoD from
1986-88 and vice master-general of the ordnance from 1988-90. President of
the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers,
Major-General Hutchinson is a member of the council of presidents steering
group for the unification of the engineering profession.
The new planning director also comes from the MoD; Stephen French is to be
seconded from his work in project finance, public procurement and strategic
planning.
The third board member to be appointed yesterday comes from United
Scientific Holdings which Sir Peter Levene headed before moving to the MoD.
Anthony Jackson, finance director at USH, will be the new finance director.
Another secondee from the defence department, Stephen Gibbs, will head the
projects organisation. Gibbs is currently a scientific adviser to the army
on research and technology programmes under the title of director science
for land systems.
His experience in radar, communications systems, guided weapons and
'stealth' bombers will no doubt be invaluable in sorting out the DLR's
operating problems, which appear to be largely technical rather than
manag-erial.
