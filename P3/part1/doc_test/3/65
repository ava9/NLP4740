FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: How to revive a dead canary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSOLVENCY of Canary Wharf raises two possible prospects. One involves
cancelling a proposed underground rail link to central London. This would
add to the pressures on tenants already dismayed by the collapse to invoke
escape clauses in their leases; everyone could then watch as Europe's
biggest office development, already half empty and worth half as much as the
debt carried in its name, becomes a marbled haunt for bats and river
rodents.
The second is that those with a direct interest in avoiding this outcome -
namely the banks which effectively own Canary Wharf and the government - do
something to stop it.
So far, the government has reasoned that the banks will see that if they are
to avoid adding to their losses they must stump up the cash the original
developer, Olympia &amp; York, promised to co-finance the Jubilee Line link. Mr
Major was firm again yesterday that he has no intention of bailing out
Canary Wharf.
The government is right to drive a hard bargain; the banks are exposed not
only to Canary Wharf but to numerous other projects in east London. They
cannot expect to avoid paying a heavy price for their commercial
misjudgments.
But the bargaining cannot end there. The upgrading of east London's
transport infrastructure is crucial to the future of the only substantial
part of greater London capable of absorbing more people and buildings, not
to mention its position at the fulcrum of the proposed Channel tunnel link.
A very large amount of public funding has already been committed to
Docklands, much of it in a belated dash to address the area's chronic
transport problems.
If it is true that the Thatcher government's biggest mistake in Docklands
was its failure to provide an adequate transport system, it hardly makes
sense to deny proper transport now that the area is heavily developed. The
government should declare swiftly and firmly that it is negotiating with the
administrator to ensure that it gets the best terms possible for moving its
civil servants to Canary Wharf and for co-financing the new railway.
There is also the wider question of the government's credibility. Its urban
development corporations, using public funding to attract private sector
investment, have mostly been a success. So much so, that Mr Peter Walker,
the former Welsh secretary with whom some of those successes are associated,
is about to become head of a new urban regeneration agency. If the
government proves too hard-nosed over Canary Wharf, it will hardly be seen
as a reliable partner in future projects.
The key to Mr Walker's Welsh achievement was his ability to combine mixed
funding and a constructive relationship with (mainly Labour-controlled)
local authorities. Most of the problems of Docklands stem from the failure
in London's more turbulent political atmosphere to achieve a similar unity
of purpose. The City of London, the east London boroughs and the government
have, literally, played beggar my neighbour.
Canary Wharf may never become a global financial centre. But there is no
reason why it cannot play a useful part in the economic rehabilitation of
east London. Mr Major has set up a cabinet committee to co-ordinate London's
woefully strategy-less development. It is time Londoners heard from it.
