FT  27 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Trouble in Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property developer, made a fortune in the 1970s
by turning a derelict area at the base of Manhattan into the hugely
successful World Financial Centre. In trying to repeat the trick in London's
Docklands O &amp; Y has hit trouble.
Much of O &amp; Y's colossal office development at Canary Wharf is unlet and the
developers are discussing their difficulties with about 200 banks. The
question is what, if anything, should be done to influence the outcome in
the wider interests of the capital.
The problem is not simply one of hubris and bankerly excess. Docklands, the
largest urban redevelopment project in Europe, came into being because
London's political institutions had failed. It was the chronic inertia of
local Labour-run boroughs that led Mrs Thatcher's first government to set up
a special development zone in the abandoned docks.
As the project progressed, mistrust between central government and Labour
local authorities became all out war, culminating in the abolition of the
Greater London Council in 1986.
It is hardly surprising that in these circumstances, relations between the
development corporation and neighbouring Labour boroughs deteriorated or
that strategic planners were ignored. The consequence was a catastrophe of
infrastructure provision; Docklands lacks effective road and rail links to
the nearby city. Only belatedly were plans laid to build new roads and to
extend London Transport's Jubilee Line through Docklands. An immediate
difficulty is that O &amp; Y's promised commitment of Pounds 400m to the Jubilee
Line extension is in doubt.
Relaxed rules
Canary Wharf's prospects were also hurt by the City's relaxation of its
planning rules to allow a further 20m square feet of offices in the Square
Mile. As a result the City has an unprecedented office vacancy rate of 20
per cent and rents on empty office space have halved.
It is tempting to argue that O &amp; Y and the banks should be left to extract
themselves from the mess. Since much of the bank debt was advanced by
Canadian and other foreign banks, O &amp; Y's problems are unlikely to pose a
threat to the stability of the British banking system. Lower office rents
are also a good thing, from the point of view of London's competitiveness as
a financial centre.
That would have been no more than a marginal consideration in the 1980s. But
the City's competitive edge, which used to rest substantially on a light
regulatory touch in wholesale markets, is now under threat as other European
countries deregulate their financial markets. London's financial services
sector may continue to grow through the 1990s, but its share of
international finance will probably decline.
Narrow view
The government, however, cannot afford a narrow view. Docklands, for all its
faults, is crucial to the task of rebuilding east London's economy. This is
desirable in its own right and essential if planning pressures in
overcrowded west London are to be tolerable in the next economic upswing.
Also, if Docklands cannot be made to work, there is no hope at all for the
more ambitious east London corridor project. That project is in turn the key
to connecting London efficiently to the Channel Tunnel, a task which the
government has thus far addressed with dismal lethargy.
Whoever wins the general election will therefore look east from Westminster
and see towering problems. The parties have proposed radically different
blueprints for overhauling London's government: direct rule from Whitehall
by the Conservatives and a new Greater London Authority from Labour. Neither
has clear views on what should happen to the Docklands Development
Corporation when its remit expires in the course of the 1990s.
London desperately needs clear thinking and resolute action on these complex
strategic questions. Meanwhile, the government must ensure that the Jubilee
Line project is safeguarded. The banks will argue that it is not for them to
stump up the cash promised by O &amp; Y. Yet their overriding interest lies in
ensuring that the building finds tenants to fill the 40 per cent of space
that remains unlet. Without that, loans will not be serviced and repaid. On
this, at least, the government can afford to take a hard-nosed line.
