FT  29 MAR 94 / Gummer opens extension to Docklands Light Railway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Environment secretary John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile extension
to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a delay of 18
months.
The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems
with construction and systems installation. The extension, which connects
Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City, is funded by the London
Docklands Development Corporation.
Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village, where he took the
controls of a mechanical digger (above).
