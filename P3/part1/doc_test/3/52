BANKERS yesterday put forward proposals for a Pounds 1.1bn rescue package to
save Canary Wharf, the insolvent London Docklands office scheme, from
liquidation.
The proposals would pave the way for the Pounds 1.8bn extension to east
London of London Underground's Jubilee Line.
The agreement, hammered out during more than a year of complex negotiations,
depends on approval by the project's 1,400 unsecured creditors at a meeting
on September 30. If agreement is reached, Canary Wharf is expected to emerge
from administration, a UK insolvency procedure, by the end of October.
Canary Wharf, which cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build, has been valued at
just Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m. The rescue package depends on the secured
lenders investing substantial new funds in the project in the expectation of
recouping more of their existing Pounds 568m of loans.
Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank, which co-ordinated the rescue package, said
the banks intended to hold on to their investment at present. 'We believe
that the value of the project is in the future,' he said.
Unsecured creditors, who have been offered payment of up to 15p in the
pound, have been told they have no chance of securing a better offer. Mr
Cheyne said that if creditors rejected the deal, Canary Wharf would go into
liquidation, which would be 'a tragedy for the Docklands'.
The rescue of Canary Wharf and the Jubilee Line extension could have a
lasting impact on the potential success of Docklands, which suffered a
crisis in confidence after the insolvency of Canary Wharf in May 1992.
Better transport links would help Docklands overcome its difficulties in
attracting tenants, which, with the collapse in the London office market,
resulted in the failure of Canary Wharf.
The government is expected to approve the Jubilee Line extension once the
Olympia &amp; York companies come out of administration. Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, said securing the private sector contribution cleared
'a very large hurdle'. The government had delay-ed approving the project
until it had secured the private sector contribution promised by O&amp;Y, the
Canadian company which was the original developer of Canary Wharf.
The rescue package involves the restructuring of Pounds 568m of existing
debt and the payment of additional new finance of up to Pounds 278m plus
another Pounds 300m over 25 years for the Jubilee Line extension.
