THE sale of a Canary Wharf building to the government is being negotiated in
a last-ditch attempt to save the Jubilee Line extension and attract civil
servants to the troubled east London property development.
Canary Wharf's administrators, who have run the project since it filed for
insolvency protection five weeks ago, will offer to sell a building to the
Department of Environment. An offer could be made as soon as today.
The proceeds would be returned to the government to pay for part of the
London Underground Jubilee extension into east London, without which the
future of Canary Wharf would be even less certain.
Some government ministers are keen on moving civil servants to Canary Wharf,
the biggest property development in Europe, whose success may be vital to
the long-term regeneration of London's Docklands. However, the Treasury is
insisting that Canary Wharf should only win if it offers the best terms.
The DoE's property adviser, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, last week told the
administrators, partners from the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, that it is
prepared to negotiate the purchase of a building at a market price.
Before Canary Wharf went into administration, its owner, Canada's Olympia &amp;
York Developments, had agreed to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of
building the line in staggered payments over 25 years, including a payment
this year of Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m next year. The contract was never
signed and the administrator is under no obligation to honour the agreement.
The DoE is keen to move 2,000 civil servants to Docklands and has been
looking closely at four sites: Harbour Exchange, East India Dock, Thomas
More Square and Canary Wharf. Ministers are likely to move there too in
order to encourage civil servants unhappy about the move from central
London.
Until now, Canary Wharf's rivals have consistently offered lower rents.
Canary Wharf's last bid, made on 18 June, was rejected by the DoE.
