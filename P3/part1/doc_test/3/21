FT  26 MAR 92 / Opposition warns on cost of Jubilee Line plan

THE LABOUR PARTY warned yesterday that the taxpayer may have to fund a much
larger share of the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line Underground extension to
London's Docklands if Olympia &amp; York, the project's main private backer,
cannot come up with its share of the money.
Labour's warning came as the Department of Transport acknowledged that
ministers would have to reconsider the financial future of the Underground
extension if the financially troubled property developer was unable to meet
its Pounds 400m commitment.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, said the project was 'going
to be thrown into the hands of the public sector because the private sector
has failed to live up to its agreement'.
The Jubilee Line extension, once regarded as a pioneering transport project
by the government involving private and public investment, would create five
Underground stations in south and east London and would service Docklands.
The Department of Transport said its decision to give the Jubilee Line the
go ahead in November 1989 hinged on the agreement of Canary Wharf's
developers to contribute Pounds 400m towards the cost of the project.
'If for any reason that (contribution) is not possible, any such radical
change to funding arrangements will require ministers to consider all the
issues before arriving at any decision,' an official said.
O&amp;Y was due to make its first contribution of Pounds 40m to the project at
the end of this month, with a further Pounds 60m due at the end of March
next year. The balance of Pounds 300m was expected by 1996, when the
extention was due to be completed.
O&amp;Y has begun a restructuring of its worldwide debt, estimated at more than
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn). It denied that its finance plans for the
Jubilee Line were being discussed by banks as part of its debt
reorganisation.
Both London Regional Transport (LRT) and O&amp;Y said last night that
negotiations on the extension were continuing.
Sources close to the project say the party that wins the election could face
a difficult choice: increase its share of the project, or go for a less
costly plan.
A Docklands Light Railway official said it would be 'unable to cope' with
the projected increased passenger levels for 1996 and beyond without the
extension.
