At least five consortia, including some overseas companies, are likely to
submit preliminary bids for the Pounds 100m-Pounds 130m privately financed
extension of the London Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham in south London.
The contract, which is expected to be awarded next autumn, will form part of
the Pounds 5bn of private investment in infrastructure which Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, said in his Budget speech was likely to be placed
next year.
The closing date is December 14 and memberships of some of the consortia
have still to be finalised, but five potential candidates have emerged.
The list is understood to include a joint venture between Amec, the UK
construction group, Dragados, the Spanish contractor, and Brown and Root,
the US engineering group. Bovis, the construction arm of shipping group P&amp;O,
and Nishimatsu, a Japanese contractor specialising in tunnelling, are also
expected to bid jointly and are negotiating with other potential partners.
Mowlem, the UK construction group which built previous sections of the
Docklands Light Railway, is expected to lead another bid.
It has still to be decided whether GEC will support the Mowlem tender as the
signalling contract for the Lewisham extension has already been earmarked
for the Canadian subsidiary of Alcatel of France which is providing new
signalling for the existing railway.
Other potential bidders for the 2 1/2 -mile extension are believed to
include the BICC engineering group, which owns Balfour Beatty construction,
and Pell Frischmann, consulting engineers, which is understood to have had
negotiations with UK contractors Alfred McAlpine and Sir Robert McAlpine and
Sumitomo Bank of Japan.
Bidders for the extension have been invited to pre-qualify through the
official journal of the European Union. A shortlist of bidders is expected
in January.
The government intends that the Docklands Light Railway, which links the
City with east London, should be franchised to a private-sector operator in
1996 before being sold completely to the private sector seven years later.
