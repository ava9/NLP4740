The men responsible for Canary Wharf sat on its 30th floor yesterday,
deflecting criticism of the scheme that has brought the world's largest
property developer to its knees.
'Wasn't the project a great disappointment?' insisted a questioner. Steve
Miller, Olympia &amp; York Development's chief bank negotiator, came back: 'You
are sitting in the most important commercial development in the country. I
don't see how you can even ask the question.'
That question, however, is being repeatly asked by government ministers,
tenants and, most of all, the bankers who are deliberating whether to put
the project into administration. Whatever its fate, the project has played a
disastrous role in draining O&amp;Y's cash to a point where it has sought
protection from its creditors under US and Canadian insolvency laws. The
4.5m sq ft office complex is only 60 per cent let.
But in one respect, Mr Miller had a point. As a construction project, Canary
Wharf is an astounding achievement. In just five years it has transformed a
derelict area of disused docks into the highest-quality offices in the
country. The scale and panache of the Canary Wharf buildings present an
astonishing contrast to its surroundings.
Too astonishing, perhaps. The opulence of the development sits oddly with
the neighbouring buildings on the Isle of Dogs and the shabby housing of the
East End. Its critics in the neighbouring local authorities believe that a
massive office complex is an inappropriate way of revitalising the area and
its community. Its critics in the property market wonder whether the image
of Docklands will ever be able to overcome the down-at-heel neighbourhood.
It is too early to assess whether the scheme will succeed or fail. In the
long run, Canary Wharf could become a prestigious cornerstone of a
revitalised East End. But in the near future it is hard to see the project
living up to its developers' vision.
Its goal of creating a third business centre to rival the City and West End
was always ambitious. Certainly, Canary Wharf had little in common with the
government's original intention for the area which, at the start of the
1980s, was a wasteland. The vision was a modest one. When Mrs Thatcher's
first government set up an enterprise zone in the Docklands, it only
expected to attract industrial companies to the area.
The stakes were quickly raised. Private developers, supposedly the best
forecasters of demand, were willing to invest ever-larger sums in the
Docklands. The London Docklands Development Corporation, set up in 1981 to
oversee the regeneration of the area, also worked tirelessly in attracting
new tenants. Even before O&amp;Y arrived on the scene, the area enjoyed a
feverish period of commercial and residential expansion.
For a time, the Docklands was a magnet for investment - attracting five
times as much private money as public funds. But many who entered the market
have regretted it bitterly. Well over half its building never found tenants,
making the Docklands a developer's graveyard. The latest casualty is South
Quay, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft building just across the water from
Canary Wharf, which yesterday went into administrative receivership.
The question now facing the Docklands is whether it can fulfil the lofty
aspirations symbolised by the Canary Wharf project. Or will it take on a
more modest role, poor relation to the business headquarters of Central
London.
Part of the answer depends on whether it has already achieved sufficient
momentum to build itself up as a centre for international companies in
London. Canary Wharf already has an impressive roster of US-owned tenants,
ranging from American Express, to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, which
could attract others to the area.
But to a greater extent, the future of the Docklands rests with the
government, which can influence events in two crucial ways. First, it is
considering moving at least 2,000 and possibly up to 5,000 civil servants to
the area. Second and equally important is its willingness to finance the
extension of the Jubilee Underground Line, due to be completed in 1996 at a
cost of Pounds 1.7bn.
The government is divided on what to do. It is unwilling to send civil
servants to the Docklands unless the future of the Jubilee Line extension is
assured. But it is unclear whether Canary Wharf's banks will honour O&amp;Y's
commitment to fund the extension. The company is due to pay Pounds 100m over
the next year and a further Pounds 300m when the line is completed.
If the banks refuse to provide the funds, some ministers would like the
government to make up the difference. The cost, they argue, is a relatively
small price to pay for salvaging the world's biggest urban redevelopment
project.
The Treasury sees the matter in a different light. At a time of a ballooning
budget deficit, it needs to cut expenditure. It thinks that Canary Wharf's
owners will, eventually, be willing to help finance the Underground
extension that will greatly add to the buildings' value.
An extra twist is provided by the negotiations with the Department of the
Environment, which is moving from its current offices in Marsham Street and
is considering several Docklands locations. Although the department was
close to clinching a deal with Canary Wharf earlier this week, it has yet to
be sure that it is obtaining the best possible value for money.
The government's need to find a satisfactory route out of this maze is
complicated by the symbolic role that Canary Wharf has played as a flagship
of the enterprise culture of the 1980s. The government cannot totally
divorce itself from the fate of the project, which it promoted as a
prominent example of a partnership between the public and private sectors.
The prime incentive for the government to rescue the project and the Jubilee
Line extension lies in its commitment to develop the east of London. This is
reflected in the concentration of infrastructure spending in the area, the
routing of the high-speed rail link from the Channel through Stratford and
the grandiose, although sketchily defined, plans for development along the
East London Corridor, a tract of land stretching through Essex that is
earmarked for urban renewal.
The three borough councils abutting the Docklands Development Corporation -
Southwark, Newham and Tower Hamlets, gateway to the 'East London Corridor' -
are watching developments with anxiety.
For all three, Canary Wharf is a symbol of hope - or more particularly,
jobs. The Jubilee Line is seen as vital to reviving the whole area.
Unemployment levels are high: about 19 per cent in the Peckham and Southwark
and Bermondsey constituencies, and higher still in Bow and Poplar (21 per
cent) - which includes the South Poplar district, for which the council is
currently seeking urban regeneration funding under the government's City
Challenge scheme.
East London regeneration projects are only weakly tied to Canary Wharf for
the most part, but Tower Hamlets has recruitment, amenities and education
agreements with Olympia &amp; York, which may be nullified in the event of a
collapse.
'Development in the southern side of the borough was driven by Docklands,'
says Ms Janet Ludlow, the Tower Hamlets representative on the Docklands
Development Corporation. 'It's slumped since the recession, but could take
ages to revive if Olympia &amp; York go under.'
There is a certain irony in the possibility that the government will come to
the rescue of the project. A key reason for Canary Wharf's problems has been
the slow progress made by the Department of Transport in improving the
Dockland's transport links.
O&amp;Y's executives were incensed at the inefficiency and poor management of
the Docklands Light Railway, which sullied the reputation of the entire
area. When O&amp;Y appeared before the House of Commons transport committee in
1990, it said the average delays experienced by DLR passengers were between
10 and 100 times greater than those found on any comparable system in the
world.
Transport has not been the only problem facing O&amp;Y and other Docklands
developers. Canary Wharf might have pulled its ambitious plans off had it
not been for the deepest slump in London commerical property prices in
living memory.
The recession bit at the same time as a record number of new buildings came
on stream, the legacy of the property boom of the late 1980s. There is now
no shortage of large, modern air-conditioned buildings in the City where one
in five buildings is empty.
Together with other Docklands projects Canary Wharf inspires mixed reactions
from its tenants, with some bemoaning a shortage of shops, difficult
transport and a sense of isolation. However, the developments also have
ardent admirers, whose enthusiasm is undimmed by O&amp;Y's problems.
'Whatever happens to the owners, it is still an extraordinary facility,'
said Mr Jerry Roberts, general manager of Ogilvy and Mather Europe, the
advertising agency. 'There is still a tremendous shortage of this kind of
quality of place with as much flexibility as one has in Canary Wharf.'
But O&amp;Y has had difficulty is persuading UK companies of the merits of the
high-quality, large buildings at Canary Wharf, leaving the overwhelming
majority of buildings to North American tenants. The developers found many
UK companies resisted moving. 'We have to identify people who have the
courage and personal leadership skills to risk the disdain of their
colleagues,' said a senior O&amp;Y executive last year.
Is there, the developers mused, something intrinsically conservative about
the British that deterred them from pioneering a new district? Were they so
prejudiced against the East End that they could not see its potential? Were
they so tightly bound to familiar streets and watering holes that they were
unwilling to explore new locations?
The fate of London's Docklands hangs in the balance. If the Jubilee Line
extension is completed and the government takes a lead in mopping up the
surplus space, it will have gone some way to overcoming the pyschological
barriers of potential tenants as well as its physical isolation. The
development of the area moved faster and further than anyone thought
possible during the 1980s. Decisions made in the next few weeks will
determine whether that impetus has been lost for good.
