are slowly transforming the bleak face of London's docklands

Visitors to London's docklands marvel at the enormity of the Canary Wharf
building, at the driverless trains in their toytown colours and at the
futuristic shapes of the office buildings. They rarely admire the lapwings
or the little ringed plovers or remark on the plant life.
As for the 55,600 people who work in London's docklands, their chief link
with nature is likely to be the plants in their offices.
The London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-appointed
quango which has been running 22sq kms of land east of the Tower of London
since 1981, wants to change that by establishing ecological projects in the
area.
Last summer, it commissioned a wildlife survey of docklands by members of
the Trust for Urban Ecology. They concentrated their efforts on the Limmo
peninsula of the River Lea, east of the Isle of Dogs. The peninsula is split
in half by the Beckton extension of the Docklands Light Railway.
The survey found birds such as cormorants, lapwings, little ringed plovers,
shags and grebes. In the 12 acres of former railway sidings on the peninsula
and the East India basin nearby, it recorded 140 plant species, including
some from as far afield as South America and Indonesia.
Bishop's weed, silky bent, Austrian camomile and Sumatran fleabane were
found growing beside the belching traffic on the main road. The rare seeds
are thought to have been the offshoot of cargo deliveries of old.
Since then, walkways and a footbridge have been built to link Bow Creek with
the proposed Canning Town interchange and the residential areas separated by
one of the busiest roads in London. The money came partly from Pounds 3m
devoted to environmental improvements along the DLR extension which opened
earlier this year.
The LDDC is expected to agree a further Pounds 1.5m for the ecology park
this summer. Designs for an ambitious environmentally-friendly nature centre
will require further funding this year.
Much of the impetus for the work, says the corporation, has come from the
completion of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Limehouse Link
road, completed last year, and the DLR extension. With such work completed,
time could be devoted to environmental enhancement.
LDDC spokesman John Williams says: 'We have been concentrating on putting in
the infrastructure over the last four or five years. Now it is in place, the
time is right to make it as environmentally friendly and attractive as
possible.'
The corporation is sensitive to suggestions that part of the impetus for
environmental improvements has come from the mistakes of the rapid
development of the Isle of Dogs where, for example, workers now have the
option of watching bird rafts on Millwall Docks.
It points out that it has sponsored two ecological sites in Surrey Docks on
the south side of the River Thames since the early 1980s and it has spent
Pounds 95m on environmental improvements in the past 13 years. In the last
few years, this has mainly been spent on landscaping work on roads and the
DLR.
A lot of work has been spent on 'greening' the corridor of development going
out to Beckton and easing the fears of local residents - efforts which the
corporation has been criticised for lacking in the past. Much work has also
been put into reclaiming the site of an old British Gas works contaminated
with methane.
The emphasis is on a living and working environment with educational and
recreational needs coming high up on the corporation's agenda, says
Williams. 'The corporation is a regeneration authority whose primary focus
is to build buildings using former derelict land. But, having said that, we
are quite aware that we can't just go on building buildings ad infinitum and
that there has to be a balance to create a desirable living and working
environment.'
Kieron Murphy, the manager in charge of the ecological projects, says: 'We
are intensely conscious that the image of docklands in the public mind is of
Canary Wharf or negative images. It is not associated with ecological
projects and we want to do something about that.'
Eric Sorensen, the corporation's chief executive, is well aware of the
commercial benefits of such projects. 'Environmental improvement like this
is good business sense. We know from discussions with businesses that the
quality of the local environment where people work and live is of great
value. If you are in the business of attracting business, then these
features are doing a very positive good.
'Our aim is to bring the East End into line with the mainstream commercial
world by demonstrating that it's not an area of environmental hostility but
a very good one in terms of access to water and that it's a very pleasant
place to be in terms of flora and fauna. All these things are very important
to us.'
Although the cost of environmental improvements has been borne by the
corporation so far, the aim is to involve local businesses as much as
possible.
Texaco, the US energy group which moved its UK headquarters and 1,000 staff
from west London to the Isle of Dogs last year, is sponsoring the bird raft
project as part of its educational policy.
This business involvement will be of increasing importance when the
corporation pulls out of docklands in 1998. Faced with its own demise, there
is a natural desire to leave a more diverse legacy than the half-empty
Canary Wharf and the DLR. The corporation says the onus in the last few
years will fall on attracting partnerships to continue its work and to
create long-term benefits for local residents as well as those who work in
the area. To this end, it is also working closely with local authorities.
Murphy, walking around the saplings of the peninsula, is full of plans for
creating marshlands and drylands and woodland areas and fishing.
'We have so much planned for this area but until it is more ready we will
not be able to go, cap in hand, and ask for support. When we can, we will go
out and be able to say 'Look, this is what you can support: wildlife in
docklands'.'
