Canary Wharf's plunge into administration stems in part from the UK
government's dithering over whether to relocate its civil servants to the
4.5m sq ft development in the London Docklands.
The delay is more than just an illustration of the slow pace of government
decision-making. The Conservative government, which faces considerable
embarrassment over the plight of the Docklands because of its strong
ideological and fiscal support for the region, has been anxious not to
appear to be bailing out a bankrupt developer. For the government, the need
to obtain value-for-money in its choice of office space for Whitehall-based
civil servants has been all important, prompting a careful consideration of
other potential accommodation in the Docklands
Two weeks ago Sir Terence Heiser, permanent secretary at the Department of
the Environment, and a score of his most senior civil servants went on a
tour of the Docklands in search of offices to house some 2,000 civil
servants.
The senior civil servants' visit underlined one of the most remarkable
features about the parlous state of Docklands: the abundance of empty,
modern buildings that are large enough to accommodate an entire government
department.
There are three premises - besides Canary Wharf - on the civil servants'
list of potential new homes for Department of Environment staff. All are
large, audacious schemes.
In the middle of the Isle of Dogs, the half-empty Harbour Exchange is a 1m
sq ft behemoth of dark, mirrored glass. East India Dock, on the eastern edge
of the enterprise zone, is a light, neat edifice totalling 600,000 sq ft.
Thomas More Square, a pale elegant structure on the western fringe of
Docklands, contains 550,000 sq ft of space of which 80,000 sq ft has been
let.
Three out of the four schemes have been built by non-UK developers - as good
a sign as any of overseas developers' more adventurous outlook towards the
Docklands.
East India Dock was developed by the Swedish partnership of NCC and SPP.
Thomas More Square was built by Skanska, the Swedish developers. Canary
Wharf is, of course, the work of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer
which has sought protection from its creditors.
Harbour Exchange has been built by Charter Group, a private UK property
company, which was once one of the most successful Docklands developers,
although it has recently run into difficulties. Like O&amp;Y, Charter Group was
admired by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former UK prime minister, who wrote the
foreword to one of its marketing publications.
The claims made by the developers are depressingly interchangeable: 'A
magnificent building with facilities unmatched in London'; 'an unrivalled
modern office scheme'; 'the quality of the buildings surpasses that of any
other office accommodation in the capital.'
Most property experts undoubtedly believe the quality of the Canary Wharf
buildings is a cut above other Docklands competitors. And Canary Wharf is
likely to be favoured by the government in its final selection of a new home
for Department of Environment civil servants if a deal is struck with O&amp;Y's
bankers over the Jubilee Line extention. Whichever of the quartet is
selected, the new premises would be a huge improvement on the crumbling hulk
of the Department of the Environment's current offices at Marsham Street in
Victoria.
The four buildings' location and facilities differ substantially. East India
Dock is surrounded by traffic, a housing estate and the Financial Times's
printing plant. Both Canary Wharf and Harbour Exchange are in the heart of
the Isle of Dogs with a reasonable selection of shops nearby. Thomas More
Square, to the east of St Katherine's Dock by the City, is 10 minutes walk
to the nearest tube station.
The government has said that its final decision will rest on value for
money. Canary Wharf's owners are believed to be asking Pounds 15 per sq ft;
the government has been offering only Pounds 13 per sq ft. O&amp;Y's move into
administration could lower asking rents in the area still further.
Arriving at a swift decision over the Department of Environment's new home
has been a prime concern for the government. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
the government's adviser, has argued it needs more detailed negotiations
before it can come to a conclusion over which is the most suitable site.
Yet the decision to move to the Docklands is by no means cut and dried.
Certainly, the outcome is likely to be jeopardised by the cancellation of
the Jubilee Line extension, following O&amp;Y's move into administration.
One alternative for the government would be to consider using those central
London premises made vacant by the relocation of civil servants from other
departments. 'There is a possibility that the government could take the
option of using the existing government estate,' says Mr Michael Soames of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The Department of Transport, which shares the Marsham Street premises with
the Department of Environment, is undertaking separate reviews of its
relocation needs and is thought to be unwilling to make any rapid decision
to move staff to the Docklands.
Civil servants would welcome any proposal that avoids the Docklands. Many
staff are incensed by the prospect of being sent to an area that has been
largely spurned by the private sector. The civil servants' unions are
seriously concerned about the impact on staff of splitting up the
department, longer journeys to work and the relative shortage of facilities
in the Docklands.
'The effect on staff morale will be devastating,' says Mr John Rouse of the
First Division Association. Mr John Delaney of the National Union of Civil
and Public Servants goes further. 'It could well lead to industrial action,'
he says.
