FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Extension to Jubilee Line a priority for future of
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PICKARD

<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to read David Weeks's letter (March 31) suggesting that
the Jubilee Line extension can be delayed, on the grounds that it serves
only London's Docklands. In addition to improving Docklands access, this
line will provide a new high-quality central London rail link to east and
south-east London, serving not only the Docklands area, but also the
residents and businesses of Waterloo, London Bridge, North Southwark,
Bermondsey, Greenwich, Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford.
It will also relieve several of the most congested parts of the central
London rail network. Passengers on the Central Line between Stratford and
Holborn, the District and Circle Lines between Monument and Victoria, and
Bakerloo Line between Paddington and Oxford Circus on the Network SouthEast
between Stratford and Liverpool Street, will all experience significant
improvements in journey comfort.
The London Docklands Development Corporation has recently engaged in
discussions with Westminster City Council with a view jointly to promoting
London to ensure that it retains its position as the premier commercial city
of Europe. In achieving this, Docklands will complement the City and West
End.
The Jubilee Line will play a key role in providing high-quality access
between these centres and also in giving access to the Channel tunnel train
services at Stratford. It will combine with and reinforce other ongoing rail
improvements to provide London with an effective public transport system to
compete internationally in the future. For all these reasons the Jubilee
Line extension should continue to be supported as a priority project for
London Transport.
