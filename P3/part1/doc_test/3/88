hopeful - Office Property

A YEAR after Canary Wharf's insolvency sent shockwaves through the Docklands
office market, opinion remains sharply divided about the sector's prospects
for recovery.
The sceptics doubt whether the area has a chance of ever living up to the
ambitious plans that were hatched in the second half of the 1980s. They
believe that the high-profile problems of Canary Wharf and other schemes
have dealt a lasting blow to the Dockland's prestige. Moreover, the
oversupply in the City and weak demand from the financial services sector
will severely constrain take-up of offices. At the current rate of take-up,
there is well over a decade's supply of available office space.
But its defenders believe that within the next five years, its fortunes
could be transformed. They think it can still fulfil its potential of being
London's third business centre, along with the City and West End.
The area's champions draw encouragement from improvements to the Docklands
transport system and the arrival of large tenants such as Texaco at Canary
Wharf.
Moreover, they contend that Canary Wharf's move into administration was less
damaging to tenant demand than was generally assumed, notwithstanding the
decision of some of the Wharf's tenants, such as American Express, to
abandon their move.
Interest in the Docklands from potential tenants actually increased after
the insolvency of Canary Wharf, according to Mr Roger Parsons of Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors - 'we had a lot of people come and have
a look purely out of curiosity. It raised expectations that there were
incredible deals because everyone assumed the Docklands was on its knees.'
Indeed, demand for office space in the Docklands showed slight signs of
improvement last year. Take-up increased to 332,000 sq ft in 1992, compared
to 192,500 sq ft in 1991, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The trend also improved in the first quarter of 1993, which saw the highest
quarterly take-up rate of 213,503 sq ft, since the second quarter of 1990.
However, it is unclear how sustainable this improvement will be. Some 90 per
cent of the first quarter's take-up was the result of moves by three
occupiers from in or immediately around the Docklands. The largest deal was
struck by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets which in February announced
that it would move its town hall to a 140,000 sq ft building in the East
India Dock development owned by NCC, the Swedish development group and SPP,
the Swedish insurance group. In addition, Northern and Shell, the
publishers, bought the 54,000 sq ft Merchant House in City Harbour and East
London Telecommunications let 27,000 sq ft at Limeharbour Court.
Another notable deal in the first quarter of 1993 was the LDDC's sale of
three acres in March to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which announced
plans to build a 150,000 sq ft courtroom complex in East India Dock. Other
office tenants that have taken space in the past year include Endsleigh
Insurance, which rented 24,000 sq ft in South Quay Plaza II in 1992, the
Dept. of Transport, Sunrise TV and the National Therapeutic and Osteopathic
Society.
THE Western International University of Phoenix, Arizona agreed last summer
to open a London campus that would occupy 20,000 sq ft of Glengall Bridge, a
scheme by London and Edinburgh Trust and BICC Development at Millharbour.
Another educational establishment, the European Language School, also took
space in the scheme.
The attraction of the Docklands for most incoming tenants is price.
Typically, a new tenant would pay Pounds 10 per sq ft for a ten year lease,
with 2 1/2 years rent free. Furthermore, the Uniform Business Rate of around
Pounds 10-15 per sq ft for top specification space is cheaper than in the
City and West End rates where it averages some Pounds 23 per sq ft. However,
the 1995 revaluation, which is based on rental values in April 1993, will
reduce this differential.
Although there has been a trickle of small and medium-sized deals in the
past year, the Docklands will need to attract large office users before it
has a realistic chance of recovery. Some 57 per cent of available space of
available space in the Isle of Dogs (which totals 2.87m sq ft) is in
buildings over 200,000 sq ft.
Unsurprisingly, Canary Wharf dominates the market. It accounts for half the
available space in the Isle of Dogs, which in turn accounts for 84 per cent
of the LDDC area.
Its prospects remain highly uncertain. Since the project moved into
administration, it has attracted little interest from tenants. Even with an
economic recovery and a resolution of the uncertainty surrounding the
Jubilee Line extension, the prospects of filling up the 4.5m sq ft project
are daunting.
Recovery in the Docklands property market is likely to lag the rest of the
London office market. Agents blame the meagre level of interest from
potential tenants on the intense price competition from other parts of
London.
'The problem is that there hasn't been a good reason to come to the
Docklands. The competition has been so strong,' says one agent.
The best hope of Docklands property owners is that once the large new office
blocks in the City of London have been taken up, large occupiers will decide
to move down the river to the docklands, rather than opt for second hand
accommodation that lacks air-conditioning. Another faint source of comfort
for Docklands' landlords is that the development pipeline has virtually
dried up. Moreover, there is little likelihood that the large development
projects that have already won planning permission will come to fruition.
With its modern office space and improving infrastructure, the Docklands
should benefit from a pick-up in tenant demand as the economy recovers. But
even the most optimism observer of the Docklands believes that pulling its
property market out of its current position will be a long, slow haul.
A Small Business Ideas Day, sponsored by John Laing, the construction group,
will be held on Wednesday, June 9 at the Skylines development. Details of
the open day and exhibition are available on 071 497 9707.
