FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Collapse may depress Docklands rents

THE PLACING in admini-stration of Canary Wharf may lead to rents in London's
Docklands being slashed from an already low level. The task of rival
developers in finding tenants will become even more daunting if Canary
Wharf, which offers some of the best-quality offices in the UK, is placed on
the market at rock-bottom prices.
The downward spiral of office rents has particularly dismayed developers who
sold buildings to investors with a guaranteed rental income. The deals
allowed developers to exploit the Enterprise Zone's 100 per cent capital
allowances, but it has left them with heavy liabilities. Rents of about
Pounds 20 a sq ft which seemed realistic two years ago are now more than
double the going rate.
Merely cutting rents is unlikely to generate demand. Few places in the UK
offer new, high-quality air-conditioned buildings at such cheap rents -
although some fringe City buildings are heading the same way. Developers
have been leapfrogging each other in an attempt to set the lowest prices.
A shock wave went through the Docklands market last year when Wyn-Ro
Investments set the rent at South Quay Plaza, a big building opposite Canary
Wharf, at just Pounds 10 a sq ft.
Even that has since been undercut: a building at Thames Quay on the Isle of
Dogs is being offered for a two-year trial period for no rent.
Docklands' reputation as a developers' graveyard should be safe for several
years. Pressure is intensifying on the owners of empty property, which
accounts for half the 10m sq ft of offices in Docklands. Their costs rose
steeply a month ago when the Enterprise Zone's tax breaks ended, forcing
developers to pay 'empty rates' of about Pounds 3.50 a sq ft as well as
maintenance costs on their empty buildings. Such developers have little hope
of finding buyers because unlet property has little value in such an
oversupplied market. The receivers to the Euro Trade Centre, a project close
to Canary Wharf that failed two weeks ago, said they were considering
mothballing the building for up to 10 years.
It might take decades to fill the empty property if lettings continue at
their present rate. Last year, which was admittedly the lowest point of the
recession, 350,000 sq ft of offices were let, according to Savills, the
chartered surveyors. Outside Canary Wharf, only 100,000 sq ft was let.
Developers cannot take such strain indefinitely. Last month Charter Group
had to defer its quarterly payment to investors in PET 8, a trust based on
Exchange Tower in the Isle of Dogs, which is less than half let.
Desperation has led developers to ever more creative ways to market their
projects. For example, the Euro Trade Centre attempted to arrange an office
swap with the Estonian government. Meanwhile, the inducements demanded by
tenants, such as rent-free periods, have become increasingly onerous for all
but the strongest developers.
The developers with the most serious difficulties are those which built
grandiose buildings in the last few years of the Docklands property boom.
The difficulty in persuading large tenants to move to the area will become
even more daunting if the Jubilee Line extension is not built. If that
happens, the market will have to rely on the small businesses that are
providing what little demand there is.
The troubles in the office sector are shared by other parts of the property
market. The recession and poor infrastructure undermined the prospects of
the London Arena, the conference, sporting and concert venue, and of Tobacco
Dock, a stylish but isolated shopping centre in Wapping.
Poor transport and an over-emphasis on expensive property have also
afflicted the housing market, which has seen a 30 per cent fall in prices
since its peak in 1987. The depressed state of the market prompted one
developer to fill its empty flats by housing the local authority's teaching
staff. The housing market, too, has claimed corporate casualties. The most
striking example is Sir Terence Conran's Butlers Wharf scheme, which
eventually failed as a result of high interest rates and the evaporation of
demand after the stock market crash of 1987.
The bleakness of Docklands' prospects are offset by the occasional chink of
light. Even if the Jubilee Line extension does not go ahead, Docklands will
benefit from big transport improvements over the coming year. Lower interest
rates and economic recovery should increase demand from tenants.
For all that, Canary Wharf was the engine of much of the area's development
and its failure has cast a long shadow over the market as a whole. The
developers who pioneered the area over the past 10 years are bogged down in
the most treacherous property market this century.
