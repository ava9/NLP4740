Canary Wharf, the largest, most expensive office project in Europe, is being
put to the test.
More than 3,000 people have arrived at the development in London's Docklands
over the past few months including the staff of Morgan Stanley, Ogilvy &amp;
Mather and the Daily Telegraph. So does their experience justify the
long-held belief of Olympia &amp; York, the developers, that 'once people are
there, Canary Wharf will sell itself'?
The project has some enthusiastic advocates. 'It looks absolutely first
class,' says a senior executive of Morgan Stanley, which has swapped five
cramped buildings in the City and West End for spacious, state-of-the-art
offices, a canteen and a gymnasium.
'Marvellous,' says Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which has
moved its staff away from a tatty, 70-year-old building north of Waterloo
Bridge to two open-plan floors in Cabot Place.
Staff milling around the shopping mall at lunchtime have mixed views. 'It is
disastrous,' says a brisk, smartly dressed Morgan Stanley employee, scanning
the bookshelves in the newsagent. 'I hate it. It's like Ford open prison,'
she adds.
Although Canary Wharf boasts a dozen shops, a pub, a restaurant and two
cafes which report brisk trade, the range of diversions in the West End is
widely mourned. 'There is nothing here for anyone. What there is, is too
expensive,' says a young back-office worker at Morgan Stanley.
Even the limited amusements offered in the southern Isle of Dogs inspire
nostalgia in one Daily Telegraph employee. 'I never thought I'd say that,'
she says wryly.
Transport heads the list of complaints, although several Canary Wharfers
have found it better than they feared. Employers are smoothing the
transition with free car parking, free river bus passes and even, in the
case of Morgan Stanley, a temporary private bus service.
Heavy car parking charges (up to Pounds 35 for a day) are designed to
encourage people to use public transport. But the Docklands Light Railway
(DLR) is still unreliable and overcrowded. The riverbus does not currently
have sufficient capacity to cope with peak demand. Getting to Westminster
through lunch-hour traffic takes up to an hour.
Many of these gripes will disappear in time. Two extra riverbuses will be in
service by May, reducing intervals between the boats to just 10 minutes; the
DLR is being upgraded; the opening of the Limehouse Link next year will cut
congestion on the roads; the Jubilee tube line will be in place in 1996.
Several other shops and restaurants are due to arrive, including Marks and
Spencer. A post office counter will open in May; there will be a health
club, although its opening has been delayed for six months until next
spring.
In the summer, the 25 acres of open space and riverside promenades will seem
more inviting for the office workers who complain of having nowhere to go at
lunchtime.
That said, Canary Wharf's claim that 'the environment offers a higher
quality of working life than any other in London, with incalculable benefits
in terms of morale, productivity and staff retention' looks far-fetched at
present.
What of Canary Wharf's central claim that it offers 'unprecedented benefits
to modern, competitive businesses' compared with London's other inadequate
and dear office accommodation?
The property industry would largely agree with Canary Wharf that 'the
quality of the buildings surpasses that of any other office accommodation in
the capital'.
Nonetheless, there is no shortage of high-quality, modern buildings in other
parts of London. According to APR, an independent research body, two-thirds
of the 40m sq ft available for let in central London is brand new. In any
case, the problem for London developers is not that companies are happy with
their existing offices, but that they cannot escape from lengthy leases at
overpriced rents.
Similarly, Canary Wharf is not unique in its promise to help companies
'improve their operational efficiency and competitiveness', although the
claim is well founded. Ogilvy &amp; Mather is pleased with the improvement in
culture and communications that has resulted from its move. 'There is a real
buzz,' says Mr Walsh.
The cost savings of moving to Canary Wharf have narrowed over the past two
years, as rents in some parts of central London have halved. Ogilvy &amp;
Mather, which is thought to be paying around Pounds 30 per sq ft at Canary
Wharf, signed its lease when the rent at its old headquarters was
threatening to soar. Now agents reckon that renewing its old lease would
cost the same as or less than it is paying at Canary Wharf.
Canary Wharf is expensive compared with the rest of Docklands, where it can
cost less than Pounds 10 per sq ft to rent modern, air-conditioned space.
If, for instance, the Department of the Environment moves to Docklands, it
will be difficult to justify a deal with Olympia &amp; York, unless it is at an
unprecedentedly cheap rate.
Canary Wharf also claims that its tenants 'will be at the heart of the most
rapidly improving transport infrastructure in the country, in an area which
will become the most accessible in the capital'. The first point is probably
true: Pounds 3.5bn is being ploughed into Docklands transport links. The
second point is more controversial. Some commentators think that, if Canary
Wharf achieves its projected 50,000 jobs, the rail, riverbus and road
capacity may be stretched.
The reservations expressed by some occupants and potential tenants are not
usually shared by casual visitors. The scale, detail and sheer novelty of
the project impress many who flock to it at weekends.
Visitors' reactions to the architecture vary hugely. Cesar Pelli's imposing
steel tower has been widely acclaimed, but many, like Prince Charles, detest
the monolithic scale of the buildings. Canary Wharf's visitors' centre
plaintively reminds critics: 'Sir Christopher Wren's plans for St Paul's
attracted a considerable amount of criticism for its size at the time.'
The verdict is also mixed on the interior, which ranges in style from an
elegant glass dome at Cabot Place East to a slightly oppressive atrium tower
clad in 199 tonnes of streaky, blood-red marble.
Visitors are not just regaled by the architecture. A thousand people a day
visit Canary Wharf's visitors' centre, which is an entertaining mix of
history and hyperbole. 'Canary Wharf, London's third business district, is
perhaps this century's prime example of Britain's unwavering strength and
confidence,' says a display board. 'The best transport system in London,'
trumpets another.
The greatest attraction of Canary Wharf lies in the views from its 800 ft
tower, the tallest in the UK. Visits have been limited to potential tenants,
opinion-formers and potential investors in the Enterprise Zone Trust - which
was trying to raise Pounds 215m on one of the Canary Wharf buildings before
it was withdrawn yesterday. But O&amp;Y is 'seriously considering' extending
this opportunity to the public.
A chance to see a view of London hitherto confined to aircraft pilots is
likely to pull in the crowds. From 800 ft up, there is a panoramic view
across areas as diverse as the City, Wapping, Limehouse, Stepney, the Royal
Docks, Bromley, Stratford, Greenwich and the Isle of Dogs, displaying
dramatic contrasts in architecture and wealth.
Letting visitors up the tower could be a profitable marketing ploy. Anything
that adds to Canary Wharf's profile could help overcome the business world's
ambivalence towards the project. As a starting point, the invitation to the
top of the tower has been extended to London's taxi drivers - some of the
most influential arbiters of opinion in the capital.
