THE COST of abandoning the Pounds 1.7bn planned extension of London's
Jubilee underground line may be more than Pounds 200m, according to the
London Docklands Development Corporation.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developers of Canary Wharf in London's
Docklands, had promised to pay Pounds 400m over 25 years towards the line.
Canary Wharf was put into administrative receivership last month, putting
the Jub-ilee Line extension in jeopardy.
The government has said that it will not go ahead with the extension unless
a purchaser can be found for Canary Wharf that would be willing to take over
O&amp;Y's commitment.
In a briefing paper submitted to the Department of Transport, the London
Docklands Development Corporation says that taxpayers and shareholders of
construction companies have already spent more than Pounds 100m in
preparatory work on the extension.
London Transport says it has spent Pounds 100m on bringing designs to the
point at which contractors can tender for work. Contractors are estimated to
have spent a further Pounds 20m on preparing bids.
The development corporation estimates that the costs of aborting the
extension may be a further Pounds 35m to Pounds 85m.
Contractors have submitted bids for almost all of the 10-mile extension.
London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by
Italstrade, the Italian engineering group, as being likely to win the
contract a 2 1/2 -mile section.
