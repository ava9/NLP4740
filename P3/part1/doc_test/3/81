FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Transport priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID WEEKS

<TEXT>
Sir, Londoners will have been saddened to read of the difficulties of
Olympia &amp; York, the company which has brought to Docklands the magnificent
Canary Wharf project, but the company's involvement in funding the Jubilee
Line should be the least of our worries.
Polls carried out by Mori have shown that the top priority of eight out of
10 Londoners is making improvements to the existing services such as new
rolling stock, new signalling and better stations on lines, such as the
Central and Northern line stations.
As one would expect, the customers have got it right. In Westminster and the
City of London we have 170m square feet of offices and a workforce of around
1m people. What is more, we have most of the capital's tourist attractions
and half the hotel bed spaces. Let us concentrate on getting a modern,
reliable underground system for today's workers, residents and visitors.
I note that John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, thinks that this
delay in O &amp; Y's Pounds 40m contribution to the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line
project shows that 'determining transport priorities on the basis of
development case was folly'. It was not. The slower than expected take-up of
the 5m square feet of Canary Wharf offices means the Jubilee Line will not
be needed so soon. Bringing in the private sector has meant the government
programme is forced to take into account market needs. So much the better,
say I.
London Transport's lethargic response to the problems of today is what
should concern us, rather than any delay in Olympia &amp; York's contribution to
the Jubilee Line project. Railways to Docklands can wait while existing
problems in central London are sorted out.
