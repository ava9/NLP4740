FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Another train ride for Prideaux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Prideaux, the manager credited with turning British Rail's InterCity
division into the only profitable long-distance railway in the world, is to
join the Docklands Light Railway, a much smaller and currently loss-making
operation.
Prideaux, 49, is joining DLR, which operates a nine-mile network serving
east London and the Canary Wharf office development, as a non-executive
director. But he says he expects to devote more time to DLR than is formally
laid down in his contract.
One project to which he will be devoting his time is the planned Pounds 100m
extension of the railway south of the Thames into Lewisham. The DLR is to
look for a private consortium to build the 4.5 mile line which on completion
would double the DLR's revenues. At present it collects just Pounds 4m in
fares against running costs of Pounds 20m.
Prideaux says his experience of helping BR negotiate the creation of a
joint-venture partnership with BAA to build the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express
line between Heathrow and Paddington in west London should be valuable in
negotiations with potential bidders for this project.
After stepping down as managing director of InterCity, Prideaux became
executive chairman at Union Railways, the BR subsidiary set up to manage the
development of the fast rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel. But
he fell out with BR chairman, Sir Bob Reid, over the proposed privatisation
of the company and over the choice of a London terminus for the link.
Prideaux favoured St Pancras while Sir Bob wanted Kings Cross.
The boardroom row came to a head last August but Prideaux only reached a
severance agreement with BR in December. The DLR directorship is the first
job he has taken on since leaving Union Railways, since when, he says, he
has been brushing up his language skills.
Also joining DLR as a non-executive director is Nicolas Lethbridge, managing
director in London of Babcock &amp; Brown, an international leasing company.
Lethbridge, formerly project finance director with Schroders merchant bank,
has a background in the private financing of public services, particularly
in the transport field.
