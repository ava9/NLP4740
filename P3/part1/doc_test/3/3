Jubilee extension

GOOD TRANSPORT links have always been seen as crucial to the future of
Canary Wharf and London's Docklands. But with the final shape of Canary
Wharf now in doubt, one question to be answered is whether those transport
plans will be scaled back.
Projected government spending on Docklands transport is colossal. Over the
next five years, the bill for upgrading the Docklands Light Railway,
extending London Underground's Jubilee Line and completing the road links is
expected to reach Pounds 3.5bn - many times more than is being spent on
transport in the rest of the badly congested capital.
The government's commitment to the regeneration of Docklands means most of
that spending will still go ahead. Road construction and the upgrading of
the Docklands Light Railway are in any case too far advanced to be halted.
Where doubts do arise, however, is over the two transport links in which
Olympia &amp; York is financially involved - the RiverBus and the Jubilee Line
extension.
The RiverBus, a high-speed ferry service running every 20 minutes along the
Thames from Chelsea Harbour to Canary Wharf and Greenwich, is in danger of
becoming an early casualty if O&amp;Y collapses. Heavily loss-making, it has
only survived this long because O&amp;Y was prepared to finance it as a stop-gap
service pending the completion of other transport links.
It only seems likely to continue if any successors to O&amp;Y decide the losses
are outweighed by the value of the direct links provided by the ferry
between Canary Wharf and British Rail's London Bridge, Charing Cross and
Waterloo stations.
The Jubilee Line extension from central London to Canary Wharf and
Stratford, in east London - the most important link of all - also faces
uncertainty. At Pounds 1.7bn it accounts for nearly half the projected
Docklands transport spending.
In recognition of the fact that the value of the Canary Wharf development
would be greatly enhanced by the Jubilee Line extension, O&amp;Y had agreed to
put Pounds 400m towards the construction cost. But only Pounds 100m was to
be paid during the construction period: the remaining Pounds 300m was due in
staged payments long into the future, so its effective present value was
small.
O&amp;Y and the Department of Transport had yet to sign a legal agreement
covering the details of the deal. But the department has a letter from O&amp;Y
committing the company to the financial contribution, and ministers regard
this as binding on the company and its successors.
What remains to be seen, however, is whether O&amp;Y's banks see it this way, or
whether they would try calling the government's bluff and default, in the
expectation that the government would pick up the tab.
The government's view is that whoever takes control of Canary Wharf would
accept that Pounds 100m is a small price to pay to secure the Underground
line, given the fact that the investment will be recouped many times over
through the enhancement of Canary Wharf's value. Conversely, without the
line, Canary Wharf could become next to worthless.
But O&amp;Y's banks are also aware that the extension of the Jubilee Line is
crucial not just to Canary Wharf, but to Docklands in general; they may
gamble that the political price of not proceeding with the project would be
far greater than the missing Pounds 100m.
Whichever way, it seems likely that the line will be built. But the bigger
question is over the timing. London Transport warned yesterday that it could
not hold its project team together indefinitely. If the uncertainty lasts
much longer, and the project team is disbanded, the Jubilee Line could be
badly delayed - with all that implies for Canary Wharf and Docklands as a
whole.
