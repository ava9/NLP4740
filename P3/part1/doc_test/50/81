THE US is to end its ban on female pilots being assigned to combat units,
defence officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, will issue the order this week, they
said, and will also ask Congress to drop a long-standing prohibition on
women serving in warships and tell the navy to study the issue.
Women in the US military are currently allowed to fly helicopters and
fighter jets, including training male combat pilots, but cannot serve in
combat units.
Mr Aspin's moves, expected today, are in keeping with President Bill
Clinton's campaign promise last year to drop barriers against expanded roles
for women in the army, navy, air force and marine corps.
But Mr Aspin is expected to move more carefully toward possible service of
women in army ground combat.
The navy's leadership has in the past year openly supported admitting female
pilots to combat roles, such as the hazardous job of flying jet fighters
from aircraft carriers.
Some senior air force officers, however, have spoken out against the move
despite tests that show women in some cases might be better fighter pilots
than men.
