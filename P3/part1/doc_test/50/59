Patty Sheehan shattered the U.S. Women's Open record for 36 holes Saturday when 
she completed a two-day round of four-under-par 68 to take a six-shot lead in 
the rain-plagued event. 
</P>
<P>
The leading money winner on the LPGA Tour this year faces a 36-hole test today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with my position," Sheehan said after her 10-under-par 134 
score for two trips around the 6,298-yard Riverside Course at the Atlanta 
Athletic Club in Duluth, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
USGA officials said it was believed to be the first time a player ever was 
10-under in the Women's Open. She broke the 36-hole scoring record of 138 set 
last year by Betsy King. 
</P>
<P>
An overnight rain kept players off the course until Saturday afternoon and 
limited play to those players finishing their second rounds. Sheehan played 15 
holes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She held the lead over Jane Geddes, the 1986 Open champion who needed 12 hours 
and endured two rain delays before completing a 74 on Friday that left her at 
140. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Verplank is enjoying playing "catch me" instead of catch up, in the Bank 
of Boston Classic PGA tournament at Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I don't have to pass anyone tomorrow," Verplank said after he 
retained a one-stroke lead with a three-under-par 68 for a 54-hole score of 
203, 10 strokes under regulation, at Pleasant Valley Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid for his first tour victory since the 1988 Buick Open, Verplank had a 
one-stroke lead over Brian Tennyson, who finished a bogey-free third round with 
birdies on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
At 206, three strokes back, were Mike Smith, Sam Randolph, Willie Wood and 
Clarence Rose. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 players have a shot at the $90,000 winner's check in the Kroger 
Senior Classic at Mason, Ohio, co-leader Lee Trevino said after play was rained 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to go all the way to the two-unders -- at least a dozen guys," 
Trevino said. "It would be difficult to come from even par." 
</P>
<P>
After Trevino and Dave Hill, who are tied at six-under-par 65, there are 21 
other players who were at least two under par after Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
The $600,000 tournament was also halted by rain on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One stroke behind the leaders were Joe Jimenez, a 64-year-old lifetime club 
pro; Walt Zembriski, a retired ironworker; and John Paul Cain, a stockbroker 
from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Welshman Ian Woosnam won back-to-back golf tournaments for the first time when 
he shot a final-round 68 to win the $680,000 Scottish Open at Gleneagles. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam moved away from the field to a 19-under 269 for a four-stroke victory 
over Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.
