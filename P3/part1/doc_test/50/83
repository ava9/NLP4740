Orange Coast and Golden West colleges, less than 10 miles apart, will travel 
close to 500 miles to most likely decide the state women's swimming title this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, which had won four consecutive state titles before finishing 
second to Diablo Valley last season, is back as the favorite. Golden West and 
Diablo Valley figure to be the only two teams strong enough to challenge OCC. 
</P>
<P>
The meet starts Thursday and continues through Saturday at Diablo Valley 
College in Pleasant Hill, near Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has qualified seven swimmers, four divers and four relay teams. 
Golden West has 10 swimmers and four relay teams, but no divers. 
</P>
<P>
OCC is led by Patti Reed, Karen Paulitschek, and Erika Reetz. Reed has the best 
time in the state in the 500-yard freestyle (5:05.01.) She also will be in the 
200 freestyle and the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Paulitschek will swim the 500 freestyle, 50 butterfly and 100 butterfly. Reetz 
will be in the 500, 200 and 100 freestyles. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West is led by three sophomores, each of whom qualified for three events 
after qualifying for three last season. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Takayama will be in the 100 individual medley and the 50 and 100 
butterfly. Carolyn Bentley will swim the 100 individual medley, 50 breaststroke 
and 100 breaststroke. Cristi Hugh qualified for the 500 freestyle, 200 
individual medley and the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
This will mark the second time this season that OCC and Golden West have faced 
each other. OCC, which won the Orange Empire Conference, won the Cuesta 
Invitational title in March. Golden West, which won the South Coast Conference, 
finished second and Diablo Valley third at Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West Coach Jem McAdams thinks his team still could challenge OCC. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much room for improvement from Cuesta that it's exciting," McAdams 
said. "We have a chance to really do some things well and be right there."

Saddleback baseball: Saddleback is in motion to hire a full-time baseball coach 
by the end of spring. Jim Brideweser took over the program again this season 
after coaching from 1982-85, but had to step down for medical reasons a month 
ago. Brideweser planned to coach this season only. 
</P>
<P>
Assistants Rich Rommel and Charlie Phillips have been running the team since 
Brideweser stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Athletic Director Bill Otta, who will head the search committee, 
said there were close to 40 applicants. The committee will start interviewing 
soon after the regular season ends on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reach will be returning to the Rancho Santiago baseball program as an 
assistant coach, the college's sports information department announced Monday. 
Reach was baseball coach from 1975 to 1981 and compiled a 151-92 record. 
</P>
<P>
He then took over the softball program from 1982 to 1987. Reach's softball 
teams had a record of 189-54 and won back-to-back state titles in 1985 and 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Reach will be joining the staff of Don Sneddon, who replaced him in 1982.
