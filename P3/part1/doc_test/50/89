Seems that Steve Scott, whose name has been synonymous with the Carlsbad 5,000 
road race over the past three years, is having to share the attention this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the three-time champion, could find himself nudged out of the glow of 
the spotlight by any one of a number of stars in the men's field -- or by three 
Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
One, Olga Bondarenko, won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, setting 
a world track 10,000-meter record of 31:05.21. Another, Yelena Zhupiyeva, took 
the bronze medal in 31:19.82. The third, Natalya Artyomova, holds the Soviet 
track record in the 5,000 meters at 14:54.08. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive accomplishments. But those Olympic feats are actually reasons why 
the Soviets might not be in top form right now. They're still recuperating from 
the physical and mental exertion they put into training for the Games, which 
were held less than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're just coasting, or at least that's what they indicated Thursday at 
the Carlsbad City Council Chambers, where they were bestowed with BAD 5000 
T-shirts, sweat shirts and "coffee" mugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural differences being what they are, the Soviets quickly corrected 
Carlsbad Mayor Pro-Tem Ann Kulchin after she presented the visitors with the 
mugs, telling her that they would probably be used for vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Kulchin protested, offering a compromise that the mugs be used for tea. But the 
Soviets just said nyet. 
</P>
<P>
Which, as it turned out, was the answer of the day, especially when the runners 
were asked if they were in top shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to upset anyone," Bondarenko said through interpreter 
Aleksander Mineyko, "but please do not expect the most out of me because after 
Seoul, with the physical and mental effort put into it, I've been recuperating. 
. . . But I'm delighted to be invited here. I'd just like to do my best." 
</P>
<P>
Added Zhupiyeva, "I'm not in solid form. I'm in good shape, but not solid." 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. Compared to the Olympics, the Carlsbad 5,000 is just another 
road race. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand that this is not the Olympic finals," said Pavel 
Litovczenko, the Soviet coach. "But still you're more likely to see their 
(Soviet runners') backsides than their front sides. They will do their best, 
and if winning comes, then God bless." 
</P>
<P>
Artyomova was more optimistic. "I'm going to go for a good time," she said 
after Zhupiyeva indicated that she would not push her time. "And if the times 
are good, then perhaps the gods will allow for a good place as well." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Then again, maybe former San Diego State runner Lynn Williams, the 
bronze medalist in the 1,500 meters at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 
fifth-place finisher in Seoul at 3,000, will be inspired by the Russians' 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is expected to be the biggest challenge to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
And for these runners, anyone would seem to present a "big" challenge. 
Bondarenko stands only 5-feet-1 and weighs 90 pounds. Zhupiyeva is 5-2, 101, 
and Artyomova 5-6, 108. 
</P>
<P>
The Invitational for men and women will begin at 9:15. A crowd of 25,000 is 
expected to line the streets of Carlsbad to view the race. The starting line 
will be the corner of Grand and Jefferson Avenue, the finish at State Street 
and Elm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is once again favored to win the men's division -- he ran a world road 
best of 13:31 here in 1986 and broke that with a 13:30.2 last year -- but he 
will be pushed hard on the home course he designed. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Nenow, a late entry, brings with him a world road 10,000 best of 27:22, 
set in 1985. Kenya's Julius Kariuki, the gold-medalist at Seoul in the 
steeplechase, has guaranteed race promoter Tim Murphy that he need not "worry 
about Steve Scott winning for the fourth time in a row." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Terry Cotton, who finished ninth last year, is entered, as are 
Americans Doug Padilla and Ed Eyestone. Padilla is the U.S. record-holder 
indoors in the 5,000 meters, and Eyestone was Track and Field News' 1988 Road 
Racer of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Two British runners -- David Moorcroft and Geoff Wightman -- also could 
contend. In 1985, Moorcroft became the first man to finish 5,000 meters on a 
track in less than 13:00. Wightman is a miler moving up to the 5K.
