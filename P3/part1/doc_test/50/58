NEW COACH PUTS EL CAMINO IN THE SWIM FOR STATE MEET

Corey Stanbury, El Camino College's enthusiastic swimming and water polo coach, 
has proven that with enough dedication, any program can be upgraded in a short 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In only his second season as head coach, Stanbury has made contenders out of 
the once-ailing El Camino men's and women's swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's South Coast Conference meet at Golden West College, the El 
Camino men finished second and the women third. Seven Warriors -- two divers 
and five swimmers -- qualified for the state meet, which started Thursday at 
Mt. San Antonio College and ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last season only one El Camino swimmer, Todd Douglas, and three divers 
qualified for the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, an all-American last year, will compete in the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke and the 400-yard medley relay. Sophomore Dan Wilkinson qualified 
in the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle, the 200 freestyle relay and the 400 
medley. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes High freshman Scott Peppard will compete in both relays and the 
50-yard freestyle. Freshman Bill Johnston will swim the last leg of the 200 
freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
The only woman swimmer to qualify is Nicole Standardi, a sophomore from Rolling 
Hills High. Her outstanding performances in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard 
freestyle have earned her spots in all three races at Mt. SAC this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're poised to do quite well," Stanbury said. I think both men and 
women can finish in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury is also confident in his two divers, freshmen Michelle Zimmer and Ed 
Bangaster. Both have qualified on the one- and three-meter boards. Zimmer is 
from North Torrance High, Bangaster from St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Though it won't be official until after next week's Southern California 
Championships, it appears that El Camino is sending at least five athletes to 
Santa Barbara for the state track meet May 18-19. 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Sharette Garcia is a sure bet in the 800 and 1,500 meters 
unless unexpected injuries hamper her. The petite sophomore from Belize is the 
defending 800-meter state champion and the state runner-up at 1,500 meters. She 
was also on El Camino's championship 4 x 400 relay team last year. 
</P>
<P>
This season Garcia's marks in the 800 and 1,500 rank among the state's best. At 
last weekend's SCC meet she swept the 1,500 in 4:49.56 and the 800 in 2:16.68. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Tracy also had impressive performances at the conference meet in Walnut. 
The 37 year-old won both the 3,000 and the 5,000 meters. Her 17:27.00 mark in 
the 5,000 set a new league and school record. It's also a personal best for the 
freshman from Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of quality athletes," said El Camino assistant coach Dean 
Lofgren, "but unfortunately we don't have much depth." 
</P>
<P>
That mostly applies to the field events, though Tiesha Holmes leads Southern 
California in the long jump and triple jump. The freshman won both events at 
Mt. SAC with marks of 18 feet, 8 1/2 inches in the long jump and 37 1/2 feet in 
the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino men also have a pair of leapers who should qualify for the 
championships in Santa Barbara. Sophomores Ron Martin and Curtis Mitchell rank 
among the state's best in their events. Last week Martin broke the SCC long 
jump record with a leap of 25 feet, 1 inch. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell leads the state in the triple jump. He swept that event at the 
conference finals with a mark of 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches. Coach Bill Moreno says 
Mitchell is being highly recruited by top schools such as Louisiana State 
University and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
SCC track coaches couldn't decide on a conference athlete of the year when they 
met Wednesday, so they took the easy way out and picked four. Garcia, Tracy, 
Jakki Henderson and Crystal Irbing were named co-athletes of the year in the 
conference. Henderson is a sprinter at Mt. SAC, and Irbing is a sprinter at 
Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing new about Harbor College's baseball team making it to the 
playoffs, this year's club is even more impressive than usual. The Seahawks, 
41-5, have broken the school record for victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Harbor is in a weak league, but the Seahawks also have solid 
tournament victories over top-notch teams such as defending state champion 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the Harbor players have managed to get pumped up for all 19 games 
they have played in the six-member Southern California Athletic Conference, 
despite the lack of competition. They finished league play 19-0. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a cakewalk has it been? Only one regular starter -- center fielder 
Mike Murphy -- played in Harbor's last conference game, against Barstow on 
April 26, and the Seahawks still won, 13-3. Coach Jim O'Brien, sure there was 
nothing to worry about, was at a coaches' meeting in San Francisco while his 
reserves nailed Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs should provide more excitement for the confident Seahawks. 
Post-season action starts May 11 against a team yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
At the state championship tournament, scheduled May 25-27 at UC Irvine, Harbor 
looks as if it's equipped to improve on last year's third-place finish.
