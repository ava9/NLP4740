<P>
Amid reports of aberrant and inept behavior by the cockpit crew, federal 
officials on Friday suspended the licenses of the captain and co-pilot of a 
USAir jetliner that crashed during an aborted takeoff attempt at La Guardia 
Airport on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said that because of "circumstances related 
to the accident . . . (Capt. Michael Martin and First Officer Constantine 
Kleissas) no longer qualify to exercise their privileges to fly an airliner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subpoenas Issued 
</P>
<P>
The agency said also that it has issued subpoenas for Martin, a veteran pilot, 
and Kleissas, who was at the controls for the first time on a regularly 
scheduled 737 flight. The FAA said it is asking them to "provide all pertinent 
records" involving Wednesday's crash. The plane broke into three pieces after 
skidding into the East River, killing two women passengers. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing Friday night, James L. Kolstad, acting chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said that "there clearly was a lack of proper 
procedure being followed in the cockpit" of USAir Flight 5050. 
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with NTSB investigators Friday, each pilot cast doubt on 
the other's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the investigators said, described Kleissas as inexperienced and said 
Kleissas inadvertently disengaged the automatic throttle control mechanism as 
the plane began its takeoff roll. Martin said he manually engaged the throttle 
but then felt "a vibration" and detected a leftward drift of the plane. When he 
could not control the drift with the rudder, he aborted the flight, Martin told 
the NTSB. Too late, he realized that the plane would skid into the river. 
</P>
<P>
Kleissas told investigators that, after the crash, he had mentioned to others 
that Martin was "babbling" while going over the preflight checklist, but the 
co-pilot said he now regrets using that word. 
</P>
<P>
Unnamed New York Port Authority detectives have been quoted in New York 
newspapers as saying that Kleissas told them that Martin had been "mumbling" 
and "acting irrationally" before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Kleissas, a resident of the San Fernando Valley, was also quoted as saying the 
pilot began screaming shortly after giving the command to abort the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said Friday that "it clearly took too long" for Martin and Kleissas to 
report for drug and alcohol testing after the crash. The results of the tests 
were not made public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has a right to know that its transportation system is alcohol- and 
drug-free," Kolstad said. "Failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug 
testing following a major accident is inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
"The provision of urine samples, and no blood samples, almost two days after 
this accident severely impedes our investigation and unnecessarily creates an 
environment of suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highly Questionable' 
</P>
<P>
In a statement from Washington, FAA Administrator James B. Busey said that, 
"for these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 hours after an 
accident that took two lives and to do so with no explanation is highly 
questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials in New York said the captain's flight bag had been 
impounded and searched but "nothing improper" was found. However, the Queens 
district attorney's office said it was continuing to monitor the federal 
investigation of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said that Martin and Kleissas said that they had assisted passengers in 
evacuating the plane before leaving the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
The senior flight attendant on the plane, at an emotional news conference with 
three of his co-workers from Flight 5050, said both pilots assisted in rescue 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But the attendant, Wayne Reed, 34, of Chesapeake, Va., refused to comment on 
the captain's behavior except to say: "He was assisting me in any way he 
could." 
</P>
<P>
The captain told investigators that he took a rescue boat to a nearby pier and 
then went to a hotel, where he met with representatives of the Air Line Pilots 
Assn., the pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot said a Coast Guard helicopter took him to a Port Authority 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the two men told the NTSB that "they'd gone through a very 
traumatic experience. They'd helped the passengers. They wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union said Friday that "there was nothing unusual in the crew's 
performance; no federal rules were broken, and the crew has cooperated 
completely with the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The union denied also that Martin disappeared after the crash. A USAir 
representative contacted Martin after the crash and told him to check into a 
Marriott hotel and stay there, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was unable to obtain a room at the Marriott, he went to the home of 
another pilot to rest and recuperate," the union's statement said. "There he 
remained in contact with the company, which knew his whereabouts at all times." 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said the cockpit crew's day began in Baltimore at 2:10 p.m., when the 
pair were scheduled to fly to La Guardia. Because of delays, the flight did not 
leave until 7:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the captain told investigators that Kleissas piloted the plane on 
the flight to La Guardia and his performance "suggested that he was obviously 
new . . . he missed some radio calls, radio checks." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot said that, when Flight 5050 prepared to leave La Guardia for 
Charlotte, N.C., later that night, Kleissas was at the controls. It was the 
first time Kleissas had piloted a Boeing 737-400 on takeoff on a regularly 
scheduled flight. 
</P>
<P>
David Shipley, a spokesman for the airline, said in response to questions being 
raised about Martin's piloting skills that the captain was "very experienced" 
at flying a Boeing 737A and that there was nothing negative in his record with 
USAir or with Piedmont Airlines, which merged with USAir earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said Martin has about 2,500 hours of experience in a 737. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Kleissas had only training in the Boeing 737, although Shipley 
said he was fully qualified to handle the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"All (our) pilots go through a training program," Shipley said. "No pilot is 
out there flying a plane with passengers in the back who has never flown that 
plane before." 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said it had not been determined whether Kleissas' inexperience 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, neither pilot followed proper procedure in calling out Flight 
5050's speed as it accelerated down the runway, Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking off, a cockpit crew normally calculates the plane's "V-1" speed. 
V-1 is the so-called point of no return, the speed at which the plane is going 
too fast, and is too far down the runway, to abort the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
V-1 on a given plane varies according to a number of factors, including load 
and runway length. According to the NTSB, the V-1 for Flight 5050 on Wednesday 
was 121 knots. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, the cockpit crew member not manning the controls on 
takeoff calls out "V-1" when the plane reaches V-1 speed, "V-R" when the plane 
reaches the speed to rotate into a nose-high attitude for liftoff and "V-2" 
when it reaches the speed at which it can safely climb out on one of its two 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation sources say there are a number of reasons why the abort attempt might 
have failed, including miscalculation of the V-1 speed, an inordinate delay 
before the abort attempt was initiated, brake failure and failure of the thrust 
reversers, which can be deployed to help slow the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers did report seeing plumes of spray, apparently 
indicating that the thrust reversers were deployed during the abort attempt.
