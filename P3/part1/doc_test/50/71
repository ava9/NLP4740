The World Indoor Track and Field Championships had a dazzling day as four world 
indoor records were broken Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
High jumper Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, 800-meter runner Paul Ereng of Kenya, 
women's 3,000-meter runner Elly Van Hulst of the Netherlands and women's 
3,000-meter walker Kerry Saxby of Australia had record-setting performances. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, the world outdoor record-holder, matched his outdoor world record 
with a leap of 7 feet, 11 1/2 inches on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Ereng, the gold medal winner at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, surprised himself with 
a sizzling finish in overtaking Jose Luis Barbosa of Brazil and winning the 800 
in 1 minute 44.84 seconds. Ereng, a University of Virginia sophomore, erased 
the record of 1:44.91 set by Britain's Sebastian Coe in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Van Hulst trimmed nearly six seconds off the women's 3,000 mark with a time of 
8:33.82. The previous record of 8:39.79 was set in 1986 by Zola Budd. 
</P>
<P>
Saxby won the women's walk in 12:01.65. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor cleared 7-11 1/2 outdoors last September in Spain, nine days before 
the start of the Olympics, but Cuba joined North Korea in boycotting the Games. 
</P>
<P>
So, even though he was ranked No. 1 in the world for 1988, Saturday was his 
first opportunity since the Games to prove that he could beat the world's best 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this world record very much, just as much as I wanted to win," 
Sotomayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The world records were only part of Saturday's outstanding performances. 
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey of Jamaica ran the second-fastest women's 200 with a time of 
22.34. She might have surpassed the world record of 22.27 set by East German 
Heike Drechsler in the 1987 world championships had she been seriously 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
The expected showdown in the men's shotput between Olympic champion Ulf 
Timmermann of East Germany and world record-holder Randy Barnes never 
materialized, although they finished in the same order as at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Timmermann led all the way to win his second consecutive world indoor title at 
71-4 1/4. Barnes had a poor series except for his final throw of 69-9 3/4 to 
finish second. Barnes set the world mark of 74-4 1/4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets Rodion Gataullin and Yevgeny Egorov, the Olympic silver and bronze 
medalists in the pole vault, finished first and second. Gataullin clinched the 
gold medal with a vault of 19-2 1/4, matching the meet record set by world 
record-holder and Olympic champion Sergei Bubka, also of the Soviet Union. 
Gataullin then missed three times at a world-record 19-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Romanian Doina Melinte repeated as women's 800-meter champion 
in a meet-record 2:04.79; West German Helga Arendt won the women's 400 in 
51.52, also a meet record, as Diane Dixon finished second in 51.77, breaking 
her U.S. record, and outdoor world record-holder Galina Chistyakova of the 
Soviet Union won the women's long jump at 22-10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The meets ends today with 11 finals.
