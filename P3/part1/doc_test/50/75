  [Text] A parade of the Armed forces, the police, prisons, 
and other security services and voluntary organizations took 
place in Accra this morning to mark the first anniversary of the 
Fourth Republic. The president, Flight- Lieutenant Jerry John 
Rawlings, took the salute at the parade. Addressing the 
ceremony, President Rawlings restated the commitment of the 
government to the cause of the nation. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] The government of the progressive 
alliance comprising the National Democratic Congress, the 
National Convention Party, and the Egle Party, is conscious of 
the record of achievements of the revolutionary decade that 
brought Ghana out of conditions of despair and hence our 
commitment to build on the gains that have been made. In 
rededicating ourselves to the task of nation-building today, we 
will be guided by the fact that at the end of the day, we will 
be judged not by the amount of political rhetoric we would have 
generated, but by the concrete and practical achievements we 
would have made in improving the quality of life of our people, 
especially those in the rural areas. 
  Countrymen and women, there is a time for political fanfare, 
there is a time for elections and there is a time for work -- 
for nation-building. Over a year has passed since the 
presidential and parliamentary elections were held. While some 
may already be setting their sights on 1996 and are dreaming 
about their ambitions, we must remember that there is a lot of 
hard work which needs doing now. No matter our political 
persuasions, we must cooperate with each other in ensuring the 
peaceful development of our nation. As a government, we 
recognize that democracy thrives in an atmosphere of tolerance. 
It is for this reason that the government continues to ignore 
the various acts of provocation orchestrated by some political 
interests. However, those amongst them who might be 
contemplating going beyond their ugly noises must take note that 
the government has a constitutional responsibility to maintain 
law and order. [end recording] 
  President Rawlings spoke against acts of provocation by some 
political interest groups. He also spoke about the need to 
foster national unity. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] Our individual and collective 
loyalties to our families, ethnic groups and political parties 
should not be allowed to divide us as a nation. We all have a 
responsibility to promote unity, stability, and development and 
to be actively involved in resolving situations which militate 
against this unity. Countrymen and women, as we commemorate the 
fifth anniversary of the inauguration of the Fourth Republic, we 
should more than ever before be mindful of the challenges that 
lie ahead. And it is only through our collective efforts that we 
can build an enduring foundation for national development. In 
the year ahead, let us have little less of the unproductive 
political rhetorics and a little more concerted and practical 
efforts in those areas which directly affect the lives of our 
people. Productivity, rural development, export promotion, the 
elimination of waste -- these are things which we can all 
contribute towards no matter our affiliations or opinions. 
These are the things which will make our nation competitive in 
the global economic context. 
  As we celebrate the first anniversary of the Fourth 
Republic, 
we must thank God for bringing us this far. We must enter the 
new year with renewed determination to strengthen the 
foundations of national unity, stability, and development. 
Noble countrymen and women, I wish to congratulate the 
contingents on parade for an excellent drill. I also wish once 
again to commend our officers and men in the Armed Forces, the 
police, and the security agencies as well as our various 
revolutionary organs and supporters for their diligence and 
dedication to national unity. I thank you and wish you all, 
once again, a happy anniversary and a happy new year. God be 
with you. [end recording]
