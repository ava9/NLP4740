  [Text] Moscow, May 12 (KCNA) -- A scientific symposium on 
the reunification of Korea was held here today. 
  Speeches were made on the subjects of "formation of 'two 
Koreas'", "present status of the Korean question and prospect of 
its settlement" and so on. 
  The speakers pointed out that the division of Korea, a 
product of the "cold war", was caused by the moves of big 
powers, the United States in particular. 
  They said that President Kim Il-song called a joint 
conference of political parties and public organizations in the 
North and the South of Korea to prevent the division of the 
country, initiated building a democratic unified state and later 
put forward the three principles of national reunification, the 
proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of 
Koryo and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation, thus opening a bright vista for the reunification of the 
country. 
  They noted that the proposal for reunification through 
confederacy and the 10-point programme, advanced by President 
Kim Il-song, are a reunification proposal acceptable to 
everybody because they reflect the will common to the nation, 
and the proposal and the programme are positively supported by 
the world's people as well as the Korean people. 
  Referring to the prospect of Korea's reunification, the 
speakers said Korea should be reunified by the Korean people 
themselves without outside interference. 
  They held that Korea must become one unified state.
