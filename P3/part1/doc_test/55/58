<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Supports Patriotic Initiative of Pomminnyon </F>
Overseas Headquarters" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) proposed that this year be made a 
"Year of Great National Unity" and called upon the North and 
South sides of Korea to launch a joint campaign in the North, 
South and overseas for the great unity of the whole nation. 
Supporting this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: This is a 
very timely and just patriotic initiative in view of the desire 
of the fellow countrymen for reunification and the domestic and 
foreign situation. 
  The Central Committee of the North side headquarters of 
Pomminnyon highly estimated the initiative as a good proposal, 
expressed full support to it and warmly welcomed it. 
  The reunification question of Korea is a question of 
terminating the domination and interference of outside forces 
and fully realizing the sovereignty of the Korean nation and 
achieving national unity; it is a nationwide cause which the 70 
million fellow countrymen at home and abroad should accomplish, 
united as one under the banner of the great unity of the whole 
nation. 
  Great national unity is the basic idea of Pomminnyon and 
reunification in the 90s is its noble duty to the nation. 
  The Pomminnyon organisations at home and abroad should 
jointly and energetically organize and conduct the patriotic 
movement for reunification to achieve great national unity by 
availing themselves of all possibilities and occasions and thus 
brilliantly adorn this significant year as a "Year of Great 
National Unity". 
  All the compatriots at home and abroad should frustrate the 
anti-national, anti-reunification reactionary offensive of the 
Kim Yong-sam group under the "civilian" veil and actively 
promote the great national unity in this course.
