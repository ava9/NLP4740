headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
group of traitors seeking confrontation and war against the 
desire of the nation for reunification will never get off 
scotfree, warns NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique last year 
viciously incited confrontation between the North and the South 
and tried to provoke a war, availing itself of the 
anti-socialist moves of the international reactionaries to 
stifle the DPRK, the author of the article says: 
  Upon the publication of the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation, we sent letters calling for 
reunification in the 1990s through concerted efforts of the 
nation to the authorities, representatives of the political 
parties and organisations and personages of all strata of South 
Korea. The South Korean puppets, however, did not convey the 
letters to the addressees, totally froze North-South dialogues 
which had continued during the preceding military dictatorship 
and barred a North-South reunification soccer game and a 
reunification concert. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group not only persistently opposed our 
sincere offers for promoting national harmony and unity but also 
resumed, in league with outside forces, the "Team Spirit" 
nuclear war exercises which had been suspended toward the end of 
the rule of the "sixth republic". After the "Team Spirit" 
nuclear war exercises, it staged war manoeuvres such as 
"Ssangyong", "Ulchi", "Ulchi Focus Lens", "Foal Eagle" and 
"Hwarang" in succession. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam in combat uniform of the puppet 
Army 
frequented frontline units and fields of military drill near the 
Military Demarcation Line, inciting confrontation and war. 
Worse still, he flew to the United States and entreated his 
masters to "exercise a powerful influence" and establish "an 
international cooperation system," crying over "suspicion of 
nuclear development" by the DPRK. 
  The whole nation clearly sees that with the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam left alone, harmony and unity between the North and the 
South cannot be achieved nor can peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country be realised but nconfrontation and 
war between the fellow countrymen will be inevitable. 
  The South Korean puppet clique will face a stern judgement 
by 
history and the people.
