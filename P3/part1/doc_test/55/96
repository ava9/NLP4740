  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), an organization of the movement for 
the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, reportedly 
held its presidium meeting in Tokyo recently and adopted a 
resolution to implement the program of the movement which had 
been agreed and decided on at a meeting of the joint presidium 
of Pomminnyon. 
  The resolution said the meeting discussed the issue of 
promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country by forming strong units based on great national unity to 
counter outside forces, the United States and Japan, and the 
South Korean puppet clique that are trying to make a dangerous 
adventure under the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue." 
  It called on all the regional headquarters overseas to 
actively take part in the movement of "10,000 people's 
declaration" with a view to strongly urging the United States to 
observe the conclusions reached at its talks with the DPRK, 
rallying the forces of the whole nation to smash Japan's scheme 
to become a military power and having the Korean Armistice 
Agreement replaced with a peace agreement. 
  The resolution also called for making efforts to 
successfully 
hold the fifth pan-national rally slated for this year as a 
great festival of the whole nation.
