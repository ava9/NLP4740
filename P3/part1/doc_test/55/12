  [Text] Pyongyang, February 16 (KCNA) -- A statement 
supporting the cause of Korean reunification was adopted on 
February 12 at the international seminar on the chuche idea for 
the independent development and coopertion of the world peoples 
held in Uganda. 
  Noting that "10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward 
by the great leader President Kim Il-song reflects the noble 
desire of the Korean people to achieve national reunification 
and prosperity by winning the unity of the whole nation, 
irrespective of the difference in ideology, idea and system, the 
statement said all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas 
who love the country and the nation set 1995 as the first year 
of Korean reunification. 
  It said the South Korean authorities are seeking dependence 
on outside forces and North-South confrontation, ignoring the 
desire of the whole nation for reunification. 
  Pointing out that the "nuclear problem" of Korea over which 
the United States and its lackeys are raising outcries is an 
offspring of the U.S. moves against socialist Korea, the 
statement said: 
  "It is the United States that raised the `suspicion of the 
North's nuclear arms development' and it is also the United 
States that iishthreatening the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  "The United States must know that pressure or threat have no 
effect on the Korean people and such a method cannot solve the 
problem but may bring the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  "It must look sqaurely at all the facts and act with 
discretion. 
  "We fully support the proposal advanced by the Workers' 
Party 
of Korea to reunify the country through confederacy based on one 
nation, one state, two systems and two governments in accordance 
with the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, considering it to be the 
most fair one. 
  "We also strongly demand that the nuclear issue on the 
Korean 
peninsula must be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks because it was 
caused by the deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea by 
the United States."
