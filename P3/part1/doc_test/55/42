  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
"minister of the unification board," in his "report" to Kim 
Yong-sam the traitor, threw together a balderdash about 
"possible changes" in the North, drivelling on "the permission 
of visit to the North" and "the reunion of families living 
separated in the North and the South". 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  For the South Korean puppets to talk about "changes" is a 
futile attempt to keep off the ever increasing influence of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea with their short tongues. 
  Changes are needed not in the North but in the South. 
  In the South there must be a change in such a manner as 
making the society independent after putting an end to the 
colonial enslavement policy and the flunkeyist and treacherous 
policy, as democratizing the society after liquidating the 
"civilian" fascist system and as checking the moves of 
confrontation and division and heading for national unity and 
reunification. [sentence as received] 
  The worldwide trend of change oriented to independence and 
democracy must reach South Korea. But the puppets are crying 
for "changes" in the North, ignoring this trend. This reveals 
their sinister intention to stifle our socialist system by 
bringing the "wave of liberalization" to the North. 
  The puppets blared that they would "actively promote the 
reunion of separated families." This was nothing but a 
hypocritical act to veil their anti-reunification nature, 
fooling the fellow countrymen's desire of reunification with the 
humanitarian issue. 
  If they have the least intention to lessen the sufferings of 
those families, they should, first of all, have stated that they 
would send POWs Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to their home towns so 
that they might spend their remaining years with their kinsmen. 
  The fellow countrymen who are making a vigorous march 
towards 
reunification in the '90s will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam 
group's treacherous acts seeking only confrontation and division 
against the trend of the time.
