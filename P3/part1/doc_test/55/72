<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Anticommunist Fascist </F>
Maniac's Colors, Which Have Been Exposed More Clearly"] 
  [Text] According to broadcast reports from Seoul, puppet 
traitor Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition 
Democratic Party, held talks at Chongwadae [presidential office] 
on 10 March. During the talks, they reportedly discussed the 
revision of the National Security Law, the suppression of human 
rights, the visit to the North by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and the 
reopening of the Uruguay Round negotiations. It was reported 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly said they were impossible. 
  This clearly shows his colors as a vicious fascist maniac, 
an 
anticommunist fanatic, and a national betrayer. This also is a 
vicious challenge to and a mockery of the South Korean people 
who demand that the Uruguay Round negotiations be reopened. 
  When the Democratic Party chairman demanded that the 
National 
Security Law be revised, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stubbornly 
insisted that it was impossible to abolish the National Security 
Law, while stating that someone else's ambition to communize 
South Korea had not changed. 
  The puppet traitor said that he could not abolish the 
National Security Law in a vicious attempt to maintain the 
vicious antireunification fascist law, pursue North-South 
confrontation, further step up his civilian fascist 
dictatorship, and, thus, brutally suppress the South Korean 
people's righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification. 
  As everyone knows, the National Security Law is a legacy of 
the era of the military fascist dictatorship that made 
anticommunism, North-South confrontation, and a fascist 
terrorist rule their undertakings. It is a vicious 
antinational, antireunification law that declares the fellow 
countrymen the enemy, negates reunification, blocks dialogue, 
and opposes improved North-South relations and an unprecedented 
vicious fascist law promulgated to suppress democratic forces 
for reunification, viciously trample people's democratic and 
human rights, and justify terrorist acts against and murders of 
political opponents. Therefore, South Korean people, human 
rights organizations of the world, and Amnesty International 
have strongly demanded that the National Security Law be 
abolished in South Korea. Moreover, even high-ranking U.S. 
authorities repeatedly confirmed that abolishing the National 
Security Law is the U.S. Government's official position and 
demanded that it be abolished. 
  Abolishing the notorious National Security Law in South 
Korea 
is the era's demand, which can no longer be delayed. 
Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam persistently opposed the 
abolition of the National Security Law. This again shows the 
bastard is a fascist tyrant and a vicious divisionist. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam stated the North's ambition to 
achieve reunification under communist terms is what prevents the 
abolition of the National Security Law. This is a shameless act 
of deceiving reality and is idle talk. 
  The reunification we advocate is a reunification under a 
confederal system based on great national unity. It is traitor 
Kim Yong-sam and his cohorts who oppose reunifying the country 
based on the principle of coexistence that neither side swallows 
or is swallowed by the other. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had inspired North-South 
confrontation and frantically prepared for war to harm its 
fellow countrymen and even babbled about an international 
cooperation system, made those remarks. This is preposterous. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam flatly rejected the visit to 
Pyongyang by Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, saying that 
it would not be good for him to visit the North. This is part 
of his criminal maneuvers to block national reconciliation and 
unity and inspire North-South confrontation. 
  During his New Year news conference, the Democratic Party 
chairman expressed worry about current North-South relations and 
expressed his intention to visit Pyongyang to help improve 
deadlocked North-South relations. At that time, we acknowledged 
this was a patriotic idea that anyone who worries about the 
destiny of the country and the nation should have and supported 
and welcomed it. 
  The government of our Republic proposed bilateral or 
multilateral negotiations among leading politicians in the North 
and South out of an earnest desire to promote great national 
unity and reunify the fatherland after transcending differences 
in ideas, ideology, and systems and has made sincere efforts to 
implement this proposal. For leading politicians of the North 
and South to gather and jointly probe ways to end the tense 
confrontation within the nation and open a new phase in peace in 
the country and its peaceful reunification is not 
disadvantageous, but beneficial to the fatherland's 
reunification. 
  Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam opposed the visit to the 
North by the Democratic Party chairman. This is designed to 
block multipronged North-South dialogue, monopolize North-South 
dialogue, and use it as a means to promote North-South 
confrontation just like the former dictators. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled it is impossible to 
reopen the Uruguay Round negotiations. This is intended to open 
the South Korean rice market at all costs. This is an act that 
can only be committed by the vicious toadyist nation-seller and 
top-class colonial running dog who does not hesitate to do what 
his masters ask him to do, regardless of the destiny of the 6 
million South Korean farmers and tens of millions of South 
Korean people. 
  All facts show traitor Kim Yong-sam is an unprecedented 
fascist tyrant, antireunification element, and treacherous 
traitor. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who pursues fascism, perpetual 
division, and treachery more frantically as time goes by, will 
not be able to escape from the people's harsh punishment. 
Traitor Kim Yong-sam must squarely see the growing 
antigovernment sentiment in South Korea and act with discretion 
and resign from power without delay before being subjected to 
the stern judgment of history.
