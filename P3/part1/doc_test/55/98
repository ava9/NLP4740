  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The International 
Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) 
published an appeal headlined "Let Us Launch a Vigorous 
Signature Campaign Supporting `10-Point Programme of the Great 
Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country'" 
on March 29. 
  The appeal says that the "10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" 
advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song in April last 
year is a great program of reunification which indicates to the 
Korean people a clear way for founding an independent, neutral, 
peaceful and non-aligned confederal state by their own efforts. 
  The appeal calls upon the committees for supporting Korea's 
reunification and organisations of friendship and solidarity 
with the Korean people in different countries to conduct a 
vigorous international signature campaign supporting the 
"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country".
