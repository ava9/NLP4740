  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- A memorial service 
for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for 
reunification of South Korea, was held in Pyongyang today. 
  Rev. Mun was a reputed patriotic champion for reunification 
who devoted his all to the struggle for the independence and 
democratisation of South Korean society and the reunification of 
the country. 
  Seen on the platform of the hall of the memorial service 
were 
a portrait of the deceased wearing black ribbons and wreaths 
from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, the Korean Christian Federation and other public 
organisations. 
  Present at the memorial service were Yang Hyong-sop, 
alternate Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the Supreme People's 
Assembly [SPA] and vice-chairman of the Committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], Chong Chun-ki, 
chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign 
Countries and vice-chairman of the CPRF, and other officials 
concerned. 
  Memorial addresses were made by Chairman of the North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomminnyon] Paek In-chun, director of the 
secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland Paek Nam-chun and member of the C.C., the North 
side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students 
for the Country's Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] Choe Yong-hui. 
  They said the life of the late Rev. Mun, the fallen patriot, 
was the life of an admirable paoriotic-minded person who devoted 
his all to the struggle for independence, democracy and 
reunification and the life of a reunification champion who made 
a breakthrough on the barrier of national division with the 
devotion of his whole body and who kindled a fierce flame of 
reunification in the hearts of the compatriots at home and 
abroad. His death is a big loss to our nation, they noted. 
  They recalled that the pastor hailed and supported the 
proposal for convening a North-South political consultative 
conference to discusy the confederacy formula of reunification 
which was put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song 
in his New Year address for 1989, visited Pyongyang in March 
that year and was received by the great leader, after which he 
renewed his patriotic faith and will for reunfication and, back 
in South Korea, he did not cease his struggle behind bars. 
  By refusing a Seoul trip of our mourners' group on the death 
of the late Mun, the South Korean authorities stripped 
themselves naked to the world, revealing their true color as 
fascist dictators and a group of barbarians who have totally 
thrown away human morality and the "civilian" mask, they said. 
  They stressed that, though the Rev. Mun passed away, his 
patriotic spirit for reunification will remain in the hearts of 
our people and the day of national reunification longed for by 
him will come certainly. 
  A poet Pak Se-ok recited a poem "To the Memory of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan" and people's actor Yi Tan read a poem written by the 
late Rev. Mun at the memorial service.
