<F P=106> ["National Conference Must Be Convened" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The present situation 
makes it incumbent upon our compatriots to come out without 
hesitation to the plaza of the national conference which will 
open a new chapter of national reconciliation and unity, 
irrespective of residence and job, if they to not want to fall a 
victim to big powers but really want the peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
article today. 
  The great unity of the nation is the best way out for all 
the fellow countrymen to remove the danger of a nuclear war 
facing the nation, defend the peace of the country and open a 
phase of turnround for its independent and peaceful 
reunification, the paper notes, and goes on: 
  All the fellow countrymen in the North and the South and 
overseas fully support the convocation of a national conference 
which will seek a short cut to reunification in the 90s by 
promoting the great unity of the nation and pooling the will and 
wisdom of the nation, surpassing differences in ideology, idea 
and political view. 
  But the Kim Yong-sam group, which dislikes the peace and 
peaceful reunification of the country, is desperately opposing 
our proposal for the convocation of a national conference 
unreasonably branding it as "united front tactics" and is 
cracking down with the bayonet upon the South Korean students, 
political parties and organisations and individual figures 
aspiring after the opening of the national conference. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group answered our proposal with its role 
of 
the shockbrigade in the "nuclear" row of the outside forces 
against the northern half of Korea, clamouring for "a tough 
response," "an international cooperation system" and "sanctions 
against the North." 
  This reveals the vicious plot to block the great unity of 
the 
nation by frustrating the convocation of the national conference 
at any cost and ignite a nuclear war against the North together 
with outside forces. This is an unpardonable criminal act which 
can be done only by such rare traitors and warmaniacs as the Kim 
Yong-sam group which takes no notice of the country and the 
nation, peace and peaceful reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to block the convocation 
of 
the national conference for national reconciliation and unity 
with sword-brandishing and war moves, but in vain. 
  Unshakable is the will of the 70 million fellow countrymen 
to 
convene the national conference and tide over the present 
difficulties and open the road of the country's peace and 
reunification.
