  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- Yu Mi-yong, 
chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu 
Party, issued a statement on January 5 supporting the policy of 
national reunification clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994. 
  "It is an intolerable national misfortune that our 
homogeneous nation who has glorified its 5,000 year long history 
with Tangun as its father is still living, divided into the 
North and South for nearly half a century, failing to remove the 
tragedy of national split forced on it by outside forces," she 
said, adding that the cause of national reunification must be 
achieved at an early date to meet the unanimous, ardent 
aspirations of the whole nation and hand down the reunified 
country to the posterity. 
  She pointed out that the South Korean authorities, however, 
ignoring the DPRK's magnanimous proposals and sincere efforts, 
have staged large-scale military exercises against the DPRK 
frequently in collusion with foreign forces and have been 
jeopardizing North-South relations by clamouring for "military 
counteraction" and an "international cooperation system" on the 
pretext of its "nuclear problem". 
  "This shows that the South Korean chief executive's 
`promise' 
to place the nation above anything else in the discussion of the 
reunification question was a sheer lie and that the present 
`regime' too is a flunkeyist, traitorous `regime', an 
anti-national fascist `regime' and a separatist `regime' that 
does not differ from the successive military dictatorial 
regimes," she said, and stressed: 
  "If the South Korean authorities really want a solution of 
the national reunification question, they must, though 
belatedly, stop their anti-national acts to harm and stifle the 
same fellow countrymen by dancing to the `nuclear' tune of 
outside forces and must turn to the stand of national 
independence, not hinder the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula from being solved fairly through DPRK-USA talks but 
join in the efforts to achieve national reconciliation and unity 
in response to our 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation."
