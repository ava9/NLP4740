  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- An enlarged meeting 
of the executive Committee of the International Liaison 
Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea [Cilreco] held in 
Paris on February 6 adopted an action programme for 1994. 
  The action programme manifested support to the proposal to 
reunify Korea in the form of confederacy which was advanced by 
the great leader President Kim Il-song and clarified its policy 
to dynamically conduct the international solidarity movement to 
realise the proposal for founding the democratic confederal 
republic of Koryo and the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. 
  It noted: 
  The primary task of the international liaison committee in 
its activities for 1994 is to check and frustrate the U.S. 
adventurous policy of strength against the DPRK and rouse 
widespread international opinion demanding a successful progress 
of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The formula of reunification through confederacy is the most 
realistic way of founding a unified state, independent and 
neutral, peaceful and non-aligned, leaving the two systems in 
the North and the South of Korea as they are, and achieving a 
genuine unity of the nation. 
  The international liaison committee will further strengthen 
the international solidarity movement with the Korean people in 
their struggle for the reunification of the country and rouse 
wide international opinion to urge the South Korean authorities 
to promote the great national unity with an independent stand. 
  It once again expresses full support to the proposal for 
founding the democratic confederal republic of Koryo and the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and 
decides it as its main task for its activities in 1994 to rouse 
widespread international opinion in favor of the proposal for 
reunification by means of confederacy. 
  With a view to making solidarity movement powerful in many 
countries of the world, it declares 1994 a "year of 
international solidarity for support to the reunification of 
Korea through confederacy". 
  While giving priority to the above-mentioned two points, it 
will dynamically conduct the solidarity movement for the final 
solution to the Korean issue. 
  It will make its utmost in its activities in 1994 to wage a 
powerful movement for demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. 
troops and nuclear weapons and other arms and equipment from 
South Korea, a perpetual end to all forms of provocative 
military exercises in the Korean peninsula, a termination of the 
U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the [words 
indistinct], replacement of the Korean armistice agreement of 
1953 with a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United 
States, urging the South Korean authorities to stop the 
suppression of the democratic figures fighting for independence, 
democracy and reunification, abrogate the notorious "national 
security law", release the imprisoned patriots and respect human 
rights, demanding the resumption of heart-to-heart North-South 
dialogue for the faithful implementation of the inter-Korean 
agreement and dismantlement of the concrete wall and supporting 
the establishment of a nuclear-free, peace zone on the Korean 
peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of 
Korea.
