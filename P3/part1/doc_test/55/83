  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  Our party and the Republic Government put forward the 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for 
national reunification through the united national strength last 
year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program. 
  Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow 
countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by 
transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and 
to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who 
has the long history of half a century. 
  We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the 
road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country. We also took the important measure 
for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders. 
However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our 
magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for 
reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon 
foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have 
taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to 
national unity. 
  While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises 
against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and 
talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an 
international cooperation system under the pretext of our 
nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading 
North-South relations to a dangerous phase. 
  The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in 
appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from 
the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and 
fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The 
South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and 
national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean 
people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer 
have any further expectations of the current South Korean 
regime. This is natural. 
  If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and 
its followers are babbling about, it is because of the 
antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States 
has persistently sought. 
  It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear 
issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula 
in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. 
talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United 
States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and 
may drive the situation to a deadlock. The United States should 
look straight at all facts and act with discretion. 
  Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement 
the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved. 
  There is no change in the principle and line of our party 
and 
the Republic Government for national reunification. We will 
make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means 
of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems, 
and two governments according to the three-point principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national 
unity. [passage omitted]
