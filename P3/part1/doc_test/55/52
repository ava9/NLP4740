  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The 70 million 
fellow countrymen, who love the country and the nation and hope 
for national reunification, must vigorously wage the common 
struggle of the nation to overthrow the anti-national, 
anti-democratic and anti- reunification Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime and establish a genuine government, independent and 
democratic. 
  This call was made by the Central Committee of the 
Democratic 
Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in its appeal to 
the compatriots at home and abroad Friday to launch a nationwide 
noble struggle for settling scores with the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique for its monstrous crimes against the country 
and the nation in the last one year and overthrow this 
despicable group. 
  Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam recently decided to 
allow the United States to deploy Patriot missiles and attack 
helicopters in South Korea and invited infamous U.S. state 
intelligence agents to South Korea, offering the land as an 
intelligence base of the U.S. imperialists directed against the 
North, the appeal said: 
  The traitor signed the treacherous "special agreement" for 
largely increasing South Korea's burden share for the 
maintenance of the U.S. troops in South Korea and induced the 
United States to pigeonhole the "program of the phased reduction 
of the U.S. troops." He is really a pro-U.S. traitor who has 
totally opened the rice market to U.S. surplus agricultural 
products. 
  Branding the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a "civilian" fascist 
overshadowing his predecessors, the appeal said his clique has 
turned down with violence the South Korean workers' demand for 
wage hike and the means of suppression has become all the 
craftier and harsher. 
  Saying the traitor is a most despicable national separatist 
and warmaniac, it said: 
  He has stalled all the North-South dialogues, which had been 
held even in the period of the "fifth and sixth republics" and 
has staged such joint military manoeuvres with the United States 
as "Team Spirit," "Ulchi Focus Lens" and "Kfoal" "Agpe" [names 
as received] and other war games, crying for a "military 
reaction", to the north. 
  The one year hkoverebvby the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is a 
year of pro-7 [as received] pro-Japanese flunkeyist treachery 
and "civilian" fascism and a year of crimes and disgrace run 
through with confrontation, division and war moves. It has 
become all the more obvious that with him left alone, neither 
the independence and democratisation of the South Korean society 
nor the peace and peaceful reunification of the country can be 
expected. 
  Today the attitude towards the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is 
a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery. And 
whether one joins in the anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle or not is a 
yardstick showing whether he wants independence and democracy of 
the South Korean society and peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country, or not. 
  All the Koreans, whether they be in the North or South or 
abroad and whether they be communists or nationalists, must 
unite with each other [words indistinct] nation and invigorate 
the struggle for national reunification, regarding the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation as a common 
guideline of the nation.
