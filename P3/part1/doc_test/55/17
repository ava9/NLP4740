  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a 
patriotic champion of reunification who had been active in South 
Korea for a long time for the reunification of the country and 
the democratization of the society, died, to our regret, on 
January 18 at the age of 76. 
  He devotedly struggled in South Korea for independence and 
democratization of the society and for the reunification of the 
country. 
  He, who started the activities for democracy in 1974 as a 
member of the Council of Literary Men for the Practice of 
Freedom, worked out the "March 1 Declaration for Democracy and 
National Salvation" against the "Yusin" fascist dictatorship in 
1976. And in 1979, he, active as the chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the National Alliance for Democracy and 
Reunification, continued the struggle on the street and behind 
bars, opposing the seizure of power by the "fifth republic" 
military fascist clique and denouncing the barbarities of the 
United States in the Kwangju popular uprising. 
  He was arrested and imprisoned more than once because he 
urged the U.S. troops pullout, the obstacle to the country's 
reunification, and called for the establishment of a democratic 
government, the conclusion of a peace agreement, reunification 
through confederacy, etc. 
  He was active as the chairman of the National Congress for 
Democracy and Unification, the co-chairman of the National 
Liaison Organization for Democracy, the chairman of the United 
People's Movement for Democracy and Unification (Mintongnyon) 
and advisor to the Coalition for National Democratic Movement 
(Chonminnyon) in the period from 1984 to 1989. 
  He participated in the "World Conference for Peace and 
Reunification of the Korean Peninsula" in 1988 and called for 
the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace 
agreement and the denuclearization of the peninsula. 
  He supported the proposal advanced by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1989 for the 
convocation of a North-South political consultative meeting to 
discuss the way of reunifying the country through confederacy. 
And he visited Pyongyang at the risk of his life in late March 
that year. 
  While in Pyongyang, he was received by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of 
national reunification, and renewed his strong faith and will 
for reunification. 
  As the advisor to Chonminnyon, he held talks with officials 
of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, agreed to the removal of the political and military 
confrontation between the North and the South, the replacement 
of the armistice agreement between the DPRK and the United 
States with a peace agreement, the adoption of a nonaggression 
declaration between the North and the South, reunification 
through confederacy, etc. and published a joint statement. 
  Back to South Korea, he was arrested and jailed by the 
fascists. But he continued the struggle for independence, 
democracy and reunification. Working as the chairman of the 
preparatory committee for the inauguration of the South side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) from 1991, he made strenuous efforts 
for national unity and peaceful reunification. 
  Though the old man had become weak because of many years' 
imprisonment, he admirably fought to the last moment of his life 
for the patriotic cause of reunification. 
  Although Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, who fought for independence and 
democratization of the South Korean society and for peaceful 
reunification of the country, passed away, his desire will be 
surely realised by the South Korean people and students and his 
patriotic spirit for reunification will always remain in the 
memory of the Koreans at home and abroad.
