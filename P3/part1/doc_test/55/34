  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Chong Sin-hyok, 
vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, in a statement January 6 said that to found a 
pan-national unified state through a confederacy on the basis of 
the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and 
great national unity as clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994 is the most fair 
and feasible way of reunification which fully conforms to the 
will and interests of the nation. 
  "If our nation who has lived as a homogeneous one for more 
than 5,000 years from the days of Tangun unites firmly as one 
under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of 
the whole nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea, 
political view and religious belief, it can found the 
pan-national unified state without difficulty while leaving the 
two systems and two governments existing in the North and South 
as they are," he said, and stressed: 
  "The present South Korean authorities, however, broke off 
all 
the dialogues of both governmental and nongovernmental level 
between the North and South which had been held even in the days 
of the preceding military fascist 'regimes', saying they 'cannot 
shake hands with the partner possessed of nuclear weapons', and 
did not hesitate to commit such a treacherous act as trampling 
upon the historical North-South agreement and joint declaration 
on denuclearization which had already been adopted and brought 
into effect, like sheets of waste paper. 
  "What our nation wants is national reconciliation and unity, 
not confrontation and war. 
  "All the Koreans in the North, in the South and abroad 
should 
turn out more vigorously in the struggle for national 
reunification."
