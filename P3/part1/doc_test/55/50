<F P=106> ["Korean Residents in Russia Protest Forcible Migration" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- An organization of 
Korean nationals in Russia sent a protest message respectively 
to the Japanese and South Korean Consulates General in Russia 
denouncing the South Korean traitorous clique and the Japanese 
reactionaries for scheming to drag Korean residents in Sakhalin 
into South Korea. 
  The message says the South Korean puppet authorities are 
hell 
bent on the deceptive propaganda to bring over fellow countrymen 
in Sakhalin, acting in the guise of "humanitarianism", in an 
insidious attempt to lay an anti-DPRK "foundation" in the Far 
Eastern region by winning them over and foment discord and 
consciousness of confrontation within the nation and thereby 
perpetuate division of the country and block the compatriots 
from advancing toward national reunification. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce at once their 
anti- national, anti-reunification scheme to settle the issue of 
Korean residents in Sakhalin and other regions of the former 
Soviet Union with some money through conspiracy and tieup with 
the Japanese Government, and the Japanese authorities must no 
longer do acts obstructive to an independent reunification of 
Korea, it demands.
