<F P=106> ["CPRF Exposes Crimes of Traitor Kim Yong-sam in His First </F>
Year in Power" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The Committee for 
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] released an 
indictment Thursday exposing the crimes committed by the traitor 
Kim Yong-sam in his first year in power. 
  The indictment, citing detailed materials, roundly exposes 
the fact that he has resorted to flunkeyist treacheries, fascist 
dictatorship, schemes to perpetuate the division of the country 
and war moves in a more crafty and vicious way than the 
preceding military fascist dictators in last one year after he 
came to power under the "civilian" mask. 
  According to the indictment, it is one of the blackest 
crimes 
he committed during the year that he has impaired and sold off 
the interests of the country and the nation, persistently 
pursuing the flunkeyist and treacherous policy. 
  In his "inaugural address" he said that no allies "can be 
better than the nation." No sooner had he held all the strings 
of power, however, than he left South Korea lock, stock and 
barrel as an aggressive military base of the United States, 
opened the domestic rice market to the United States and turned 
South Korea into a market of Japanese goods. 
  Worse still, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to Seoul in November last year and told him that the 
issue of "comfort women for the army" and other monstrous crimes 
committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people 
in the past should be buried in oblivion and South Korea and 
Japan should develop new "relations" and flung open the door to 
Japan for its economic comeback to South Korea. 
  Since he took office, the traitor has stooped to any infamy 
in his efforts to "isolate and reject" the North in the 
international arena, rehearsing the rumor about "the North's 
nuclear arms development" spread by the imperialist 
reactionaries. 
  Another blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam group is that it 
has harshly suppressed the just, patriotic struggle of the South 
Korean students and people for independence, democracy and 
reunification, reducing South Korea to a theatre of fascist 
rowdyism, a waste land of the nation and a graveyard of human 
rights. 
  The group has kept intact all the legal and institutional 
mechanisms such as the "National Security Law," the "Security 
Planning Board" and the "secret affairs command," which the 
preceding military fascist regimes regarded as the foundations 
for their existence. It has bloodily suppressed the struggle of 
the South Korean people by dint of them. 
  By October last year the fascist clique had imprisoned more 
than 200 students and intellectuals by invoking the "National 
Security Law." This number is 2.5 times that in the 
corresponding months of the early period of the power of the No 
Tae-u puppet clique. 
  Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's 
suppression has become all the more outrageous. 
  In early February when peasants and students demonstrated to 
protect the farm market, the puppet clique brutally suppressed 
them with the mobilization of more than 15,000-strong riot 
police of 130 companies and arrested no fewer than 400 of them, 
branding their patriotic struggle as "violence." 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a thorough-paced 
anti-reunification element who has driven the North-South 
relations from bad to worse and opposed peaceful reunification 
of the country. 
  Even after he received the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation sent by the North, he, turning down 
the magnanimous proposal of the North for reconciliation and 
unity, has totally frozen inter-Korean high-level talks and 
foiled the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South. He also perpetrated such inhuman and anti-reunification 
criminal acts as blocking the Seoul trip of a mourners' group of 
the North to participate in the funeral of the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan 
in January and not allowing a Panmunjom contact between 
delegates of the chondoists of the North and the South for the 
joint commemoration of the centenary of the peasants' war in 
1894. 
  The anti-reunification nature of the traitor was graphically 
illustrated by the fact that he brought forward a "three-stage 
unification formula" based on "institutional unification" which 
may foster confrontation and spark off a war between the fellow 
countrymen, motivated by the "concept of uselessness of 
unification" the keypoint of which is that "unification which 
fails to ensure liberal democracy and market economy is no 
better than division." 
  It is an intolerable high treason that after taking power, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has zealously schemed to provoke 
a war against the fellow countrymen in the North, following 
outside forces. 
  From the beginning of the year, the puppet clique has staged 
war exercises with the United States against the North, 
increasing military tension. It openly stated that if the "Team 
Spirit" nuclear war exercises were suspended this year, joint 
military manoeuvres equivalent to them in scale would be staged 
in August. 
  Getting off into war hysterics, the Kim Yong-sam group has 
brought into South Korea various types of military equipment 
including ground-to-ground missiles and fighter planes of next 
generation by increasing military expenditures. It has also put 
spurs on nuclear arms development, openly claiming that "nuclear 
right must be secured." In actuality, such comprador 
enterprises of South Korea as the Chang Won Machines, the 
Nuclear Fuel Corporation, Ltd. the nuclear fuel plastic 
processing factory and the Atomic Energy Technology Corporation, 
Ltd. have separately manufactured in secrecy accessories and 
materials necessary for nuclear bombs, labelled as ordinary 
goods or with ciphers. 
  The facts clearly show that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
wearing the "civilian" veil left intact, neither national 
reconciliation and unity, nor the reunification in the '90s 
which the whole nation eagerly hopes for, nor the independence 
and democratization of the South Korean society can be achieved 
and only the confrontation will be fostered and war caused 
between the fellow countrymen.
