<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Puppet Regime Must Be Overthrown" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today declares that the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime opposed to the nation, democracy and reunification must 
be overthrown. 
  Though less than one year has passed since the self-styled 
"civilian" regime of the traitor Kim Yong-sam made its 
appearance, its treacherous nature has been fully laid bare, the 
article says, and continues: 
  The regime of Kim Yong-sam is a more anti-national, 
flunkeyist and treacherous colonial puppet regime than any of 
the preceding regimes. 
  There has been not a South Korean ruler who did not beg for 
the presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea, but there has 
never been such a ruler who has begged for the permanent 
occupation of the U.S. troops with a promise to pay more than 3 
billion dollars squeezed from the people for their maintenance. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam has opened the South Korean rice 
market, yielding to the U.S. pressure, which the preceding 
traitors had not dared to do. This is the biggest treachery. 
  His first-year record in power is really criminal and 
treacherous because he has tried not only to do harm to the 
South Korean people but to slay the fellow countrymen in the 
North, obeying foreign forces. 
  Among the successive South Korean rulers there were those 
who 
busied themselves in isolating the North but there was no such 
a traitor as Kim Yong-sam who is rushing about in the East and 
West, crying for "sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in 
the North. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam has inflicted bigger sufferings 
upon 
the people with a "civilian" fascist repressive rule more 
truculent than the military fascist dictatorship of the "Fifth 
and Sixth Republics", while advertising "civilian 
administration" and "reform politics". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced 
the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding 
military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist 
dictatorial rule against the people. 
  Its anti-national and anti-democratic fascist repressive 
rule 
is the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a "civilian 
fascist" outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes. 
  It is the blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam "regime" that 
it 
has totally prohibited the dialogues, contacts and visits, 
seeking North-South confrontation rather than national unity. 
  The "civilian" treacherous group hay intentionally rendered 
the situation strained with the resumption of the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises suspended in the waning days of the 
"Sixth Republic's regime", the freeze all North-South dialogues 
including the North-South high level talks and foil the exchange 
of presidential envoys between the North and South. 
  The "civilian" rulers have not only frozen the dialogues 
between the authorities but also banned non-governmental 
dialogues and contacts. 
  The puppets are now inciting the North-South confrontation 
continuously while seeking a reckless war in league with outside 
forces to slay their fellow countrymen in the North. 
  Leaving intact such a most anti-national flunkeyist regime, 
a 
most anti-democratic fascist regime and a most 
anti-reunification and divisive regime as the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet regime, it is impossible to realize national 
independence, democratization of the South Korean society and 
national reunification.
