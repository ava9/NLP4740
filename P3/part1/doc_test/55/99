<F P=106> ["Destiny of Motherland and Nation, Destiny of All Koreans </F>
at Home and Abroad" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in a signed article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
as saying in his New Year address: 
  "The destiny of our motherland is immediately the destiny of 
our nation, as well as the destiny of our compatriots at home 
and abroad." 
  This teaching serves as a highly important guideline 
elucidating the ground and necessity for the entire compatriots 
in the North and the South and overseas to launch a nation-wide 
struggle for national reunification, rallied under the banner of 
the great unity of the whole nation, the article notes, and goes 
on: 
  The destiny of our motherland is immediately the destiny of 
our nation, as well as the destiny of the entire nation, because 
the independence of the country and the nation is a prerequisite 
to realizing the independence of the popular masses and the 
struggle for the independence of the country and the nation is 
immediately the struggle for independence of the popular masses. 
  As the life of everybody, a member of the nation, belongs to 
the life of the country and the nation, the independence of the 
country and the nation makes it possible to realize the 
independence of individuals. 
  The popular masses can successfuly carve out their destiny 
in 
conformity with their desire and demand only when the 
independence of the country and the nation is realized. 
  Independence of South Korea and the independent 
reunification 
of the country, this is the way for the complete realization of 
national independence in our country. 
  The destiny of our nation is closely linked with national 
reunification. 
  The reunification of our country is not a matter of ideology 
and system but a matter of national character as the matter of 
putting an end to the domination and interference of outside 
forces, completely realizing the sovereignty of the Korean 
nation and achieving national unity. 
  The entire compatriots at home and abroad should unite with 
one will to defend the independence of the country and the 
nation with their lives, linking their destiny with the destiny 
of the motherland and the nation. 
  Our fellow countrymen, who have lived for over 5,000 years 
as 
a homogeneous nation with tan gun as its father, are able to 
build a united state of the whole nation by means of 
confederation that can promote coexistence and co-prosperity, 
leaving the present two systems and two governments in the North 
and the South intact if they pool their wisdom and strength, 
giving precedence to national ideal. 
  The entire compatriots in the North and the South and abroad 
should unite as one, transcending the differences of idea and 
ideal, political views and religious belief under the banner of 
the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation 
and vigorously struggle to found a united state of the whole 
nation by means of confederation.
