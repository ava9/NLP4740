  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Romesh Chandra, 
honorary president of the World Peace Council [WPC], in an 
interview with the KCNA correspondent in India on April 9 said 
that the grave danger of nuclear war created by the United 
States on the Korean peninsula is a serious challenge to the 
Korean people and peaceloving forces of the world desirous of 
peace on the Korean peninsula and its reunification. 
  In order to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula and its 
reunification, he stated, the United States must discard its 
anachronistic policy of stifling the DPRK and approach the 
DPRK-USA talks with sincerity. 
  It must, above all, withdraw its nuclear and other mass 
destruction weapons and troops from South Korea and stop all the 
war games, he said, adding: 
  Korea must be reunified by founding the democratic 
confederal 
republic of Koryo according to the "10-point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country" advanced by the great leader His Excellency President 
Kim Il-song.
