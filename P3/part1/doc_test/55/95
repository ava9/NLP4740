  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting was 
held today upon the lapse of 68 years since the June 10 
anti-Japanese independence movement. 
  The movement in 1926 powerfully demonstrated worldwide the 
indomitable will and patriotic spirit of the Korean people not 
to allow the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and 
colonial rule. It dealt a heavy blow at the colonial rule of 
the aggressors. 
  Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central 
Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland, said in his report: "Though half a century has 
passed since Korea was liberated from the Japanese imperialist 
colonial rule, the dignity and sovereignty of the nation is 
still ruthlessly trampled upon and the people are denied even 
the elementary democratic rights and vital rights in South Korea 
under the occupation of the U.S. forces." 
  Noting that the U.S. imperialists are intentionally 
rendering 
the situation of the Korean peninsula strained, threatening the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea by inventing "the 
suspicion of nuclear arms development by North Korea," the 
reporter said: 
  "The United Nations Security Council issued an unjustifiable 
`presidential statement' and is threatening `sanctions.' This 
clearly shows what brigandish method the U.S.-bossed imperialist 
allied forces are resorting to in an attempt to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK." 
  The reporter charged that the Japanese authorities, far from 
apologizing and compensating for the shocking crimes committed 
by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the 
past, are trying to take economic sanctions against the DPRK and 
put military pressure on it. 
  "The Japanese authorities are accelerating their own nuclear 
arms development and nuclear armament, while raising a hue and 
cry over our `nuclear issue,' and worse still, perpetrating 
vicious acts against our Republic and the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)," he said. 
  He said that the United States must withdraw its troops of 
aggression and nuclear weapons from South Korea and immediately 
respond to the proposal of the DPRK for a new peace arrangement. 
And he demanded that the Japanese reactionaries refrain from 
joining the U.S. imperialists in their plot of a nuclear war 
against the Korean people, promptly stop suppression of 
Chongnyon, apologize for it and renounce their hostile policy 
against the DPRK. 
  The reporter called on all the Koreans in the North, South 
and overseas to rise up as one in the nationwide struggle to 
reunify the country through confederacy with the great unity of 
the whole nation under the banner of "10-Point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country", irrespective of ideology, religious belief, political 
grouping, class, stratum and property status, thus opening a new 
phase of national reunification this year.
