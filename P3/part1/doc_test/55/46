<F P=106> ["Abolition of `National Security Law' Is Demand of Times " </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today urges that the Kim Yong-sam traitorous 
clique should look squarely at the trend of the times and scrap 
the ill-famed "National Security Law [NSL]" without delay as 
demanded by the people at home and abroad. 
  The "NSL" in South Korea is an anti-communist fascist law of 
the worst kind in history, the article says, and goes on: 
  It is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law that 
defines the same fellow countrymen as the enemy and totally 
denies national unity. It is a fascist law that most ruthlessly 
tramples and cracks down upon the people's desire for 
independence, democracy and reunification in South Korea. 
  The "NSL" defines all the organizations and population of 
the 
northern half of the country, the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and all the 
progressive overseas Koreans living in different parts of the 
world as "anti-state organizations" and "members of anti-state 
organizations" and regards them as objects of "punishment". 
  It is a crime and a disgrace of the nation to have such 
anti-national, anti-reunification evil law like the "NSL" that 
denies the same fellow countrymen. 
  Terrorism, murders, unwarranted arrests and killing tortures 
against dissident political forces and guiltless people 
committed by fascist dictators in South Korea up until now were 
"legalized" as a whole under the notorious "National Security 
Law". 
  Unless the ill-famed "NSL" is abolished in South Korea, the 
independence and democratization of society cannot be realized, 
nor can the reunification of the country be achieved, nor can 
human rights abuses be uprooted in South Korea. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors, however, are intending 
to maintain the notorious "NSL" in a bid to incite North-South 
confrontation and block the reunification of the country and to 
further strengthen their "civilian" fascist rule in South Korea. 
Kim Yong-sam is, indeed, a traitor to the nation who is pursuing 
the treacherous policy against the nation, reunification and 
democracy more maliciously than any preceding dictators of the 
successive military dictatorial "regimes" did in South Korea.
