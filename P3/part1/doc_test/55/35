Countrymen and Depending on Outside Forces"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with an article denouncing the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique for sticking to the policy of thinking more of outside 
forces than of fellow countrymen and depending on those forces, 
while ignoring the priniciple of national independence, the 
basic principle in the settlement of the reunification question. 
  The author of the article says: 
  Kim Yong-sam, taking office, said that no outside forces 
could "be better than the nation." This was, however, an empty 
talk to cheat and flout the people. 
  This is proved, first of all, by the fact that his clique 
intends to leave South Korea under foreign domination and yoke 
indefinitely, begging of outside forces "protection" and 
"security assistance." 
  Whenever the traitor Kim Yong-sam met with his U.S. master, 
he implored for a permanent U.S. military occupation of South 
Korea, saying that U.S. troops must not be withdrawn from there. 
He even committed himself to a greater burden share for the 
maintenance of the aggressor forces in return for the shelving 
of the "U.S. troop cutback plan." 
  His clique describes the U.S. troops present in South Korea 
as "a war deterrent" and extols them as "apostles of peace." 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's dependence on outside 
forces 
finds another graphic expression in the fact that it is seeking 
North-South confrontation in collusion with outside forces while 
refusing to join hands with fellow countrymen who call for a 
solution of the problem of peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country with the concerted effort of the nation. 
  On the pretext of the "nuclear problem" of the North, the 
Kim 
Yong-sam puppet government broke up the North-South dialogue and 
exchange which had taken place under the "fifth and sixth 
republics". 
  It frequently staged large-scale nuclear war exercises 
including the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in an attempt 
to put the brake on the progress of the DPRK-USA talks for the 
solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
Especially, the puppets ran amok to establish an "international 
cooperation system" and have "sanctions" taken against fellow 
countrymen. 
  For the establishment of the "international cooperation 
system," they even opened the rice market of South Korea to the 
U.S. master, wiped off the slate Japanese imperialists' crimes 
in their invasion of Korea in the past and defended Japan's 
nuclear armament and overseas expansion. 
  With this traitorous "government" and traitor left intact in 
South Korea, national unity and peaceful reunification are 
impossible and the nation inevitably falls a victim to outside 
forces. 
  The South Korean people will never tolerate the traitorous 
"government" of Kim Yong-sam turning the back on the nation and 
depending on outside forces.
