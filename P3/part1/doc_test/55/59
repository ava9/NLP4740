  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
people of all strata who truly want independence, democracy, 
peace and reunification must unite with each other, irrespective 
of ideology, political view, religious belief and property 
status, transcending their party interests and strategies, and 
their genealogy and affiliation, to fight the colonial fascist 
forces, the common target of struggle, stresses NODONG SINMUN in 
a by-lined article today. 
  The cause of independence and democracy in South Korea and 
national reunification is a showdown between the national forces 
for independence and the aggressive forces and between the 
patriotic forces for reunification and democracy and the fascist 
forces for division and it requires the unity of all the 
champions of independence, democracy and reunification, the 
paper says, and goes on: 
  There is no reason that the forces for independence, 
democracy and reunification cannot achieve [word indistinct] 
Korea. Workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, urban 
dwellers, national capitalists and many other people are 
suffering under the colonial fascist rule in South Korea. The 
people, except the narrow privileged circles, cannot defend 
their vital interests unless the colonial fascist rule is 
liquidated. This is an objective condition under which South 
Korean people of various social strata can closely unite with 
each other under the slogan of independence, democracy and 
reunification. 
  All the South Korean forces for independence, democracy and 
reunification oppose the colonial fascist rule and hope for the 
establishment of an independent, democratic government. 
  It is a lawful demand in accomplishing the cause of 
independence, democracy and reunification that the South Korean 
people launch an all-people common struggle, irrespective of 
their isms and principles and their party, political and 
religious groupings. 
  It is important in developing the mass struggle for 
independence, democracy and reunification to strengthen the 
political struggle of the workers and peasants, while closely 
combining it with the students' movement for political freedom 
and democracy and waging a common struggle with all other 
classes and circles interested in it. 
  The South Korean patriotic forces for independence, 
democracy 
and reunification must, for the present, vigorously wage a 
massive common struggle to put an end to the domination, 
interference and pressure by outside forces and smash the 
treacheries, suppression, nonfrontationist [word as received] 
and divisive moves of the "civilian" fascist forces and head for 
the formation of a united front. 
  This is the way of rejecting the domination and interference 
by outside forces, destroying the fascist dictatorial forces and 
winning independence, democracy and reunification. 
  The South Korean people's righteous struggle for the three 
goals will surely emerge victorious.
