<F P=106> ["Present System of South Korea is Anti-national System of </F>
Confrontation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The confrontation 
atmosphere persists on the Korean peninsula because the 
traitorous Kim Yong-sam group of South Korea under the 
"civilian" veil is committing anti-national, anti-reunification 
crimes, says NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  The author of the article notes: 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group truly wanted national 
reconciliation and unity and reunification, it, first of all, 
must have reformed the anti-national, anti-reunification ruling 
system set up by the successive military dictatorial "regimes" 
in South Korea. By invoking the "National Security Law" the 
successive rulers of South Korea barred travel and contact 
between North and South, blocked national reconciliation and 
unity and tied fast the patriotic pro-reunification democratic 
figures in South Korea who hoped for reconciliation and unity 
with the North and harshly persecuted them, incriminating their 
slightest move. 
  It is preposterous to talk about reunification, while 
leaving 
intact in South Korea the confrontation system with legal and 
institutional mechanisms which totally negate and block national 
reconciliation, unity and reunification itself. Nevertheless, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, while advertising "reform", is 
keeping the whole of the anti-communist confrontation system of 
the successive military dictatorial "regimes." 
  Worse still the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is on the run day 
in and day out to beat fellow countrymen on the back with the 
help of outside forces, crying for "international cooperation 
system" and "sanctions" over the "nuclear problem". 
  The anti-national acts of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique 
strip bare the anti-national color of the "civilian government" 
pursuing North-South confrontation. 
  As long as the treacherous North-South confrontation system 
against national reconciliation and unity is kept in South Korea 
and such a separatist as the traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone, 
it is only too clear that one grave obstacle after another will 
be laid in the way of the struggle for a great unity of our 
nation and national reunification. 
  The situation gives a serious lesson that the South Korean 
people and democratic forces must not place hope on the 
"civilian government" but smash the anti-reunification moves of 
the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique with a massive struggle.
