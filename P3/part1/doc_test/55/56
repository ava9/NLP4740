  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean 
puppets staged a trial on February 21, wielding the `National 
Security Law' and cried that the North, though it is a 
`dialogue partner,' is `an anti-state organisation' in every 
respect. It is a mockery of and insult to the North," says the 
Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland [CPRF] in its Information No. 644 published 
Thursday. 
  It notes: 
  "As for the `National Security Law' in which the South 
Korean puppets define the North as `an anti-state organisation', 
it is an anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law which 
should have been thrown into the dust bin of history long ago. 
  "We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the 
South 
Korean puppets made the rude remarks blatantly getting on our 
nerves when they were talking about the resumption of the 
North-South dialogue. 
  "Entirely attributable to the South Korean authorities' 
dishonest stance of dialogue is the grave situation in which the 
North-South agreement and the joint declaration on 
denuclearization have not been implemented and all dialogues 
between the North and South have been totally broken up. 
  "If the South Korean authorities truly want the improvement 
of the North-South relations and dialogue, they must change the 
confrontation policy into a reconciliation policy and abolish 
the fascist `National Security Law' against the nation and 
reunification."
