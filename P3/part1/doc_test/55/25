<F P=106> ["`National Security Law' Must Be Scrapped" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today urges the abolition of the ill-famed "National 
Security Law" [NSL] in South Korea, saying it is natural that 
voices calling for the abolition of the anti-reunification 
fascist law are growing louder after the United States recently 
manifested its official position that the "NSL" must be repealed. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The "NSL" is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law 
that denies reunification, blocks dialogue and opposes 
improvement of North-South relations. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet group, however, is trying hard to 
avoid repealing the "NSL", turning a deaf ear to the strong 
demand of the people at home and abroad. This vividly reveals 
its despicable intention to maintain the notorious "NSL" and 
continue seeking North-South confrontation and further 
strengthen the "civilian" fascist dictatorship. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors said they would 
"reexamine" the question of repealing the "NSL" when 
"North-South relations have been improved", while maintaining 
such anti-reunification evil law as the "NSL" and putting the 
brakes on dialogue and reunification in every way. This 
virtually means that they do not intend to scrap the "NSL". 
  The ill-famed "NSL" in South Korea must be scrapped without 
delay. Otherwise, the "civilian" regime will inevitably bump 
into stronger protests of the people and meet its disgraceful 
end.
