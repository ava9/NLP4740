  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet defence minister, Yi Pyong-tae, reportedly told "a 
ceremony for the commencement of the work this year" on January 
3 that "the army, navy and air force should maintain a strong 
combat posture in the new year, too." 
  Yi Yong-ho, "chairman of the joint chiefs of staff", too, 
let 
out a war hokum that day, saying "the military posture should be 
rounded off to counter the North's threat of war" and "a posture 
of prompt counteraction" should be established. 
  Such belligerent remarks of the puppet army brass hats from 
the beginning of the year blatantly revealed their scheme of 
armed confrontation with the North and they were an intolerable 
grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who aspire to peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  As everyone knows, the DPRK has advanced the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation which is 
acceptable to anyone who wants great national unity and 
reunification and a proposal to exchange special envoys in order 
to discuss and solve the pending issues between the North and 
the South, and has made all sincere efforts to carry them into 
effect. 
  The South Korean puppet clique, however, ignoring them, has 
resorted to anti-DPRK intrigues, vociferating about "military 
counteraction" on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear 
problem" of the North. And this time the puppet clique again 
made provocative outbursts. 
  Facts clearly prove that the South Korean puppets are, 
indeed, anti-dialogue, anti-reunification elements who have no 
will to work for peace and reunification. 
  If the South Korean puppets dare provoke the North, it will 
control the fire with fire on all accounts and mete out a 
deserving punishment to the provocateurs. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop behaving rashly, clearly 
realizing that their acts of pushing the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to an acute phase of confrontation will only result in 
their own self-destruction.
