  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, 
chairman of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification [Pomminnyon], Hyon Chun-kuk, 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Journalists 
Union, and Kang Kwan-son, secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Korean Democratic Women's Union, published statements 
Saturday in support of the policy of national reunification set 
forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address. 
  Chairman Paek In-chun says that the principled stand of the 
Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government on national 
reunification clarified by President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address is a highly important guideline indicating a clear way 
of achieving national reunification by the internal strength of 
the nation in the 90s. 
  "All the people in the Northern half of Korea, together with 
the fellow countrymen in the South and overseas, will wage a 
more vigorous struggle to make this year a historic year in 
opening a new phase for national reunification, meeting all 
manner of challenges of the imperialists and the South Korean 
authorities," he states. 
  Hyon Chun-kuk says that the only way of achieving the 
reunification of the country peacefully is to adopt the 
confederacy formula based on the three principles of national 
reunification. "All the journalists and editors in the Northern 
half of Korea will wield the pen more vigorously to implement 
the policy," he stressed. 
  Saying that the women should do their share in achieving the 
unity of the nation under the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation, Secretary Kang Kwan-son ardently 
appealed to the Korean women in the North, South and overseas to 
turn out as one in the nationwide struggle for national 
reunification.
