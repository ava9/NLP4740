  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Party and state 
leaders of different countries expressed support to the Korean 
people's cause of national reunification when they received the 
DPRK ambassadors to their countries. 
  Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said the Indian people 
support the proposal for reunifying the country by confederacy 
formula without the interference of outside forces which was put 
forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the 
struggle of the Korean people to achieve a peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  The Indian people, he noted, pay deep attention to the great 
achievements made by the Korean people in all domains of social 
life including the economy, and to the development of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, prime minister of the government of the 
Republic of Mali, expressed support and solidarity for the 
Korean people in their struggle to realize the proposal for 
reunification by confederacy formula reiterated by respected 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address, saying it is the 
only just proposal conforming to the reality of Korea. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved 
only through DPRK-U.S. negotiations, he noted. 
  The general secretary of the Independent Liberal Party of 
Nicaragua, Virgilio Godoy, fully supported the policy for 
reunifying the country in the form of confederation on the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity, stating it is a most realistic and fair policy.
