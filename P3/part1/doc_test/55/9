<F P=106> ["Nation's Common Programme of Reunification" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in a signed article says that the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great unity of the 
nation is the common programme of the nation for reunification. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "The principles and line adhered to by our party and the 
government of our Republic for national reunification remain 
unchanged. We will continue to make every effort to reunify the 
country in the form of a confederation based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, and on the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity." 
  The article goes on: 
  As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said, the principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity 
are the three principles consistently maintained by the Workers' 
Party of Korea in the struggle for national reunification. 
Because these principles clearly show the way of solving the 
national reunification question in conformity with the will and 
interests of the entire Korean people. 
  The reunification of the country is a cause of putting an 
end 
to the domination and interference of outside forces and 
realizing national independence on a nationwide scale. 
  The reunification of the country, the cause of independence 
of the nation, can successfuly be solved only by the efforts of 
the Korean nation itself. The driving force of the 
reunification of the country is the Korean nation. 
  Korea must be reunified by peaceful means. The Korean nation 
must be reunified into one. But a war must not be chosen for 
this purpose. It is the biggest tragedy and shame for fellow 
countrymen to live in antagonism or to fight each other with 
arms. 
  The whole nation must share the same will and firmly unite 
as 
one in the struggle for national reunification. A bright 
prospect of national reunification can be opened when the entire 
people in the North and the South achieve great national unity 
on the principle of giving priority to the common interests of 
the nation, transcending the differences in idea, system and 
religious belief, and of subordinating everything to the cause 
of national reunification. 
  Great national unity is the fundamental prerequisite to 
independent and peaceful reunification and its essential 
content. Independent and peaceful reunification is unthinkable 
apart from great national unity. 
  The harmony and unity of the entire nation is the very 
reunification of the country that we desire. 
  The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification 
and great national unity are a common action program which the 
North and the South agreed upon and proclaimed to the world 
jointly, the article stresses.
