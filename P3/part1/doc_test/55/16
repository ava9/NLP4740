  [Text] North Korea is calling for reunification through 
the confederal system and is urging our youth and students to 
carry out "the reunification struggle" from the beginning of the 
new year. In his New Year address, Kim Il-song emphasized that 
"the only method for reunification" is through the confederal 
system. Also, from 1-7 January North Korea concentratedly 
discussed the reunification issue on 24 occasions through press 
statements by its high-ranking authorities and special articles. 
  Kim Pyong-sik, DPRK vice president and chairman of the 
Korean 
Social Democratic Party, emphasized on 4 January: "All fellow 
countrymen in the North, South, and overseas must transcend 
differences in ideology, ideas, political views, and religion 
under the banner of the 10-point program of great national unity 
to firmly unite as one so that they can all vigorously launch 
into the work to found a pannational reunified state through the 
confederal system method." 
  In the 3 January special article aired by Pyongyang radio it 
emphasized: "The South Korean youth and students, who are 
enthusiastically patriotic and who have a strong sense of 
justness, must firmly unite with the people from all walks of 
life in the new year to vigorously carry out the struggle to 
achieve reunification through the confederal system method." 
  In particular, North Korea is instigating our youth and 
students by saying that "there is nothing to expect from the 
current South Korean Government." North Korea is denouncing our 
government by saying that there is no progress in the 
reunification issue because of the South side's dependency on 
outside forces and the promotion of its confrontational policy. 
  Such moves by North Korea is related to the fact that North 
Korea is working to make 1995 "the first year of reunification." 
This implies various significance. 
  It is not known exactly when but there are rumors by the 
North Korean people that "1995 will be the year of 
reunification." This was also shown when the North Korean 
people unhesitatingly told the members of our delegation of such 
moves who went to Pyongyang from 1990-1992 to participate in the 
South-North high-ranking talks. However, it is not clear whether 
North Korea officially set such a date for reunification. 
  At the 7 November 1988 combined meeting of party organs, 
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam had emphasized: "We must work to 
make the year 1995, the 50th anniversary of national division 
and 50th anniversary of the fatherland's liberation, as a 
historical year in completing the sacred cause of reunification 
without fail." Through propaganda media toward South Korea such 
as the South Korea National Democratic Front, North Korea 
frequently said "1995 is the first year of reunification." 
  The government views that such moves by North Korea are to 
unconsciously make the "South and North Korean people" realize 
that "reunification will be achieved in 1995." Thus, this is 
viewed as a strategy to make a more favorable condition to form 
a reunification front. In particular, from last year North 
Korea has been promoting on a full scale the preparation work to 
strengthen the reunification front. Such work is "the 10-point 
program of great national unity" announced by Kim Il-song, and 
the appointment Kim Pyong-sik and Yu Mi-yong (wife of Choe 
Tok-sin) who are from the South and overseas fellow countrymen, 
and Kang Chu-il who was in charge of operations of the 
pro-Pyongyang Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, as 
directors of the party reunification front. 
  We can view that there are some strategic intentions based 
on 
advance work for North Korea to strengthen propaganda on the 
reunification issue from the beginning of the new year. In this 
connection an official of the National Unification Board said: 
"When considering the fact that next year will be the first year 
of reunification is widely spreading among the people, it seems 
that the priority goal of North Korea is to seek unity at home 
and abroad by turning the interest of the people to the 
reunification issue." 
  He added: "Another intention of North Korea is to lure the 
antigovernment struggle through the reunification issue. 
Therefore, it seems that this year North Korea will work to 
actively improve its relations with the United States, while 
carrying out a multifaceted offensive against the South based on 
the reunification front strategy."
