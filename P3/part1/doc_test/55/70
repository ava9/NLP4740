  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities refused to take over our letter to the South Korean 
authorities, political parties, organizations and individual 
figures and overseas Koreans. 
  Commenting on this unreasonable act of the South Korean 
authorities, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  If they had had a shred of patriotism and desire to achieve 
peace and peaceful reunification of the country, they should 
have positively responded to our fair proposal for the 
convocation of a national conference for seeking a way of great 
national unity. 
  The South Korean authorities, however, refused to take over 
our letter, preposterously claiming that the proposal "ignores 
North- South dialogue" and it is not "conducive to improving 
North-South relations." This is, in every respect, an 
unreasonable, rude act and a challenge to the entire fellow 
countrymen desirous of reonciliation, unity and reunification. 
  By turning down our proposal and balking the convocation of 
a 
national conference, the South Korean rulers are fully revealing 
their criminal nature as the very one who does not have dialogue 
for reunification but keeps others from having dialogue and 
seeks only confrontation, division and a war against the North. 
  The South Korean authorities would be well advised to look 
squarely at the reality, act with discretion and stop such anti- 
national acts as obstructing the convocation of a national 
conference. 
  The whole nation will keep tabs on their follow-up action.
