<F P=106> ["No Need To Watch South Korean `Regime' and Nothing To </F>
Expect From It"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- Now the South Korean 
people and public figures are courageously turning out in the 
anti-puppet, anti-"government" struggle" under the slogan "down 
with the Kim Yong-sam government", saying that there is no need 
to watch the Kim Yong-sam "civilian regime" any longer and that 
they have nothing to expect from it, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article Tuesday. 
  After coming to power under the "civilian" veil in February 
last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, has turned his 
back on the South Korean people and the whole nation and 
committed a long string of treacheries, outdistancing the 
preceding military fascist rulers, the article says, and goes on: 
  One of the grisliest crimes committed by the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and his "civilian government" is that they have taken 
the road of dependence on foreign forces, not national 
independence, and of North-South confrontation, not national 
unity, turning away the hand stretched by fellow countrymen for 
the reconciliation, unity and reunification of the North and 
South. 
  Kim Yong-sam the traitor resumed the "Team Spirit" nuclear 
war exercises against the North on a larger scale in collusion 
with the U.S. imperialists, the war game which had been 
suspended in the closing years of the "sixth republic" and, at 
"summit talks" and "annual security consultative meeting" 
between South Korea and the United States and during his trip of 
the United States, he asked the United States to shelve a 
programme to cut back its troops present in South Korea and keep 
the U.S. troops in South Korea for an indefinite period in 
return for his promise to allocate more than 3 billion dollars 
for the maintenance of its troops, and place South Korea under 
the U.S. "nuclear umbrella". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has made desperate efforts to 
get "sanctions" imposed upon the DPRK and set up an 
"international cooperation system" against it by spreading the 
fiction of "suspicion of nuclear development by the North" 
invented by the imperialist reactionary forces in a bid to 
stifle our republic, the bastion of socialism. 
  Never to be condoned are the crimes committed by the Kim 
Yong-sam fascist "regime" in turning South Korea into a fascist 
pandemonium worse than under the "sixth republic" military 
dictatorial "regime" and brutally suppressing the students and 
people calling for independence, democracy and reunification. 
  It is only too natural that the South Korean people bitterly 
condemn the present Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a "civilian 
fascist regime" and the "second-term government of the sixth 
republic" which has replaced "military fascism with civilian 
fascism". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group committed a towering crime by putting 
a spoke in the wheel of the democratic development of the South 
Korean society and driving the economy and people's living to 
the worst phase through deceptive "reforms". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has taken the road of 
dependence on outside forces, not national independence, and of 
North-South confrontation, not national reconciliation and 
unity, going against the desire of the nation for independent 
reunification and is fooling the people with hypocritical 
"reforms". This is what the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has done 
under the cloak of "civilian politics". 
  The traitor and fascist tyrant forsaken by the country and 
the nation will face a stern judgement by history.
