  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Foreigners expressed 
full support to the Korean people's cause of justice. 
  Jean Pierre Ngambi, general secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cameroon, upon handing over to the Korean ambassador to 
Cameroon on May 19 a signature paper after participating in a 
signature campaign for supporting the "10-point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country", said Korea should be reunified through a confederacy 
on the basis of the three principles of national reunification 
and the "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole 
Nation for the Reunification of the Country" laid down by 
President Kim Il-song. 
  To this end, he said, the concrete wall, an obstacle to the 
reunification, must be dismantled and foreign interference and 
nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula be removed at an early 
date. 
  The Malaysian paper NANYANG SIANG PAU May 19 quoted the 
Malaysian foreign minister as saying recently that the best way 
of resolving North Korea's "nuclear issue" is negotiations 
through diplomatic channels. The newspaper described as stupid 
and extremely irresponsible the talk within the United States 
about "possibility and desirability of a war in Korea". 
  Amaral Matos, first executive secretary of the Mozambican 
Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a 
statement May 23 said the DPRK has advanced most reasonable, 
realistic and fair reunification proposals on many occasions, 
but the South Korean authorities objected to the proposals 
categorically, and this shows that they have no intention for 
reunification. 
  He stressed that the way of accelerating Korea's 
reunification is for the whole nation to firmly unite under the 
banner of the "10- point Programme of the Great Unity of the 
Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country".
