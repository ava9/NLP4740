  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of 
the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
released its Information No. 640 on December 29 denouncing the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's treacheries against the nation in 
the nearly one year since it came to power. 
  The information cited facts exposing that since it seized 
power the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has committed despicable 
treacheries against the nation, doing harm to and bartering away 
the national interests by resorting to humiliating sycophant, 
traitorous acts, "civilian" fascist dictatorship, reckless war 
moves and malicious anti-North confrontation racket. 
  It says in part: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, in his "summit talks" 
with the United States and at the South Korea-U.S. "annual 
Security Consultative Meeting" in July and November offered to 
pay more than 3,000 million dollars for the maintenance of the 
U.S. Forces present in South Korea, begging for their permanent 
presence in South Korea, and had the planned U.S. troop cutback 
in South Korea shelved. 
  During his visit to the United States in November he begged 
his master to "exercise strong influence", raising a hue and cry 
over the "suspicion of North's nuclear development", a 
fictitious talk. And, in a bid to put the brake on the progress 
of the DPRK-U.S. talks, he entreated his master to object to the 
North-proposed formula of package solution of the nuclear 
problem and establish an "international cooperation system" 
aimed at stifling the same fellow countrymen, and promised in 
privacy to open in return for it the South Korean rice market, a 
matter which even his preceding dictators didn't dare to deal 
with. 
  Further still, the traitor invited the Japanese prime 
minister to South Korea in early November and asked for "joint 
action" against the North's "nuclear problem" till its solution. 
He blared that South Korea and Japan should "develop their 
relationship into future-oriented one", whitewashing the 
thrice-cursed brutalities committed by the Japanese imperialists 
against the Korean people in the past. 
  Since it took the helm of power the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique has zealously followed the anti-socialist moves of the 
international reactionaries to stifle the DPRK. 
  Taking office, the traitor Kim Yong-sam made quite a noise 
as 
if he would bring about any "change" in the relations between 
the North and the South, saying "relations with the North would 
be improved from the viewpoint of the same nation". But it was 
a mere deception designed to mislead public opinion at home and 
abroad. 
  His criminal records reveal to the whole world that he has 
committed heinous crimes in bringing dark clouds of war over the 
head of the nation and driving the North-South relations to the 
worst phase.
