<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Improvement of DPRK-U.S. Relations" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
choose to improve its relations with the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea from a sincere stand, not setting unreasonable 
preconditions, we will make energetic efforts for the 
improvement of the relations between the two countries, not 
looking back on the past but looking forward to the future, 
declares NODONG SINMUN in an editorial today. 
  Noting that 44 years have passed since the United States and 
the South Korean rulers started a war of aggression against the 
DPRK on June 25, 1950, the editorial says: 
  The victory of the Korean people in the fatherland 
liberation 
war furnished ample proof that no threat and strong arm of the 
imperialists could subdue a people who rose up to defend the 
sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation under 
the wise leadership of the party and the leader. 
  The editorial headlined "Let Us End Confrontation and 
Division and Advance Toward Peace and Reunification" further 
says: 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government have in 
the past period put forward most reasonable and realistic 
proposals and programs for the improvement of the 
confrontational DPRK-U.S. and North-South relations and for a 
durable peace in the country and its peaceful reunification and 
made every possible effort for their implementation. But they 
have not borne fruits owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward 
the DPRK and the anti-peace, anti- reunification splittist 
manoeuvres of the South Korean rulers. 
  If the United States really do not want to see the 
repetition 
of the June 25 disasters on the Korean peninsula, it must 
rectify its outdated Korean policy of blindly antagonizing the 
DPRK and approaching the Korean issue from the stand of strength 
and move ahead toward the termination of the hostile relations 
between the two countries. 
  The military armistice system in Korea has been paralysed 
today by a unilateral act of the United States. The United 
States is talking much about the end of the Cold War and the 
advent of peace. Should it truly want a durable peace on the 
Korean peninsula, there would be no ground for it to refuse to 
accept the peace proposal of the DPRK to replace the Korean 
armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new 
peace arrangement and there would be no problem unsolvable in 
its relations with the DPRK. 
  If the South Korean authorities want to take the road for 
the 
nation in the changed realities today, they should join in the 
nationwide cause of achieving peace of the country and its 
peaceful reunification, promoting the great unity of the nation 
from the stand of national independence. 
  MINJU CHOSON in its editorial today says. 
  If the United States do not want the repetition of the 
disasters of war on the Korean peninsula, it must bend efforts 
for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue and a 
substantial improvement of its overall relations with the DPRK 
and respond at an early date to our proposal for the 
establishment of a new peace arrangement.
