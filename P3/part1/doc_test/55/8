  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting took place 
here today to mark the 21st anniversary of the publication of 
"Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", a 
work of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, member of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party 
of Korea [WPK] and vice-president, Yang Hyong-sop, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], 
WPK and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, and working 
people in the city. 
  On June 23, 1973, immediately after the South Korean rulers 
published a "special statement" announcing the creation of "two 
Koreas" as their "policy", President Kim Il-song put forth the 
five-point policy of national reunification as a revolutionary 
measure decisively to smash the permanent nation-splitting moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and open an epochal 
phase of national reunification. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song has said: 
  "Our proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease 
tension between the North and the South, bring about 
multilateral collaboration and interchange between the two 
parts, convene the great national congress composed of 
representatives of people of all levels and political parties 
and social organizations in the North and South, institute the 
North-South confederation under the single name of the 
Confederal Republic of Koryo and enter the UN under that name. 
When this proposal for the country's reunification is put into 
effect, there will be a great improvement in accomplishing the 
historic cause of peaceful national reunification on the 
principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly 
desired by our people and the world's people." 
  In his report at the meeting Paek Nam-chun, director of the 
Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, said the five-point policy of national 
reunification laid down by the great leader was a patriotic 
reunification formula most correctly reflecting the unanimous 
aspirations and will of all the fellow countrymen who desired a 
peaceful reunification of the country and opposed a permanent 
division of the nation, and an immortal militant banner which 
set forth a broad vista and way of national reunification and 
roused vigorously the entire people to the struggle to realize 
it. 
  "It is entirely because of the `two Koreas' policy of the 
United States and the successive South Korean authorities that 
the five-point policy of national reunification has not been 
implemented, though it evoked welcome and full support of the 
entire Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for its 
fair and reasonable nature," he said. 
  The reporter pointed out that in recent years the United 
States and its followers have been increasing the tensions on 
the Korean peninsula and creating graver obstacles in the way of 
Korea's reunification by inventing the "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK. 
  Recalling that the DPRK Government took a decisive measure 
of 
declaring its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in face of unjustifiable moves of the IAEA 
Secretariat, he said this is a legitimate self-defence measure 
and "an expression of our people's firm stand and will not to 
bow to any pressure." 
  It is not allowable to live in uneasiness, exposed to the 
danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on top of the tragedy of 
national division, the reporter said, and continued: 
  The United States must no longer seek "sanctions" against 
the 
DPRK but come out to the DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere 
attitude and stand for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula, in compliance with the aspiration of 
the time and the demand of the Korean and U.S. peoples. 
  We believe that the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S. 
President a few days ago will produce an affirmative result. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy 
toward the DPRK they have pursued, motivated by a foolish 
intention to realise their old dream of "the greater east Asia 
coprosperity sphere." 
  They must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by 
their moves against the DPRK and the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), honestly apologize for 
all the crimes committed so far and punish the criminals. 
  "Sanctions" against the North are immediately sanctions 
against the South and a declaration of war to the 70 million 
Koreans. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of 
dependence on outside forces, take the stand of national 
independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the 
fellow countrymen and seek national concord and unity. 
  It is our consistent position to meet with anyone who truly 
wants the independent and peaceful reunification of the country 
from the stand of great national unity and national independence 
and jointly seek the way of the peace and peaceful reunification 
of the country. 
  The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it 
lucky that the South Korean side expressed its readiness to hold 
top-level talks with the North, sent a message today upon 
authorization to the South Korean "prime minister," expressing 
welcome and agreement to the South side's proposal for holding a 
preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks. 
  I express support to it in the name of the participants in 
this meeting, considering that it reflects the consistent 
position and policy of our side to remove confrontation between 
North and South and open a new phase for national reunification 
independently and peacefully through top-level talks. 
  Paek Nam-chun called on all the Koreans at home and abroad 
to 
brilliantly adorn 1995 as the proud year of national 
reunification, the significant year marking the 50th anniversary 
of national liberation and the historical year that our nation 
set as the first year of reunification, under the banner of the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation.
