  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The confirmation of 
the 5,000 years long history of the Korean nation and its father 
through the unearthing of the Tomb of Tangun is a marvelous 
event that brilliantly adorned the first page of the nation's 
history which had long remained a blanket, says NODONG SINMUN in 
a by-lined article. 
  The article continues: 
  It was proved again that the Korean people with Tangun as 
their father are a homogeneous nation proud of having lived with 
the same blood, the same language and same cultural tradition 
for 5,000 years. This has further hardened the will of the 
fellow countrymen to put an end to the division of the country 
at an early date and live as the same nation in a unified 
country and also brightened the prospect of national 
reunification. 
  Only when all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas 
achieve great unity of the whole nation, irrespective of their 
ideology, idea, political view and religious belief, can our 
nation establish a unified state and live a harmonious life as 
it did before. 
  The situation prevailing in Korea raises to the fellow 
countrymen serious issues -- whether they will prolong the 
national division forced by outside forces and antagonize and 
confront with each other to fall a prey to outside forces or 
unite with each other to defend the dignity of the nation and 
pave the way of national reunification. 
  Under no circumstances we can make a choice to invite self- 
destruction through a fratricidal war and allow outside forces 
to profit therefrom. 
  It is the only choice for our nation to reunify the country 
with great national unity. And it is also the only way for 
coprosperity of the North and the South as the same nation. 
  The pride of the homogeneous nation that has been maintained 
for 5,000 years with Tangun as its father and the common desire 
of the nation for reunification -- this is a source for uniting 
the whole nation closely on the road of national reunification. 
  It is the unshakable will of the fellow countrymen that if 
they achieve great unity of the whole nation with the pride of 
the homogeneous nation, they would be quite able to repulse 
aggression and interference by outside forces, smash pressure by 
big powers and win national reunification in the '90s. 
  All the Koreans in the North, South and overseas will 
reunify 
the country through the establishment of a pan-national unified 
state, independent, peaceful and neutral, in the '90s, closely 
rallied under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation with the pride of the homogeneous 
nation, thus adding shine to the 5,000 years long history of 
Tangun Korea.
