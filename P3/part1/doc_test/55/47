  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Guy Dupre, 
secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for 
Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), delivered a report 
at an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of Cilreco 
which was held in Paris on February 6. 
  The reporter outlined immediate tasks to strengthen 
international solidarity movement for supporting the cause of 
Korea's reunification and peace under the acute situation 
prevailing in the Korean peninsula. 
  Analysing the situation of the Korean peninsula, he stressed 
the need to be cautious of the Western media reports 
categorically dismissing the proposals and initiatives of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and shunning the reality 
and, at the same time, to analyse the developments from an 
objective stand and correctly see through the essential stand of 
the parties involved in the Korean issue. 
  Noting that the tension on the Korean peninsula remains 
acute, though a joint statement was adopted between the DPRK and 
the U.S. in June 1993 at official talks between the two sides, 
he said: "This is because the United States went back on its 
promise to the DPRK for the solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  He recalled that the DPRK, on January 31, 1994, solemnly 
declared that if the U.S. reversed its promise to the DPRK, the 
DPRK would no longer be bound by its promise to the U.S., that 
if the United States refused to have any more talks with the 
DPRK, the DPRK would seek no further talks and that if the U.S. 
would choose any other way, the DPRK will choose a corresponding 
countermeasure. "If broad masses are to be roused in a campaign 
to force the United States to strictly observe the principle 
agreed upon in its joint statement with the DPRK under the 
critical present situation, it is important to bring home the 
developments on the Korean peninsula to the public," the 
reporter said. 
  He branded "suspected nuclear development of the North" as a 
variant of the fiction of "threat from the North" invented by 
the United States to justify its moves to stifle the DPRK. 
  He said "threat from the North" over which the United States 
and the South Korean authorities have hitherto raised terrific 
outcries is a sheer fabrication without any ground. 
  He pointed out that the United States and its followers made 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations 
adopt high-handed "resolutions" in a bid to inveigle the 
international community into the U.S. "policy of strength" 
against socialist Korea. 
  He charged that the South Korean authorities have run a 
gamut 
of plots to bar the solution of the nuclear issue through the 
medium of direct negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. and 
Japan has burst into the limelight in raising a hue and cry over 
the fictitious "suspected nuclear development by the North". 
  The reporter quoted President Kim Il-song as saying in his 
New Year address that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks under all circumstances 
and pressure and threat will have no effect on the Korean people 
and such method may invite a catastrophe, far from leading to a 
solution of the problem. 
  "We express full sympathy for the principled stand," 
declared 
the reporter. 
  He demanded that the Korean Armistice Agreement be replaced 
by a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. in compliance 
with the requirements of the resolution (3390 b) of the 30th 
U.N. General Assembly and, accordingly, the U.S. Forces be 
completely withdrawn from South Korea. 
  He said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation shows a way of an early realisation of Korea's 
reunification. 
  He further said: 
  "The 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunification of the country put forward by 
President Kim Il-song last year indicates detailed ways for 
founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK], an 
independent, peaceful and neutral unified state. We will make 
every effort to arouse louder voices supporting the proposal for 
founding the DCRK and the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation." 
  The reporter stressed the need to expand and strengthen the 
international solidarity movement for Korea's reunification and 
peace and proposed measures for this. 
  He said: 
  "Primary efforts should be directed to the following two 
points to bring about a decisive turn in creating an atmosphere 
of detente and reconciliation for hastening the process of 
Korea's reunification this year: 
  "What is important above all is to build up broad world 
opinion urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy 
to stifle the DPRK and abide by the principles of the joint 
statement agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States. 
  "What is important next is to put the question of 
reunification through confederacy on the agenda of inter-Korean 
talks and promote reunification-oriented dialogue. Of 
importance in this regard is to arouse broad world opinion 
supporting the proposal for founding the DCRK, the most 
realistic and fair way in the solution to the Korean issue. 
  "With a view to building up world opinion in favor of the 
settlement of the Korean issue, we propose declaring 1994 `a 
year of international solidarity supporting Korea's 
reunification through confederacy.'" 
  The reporter expressed the hope that the members of the 
leading body of Cilreco and leading officials of the regional 
and national committees of support to Korea's reunification and 
organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean 
people will actively turn out, with a high sense of 
responsibility, in the work to expand and strengthen 
international solidarity movement in keeping with the demands of 
the obtaining situation.
