Confederacy Formula in View of Yemen Situation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN analyst 
today hits out at the Japanese reactionaries and the South 
Korean puppets for speaking ill of the DPRK's proposal for 
reunification through a confederacy in view of the current Yemen 
situation. 
  In an article on the civil war in Yemen the Japanese SANKEI 
SHIMBUN wrote that on the Korean peninsula, too, a confederacy 
in which the North and the South are supposed to be reunified 
without political integration while leaving their systems as 
they are, is unstable and it may lead to a war. And the South 
Korean newspaper CHOSUN ILBO reported that reunification through 
a confederacy is as good as promising a bloodlet through a civil 
war later. 
  These arguments of some Japanese and South Korean media are 
a 
sinister jargon to defend the sophism of the separatists within 
and without, create obstacles in the way of Korea's 
reunification and incite division and confrontation, the news 
analyst says, and goes on: 
  The cause of the civil war in Yemen rather testifies more 
clearly to the validity and reasonableness of the DPRK's 
confederacy formula. 
  The confederacy formula calls for the establishment of a 
national unified state on the basis of patriotism and the idea 
of national independence and on the principle of promoting 
co-existence, co- prosperity and common interests. 
  It provides an institutional guarantee of fairly 
distributing 
the functions and authority of the confederal government and 
regional governments and enabling the political forces 
participating in them to exercise equal rights, such as 
establishing above the regional governments a unified national 
government consisting of an equal number of people from both 
sides and the North and the South running it on a rotatory basis. 
  It also envisages organizing a United National Army through 
a 
drastic reduction of the armies of the North and the South and 
their amalgamation and placing it under the unified command of 
the confederal government, thus providing a military arrangement 
so that the fear of invasion from both South and North and the 
ideas of prevailing over communism and communization may be 
dispelled and a durable peace be preserved. 
  The proposal of achieving national reunification through a 
confederacy on the basis of one nation, one state, two systems 
and two governments is the most just and feasible programme 
which makes it possible to achieve the reunification of the 
country independently and peacefully at the earliest possible 
date without neither side conquering the other or being 
conquered under the conditions where different ideas and systems 
exist in the North and the South of Korea. 
  The process of reunification in Yemen is fundamentally 
different from DPRK-proposed reunification through a confederacy 
in the principles, ways and content of reunification. It is 
motivated by their sinister political aim that they are speaking 
ill of the DPRK's confederacy formula by connecting it with the 
incident in Yemen in a far-fetched manner, without so much as a 
study of it. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets have 
desperately tried to block peace and reunification of the Korean 
peninsula, objecting to the DPRK's proposal for reunification 
through a confederacy, in order to perpetuate the division of 
Korea. The slander of some Japanese and South Korean media on 
the DPRK's reunification proposal represents the real intention 
of the dishonest force seeking to perpetuate the division. 
  It is a disgraceful behavior like tarnishing one's own image 
by himself for the press which regards justice and truth as what 
keeps it alive to play into the hands of the separatists opposed 
to peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula.
