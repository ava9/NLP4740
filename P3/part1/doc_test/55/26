  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today condemns the unending arrests of patriotic 
students in South Korea in the new year as a heinous challenge 
to the patriotic force which calls for independence, democracy 
and reunification. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique recently 
arrested Kim Yong-ha who was chairman of the committee for 
national Reunification of the former "National Council of 
Student Representatives (Chondaehyop)" and Ho Hon-chun, a 
fourth-year student of Chonpuk National University who was 
chairman of the South side's headquarters of the National 
Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomchonghaknyon) at the time of the first joint presidium 
meeting of Pomchonghaknyon, the news analyst says: 
  The students thrown behind bars by the puppet clique have 
done nothing guilty. It is, to all intents and purposes, a 
praiseworthy patriotic deed for the students in the North and 
the South and abroad who were born in a divided territory to 
exchange greetings though by correspondence and on the phone and 
vow to bring earlier the morning of national reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, did not cease to 
arrest patriotic students in the new year, too. This tells that 
they overshadow the preceding military fascist dictators in 
suppressing the people stubbornly and maliciously. 
  Either the independence and democratization of South Korean 
society or peace and Reunification of the country cannot be 
realized while the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is left intact, a 
group of traitors who are brandishing the fascist sword against 
pro-reunification patriotic forces at home and are engaged in 
confrontation and war rackets against the fellow countrymen 
abroad. 
  The South Korean students and people who aspire after 
independence, democracy and reunification will certainly bring 
down a sledge hammer to bear upon the traitorous clique of Kim 
Yong-sam, a dyed-in-the-wool fascist dictator, separatist and 
warmaniac.
