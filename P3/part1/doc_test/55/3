Splittist Forces"] 
  [Text] The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean 
puppets are making an attempt to arouse the public opinion by 
slandering our reunification formula through a confederal 
system, regarding the fact that Yemen, which was reunified four 
years ago, has recently entered into a situation of internal 
conflict. 
  Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUM reported in an article regarding the 
internal conflict in Yemen that the confederal system -- under 
which the North and South would be reunified by leaving their 
systems as they are without a political merger on the Korean 
peninsula -- is shaky, and that it may even bring about a war. 
  South Korea's CHOSON ILBO reported that reunification 
through 
the confederal system would promise [word indistinct] caused by 
the internal conflict in the future, and that a war must be 
avoided even if the reunification is delayed. 
  Such assertions by some Japanese and South Korean 
newspapers, 
as backing sophistry made by splittist forces at home and 
abroad, have created obstacles to the reunification of Korea 
and, also, are insidious plots to perpetuate national division 
and confrontation. 
  As reported by foreign newspapers, the reason for Yemen's 
plunge into a crisis situation today, due to its bloody internal 
conflict, is not only because it is reunified without achieving 
reconciliation and unity between North and South Yemen, but 
because it was not able to guarantee the balance of power or 
merge the Armed Forces even after the reunification. 
Considering the background of its internal conflict, this will 
clearly prove the justification and reasonableness of our 
reunification formula through the confederal system. 
  It is reported that North and South Yemen have reunified 
their country based on an agreement between the heads of the two 
sides without achieving reconciliation and unity. On the other 
hand, our reunification formula through the confederal system 
clearly defines an ideological basis and principle of the great 
unity of the whole nation for national reunification. This 
reunification formula is based on the national sentiment and an 
ideology of national independence, as well as plans to establish 
a national reunified state embodying the principle of promoting 
coexistence, coprosperity, and public interests. 
  Our reunified state through the confederal system regards 
the 
common demands and interests of the nation as its basic mission 
and, also, is the most reasonable form as a reunified state that 
makes it possible to achieve national unity, transcending the 
difference of ideas [sasang], ideology [inyom], and systems. 
  Our reunification formula through the confederal system 
gives 
the highest priority to the nation over the system and, also, is 
the reunified formula deployed based on national ideology. 
Therefore, this formula has elucidated the most practical and 
reasonable way to realize national reunification by achieving 
national reconciliation and unity even under the situations in 
which the two different systems exist between the North and 
South. 
  It is also reported that the merge has been made in Yemen 
without a structural guarantee that can sufficiently maintain 
the balance of political forces representing the North and 
South. However, our reunification formula through the 
confederal system has prepared a structural guarantee that makes 
it possible to establish the national reunified government made 
up of the same number of delegates from the North and South 
based on the local governments that can fully exercise their 
autonomous rights; that enables the North and South to take 
turns in operating it and to equally share the function and 
authority of the confederal government and local government; 
and that makes it possible for other political forces to 
equally exercise their rights. 
  For the governments of the two regions of the North and 
South to equally participate in the confederal system guarantees 
equality in the two autonomous regions to consolidate national 
unity, equally realizes the interests of the two regions in 
operating the confederal system, and makes it possible to 
achieve common prosperity of the nation. This is a superior and 
unique form of a confederal system. 
  Then, in Yemen, the North and South maintained each other's 
forces and the leadership was unified in a situation in which it 
was under a separate control. Apart from this, our 
reunification method through the confederal system anticipates 
that each Army of the North and South be drastically reduced to 
100,000-150,000 each; unify each other's Army to organize a 
single national united Army; and put this under the unified 
command of the confederal government. Therefore, apprehensions 
on invasion from the North, invasion from the South, victory 
over communism, and communization will disappear, and there is a 
military security device to maintain solid peace. 
  Truly, the fatherland's reunification method through the 
confederal system based on one nation, one state, two system, 
and two governments, is the most just and practical national 
reunification program which makes it possible to most quickly 
realize the country's reunification independently and peacefully 
without someone not swallowing the other or being swallowed by 
the other under the condition in which other ideology and 
systems exist in North and South Korea. 
  As we have seen, there is a fundamental difference in the 
principle of reunification, method, and content in the process 
of unification in Yemen and our reunification method through the 
confederal system. Nevertheless, slandering our reunification 
method through the confederal system by unreasonably linking it 
with the Yemen situation, without even researching it, stems 
from an insidious political goal. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are 
opposing our reunification method through the confederal system 
to perpetuate Korea's division, and are persistently preventing 
peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula. 
  In connection with the Yemen situation, some media in Japan 
and South Korea are slandering our reunification method. This 
speaks for the true intention of the insidious forces who want 
to perpetuate division. 
  For the media, which regard justice and truth as life, to 
become a tool of the splittists opposing peace and reunification 
on the Korean peninsula which the Korean people and the world's 
peace- loving people are consistently desiring, is indeed 
nothing but a shameful act of tarnishing their own face. 
  Our reunification method through the confederal system is 
receiving a wide range of support and approval from the fellow 
countrymen of the North, South, and overseas in its justness and 
practicality with each passing day. Splittists at home and 
abroad cannot prevent our nation's strong trend which is moving 
toward the fatherland's reunification with any kind of schemes, 
obstructions, and maneuvers. 
  Through united strength, our nation will eliminate barriers 
and difficulties lying ahead in the road of the fatherland's 
reunification, and realize the country's reunification without 
fail according to the reunification method through the 
confederal system.
