Workers Union: "`The Economic Community Has Been Successful, 
But Social Problems Are Mounting'"] 
  [Text] The Europe saga illustrates the opportunities and 
dangers that lie in the unions relationship with Europe. Zeus, 
who worshipped the king's daughter Europa, assumed the form of a 
white bull and behaved so gently that the girl climbed onto his 
back. Before she knew what had happened, the steer swam across 
to Crete with her where she became Zeus' lover. Not only was 
the girl deceived, but so was Zeus' wife Hera, who in fact 
realized what was going on very quickly. 
  What does this old myth have to do with the unions and 
Europe? Well, the unions neither want to be the betrayed wife 
nor do they want to be the seduced innocent. The European 
integration process has created an enormous economic and 
financial zone, but Europe as a social policy zone has remained 
an illusion. From the very beginning, the German trade unions 
were positively disposed toward Europe. They grinned and bore 
it as economic integration made progress over decades and social 
considerations were neglected. They came out in favor of the 
Rome treaties although social questions were excluded. There 
are good reasons why Europe should exist. One motive is that of 
securing peace in Europe, and that hope has not been 
disappointed. Europe has experienced a long period of peace, 
and the war in former Yugoslavia reminds us how valuable peace 
is. It also reminds us that peace is always in danger and that 
nationalist and ethnic excesses can quickly turn into war. The 
European economic community was an exceptionally successful 
venture. To quote Willy Brandt, it has become "a unique zone of 
prosperity." However, these successes cannot conceal the fact 
that social problems in Europe are mounting up. It is a scandal 
that there are almost 20 million unemployed people in Europe. 
Almost one-fifth of people under the age of 25 are without 
work. I do not want to become Cassandra, but this challenge 
must be addressed. If that is not done, then there is a danger 
that the entire European integration process will run into 
difficulties. We should consider the current weariness and 
skepticism with regard to Europe to be a warning sign, the 
writing on the wall. The writing on the wall reads that Europe 
must be democratic and social, or it will not exist at all. Is 
it really surprising that support for Europe has been crumbling 
away? Is it really surprising that anti-Europe groups are being 
formed and that the contradictions that are appearing in the 
European unification process are being used to achieve political 
capital? 
  The unions also face the challenge of having to rethink 
their 
position on Europe. I am not concerned about formulating 
radical, verbal positions on Europe, but, within the limits of 
what is possible, to use the German presidency to place concrete 
proposals on the table. Three demands are of key importance for 
the German unions. First, the guidelines for European employee 
councils have been discussed for over 20 years and they must now 
be approved despite the policy of obstruction being practiced by 
Unice [European employers union]. The Federal Government 
supports this demand and the next council meeting, at which the 
guidelines will be on the agenda, should be considered an acid 
test. The commission's patience with respect to the formulation 
and reformulation of the guidelines knows no end and that also 
applies to the unions. 
  Second, a European policy on employment must be implemented 
so that the Europe of the future is not a Europe of the 
unemployed. The hopes contained in the Ceccini report, which 
forecast the creation of millions of jobs proved to be illusory. 
French President Mitterrand has assured [EU President Jacques] 
Delors of his support. By contrast, the German Government has, 
in an irresponsible manner, blocked the employment policy 
initiative with its monetary veto. 
  The Federal Government should abandon these stances. A 
Franco-German package solution is conceivable, one in which both 
sides will have to bear their costs. Why should we not embark 
on unconventional paths and not seek a reduction for the 
duration of the reconstruction of eastern Germany according to 
the British pattern? Why should we not respond to the French 
side with regard to the European bond issue, which, by virtue of 
its job creation impetus can also satisfy German interests? 
This kind of package would satisfy all sides, because an end to 
the skepticism about Europe, which is spreading like a plague, 
would also benefit Europe as a center for business. 
  Third, the British, who want to use the fact that they have 
not signed the protocol on social affairs in order to improve 
their position as a center for business, should be forced to 
sign the protocol. Why should we not attempt to reduce British 
skepticism by bringing about an intelligent reshaping of the 
agriculture sector and thus make them more ready to achieve a 
compromise. 
  The issue of shaping Europe as a social policy zone is also 
a 
question of Europe's political legitimacy at the same time. 
Acceptance of the European unification process can only be 
increased if European agencies adopt a resolute approach in 
eliminating shortcomings in social policy and democracy. In 
following such a course, they can rely on and count on the 
support of the German trade unions.
