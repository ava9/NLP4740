Asserting that "the credibility of the United Nations is at stake" in the 
Persian Gulf crisis, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told President 
Turgut Ozal and other Turkish officials Wednesday that Washington soon may ask 
the Security Council for standby authority to use military force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that when the United Nations takes action . . . that those 
resolutions and actions be implemented," Baker told reporters after a two-hour 
meeting with Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said later that the United States has 
adequate legal authority under the "collective self-defense" provisions of the 
U.N. Charter to take offensive military action against Iraq but that new 
Security Council action would "provide a firmer political basis." 
</P>
<P>
Ozal has said that Turkey will not participate in warfare against Iraq, its 
neighbor to the south, unless the action is specifically authorized by the 
United Nations. Earlier this week, he went so far as to say that Turkey is not 
prepared to launch a "second front" in a U.S.-initiated conflict launched from 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal's determination not to get out in front of the Security Council was 
underlined by Suleyman Demirel, leader of the opposition True Path Party, who 
was quoted by the Turkish newspaper Gunaydin: "While war is on the horizon in 
the gulf, Ozal should not make any promises on behalf of the Turkish nation and 
state." 
</P>
<P>
As Baker and Ozal met, Iraq announced that it will free 120 more hostages, most 
of them Germans, after former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt met with 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The official Iraqi News Agency reported that 20 
of the hostages being freed will be of other nationalities, including 
Americans, Britons, Italians and others. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects Baghdad's "appreciation for the German policy, which does not 
support trends toward war," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. officials 
have not yet been notified about plans to free any Americans. But he denounced 
Iraq's "cynical bartering" of captive foreigners, who were trapped by Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 74 Japanese hostages flew to freedom from Iraq aboard a 
charter flight with former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who had 
arranged for their release. Iraq had said 77 Japanese were free to go, but 
three businessmen who had been given permission to leave changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher issued her sternest warning 
yet to Iraq in a speech to a crowded session of Parliament, declaring: "Time is 
running out for Saddam Hussein. . . . Either he gets out (of Kuwait) soon, or 
we and our allies will remove him by force." In that event, she added, "he will 
go down to defeat, with all its consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official, who talked to reporters aboard Baker's jetliner on a 
flight from Ankara to Moscow, said the possibility of additional Security 
Council action is on the agenda for all of Baker's stops on his weeklong, 
seven-nation swing through the Middle East and Europe. But the issue took on 
additional significance in Turkey because of Ozal's desire to have U.N. cover 
for any action by his formidable army against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The United States holds the presidency of the Security Council this month under 
the U.N.'s rotation system, and the senior official said Washington plans to 
sponsor several new gulf-related resolutions, in addition to the measure 
providing standby authority for military action while it holds the chair. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker denied a report, first carried by Israel Army Radio, that he 
had given Iraq an ultimatum to get out of Kuwait within two weeks or face a 
military assault. The Israeli station, quoting diplomatic sources in Cairo, 
said Baker discussed the deadline with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
when they met Tuesday at Cairo airport. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, a senior U.S. official arrived unexpectedly on Wednesday to brief 
Syrian leaders on Baker's current trip. The official, John Kelly, assistant 
secretary of state for Middle East and South Asian affairs, met with Syrian 
Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh to discuss developments in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Baker meets today in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Both the gulf and arms control are on 
the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States chooses to ask the Security Council for standby authority 
to use force, Soviet support would be essential.
