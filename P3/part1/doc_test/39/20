<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Cosmos Speaks--Rudolf Scharping </F>
Can Hardly Believe It: Helmut Schmidt Is Campaigning for Him"] 
  [Text] The "real satisfaction" of being honored, said the 
much-praised one, often remains concealed behind cliches and 
fulsome praise--namely the message "that others identify with 
our intentions and hopes." 
  This is how Helmut Schmidt formulated it almost 11 years ago 
in Berlin in a eulogy of Robert McNamara, former U.S. secretary 
of defense and later World Bank president. The anointed words at 
that time sounded like an obituary of himself, failed Chancellor 
Helmut Schmidt. 
  One year previously, in the fall of 1982, he had been 
toppled 
by Helmut Kohl. True, he still had an enormous lead in the West 
German popularity list of politicians. But he knew that the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party] under its chairman, Willy Brandt, 
would cause him grievous shame one month later at the Cologne 
party congress "going ballistic" and would shunt him into 
political exile once and for all. 
  Now Helmut Schmidt patently believes he has finally found 
someone younger who shares his intentions and hopes: Rudolf 
Scharping, 6 foot 4 inches tall, minister-president of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, SPD candidate for the chancellorship. 
Schmidt considers him capable of replacing [Schmidt's] 
successor, Helmut Kohl. 
  In mid-March, the SPD leadership met in Bonn's "Maritim" 
Hotel for a dinner honoring its former chancellor. The festive 
party was to belatedly celebrate Schmidt's 75th birthday--and 
was surprised by the guest of honor, for notorious SPD-panner 
Schmidt praised his party and its chief, Scharping. And the 
Hanseat forgot all arrogance and even referred by name to 
Palatinate Kohl. 
  "This man must be toppled," Schmidt twice drummed into the 
assembled group. The situation for a turnaround has arrived: 
"There is an SPD that can do it." And turning to Scharping, his 
neighbor at the table, he added: "And there is one who can do 
it." 
  Schmidt, in his unexpected role as campaign fighter, this 
week will present a book of over 200 pages (The Year of 
Decision) which was finished in March--political fast food, 
prepared for "the male and female voters of 1994." The Schmidt 
primer, aggressive, occasionally arrogant in tone, conservative 
in goals, is bursting on the scene in the midst of the SPD's 
program discussion. 
  In the "preface," Schmidt already expounds his judgment that 
in this superelection year, the voters will decide "whether we 
will sink even deeper into the morass of tactical political 
games--or rid ourselves of it": through electing a "different, a 
fresh Federal Government." 
  "This man," meaning Kohl, has "no concept for our economic 
future, no idea for our spiritual future; he can neither turn 
around the mass unemployment caused by him nor put an end to 
violent acts in Germany." 
  The chancellor only pulls his opponents "into the filth of 
his suspicions--that he knows how to do." If Weimar Republic 
conditions should occur and if democracy were harmed, 
then--according to Schmidt's harshest accusation--the chancellor 
is culpable: In February, he accused the Social Democrats of 
"treason against Germany's future," a slogan used in the Weimar 
democracy by the Communists against Social Democrats. 
  A "fresh force" is needed at the head of the state. Schmidt: 
"It offers itself in Rudolf Scharping. This is a man who has 
learned how to govern as the head of government in 
Rhineland-Palatinate and has shown there what he can do." 
  What a change: For years, Schmidt had tormented and nettled 
the comrades, mostly for fun and to the advantage of their 
political opponents. He was constantly quarreling with his party 
and its representatives. During election campaigns, he provided 
only sparse support for Johannes Rau or Hans-Jochen Vogel. 
Schmidt-Cosmos, as comrades named the know-it-all, with lectures 
and books raked in the big money which he, while still in 
political office, begrudged others. 
  Despite all that, or perhaps even because of maintaining 
such 
distance from his own camp, Helmut Schmidt remained a 
media-attractive political pensioner even after moving out of 
the office of chancellor. 
  Now the elder statesman--Scharping at first could hardly 
believe his good luck--just in time before the elections, is 
returning into the arms of his party. The last survivor of the 
legendary Wehner/Schmidt/Brandt triumvirate, in his old age 
might yet be elevated to the position of "grand old man" of the 
traditional party. 
  Schmidt evidently is impressed by Scharping's will to power 
which wants to place the SPD in the center of the voter 
spectrum. No fear of a common ground with the conservatives, but 
distance from the ecological and pacifist movements which have 
changed society and Social Democracy--the former chancellor 
likes that. How often had he complained about the "pack of 
swine" of Brandt's party. Now he feels belated gratification. 
  For the election in the fall, Schmidt would like to see 
strong people's parties, and not overly strong marginal 
parties--FDP [Free Democratic Party] and Alliance 90/Greens. He 
hopes that the extremist fringe parties will stay below 5 
percent. Whosoever, out of aversion to the large parties, seeks 
refuge with the extremists, increases "the probability of a 
grand coalition emerging in the end." He is not comfortable with 
that, but to him--and here he is more outspoken than his 
protege, Scharping--it is preferable to "rainbow coalitions, be 
they led by my own party or by the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]." 
  Schmidt is reappraising even his own ranks. Most striking is 
his differentiated judgment of Oskar Lafontaine. Since the 
latter's pronouncements on the secondary virtues of the 
then-chancellor 12 years ago, Schmidt had vilified and avoided 
him. But at the birthday party in the "Maritim," Schmidt had a 
long conversation with the Saarlander [Lafontaine]; he shares 
the latter's analyses of mistakes made in the rapid introduction 
of the currency union in the course of German unification. 
  With regard to "perceptiveness, eloquence, and capability of 
implementing plans"--all of them secondary virtues--the 
Saarlander resembles Franz Josef Strauss, who also "had not been 
a trained economist, yet still was a good finance minister." "In 
a similar way...one could imagine" Lafontaine "in the same 
office." 
  Once a chancellor, always a chancellor; to hand out grades, 
assign places, he enjoys doing that. But whether such assistance 
helps Scharping, or whether the wondrous discipline in his party 
will get lost when rebellious comrades will soon hold him 
responsible for Mr. Schmidt's dispensed wisdom, remains to be 
seen--at the latest, in the fall.
