<F P=106> [Report signed "Fz": "Wehner Case: CSU Does Not Rule Out </F>
Investigating Committee"] 
  [Text] The Christian Social Union [CSU] group in the 
Bundestag has requested that the GDR contacts of Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] officials Herbert Wehner and 
Karl Wienand be clarified. The CSU does not rule out 
establishing an investigating committee in this connection. 
  In Bonn yesterday, Michael Glos, head of the CSU group in 
the 
Bundestag, said one must clarify the extent to which foreign 
powers had an influence on activities in the old FRG. 
  Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, the widow of former SPD Chairman 
and Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt, who died in 1992, disclosed 
notes of her husband that create the impression Mr. Wehner, who 
died in 1990, was involved in secret cooperation with Moscow and 
East Berlin. 
  With a view to the "confessions" of young Wehner in Moscow, 
which have now become public and in which he denounced comrades 
in Germany during the Stalin era as deviationists, Glos stated 
that it had to be clarified whether the former chairman of the 
SPD Bundestag group was liable to blackmailing. Glos added that 
clarification was also necessary in connection with the 
suspicion that Karl Wienand, Wehner's long-standing Bundestag 
group manager, might have spied for the GDR or the Soviet KGB. 
  Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the SPD, spoke of a 
"campaign" that, considering the treatment of hitherto 
unpublished files, provided a foretaste of the 1994 super 
election year. The SPD's attention was to be deviated from the 
election campaign and its party leadership was to be presented 
in a suspicious light. 
  Former SPD Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel told Cologne EXPRESS 
that Brandt never accused Wehner of espionage. SPD Deputy Klaus 
Lennartz accused Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt of suffering from an 
image neurosis. 
  Wienand rejected the accusation that, regarding Willy 
Brandt's overthrow in 1974, Wehner served the cause of the 
former Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] rulers or 
intercepted Honecker letters to Brandt. Wienand said Wehner, 
who was a member of the German Communist Party until the 1940's, 
used his former contacts to achieve progress in inner-German 
relations.
