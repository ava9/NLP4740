<TEXT>
<P>
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived in this capital Monday night 
on a personal mission to win the release of hundreds of Iraqi-held hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt traveled in a chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry about 250 
people, bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the estimated 400 German 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Also on board were four aides and two tons of medicine for Iraq donated by 
German companies. 
</P>
<P>
The British, Belgian and Dutch governments have criticized the journey, and 
Brandt has been unable to stir up much support outside Germany for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
The German government said it backs the journey even though the 12-nation 
European Community last week stated there should be no negotiations with 
Baghdad on hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has asked Italy to call an EC foreign ministers' meeting out of 
concern that missions such as Brandt's undermine Western resolve against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, honorary head of the opposition Social Democrats in Germany and a Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, says his trip is a private mission and that he is not going 
to Baghdad as a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
