<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "SPD Chief 
Scharping: The CDU Urgently Needs Rest..."] 
  [Text] [BILD] Mr. Scharping, please tell us whom you would 
take into your government as ministers.... 
  [Scharping] Later! In addition to good women and men in 
political offices and functions, we also have excellent people 
in industry, for example: Karl Otto Poehl, Edzard Reuter, 
Manfred Lahnstein, and many others. They are experts! I also 
like to use their technical knowledge. 
  [BILD] What would you do differently if you were in 
government? 
  [Scharping] I would keep the ministers' salaries frozen for 
some time to come, reduce the number of ministries, and appoint 
fewer state secretaries. In the Construction Ministry alone, 
there are three state secretaries -- this is a pure waste of 
money. 
  [BILD] With which partner do you want to implement this? 
  [Scharping] This is a question about a coalition through the 
back door. If the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is 
the strongest party, then the coalition partners will all come 
by themselves. The will to participate in government is in the 
nature of the liberals, but also of the greens. 
  [BILD] ...and of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU]? 
  [Scharping] I want the CDU/CSU to have a period of 
regeneration, which it needs urgently -- and that in the 
opposition...! 
  [BILD] As things look, the next president will be Roman 
Herzog. Will the SPD withdraw Johannes Rau? 
  [Scharping] Johannes Rau is the best candidate for this 
office. In the Federal Assembly, there are enough sovereign 
women and men who orient themselves toward what is best for 
Germany and what is the desire of the overwhelming majority. 
Mr. Kohl initially wanted Johannes Rau, then Mr. Heitmann, and 
now Herzog. The first choice was and is the best. 
  [BILD] Must the more recent history of the SPD be rewritten 
after the revelations of Brandt's notes? 
  [Scharping] No, the accusation that Herbert Wehner did the 
work of the other side is slander. There is no evidence of 
that. Willy Brandt's widow has not done herself a favor. I am 
sad rather than outraged about this matter. 
  [BILD] Will Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt be expelled from the SPD? 
  [Scharping] I do not think that this is an appropriate way 
to settle the conflict. There is a party disciplinary procedure 
underway against her, however; I have no business interfering 
with the responsible arbitration committee.
