<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf </F>
Scharping by Zbynek Petracek; place and date not given: "The 
Time Has Come for a Change"] 
  [Text] Rudolf Scharping is chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] of Germany and is also minister-president 
of North Rhine-Westphalia. He reached the highest echelons in 
German politics only last June, but -- despite this -- the 
majority of the FRG's citizens now consider him to be the next 
German chancellor. He should achieve this goal following the 
elections to the Bundestag in October. 
  [Petracek] You are 46 years old, the same age as Bill 
Clinton when he began his presidential campaign, and the SPD has 
been in opposition for 12 years, the same span of time for which 
the Democratic Party in the United States had to entrust the 
White House to the Republicans. Do you consider Bill Clinton to 
be a specific model for yourself and for the SPD? In which 
sense? 
  [Scharping] Such a direct comparison is always undesirable 
as there are many things that simply cannot be compared. It is 
true, however, that both during the Clinton campaign in the 
United States and now in Germany, many people were and are 
convinced that the time has come for a change in the political 
leadership, that the current government has become worn out, and 
that it has run out of ideas for dealing with the challenges of 
the present and the future. 
  [Petracek] You appear in the media and in public more 
openly, more naturally, more convivially, and more sportsmanlike 
than is normal among the German political elite. Here, too, it 
would be possible to discern a certain similarity to Bill 
Clinton. Is this part of your program? Do you want to thus 
suppress or overcome the distaste for politics often expressed 
among German citizens? 
  [Scharping] Participation in the elections last month and 
also participation and involvement in political activities 
recently have shown that talk about antipathy toward politics 
has been exaggerated. It has been a long time since people were 
interested in politics. There is, of course, indignation toward 
individual politicians and also toward political behavior and 
the means of political decisionmaking. This situation has 
arisen because the truth has been concealed from the people, and 
because "the ratio between value and performance" in politics is 
often discordant. This can only be dealt with by speaking 
candidly and honestly about the general conditions -- which have 
become complicated -- and by seeking a solution to them together. 
  [Petracek] What do you say to the fact that the Czech 
Republic is the last state whose victims of World War II have 
still not been compensated by Germany? 
  [Scharping] The SPD faction in the Bundestag submitted a 
proposal in January 1991 in which it demanded that, in 
connection with the signing of the German-Czechoslovak treaty, a 
foundation be established -- in accordance with the solution 
agreed with Poland -- to benefit the Czechoslovak victims of 
Nazism. Naturally, this also applies under the changed 
politico-state groupings. We must indeed strive bilaterally to 
overcome the traumas of history to the benefit of our common 
future. I am coming to Prague in order to contribute to this. 
  [Petracek] Clinton's election slogan was "change." What 
slogan will the SPD and you personally use to try to win over 
the German voters? 
  [Scharping] The capital "W" of our election campaign stands 
for "Wir" [We], "Wechsel" [Change], and "Wahlen" [Elections], 
because this year's elections to the Bundestag must bring about 
political change so that this country again becomes fit for the 
challenges that lie ahead of us. Our main motto is "certainty 
instead of anxiety" according to the view that Willy Brandt once 
formulated as follows: "Whoever wants to live in certainty 
tomorrow must take care of the reforms today." Our policy is 
oriented toward ensuring that people in this country can be 
certain that their jobs and homes are safe and that they can 
live with their neighbors at home and abroad in security and 
peace. 
<H5>  The Social Wolf and the Taxation Goat </H5>
  [Petracek] Some 70 percent of FRG citizens believe that 
there will be a change in government following the autumn 
elections. However, according to the ZDF television channel's 
"political barometer," only 29 percent of Germans are convinced 
that the SPD would cope with the economic problems better than 
the current government coalition. A substantial difference is 
evident in this issue between Germany in 1994 and the United 
States in 1992. Do you agree with this view? 
  [Scharping] I am skeptical about polls. Therefore, I always 
issue an urgent warning: Do not allow yourself to be overly 
influenced by them in political practice. Incidentally, I could 
also quote to you from polls that ascribe more economic 
proficiency to us than to the current government. We have just 
completed the draft of our policy statement, which we are now 
making available for discussion throughout the country. I am 
certain that our ideas for dealing with the economic problems 
will then gain even greater support than hitherto. 
  [Petracek] According to this draft, another 200,000 social 
apartments, for example, are to be built within two years. At 
the same time, however, payroll and income taxes among the 
lowest and average income categories are to be reduced and -- in 
the event that new enterprises are established -- the 
"improvement of conditions for private stock by means of 
taxation measures" is being taken into consideration. How does 
this go together -- lower income taxes and higher social 
expenditures? Where would your government get the necessary 
resources? 
  [Scharping] The tax burden for 1995, already set by the 
Federal Government, is very high. It must not be increased 
further. Therefore, we are planning changes in favor of economic 
progress and social justice. It is essential to relieve the 
burden on people with low and average incomes, because those on 
the minimum subsistence level are exempt from taxation as 
decreed by the Federal Constitutional Court. We need a fair 
adjustment in expenditures for pan-German recovery. Our 
proposals for appropriate supplementary benefits are on the 
table. It is possible to save money by means of strict 
expenditure discipline and by modernizing the state; we are 
taking this into consideration. Finally, the investment stimuli 
planned by us to create jobs and intended to favor ecologically 
sustainable growth will increase the state's financial scope. 
  [Petracek] The SPD's draft policy statement gives the vague 
impression that it was written by Hillary Clinton: First and 
foremost in the passage "On Equality" where female quotas for 
vocational and training centers -- in enterprises with more than 
50 employees -- and objective support for women in research 
facilities and at universities are envisaged. Do you really 
think that such quotas can lead to genuine equality? 
  [Scharping] The experience of women in Germany has shown 
that equality, if not mandatorily endorsed by a form of fixed 
quotas, is probably unattainable. Since the SPD thoroughly 
implemented its resolution on quotas, equality in our party has 
made a great deal of progress to the benefit of political 
discussion in this country. What applies in politics must also 
be applicable in the world of work to the benefit of women and 
families. 
<H5>  You Must Seek a Relationship With Russia </H5>
  [Petracek] Like Bill Clinton, you are also reproached for 
your lack of foreign policy experience. You yourself have also 
said, in the spirit of the current U.S. President, that "what is 
achieved abroad depends a great deal on what is done at home." 
Nevertheless, despite this, can you define your foreign policy 
priorities? 
  [Scharping] First and foremost, the social and economic 
tasks associated with German unity are the main priority. 
However, it is clear to me that German reunification has 
expanded our foreign political responsibility in Europe and 
throughout the world. We want to place considerable foreign 
policy emphasis -- along with our partners from the European 
Union -- on support for the reform processes in Central and East 
Europe, since we will not be able to cope with these challenges 
without a pan-European perspective. We see another focal point 
in environment and environmental resources policy and in 
reducing the gap between North and South -- it is only possible 
to approach these tasks internationally with the involvement, 
first and foremost, of North America and Japan. 
  [Petracek] It is no secret that there is a dispute within 
the SPD on the possibility of the deployment of Bundeswehr 
units. The issue involves whether German soldiers -- under UN 
orders -- should only take part in peacekeeping operations or 
also in peacemaking missions. What is your view? 
  [Scharping] There was a dispute within the SPD on the 
Bundeswehr's deployment, but we have already reached a 
consensus, which is clear from the resolution approved at our 
recent party congress. According to it, we endorse all the 
operations that the United Nations may carry out on its own 
responsibility; these are primarily peacekeeping missions 
(deployment of the blue helmets). Moreover, the SPD is in favor 
of enforcing embargoes imposed in an attempt to quell military 
flash-points -- should the need arise -- by a blockade. 
Incidentally, I also see an important sphere for cooperation 
between Germany and its neighbors in joint exercises for 
intervention within the UN framework, since the need for UN 
peace missions -- and later, the deployment of CSCE blue helmets 
-- will, by all accounts, increase. 
  [Petracek] In your opinion, should Germany gain a permanent 
seat in an expanded UN Security Council in the future? Under 
what circumstances? 
  [Scharping] We social democrats are of the opinion that, if 
the circle of permanent Security Council members is expanded, 
the important countries and regions of the world must be 
represented. We would give preference to a joint European Union 
seat, which, however, is unfeasible in the foreseeable future. 
Therefore, Germany -- like Japan -- is a candidate for a 
permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The United Nations 
is not setting down special conditions, as the general secretary 
of the global organization has said repeatedly. Of course, it 
is rightly to be expected of Germany that it will contribute to 
strengthening the United Nations in accordance with its 
potential. 
  [Petracek] As the German media have noted, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel did not protest when in November his 
Russian counterpart Kozyrev expressed himself in favor of a 
"German-Russian axis." How would you react in such a situation 
-- as federal chancellor? 
  [Scharping] We are aware of the fears of smaller states that 
the larger ones can reach an agreement behind their backs. Such 
uneasiness was manifested particularly strongly during the 
period of German reunification -- and definitely not only in the 
Central European states to the east of us. At that time, 
Germany undertook to deal responsibly with its increased 
influence, and respect for the interests of our neighbors forms 
the main part of this. On the one hand, it is clear that it 
would have been impossible to achieve peace and security in 
Europe without cooperation with and the understanding of Russia. 
On the other hand, however, it is just as clear that a German 
agreement with Russia would certainly not suffice to guarantee 
stability in Europe. Thanks to the stabilizing influence of 
democracy, the Central European countries are appearing 
self-confidently on the international arena, which is also 
leading them into a situation in which they must again seek a 
relationship with the Russian Federation. West European or 
German policy cannot replace this, but can only support it. 
<H5>  What Social Dumping Means </H5>
  [Petracek] In your interview for DER SPIEGEL, you pleaded 
for "more social justice." How do you intend to achieve this 
aim since the possibilities of the welfare state have now been 
virtually exhausted? 
  [Scharping] I have already mentioned that we are planning 
changes in the system of taxes and levies, which will lighten 
the burden on people with low and average incomes. Our 
intention to pay the same allowance of 250 German marks for each 
child, instead of the current system of allowances exempt from 
taxation, will also lead to greater social justice. By 
implementing changes in housing construction it is also possible 
to attain the strong support of those who are really dependent 
on it. In the final analysis, our views on modernizing the 
state also concern our social security systems -- there will be 
less red tape and the distance from the citizens will be 
lessened. The "welfare state" is not to be used freely, but it 
must be reformed in keeping with the times. 
  [Petracek] In the same interview, you also said that there 
would be no social democracy in Germany without the SPD -- not 
as a political trend (Sozialdemokratie), but as a specific type 
of democracy (soziale Demokratie). Can you explain this 
semantic difference? What is the difference between social 
democracy and democracy without attributes? 
  [Scharping] I consider renewing social democracy in Germany 
to be a fundamental task of political social democracy. No one 
is denying that our country is arranged democratically, but the 
social aspect of our statehood has come up too briefly in recent 
years. Redistribution from the bottom upwards is more than a 
slogan; it is a sad reality provable by the figures. In a 
social democracy there should be tasks that belong to the common 
interest that are commonly shared and financed. Incidentally, 
this is a constitutional requirement in our country, since the 
market economy itself cannot now guarantee social justice. 
  [Petracek] You use the word "social" very often. What do 
you think of the concept of "social -- or rather, ecological -- 
dumping," especially since the SPD is concerned, first and 
foremost, with employment and cheap labor in Central and East 
Europe may threaten jobs in Germany? 
  [Scharping] If the low price of the goods offered is derived 
exclusively from the fact that these products come from 
enterprises that cause great ecological damage and whose 
employees have to work in undignified conditions, then I speak 
about ecological or social dumping. Therefore, we are striving 
for international agreements on minimum social and ecological 
standards. However, do not view this as a pretext for 
protectionism, which is harmful to all economies.
