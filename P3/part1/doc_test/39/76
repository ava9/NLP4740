<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and President Bush, caught in a tightening vise 
of confrontation, face war-or-peace choices as the American military buildup 
mounts in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Both have stuck doggedly to their tough positions over the nearly 3 1/2 months 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with Bush building a political and military 
wall around Iraq and Hussein holding onto the oil sheikdom like a bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
With the American deployment of up to 240,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf 
expected to tip the military balance firmly in favor of the United States 
within two months, talk of a diplomatic solution is on the rise. But it is a 
course full of pitfalls for both sides -- with no assurance of success. 
</P>
<P>
If a deal is to be struck, probably under the cover of intra-Arab negotiations 
that have yet to get off the ground, the formula will be delicate and neither 
side will get what it set out for. 
</P>
<P>
For Iraq, Hussein faces an implied timetable for withdrawing his troops from 
Kuwait or risking U.S. attack. His previous open-ended strategy of 
delay-and-discuss may be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Milton Viorst, an author who has written extensively about Iraq and the 
Middle East, said the most likely resolution of the conflict would spring from 
recognition by Hussein that he is outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not going to win anything until Bush makes the decision that this has 
got to be a diplomatically resolved problem," Viorst said in an interview in 
Washington. "(But) he is not going to cave in to Bush unless there are some 
negotiations. He will not accept an ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
In a standoff, some options will look better than others to Baghdad: 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq will continue to divert international attention from the anguish of 
occupied Kuwait by talking peace and dealing out some of the thousands of 
Western and Japanese captives held in Iraq and Kuwait as insurance against 
military attack. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign political personalities have streamed to Baghdad in recent weeks in 
hopes of persuading Hussein to release some hostages. Some, like Britain's 
former Prime Minister Edward Heath and Germany's ex-Chancellor Willy Brandt, 
declared that they are prepared to go again and said that Hussein's position on 
Kuwait has its points. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad could be expected to continue its attempts to split the 
international coalition opposing it, particularly the five permanent members of 
the U.N. Security Council. Any one of the five could veto future resolutions 
tightening the economic and military stranglehold on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Kemp, a senior associate at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment 
for Peace, said there has been "an indication that (Hussein) is inching toward 
dialogue." He theorized that Hussein could pull his army out of Kuwait city 
into the northern portion of the sheikdom, which he said would "put pressure on 
Bush to lift the (trade) embargo" sanctioned by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, Hussein could hang on, he said, adding: "His advisers may be 
saying to him, 'Time is on our side. Bush may want a war, but he's going to be 
stopped by all sorts of people.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Economically and militarily, there is little that Hussein can do to better 
his position. He has called up every possible reserve, including men in their 
50s who survived the war that the president launched against Iran in 1980, one 
year after consolidating power in Baghdad. The successful trade embargo has 
blocked any chance of large-scale weapons imports, but military analysts credit 
domestic weapons production with war-proven resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the next two months, the embargo is expected to grind at the 
general economy, damaging the transport and industrial sector dependent on 
imported spare parts and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of the pain surfaced late last month when Iraq imposed gasoline 
rationing. A week later, the government declared there had been a mistake in 
calculations and fired the oil minister, who had said the lack of imported fuel 
additives was restricting supplies. The unpopular rationing plan was lifted, 
and Hussein's son-in-law was named to replace the minister. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of food imports presents difficulties, but in a regimented society, 
the 17 million Iraqis grumble privately and make the sacrifices demanded by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
* The key option open to Hussein is to deal. Iraq's pre-invasion demands were 
clear: Hussein wanted full control of the Rumaila oil field it shared with 
Kuwait and possession of two Kuwaiti islands that hinder access to the Persian 
Gulf from the Iraqi port of Umm al Qasr. 
</P>
<P>
Those demands, which many Arab leaders euphemistically term "Iraq's legitimate 
rights," would be central to any deal. 
</P>
<P>
When Arab leaders call for a summit, they are talking about such a deal, not 
about Hussein's grandiose proposals to solve the problems of the entire Middle 
East. The suggestion is that Hussein has a price -- and it is the oil field and 
the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a proposition might be banged out in the name of Arab unity, it 
would mark a political letdown for leaders on both sides of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein would have to give up Kuwait, which he has declared Iraq's 19th 
province. Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states would not escape the shadow 
of a continuing threat from ambitious Baghdad. Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, now locked in a feud with the Iraqi strongman, would face an ascendant 
Hussein in the struggle for leadership of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Arab Iran, itself eager to control the gulf, would be competing with an 
Iraq with greater access to its waters. Israel, with the only armed forces 
rivaling Baghdad's in the region, would be looking at an Iraqi military with 
its fangs intact. 
</P>
<P>
And the rulers of Kuwait, their state looted of its fabled treasures, could 
only tremble. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Cobban, a scholar at the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a 
Washington-based organization working for Arab-Israeli reconciliation, 
estimated that there is a 60-40 chance that Hussein would withdraw his forces 
in coming months if he sees the military balance as unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to still give him a favorable way out -- which doesn't mean we give 
him chunks of Kuwait, but we give him some assurance that we are not going to 
track him down to a bunker in Baghdad," Cobban said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he sees himself surrounded . . . if his regime is going to be dismantled 
anyway, he's going to make sure the U.S. comes down with him."
