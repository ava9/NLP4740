FOR SOCIALISTS IN GERMANY, EMPTY STREETS;

<P>
With flags flying and loudspeaker blaring, the bright little car trundled 
optimistically into this eastern German farming community -- a one-vehicle 
caravan dispatched to spread the socialist message among those preparing to 
vote in Sunday's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one problem: the streets were empty. 
</P>
<P>
Stopping only long enough for a few curious residents to peer out their windows 
and see the letters "SPD" -- Social Democratic Party -- on the flags, the car 
spewed forth a brief, indecipherable message followed by a few bars of heavy 
"oom-pah" music, then exited as it came. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a fleeting moment in a long campaign, the incident in many ways 
captured the poorly organized, occasionally farcical effort that has 
characterized the Social Democrats' attempt to wrest power away from Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition. 
</P>
<P>
This disorganization is part of a wider set of problems plaguing the 
traditional party of Germany's moderate left, turning what by rights should be 
its hour of triumph into an electoral struggle that carries all the earmarks of 
an impending disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Former Social Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt dismayed his party colleagues 
as much by the truth as by the lack of tact in his recent comment to a Dutch 
newspaper that not only would the party lose the first free all-German 
elections in nearly 60 years next Sunday, but it deserved to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upbeat rhetoric of the party's ill-chosen chancellor candidate, 
Oskar Lafontaine, leading political opinion polls show that with the election 
only days away, the Social Democrats trail Kohl's Christian Democrats by 10 to 
12 percentage points and the combined total of Kohl's coalition parties by as 
much as 22.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
"No one with such a large lead has ever before been overhauled," said Reichard 
Schneider, an election pollster at the INFAS opinion survey organization in 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of contemplating victory, the SPD officials are considering the very 
real prospects of their worst drubbing since the party was revamped into a 
mass-based party in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Just over a year ago, they exuded confidence. The party was level or ahead of 
Kohl's Christian Democrats in the West German opinion polls, and its leaders 
spoke confidently of a built-in majority among the predominantly northern, 
Protestant -- and traditionally socialist -- regions of eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It was a majority that would likely ensure the party's dominance for decades 
once unification occurred, they believed. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of guaranteeing the Social Democrats power, the unification process 
brought a series of setbacks that, collectively, completely reversed party 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
The problems first surfaced a month before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 
November, 1989, when a group of East Germans founded an eastern Social 
Democratic Party in defiance of the Communist authorities still in power there. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure at that point if the East German Communist regime would survive, the 
party's western leadership hesitated for weeks before extending its official 
recognition to the new group. This move poisoned relations between the party's 
eastern and western wings after the subsequent Communist collapse, and it 
remains a sore point, inhibiting meaningful cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Such hesitation characterized later moves. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to forsake years of carefully constructed political contacts with 
East Germany, the West German Social Democrats found themselves both incapable 
of adjusting to the speed of unification and hopelessly out of touch with the 
public mood in the east. 
</P>
<P>
They argued for a slow, deliberate course toward unity when most East Germans 
wanted it immediately. They tried to put off national elections when East 
Germans wanted them soon. They stoked fears about the huge costs of unity when 
the nation wanted most to savor its reunion. 
</P>
<P>
As Kohl sensed the moment and threw himself behind unification, Lafontaine 
seemed to resist events. 
</P>
<P>
The results were disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of winning the East German national elections last March as they 
assumed they would, the Social Democrats won only 21.8% of the vote and were 
crushed by the Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the SPD lost local government elections and in an October vote managed 
to gain power in only one of the five new federal states created from what had 
been East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The dismal showings have only deepened differences within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Serious, sometimes open, clashes over policy and tactics have left Lafontaine 
isolated from the party's mainstream and adopting almost a flip, uncaring 
attitude in the final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
An April assassination attempt against him also left Lafontaine noticeably more 
detached from the political debate. 
</P>
<P>
While Lafontaine, despite the party's difficulties, has drawn well in western 
cities nearer his Saarland home, Social Democrats' efforts in eastern Germany 
have been hampered by the sense of futility that characterized the party's 
recent foray into this small village. 
</P>
<P>
On the Magdeburg city square, where 70,000 greeted former Social Democratic 
Chancellor Willy Brandt last December, barely 1,000 turned out for Lafontaine 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of Stalinism should have begun a decade of social democracy," a 
senior party official in Bonn said recently. "Instead, there will be a search 
for scapegoats, for what went wrong and for a new identity."
