Germany's SPD

When Mr Rudolf Scharping chose a cavernous indoor ice-rink on the outskirts
of Halle, in eastern Germany, as the venue to launch his campaign last
Wednesday for the German chancellery, he was taking a calculated risk.
Not only was this monument to east Germany's former obsession with sports,
with its banks of orange plastic seats screwed to concrete benches, a
terrible place for a big set-piece speech, even to the party faithful. It
was more than that.
Halle, once capital of a sprawling chemical industry, now ravaged by
unemployment, is in the throes of an election campaign for a new parliament
and government in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The voters go to the polls
tomorrow. So Mr Scharping, the neatly bearded, 46-year-old leader of
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), was putting his
election-winning reputation on the line.
Four months ago, he looked a good bet. Mr Scharping and the SPD were riding
high, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was trailing in opinion polls, the economy was
still in the doldrums, and the conservative-liberal coalition government in
Saxony-Anhalt was in disarray after the resignation of its premier and three
ministers in a scandal over inflated salaries.
The Halle party conference to endorse Mr Scharping as the candidate for
chancellor was just what was needed, the party strategists declared. It
would secure a resounding win in the state election, and set Mr Scharping on
his way for the chancellor's office come the general election in October.
This week, it all looked like a very risky gamble. It is Mr Scharping and
the SPD who are now falling behind, after a damaging defeat in the June 12
European election. Local elections on the same day in Saxony-Anhalt saw Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) still in front of the SPD, in spite
of the salary scandals, although only by a narrow 1.5 percentage point
margin (by 31.2 per cent to 29.7).
Yesterday's national Politbarometer opinion poll, broadcast by ZDF
television, put the CDU on 40 per cent nationally, to just 36 for the SPD.
As for Mr Scharping, he is trailing Mr Kohl in the race to be the next
chancellor by 48 per cent to 41 - a reversal of their fortunes at the turn
of the year.
On Wednesday, the mood on the ice-rink was grim. Yet everyone knew they had
to put on a good show. Mr Scharping rose to the challenge. He delivered a
storming speech, in complete contrast to his normal wooden, preachifying
style. He mocked the 'fat man' in the chancellor's office, denounced the
inequities of west German materialism and east German joblessness, and told
his detractors in the party to 'put up, or shut up'.
The question is whether his newfound fury has not come too late. For the
tide seems to be running against the SPD, in both east and west. The party
has been unable to make a clear political breakthrough, in spite of still
rising unemployment and last year's sharp recession, and even against a
chancellor like Mr Kohl, who has never been genuinely popular. Many question
whether the SPD's malaise is not more fundamental than a question of
policies, or of personalities.
'This is a very difficult time for social democracy,' says Mr Jurgen
Burckhardt, director of the Friedrich Ebert foundation, the SPD think tank.
'It is very difficult to formulate policy under our changed circumstances,
because you can only tell people unpleasant things.'
In areas such as the extension of social benefits, or the protection of
lower income groups - classic social democratic themes - the SPD now admits
that public funds are not adequate to the task.
Yet in seeking to be realistic and blunt about the financial possibilities,
it is alienating both its traditional voters and new, more prosperous
groups. 'The main themes for which social democracy always stood, and their
main voters, are no longer recognisable,' says Mr Karl-Rudolf Korte, head of
the Germany political science research group at the University of Mainz. 'If
everything comes together in a great middle-of-the-road coalition, where
will be the specific themes for the SPD?'
Ever since he was elected leader just one year ago, Mr Scharping has sought
to move his party towards the middle ground, to present it as a safe and
stable alternative government, and one which might be more competent
economically.
Yet it is precisely on the question of 'economic competence' that the voters
appear to have lost faith with the SPD. In January, a majority rated the
opposition above the ruling coalition on that question. But as signs of
economic recovery have started to multiply, they have changed their minds.
'The election strategy of the SPD has failed,' says Mr Hans-Joachim Veen,
director of research at the CDU's Konrad Adenauer foundation. 'It was a
defensive strategy which was wrong from the start, saying: 'We are like the
CDU, but rather better.' That meant they were bound to the CDU. They did not
control the themes. They had no profile of their own. And the moment the
economy started to improve, the CDU could only gain.'
The danger for the Social Democrats is that they are looking ever more like
an acceptable party for provincial politics - governing at the state or
local government level - but not for the national capital. All their main
leaders are state politicians.
Mr Scharping's safe, dull and provincial image has only compounded the
impression. 'He presents himself as a younger Mr Kohl,' says Dr Korte.
The irony is that the two may yet be condemned to govern together. For even
if Mr Kohl emerges victorious, as the latest polls suggest, the electoral
mathematics suggests he will not command a majority with his current
coalition. The Free Democratic party, Mr Kohl's current partner, is weak,
and may barely scrape back into the Bundestag.
As far as the social democrats are concerned, their strategists seem already
to be prepared to contemplate a setback in October.
'I am convinced Scharping has a chance in the medium term, even if he does
not make it this autumn,' says Mr Burckhardt. 'Halle convinced me. He has
got what it takes. This man is 46. And look how long it took Willy Brandt.'
Mr Brandt became chancellor at 55.
