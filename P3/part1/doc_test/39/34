<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday protested to Russia after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev was forced to
cancel an Italian trip, Reuter reports. The former Soviet president, barred
from travelling abroad after refusing to testify about the ex-Soviet
Communist party, said he cancelled the 10-day trip to avoid a confrontation
with Russian authorities. Mr Gorbachev was granted a passport on Tuesday but
only allowed to use it to travel to Germany for the funeral of former
chancellor Willy Brandt.
