<F P=106> [Heinz Vielain report: "Chancellor Kohl: SPD Has Sinned </F>
Against German Unity"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to notes made by the Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany [SED], the candidate for chancellor and 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], Rudolf 
Scharping, spoke out for the "realization of the Gera demands" 
in secret talks with SED Politburo member Hermann Axen in 1987. 
The Gera demands contain the recognition of GDR [German 
Democratic Republic] citizenship, which would have meant 
cementing divided Germany. The same source says that current SPD 
Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and former SPD Chairman Bjoern 
Engholm also had secret talks with GDR politicians in the late 
80's, during which they promised to fulfill important SED 
demands. 
  An official SED Central Committee protocol on Scharping's 
talk with Axen says: "R. Scharping spoke out for the 
realization of the Gera demands and immediate official contacts 
between the People's Chamber of the GDR and the FRG Bundestag." 
  The "Gera demands," which SED Chairman Erich Honecker 
formulated on the opening of a "party course in Gera" in October 
1980, contain the following points: 
  -- Recognition of GDR citizenship; 
  -- Abolition of the central registration center for human 
rights violations in the GDR (an establishment of the land 
justice authorities in Salzgitter); 
  -- Turning the permanent FRG and GDR representations into 
embassies; 
  -- Defining of the Elbe border (between Schnakenburg and 
Boitzenburg), in the middle of the waterway. 
  Rudolf Scharping, who was then SPD Chairman of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, paid an official visit to the GDR with a 
delegation of his land's party in 1987. The meeting with Axen 
took place on 27 October in the building of the SED Central 
Committee. 
  About the recognition of the Gera demands by Scharping, the 
protocol of the SED Central Committee, which has been made 
available to WELT AM SONNTAG, says that Axen "agreed" with 
Scharping on this and other issues. Axen said that, for the 
SPD, it was important not to let the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] and Christian Social Union [CSU] take away the fruits of 
the new Ostpolitik initiated by Willy Brandt. Axen was a member 
of the presidium of the SED Central Committee. It was also he 
who, in 1987, worked out the joint SED/SPD program paper on the 
"dispute of ideologies and common security," together with the 
leading Social Democrats Erhard Eppler and Egon Bahr. 
  Another Central Committee note on a meeting between the 
current deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and Erhard Honecker 
on 23 October 1987, which has also been made available to WELT 
AM SONNTAG, says that Lafontaine advocated an "absolute 
recognition" of a two-state Germany. According to the official 
protocol, the SPD politician said: "Taking account of GDR 
interests and absolutely recognizing two states, he thinks it is 
necessary to find out what steps are possible in the future. In 
the FRG, there is a general consensus that a two-state Germany 
is a reality that nobody can ignore." 
  According to the protocol, Honecker had said that all 
illusions about reunifying the two German states must be 
decisively rejected. As to Lafontaine, the protocol notes 
"agreement." The document then notes Lafontaine's statement as 
follows: "In his view, it would be good to develop common ideas 
in the future, as to what agreements a government led by the SPD 
could aim at with regard to the GDR." 
  Another protocol by the SED Central Committee reports on a 
meeting SPD politician Bjoern Engholm had with leading SED 
politician Hermann Axen on 6 April 1987, during which 
recognition of the GDR as a state was also discussed. Engholm 
was a member of the SPD Executive Committee and head of the SPD 
land parliament group in Schleswig-Holstein. 
  According to the protocol, Engholm said that the relations 
between the FRG and the GDR require a clearing away of existing 
basic problems. The SED protocol quotes Engholm as saying: 
"The SPD must speak out for the recognition of GDR citizenship, 
for the midstream Elbe border, and the abolition of the 
Salzgitter registration center. Both German states have a 
historic responsibility for peace. But bigger problems can only 
be solved if the existing obstacles are finally cleared away." 
  A severe dispute broke out at the weekend between Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister President, 
Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate for federal president, on 
documents saying that Rau received election assistance from the 
SED in 1987, in order to replace Chancellor Kohl as head of 
government. 
  These documents, which have been made available to WELT AM 
SONNTAG, indicate that a kind of barter business took place 
between the SPD and the SED on the eve of the January 1987 
Bundestag elections: The SED stops the flood of asylum seekers 
from Sri Lanka at the German-German border, which Kohl's 
government had tried to do in vain. In return, the SPD assures 
the SED of accepting the GDR's sovereignty. The SPD mediator 
was Egon Bahr. Election campaigner Johannes Rau could announce 
that the flood of asylum seekers via the Berlin-Schoenefeld 
airport was stopped on 18 September 1986, as the result of 
personal and persevering efforts. 
  In an interview with SAT-1 television network, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl said that the files that have now been published 
show who had mentally "defected" to former SED Chairman Erich 
Honecker. What becomes known about SPD policy, is "utterly 
disgraceful." He said he does not know of any statement by SPD 
presidential candidate Johannes Rau clearly rejecting the idea 
of a GDR citizenship. 
  The chancellor emphasized that he does not want a "dirty 
campaign." But especially as a presidential candidate, Rau 
would have to face the files that have now been published. 
  In an interview with the Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio 
station 
on Saturday [5 February], Rau rejected Kohl's comments: He said 
he has not made any concessions whatsoever to the GDR. In his 
speeches and in the government program, he always recommended to 
"respect GDR citizenship on the basis of the constitution." He 
said the CDU apparently wants to "create suspicions." He 
appeals to all parties to return to an election campaign where 
"the dirty work is not left to the dung beetle." 
  SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen accused Chancellor Kohl of 
"character assassination" and demanded an agreement in which all 
parties agree on SED and Stasi documents "not to be used as 
weapons in the election campaign." 
  On Saturday, Chancellor Kohl informed WELT AM SONNTAG that 
he stands by his belief "that the SPD has sinned against German 
unity." Accepting two citizenships would have "equalled the 
expulsion of 17 million Germans." 
  Politicians in the new laender expressed concern about the 
collaboration between West German politicians and the SED. 
Former GDR civil rights activist and present CDU deputy 
Reverend Rainer Eppelmann told WELT AM SONNTAG: "I am not 
saying that Rau should resign because this would be unfairly 
condemning him, which is unworthy of a constitutional state. 
But he has to speak. He must reply to the accusations." 
  Eppelmann is chairman of the Bundestag commission for 
investigations into the GDR past. In a first assessment of the 
goings-on he said: "The human failure in the whole thing is 
that leftist democrats of the Federal Republic of Germany seem 
to have been involved in shady dealings with leftist dictators 
in the GDR, regarding the FRG center politicians as opponents. 
It must be made clear that this never happened." 
  SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who comes from eastern 
Germany, told WELT AM SONNTAG he thinks it is advisable that the 
clarification of the dealings "be assigned to political 
scientists and historians at first." In this connection, the 
accusation that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang 
Schaeuble promised a redefinition of the Elbe border during 
government talks on halting the flood of asylum-seekers from the 
GDR would also have to be discussed. Schaeuble had denied this 
accusation. 
  Thierse accused the CDU/CSU of being afraid of an "objective 
election campaign." This is why "past events are brought up, 
with the intention of triggering heated disputes and diverting 
attention from the real problems, such as unemployment and 
national debts." He said he finds this "mean." 
  CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Manager Juergen Ruettgers told WELT 
AM SONNTAG that it is "absolutely necessary to inform citizens 
about all the details of former internal contacts between the 
SPD and the SED, and especially of Johannes Rau's role."
