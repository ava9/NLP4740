Germany's Bertelsmann may be only the second largest international
publishing empire (after Time-Warner), but these days its sounds like the
cat that swallowed the canary.
It is feeling very self-satisfied about landing Mikhail Gorbachev for his
first international trip since he gave up the unequal struggle to hold the
Soviet Union together.
The former Soviet superstar will be spending an entire week in Germany. For,
as well as catching up on a bit of sight-seeing with Raisa, he is there to
plug his new book, The Disintegration of the Soviet Union: My Viewpoint.
Bertelsmann brings the tome out, in German, in April.
With a title like that, and the former Soviet leader's leaden prose style,
it will need all the plugging it can get.
The itinerary includes dinner with Chancellor Kohl (they are on familiar
'du' terms), breakfast with President Richard von Weizsacker, and lunch with
former Chancellor Willy Brandt, the inventor of Ostpolitik.
But the unlikely recipient of three whole days of Gorby's time is Theo
Waigel, the finance minister. As leader of the Christian Social Union in
Bavaria - by far the most conservative and formerly anti-Soviet part of the
ruling coalition - he will have a chance to inflict on Gorbachev the
strangest Bavarian practices at his Munich home.
That means attending the 'Fischessen' - a sort of fish stew bash with beer -
with several hundred CSU luminaries on Friday night, in the cavernous and
hideous Hofbrauhaus, a must for any visiting tourist.
