is growing against the president of the oTV public services union

THE strike banners flap and the pickets cheer as Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies
climbs back into her red Mercedes. The president of the oTV public services
union winks, waves and whirrs off to continue her daily round: a barricaded
bus depot, a closed rubbish dump, and on to a picketed town hall.
The television pictures roll on, scanning heaps of rotting garbage and
traffic jams.
For the past eight days they have presented a neat composite portrait of a
Germany sweating out its first national public sector strike in 18 years,
overlaid with a cameo of a tough, competent union leader - a woman perfectly
at ease in a man's world. One of the boys.
Not quite. Despite the genuine picket-line solidarity and the admirable
efficiency of the strike, 'Our Monika' is in a bit of a jam. Today's battle
with a determined government will probably be followed in short order by a
struggle for her own survival as the only woman leader of a big German trade
union at leadership elections in June.
Her election in 1982 when, as now, the German economy was stuck in a rut and
public spending was under screws, was greeted as a revolutionary change of
tack in the conservative, male-dominated trade union world. As a 40-year-old
middle-class university graduate and former speech writer for ex-chancellor
Mr Willy Brandt, she had broken through the grass-roots ranks of career
unionists cluttering the oTV hierarchy.
Her lack of traditional credentials earned her the epithet 'the faceless
woman'. Surrounding herself with cool-thinking technocrats, she has since
won a reputation within her Stuttgart headquarters as an effective manager
and consensus-builder. She has been rewarded with charges by regional
officials that she has kept too much power to herself; the union, instead of
delegating more control to the regions, has become more centralised and less
flexible.
The value of efficient central control is evident in the meticulous
management of the current strike. But her own plans for reorganisation of
the union, a cumbersome apparatus representing the interests of some 2.3m
white- and blue-collar workers with about 400 different job descriptions,
have made little headway. Accompanying hopes that regional and sectoral
branches would be given more autonomy have been dashed, and resentment is
growing.
She has also shown herself to be out of step with senior leaders of other
unions on key issues. She has hesitated over proposals to restructure and
toughen up the DGB union association, the equivalent of Britain's Trades
Union Congress, and been reluctant to mobilise her members in pursuit of
shorter working hours, the main aim of most unions in the past few years.
More importantly, in the light of the approaching leadership elections, her
critics now accuse her of misjudging the economic and political climate when
she put forward this year's demand on pay and other benefits. The oTV claim,
a package worth almost 11 per cent, was the highest in the current wave of
demands.
'We stumbled into these negotiations as if they were a common-or-garden pay
round,' says Mr Michael Wendl, a senior officer in the Bavaria branch, and
one of her most persistent critics.
Come June, Ms Wulf-Mathies is unlikely to be accused of missing the signals
of dissent from her regional rivals. And anyone thinking of putting in a
claim for her job should be careful not to underestimate the capacities of
the new hierarchy she has built up in Stuttgart, and the picket-line
popularity she has so carefully cultivated during the current strike.
