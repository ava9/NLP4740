The authority of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) party
leader, was challenged yesterday by his rival-turned-partner, Mr Gerhard
Schroder.
Old rivalries between the two men re-emerged as Mr Schroder demanded an
equal say in negotiations with potential coalition members and the process
of sharing out departmental responsibilities in the event of an SPD victory
in the forthcoming federal elections.
Less than a month before the poll and just three weeks since Mr Scharping
recruited Mr Schroder and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Saarland premier, into a
'troika' to lead the party's campaign, Mr Schroder said it was not
acceptable that 'some have to walk while others ride on horseback'. The
party leader was only 'the first among equals', he said.
Opinion poll results had stabilised since Mr Schroder joined the campaign.
Although the SPD was still trailing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats and their Christian Social Union allies, and SPD supporters should
not raise their hopes too high, this showed the troika was already a
success, Mr Schroder said. It had 'stopped the free-fall' in public opinion
towards the party, he told the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung.
Mr Schroder, who was beaten by Mr Scharping in last year's vote for the
party leadership, had joined the ad hoc leadership team after standing aloof
insisting he would fight on his home ground, Lower Saxony. He said yesterday
the right to an equal say in forming a government was an implicit condition
of his agreeing to join.
He once again staked his claim to a 'super ministry' for economics,
transport and energy. It was 'very likely' he would be granted this range of
responsibilities in any SPD-led coalition, he said.
The attempt to pep up Mr Scharping's conservative style with Mr Schroder's
populist aggression and Mr Lafontaine's charisma was widely interpreted at
the time as a sign the party had accepted its leader stood little chance
alone against Mr Kohl.
Now the risks involved in putting three men with such contrasting styles on
the hustings together appear to be emerging. Mr Schroder was recently seen
on television telling supporters that he and Mr Lafontaine had discussed
which jokes they would tell during the campaign and had decided Mr Scharping
should not be allowed to tell any.
While the trio is due to appear together on several occasions before voting
on October 16 - with one open-air outing booked for next Tuesday in
Frankfurt - media attention is still closely focused on Mr Scharping.
Consistent rather than rousing, he is presenting himself as the man of the
middle ground, mimicking the nothing-disturbs-me style of Mr Kohl, in an
apparent attempt to lure the CDU vote. However, his speeches so far have
shown little variation in tone, content or temper.
Bidding to unseat Mr Kohl who is campaigning for his fourth four-year term
after unseating the SPD's Mr Helmut Schmidt, Mr Scharping refers constantly
to the SPD's hey-day leaders, Mr Willy Brandt and Mr Schmidt, as his role
models.
Mr Schroder, meanwhile, has adopted a characteristically more direct and
aggressive style with direct attacks on the chancellor: 'Kohl and Co are
done for. They have got to go.'
