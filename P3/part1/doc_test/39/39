<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Ulrich </F>
Rosenbaum; place and date not given: "Scharping: There Will Be 
No Cooperation With SED Successor Party"] 
  [Text] [Rosenbaum] In Lower Saxony, you have just opened 
the election campaign for the super election year. Will it be a 
year of punches and jabs? 
  [Scharping] No. The Social Democrats are interested in 
advocating their factual positions and in seeking a 
confrontation with the government when it arises from the 
factual positions. 
  [Rosenbaum] What are the main topics? 
  [Scharping] Combating unemployment, new economic growth that 
is compatible with the environment, modernizing the economy, 
relieving labor of the costs that have nothing to do with 
employees, reconstructing the east -- this is the business of 
the community as a whole -- the housing shortage, and 
eliminating other social injustices. 
  [Rosenbaum] In view of the new threats from the East -- 
keyword Zhirinovskiy -- might the voters not finally prefer to 
leave the present Federal Government in office? 
  [Scharping] Why? The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] is currently the only party that can present a consistent 
foreign policy concept, which is completely in the tradition of 
the foreign policies of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. The 
key words are European integration, development of a new 
Ostpolitik that also has economic and employment policy 
prospects, and, now as before, close friendly relations with the 
United States of America. In the field of European integration, 
the chancellor's basic policies are supported by the SPD. But 
he is becoming increasingly lonely in his own party. By the 
way, however, I cannot imagine that the Bundestag elections will 
be very strongly influenced by foreign politics. U.S. President 
Bush, who was voted out of office shortly afterward, also 
indulged in this illusion. 
  [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union] has now agreed on Roman Herzog as 
candidate for the president's office. Do you still proceed on 
the assumption that the majority of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] electors will vote for Rau? 
  [Scharping] I proceed on the assumption that in the Federal 
Assembly there are, independent of party membership, enough 
autonomous women and men who will make their decision for 
Germany's best benefit. And the best for this office is clearly 
Johannes Rau. 
  [Rosenbaum] Are you pleased that the FDP has postponed a 
statement on a coalition to September and will possibly not make 
one at all? 
  [Scharping] At any rate, this shows that the coalition is no 
longer internally consistent and the FDP is thinking. However, 
my concern for the partners in the coalition is limited and the 
FDP has to make its decision itself. I will watch this with 
interest. 
  [Rosenbaum] What about the secret agreement with Joschka 
Fischer that a Red-Green coalition is to be formed? 
  [Scharping] Journalists never report things that are 
incorrect. At most, they sometimes make mistakes. As far as 
this matter is concerned, I am interested in gaining voters for 
the SPD from all other parties. 
  [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU called on you to clearly dissociate 
yourself from the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. What 
about it? 
  [Scharping] There will be no cooperation between the SPD and 
the PDS. For the Social Democrats, the PDS is not just a normal 
political opponent, but the direct successor organization of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], from which we totally 
dissociated ourselves. By the way, the reproach from the ranks 
of the CDU/CSU is an absurd reversal of the situation. In 
eastern Germany there are several examples of the CDU hoisting 
PDS people into public office and, on the other hand, availing 
itself of the PDS support to deny public office to the Social 
Democratic winners of the Brandenburg election to the advantage 
of members of the old bloc parties and old friendships between 
the CDU and the PDS. If the exhortations addressed to the 
Social Democrats are to be even slightly credible, the CDU would 
have to expel people who make common cause with the PDS. 
  [Rosenbaum] These days its own past is, once again, catching 
up with the SPD. I mean the accusations against Wehner [former 
chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group]. You could simply say: 
Why should this affect me? All that happened long before my 
time.... 
  [Scharping] I specifically do not say this. Someone who 
bears responsibility for a party does not dissociate himself 
from the history of this party. I do not see any reason at all 
to rewrite history in any way. Herbert Wehner intensively 
advocated the growing together of the Germans, decent 
humanitarian conditions, and concrete help. This is of lasting 
value. The historians are to examine the rest. However, it is 
not a topical political question. 
  [Rosenbaum] The parties have come to an agreement on the 
question of the move of the capital. Will there be peace now 
and will the decision in the major round be final? 
  [Scharping] Yes. I am personally satisfied with the result, 
as far as the German Bundestag and compensation for the Bonn 
region are concerned. However, I add the following: From my 
point of view, the Federal Government can move earlier. It will 
take a relatively long time and it absolutely has to be 
connected both with the question of costs and the modernization 
of the government work itself. 
  [Rosenbaum] If you were chancellor, would you raise these 
questions anew? 
  [Scharping] Yes, then I would be able to do so because all 
these are questions whose organization is controlled by the 
Federal Government and the chancellor.
