FT  25 SEP 92 / Germany charges spy with treason

<TEXT>
Germany yesterday charged communist spymaster Mr Markus Wolf with spying and
treason for running at least 12 agents against Bonn during the cold war,
including one who brought down Chancellor Willy Brandt, Reuter reports.
The prosecutor's office said Mr Wolf, who headed East Germany's spy network
from 1953 to 1986, had up to 600 agents in West Germany.
Germany's constitutional court has yet to rule whether Bonn can try East
Germans for espionage, since they acted within the laws of a sovereign state
and did much the same work as West German spies.
