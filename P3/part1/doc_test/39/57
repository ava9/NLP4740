Erich Honecker, who personified the intransigence of communism during the
1980s, died yesterday of cancer in the Chilean capital, Santiago, his home
since January 1993. He was 81.
The former East German leader, who started life as a roofer and spent years
in prison as an opponent of Nazi Germany, left for exile after the collapse
of his trial in which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13
East Germans on the border with West Germany. His orders for border guards
to shoot at escapees, which resulted in 190 deaths, had led to a warrant for
his arrest in November 1990 after German unification.
German television brought almost hourly updates during the court case and
even boarded the aircraft that took him to Santiago after judges in Berlin
ruled he was too ill with liver cancer to stand trial.
By then pale and wizened, fascination with the man, seen by many as the East
German Politburo member responsible for the building of the Berlin Wall,
only faded after he had retired to his daughter's house halfway around the
globe.
He was born a miner's son in the Saarland, Germany's southwestern state.
Both his parents were members of the Communist party and the young Honecker
distributed party pamphlets at the age of eight and joined the Young
Spartacus Union, a children's communist organisation, aged 10.
He went on to join the Communist party in 1929, studied in Moscow, and
worked under various aliases to expand the party in Germany.
In 1935 he was arrested by the Gestapo charged with high treason and
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
It was Walter Ulbricht, East Germany's first Communist party leader, who
brought Honecker into the central committee after the second world war. He
earned Ulbricht's trust as leader of the Free German Youth (FDJ), the
party's youth wing, during a campaign led by Honecker to destroy all
television aerials which were being used to receive West German television.
Long Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he was given responsibility in the ruling
politburo for military and state security. The top job fell to him in May
1971 after Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with West
Germany.
Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker who had a
reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker.
However the early Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect
by many East Germans as the country's most prosperous. With prompting from
Moscow, relations between the two Germanies were allowed to improve as Willy
Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor, sought to improve ties
between Bonn and Berlin. In this respect Honecker played a crucial role.
Western politicians and businessmen beat a path to his door. A Sunday
afternoon meeting in 1973 over cakes and coffee with the late Herbert
Wehner, Social Democratic whip in the Bonn parliament, led to a series of
high-level meetings with West German leaders.
This two-track policy of strict domestic delimitation from West Germany
while courting the West German political and financial elite was crowned by
the visit to East Germany in December 1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, then West
German Chancellor.
But Honecker was pulled between the West German need for detente and the
Soviet need for legitimising a separate East German national state.
Honecker's desperately poor childhood coloured his outlook on life. On
inspection tours of cramped new East German housing estates he would remark
that workers under the Kaiser could never have dreamed of such superb living
conditions.
He failed to realise that East German workers did not compare their lot with
that of their grandfathers but instead with West German workers whose flats
were larger and equipped with more modern appliances.
Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker had longed to crown his political career
with a visit to Bonn.
Yet, in 1983 and 1984, as Moscow moved from one geriatric Communist party
leader to another, he was prevented from visiting West Germany and it was
only under the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he was at last
allowed to do so.
However, Honecker, increasingly divorced from the reforms which were taking
place in the former Soviet Union and Mr Gorbachev's refusal to intervene to
protect the Communist parties of Eastern Europe against popular uprisings,
in the end found himself up against the very Wall which was supposed to
protect East Germany.
Towards the end of 1989 the people of Leipzig and of East Berlin themselves
demonstrated against the Wall and eventually breached it on the night of
November 8. Honecker had failed to sense the shifting nature of power in
Moscow and in the West. Moscow had dropped him.
