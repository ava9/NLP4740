<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday ordered the release of 108 foreign 
hostages, including 77 Japanese nationals, in an apparent response to appeals 
from visiting delegations seeking to chip away at Baghdad's "human shield" 
against military attack. 
</P>
<P>
The release order also included 20 Italians, five Swedes, two Germans, two 
Portuguese and two Australians, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, 
which announced the partial exemption from a travel ban affecting an estimated 
2 million foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The move followed a controversial series of visits to the Iraqi capital in 
recent days that have caused growing fears among some European leaders that 
individual hostage negotiations could undermine the international coalition 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone held a second day of meetings 
with Hussein in Baghdad on Tuesday, and former West German Chancellor Willy 
Brandt arrived in the Iraqi capital Monday in a visit aimed at winning exit 
visas for all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait. The missions follow similar 
private visits by former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and civil rights 
activist Jesse Jackson. Former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange was 
reported en route to the Persian Gulf region to arrange a meeting with the 
Iraqi president. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, European foreign ministers renewed an earlier stance that 
nations should not negotiate unilaterally to free citizens trapped in Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency credited Nakasone's appeals for the release of the 77 
Japanese and said the decision to free the other foreign nationals was based on 
similar outside requests, including one from a delegation of Swedish Muslims 
and another from a parliamentary delegation from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone met with Hussein again Tuesday to "thank him for Iraq's decision to 
allow a large number of Japanese nationals -- elderly, sick and students -- to 
travel out," the INA said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry listed only 69 Japanese scheduled for release, 
including 19 captives who were part of an estimated 600 foreigners being held 
as human shields at strategic sites to help fend off a military attack. The 
other 50 are Japanese businessmen who were in Iraq at the time of the invasion, 
according to Japan's Kyodo News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters in Tokyo that Japan 
has not tried to secure the release of its nationals through individual 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has already freed about 300 French nationals and smaller groups of other 
Westerners over the last few weeks and has indicated that all foreign "guests" 
might be released under certain conditions, including a commitment from the 
U.N. Security Council's permanent members not to use military action against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone's visit was described as unofficial, and the German government has 
shown only lukewarm public support for the effort by Brandt, whose visit was 
"tolerated but not supported," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt met at a government guest house Tuesday with 150 of the estimated 400 
Germans being detained in Iraq and Kuwait and also with Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz and Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan. He is scheduled to 
meet with Hussein today. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt also met unexpectedly Tuesday with Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, who also met with Nakasone and later told reporters in 
Baghdad that prospects for peace in the region have improved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meeting in Cairo with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, received what he took to be an assurance that 
Beijing would not prevent the U.N. Security Council from authorizing the use of 
military force in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official, reporting on Baker's meeting with Qian, 
said the foreign minister "didn't rule out" Security Council action. As one of 
the five permanent members of the Security Council, China has veto power. 
</P>
<P>
Although China voted for each of the 10 U.N. resolutions adopted so far 
condemning Iraq, the Beijing regime has been very cool to suggestions that the 
Security Council might authorize force. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters before the meeting if China would support military action, 
Qian said: "We'll still have to wait and see, because all the armed forces have 
two roles to play: One is to fight a war. The other is to seek peace." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also conferred with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
