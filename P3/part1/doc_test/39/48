HOSTAGE FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A steady stream of emissaries urged Iraq to release foreign hostages, despite 
concern that direct appeals were undermining the coalition allied against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in Iraq to discuss hostage releases: a former prime minister of 
Japan, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and a delegation of Irish 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
A former prime minister of New Zealand is headed there, as is a former prime 
minister of Denmark and the wives of 10 British hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd reached a 
new military command and control agreement. It guarantees that American troops 
will be under the command of American officers if they launch an offensive 
operation against Iraq. Details of the pact were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened to attack Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led 
multinational force if war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway and its seven escorts entered the Persian 
Gulf. The 75 aircraft aboard the Midway can strike at targets in Iraq or Kuwait 
without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices started the week sharply lower. Crude oil for December delivery on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled $2.04 to $31.96 a barrel at Monday's 
close. The markets were apparently reacting to the Saudi oil minister's 
statement that his country is pumping oil at the fastest rate in 10 years.
