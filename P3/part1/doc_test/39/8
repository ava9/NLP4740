</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Chancellor Willy Brandt, the opposition Social Democrats' senior 
statesmen, bitterly accused Bonn's ruling Christian Democrats on Thursday of 
trampling on the dignity of East Germans during the election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that in East Germany's first free elections, scheduled for 
Sunday, the "bad habits of West German election campaigns have been exported 
into the virgin electoral politics of East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who is honorary chairman of the Social Democrats in both Germanys, 
implicitly singled out Chancellor Helmut Kohl, leader of the Christian 
Democrats, for attempting to intimidate East Germans by playing politics on the 
issue of currency reform. 
</P>
<P>
"East Germans directly affected or worried must be spared a further period of 
torture in limbo and be given clear answers as soon as possible after March 
18," he said, referring to the election. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, a wide range of East German public figures have complained that 
West Germany is more or less taking over the election campaign, and in the 
process treating the local candidates as puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing that issue, Brandt told a news conference in Bonn: "In the coming 
period of transition, it is vital not to hurt the self-esteem of our East 
German compatriots but to strengthen their feeling of being partners worth the 
same as we are." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt also criticized Kohl's attempts to keep other nations' participation in 
German reunification talks to a minimum, including his original plan to bar 
Poland, and his insensitivity on the Polish border issue. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt urged that the talks include all of Germany's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, 76, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic openings to East 
Germany and the Communist Bloc, also differed with Kohl on how German 
reunification might be achieved. Kohl has said repeatedly that the simplest way 
would be for an East German parliament to vote to adopt the West German 
constitution -- in effect, vote for a merger on West German terms. 
</P>
<P>
But Brandt said the best way would be a referendum drawn up and voted upon by 
both German states. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the momentum toward reunification, pushed by Kohl, "the joy that 
the train (of unity) is rolling has become mixed with the worries of those who 
fear falling under its wheels," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who is immensely popular in East Germany, was wheeled into action 
during the final days of the campaign, observers suggest, because recent polls 
show the alliance of conservative parties in East Germany pulling up even with 
the Social Democratic Party, which had previously enjoyed a strong lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the East German conservatives suffered their own setback Wednesday when the 
leader of one of the parties in the coalition resigned after admitting that he 
had been an informant for the ousted Stalinist regime's hated security police, 
known as the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Democratic Awakening Party elected pastor Rainer Eppelmann as 
its new leader. The 47-year-old former peace campaigner took over from 
disgraced ex-chairman Wolfgang Schnur, whom the party voted to expel. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised statement, Eppelmann appealed to voters not to allow "this human 
and political tragedy" to turn them away from Democratic Awakening, which is 
part of the three-party Alliance for Germany backed by Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outgoing four-month-old coalition Cabinet under reform Communist 
Prime Minister Hans Modrow held its last session. It said the economy has begun 
to stabilize despite a continuing drain of workers emigrating to West Germany.
