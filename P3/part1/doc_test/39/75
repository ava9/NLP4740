  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Two days after the Saxony Anhalt 
Landtag election, leading Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] officials spoke out in favor of electing Reinhard 
Hoeppner, the SPD candidate, as new minister president. 
Meanwhile, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] on Tuesday [28 June] warned Hoeppner and the SPD 
against a "popular front alliance" with the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS]. 
  In an interview with STERN magazine, Lower Saxon Minister 
President Gerhard Schroeder (SPD) said that, in the sphere of 
social policy, the PDS was certainly closer to the SPD than the 
CDU on some points. On north German radio, Schroeder said that 
questions of possible forms of cooperation between the SPD and 
the PDS would have to be answered in Saxony Anhalt. 
  In an interview for STERN magazine, Deputy SPD Chairman 
Oskar 
Lafontaine described the CDU warnings against the PDS as 
"impertinent." "After all, it was the CDU that took over the 
East CDU, an affiliate of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, 
and all its assets. Kohl is not only -- what irony of history 
-- Adenauer's grandson but also Honecker's heir," Lafontaine 
said in the interview, parts of which were made available to 
DPA. In Lafontaine's view, there can only be one consequence 
after the election in Saxony Anhalt: "Hoeppner must become 
minister president." 
  For Juergen Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the 
CDU/CSU Bundestag group, the voters of Saxony Anhalt decided 
that the CDU should form a government. In his view, the Saxony 
Anhalt SPD group is under pressure from the federal party. "The 
SPD has broken Hoeppner's backbone," Ruettgers said. The 
discussion on the PDS tolerating an SPD minority government only 
makes sense when "popular front alliances" can no longer be 
ruled out. 
  Similar arguments were brought forth by Johannes Gerster, 
deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, and Michael 
Glos, head of the CSU group in the Bundestag. If the SPD were 
to accept the support of the PDS in the election of minister 
president, then Willy Brandt's words that those things that 
belong together will grow together would become reality in the 
socialist sector, Glos said. Gerster told NEUE OSNABRUECKER 
ZEITUNG that the SPD-Greens minority government, which the SPD 
was seeking, would "directly lead to a popular front alliance." 
SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping and Hoeppner seem to have become 
megalomaniac to believe that the CDU would tolerate a minority 
government between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens, Gerster said.
