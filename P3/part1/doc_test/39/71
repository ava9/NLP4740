<F P=106> [Interview with Rik Coolsaet, deputy chief of cabinet to </F>
Foreign Minister Claes, by Jorgen Oosterwaal; place and date not 
given: "The Eye of Moscow"--first two paragaphs are KNACK 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rik Coolsaet is deputy chief 
of cabinet to Foreign Minister Willy Claes, of the Socialist 
Party [SP]. He has long been the SP's defense expert and was 
appointed recently lecturer in international relations at Ghent 
University. [passage omitted] 
  Coolsaet fully understands why the West is being cautious 
and 
why NATO, for the time being, is not offering East Europe more 
than the Partnership for Peace. A surprising view for a man who 
for more than a decade has been encouraging the Belgian 
Government to adopt a more active and daring Ostpolitik. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oosterwaal] East and West seem ready to tie the bond, but 
because Yeltsin is holding back, it seems we will first have to 
cohabit for a while yet? 
  [Coolsaet] Why should NATO be enlarged? Because we like the 
company of the East European countries? Because we share the 
same values and they belong with us? Or in order to ensure the 
stability of Central and East Europe? NATO is not a cultural 
organization, which means that only the latter reason is valid. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott assumes that 
stability in Europe will de determined by developments in 
Russia. I believe he is right in his assumption. We must take 
full account of Moscow. We must know what the Russians are 
thinking. Why is Russia so against the enlargement of NATO? 
Because it sees it as a move toward a dangerous isolation. 
Since 1917 that has been a permanent fear for the Russians. We 
must not fuel this paranoia. 
  We can draw a parallel with the Ostpolitik of the former 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt. He could only begin his detente 
efforts after he had assured the Russians of the status quo in 
Europe, and thus by acknowledging Russia's place in Europe. 
Another example is the Cuban crisis. U.S. President John 
Kennedy was able to resolve it successfully because he did not 
start bombing immediately but tried instead to understand how 
Nikita Khruschev saw the conflict. 
  [Oosterwaal] The West hopes to keep Yeltsin in place because 
it is horrified by his rival, Zhirinovskiy. But the West has 
little or no influence on Russia's domestic affairs. 
  [Coolsaet] The best guarantee for stability in Europe is a 
democratic Russia. Whatever it takes, we must not allow an 
authoritarian, despotic system to develop in the former Soviet 
Union which would be opposed to the West. But how? By 
supporting the forces for democracy. I also know that our 
impact is very limited. But however limited this influence may 
be, we must at least try. If we believe that Russia is 
automatically embarking on a new imperialist adventure, then we 
cannot hesitate. Then we must enlarge the alliance as quickly 
as possible. But I do not believe that this scenario is 
unavoidable. 
  Russian society consists of a Slavic, nationalist component 
and a Western-oriented component. It has been that way since 
Peter the Great. It is one of the keys to an understanding of 
Russia. Zhirinovskiy is the crystallization of a frustrated 
nation which is feeding off anti-Western Slavic sentiments. His 
success is not surprising. There is great unease in Russia. By 
immediately allowing NATO to extend right up to the borders of 
the former Soviet Union we would be lending force to this 
Slavophile and xenophobic nationalism. As long as the power 
play between the Slavophiles and those who look to the West has 
not been decided, we are right not to enlarge NATO. Because by 
doing so we would be undermining the stability of the continent 
and also of Central Europe. 
  [Oosterwaal] But in the recent past the West already counted 
for too long on a single Soviet leader. 
  [Coolsaet] It is not a question of a single leader, Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, or anyone else. Do not forget that Russia 
has no democratic tradition. Russia has always known autocratic 
government. This has usually been accompanied by a radical 
opposition. This is the second key which we need in order to 
understand anything about Russia. The opposition between 
Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy is a part of this tradition. The only 
real alternative comes from political parties which are born out 
of a pluralist democracy. 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  Coolsaet believes in the need for stability not just in 
Central Europe but throughout the continent. This was evident 
from his lecture at a recent colloquium at Ghent university. "A 
new world order is growing up gradually, leading to more 
pronounced economic regionalism around three major industrial 
poles : NAFTA in America, Tokyo and Peking in Southeast Asia, 
and Europe. West Europe is not in the best of positions at the 
moment. It is surrounded by turbulent regions which are running 
their economies badly. If Europe still wants to count for 
anything in the 21st century then we cannot remain blind to 
developments outside the borders of the Union. I am not only 
thinking of East Europe. In the long term, the stability of 
Africa is certainly equally important," he stated. 
  The situation is thus very clear to Coolsaet: The military 
alone provides for no stability. George Kennan, the father of 
the postwar policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, knew 
this. Stability has much more to do with economic factors and 
the functioning of institutions. The present power vacuum in 
Central Europe is in some ways comparable to the situation after 
the Second World War. The sense of insecurity was relieved by 
linking the economies, via the European Coal and Steel Community 
and later the European Community. This unification brought 
harmony, peace and prosperity. The European Union could thus 
serve East Europe far better than NATO.
