MR Pierre Mauroy, the former French premier, today succeeds Mr Willy Brandt
as President of the Socialist International (SI) at the close of its
emotional three-day congress in Berlin.
Even in his absence the 79-year-old Mr Brandt, suffering from cancer and
confined to his home near Bonn, dominated the gathering of 800 delegates
from socialist and social democratic parties in 132 countries.
Delegates' eyes moistened as the former German Chancellor's welcoming speech
to the congress was slowly read by Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of
the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who succeeded Mr Brandt. It was given
thunderous, standing ovations.
'Dear friends, need I tell you how much I wanted to be with you especially
during these days? But it was not to be,' Mr Brandt's speech began. The
remainder of the address was a testament - summing up his life as a
political refugee from the Nazis, a leader of postwar Germany, the foremost
proponent of East-West detente and influential leader of the SI for 16
years.
He also warned that to tolerate injustice for long was to open the way for
more injustice and appealed to give the United Nations the means it needed
in order to achieve greater influence.
The delegates included noticeably fewer world leaders than in the heyday of
the socialist parties in the 1970s: Ms Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway and
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who called on Germany to regard
the wave of attacks on asylum-seekers as 'red warning signals' and to
prevent a recurrence of the past.
The most remarkable appearance at the congress was by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev,
the former Soviet leader, who addressed the gathering yesterday. He
announced that he would accept the freedom of Berlin on the third
anniversary of the fall of the wall in November along with former President
Ronald Reagan.
