FT  30 APR 92 / Leading Article: Kohl's moment of truth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WISE IMPERTURBABILITY or dangerous insouciance? Mr Helmut Kohl gained a
well-deserved reputation for the former quality as he presided over the
triumphant unification of Germany's two pieces two years ago. But in the
last few days, with his governmental coalition facing a rash of internal
squabbles and a spreading wave of labour unrest, the German chancellor's
unruffled posture has begun to look more like the latter. Either his nerve
is stronger than his current trade union opponents imagine, or he is riding
for a fall that will have worrying consequences throughout Europe.
The challenges are certainly daunting. The last time there were
public-sector strikes on this scale was in 1974, and on that occasion -
combined with a deep malaise in the centre-left coalition - they spelled the
downfall of Chancellor Willy Brandt. In the past few weeks, Mr Kohl has lost
three valued ministers; support for his CDU party is slipping in the polls;
and his government is having increasing difficulty containing spending in
the face of public sector pay demands and the rising costs of unification.
It no longer seems fanciful to ask whether the strains will prove too great
for the traditional, consensual ways of doing business in west Germany to
bear.
Unseemly jockeying
It would be wrong to overdo the parallels with past crises. Undeniably, Mr
Kohl's position has been weakened by the events of this week - especially
the announcement by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the veteran foreign minister,
that he intends to step down next month and the unseemly jockeying between
and within the coalition parties over the succession. Certainly this is
unfortunate at a time when the government's top priority should be - through
responsible fiscal behaviour and the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy - to
tame inflation without plunging Germany into recession.
But there should be no reason for the government to be brought down. Mr
Kohl's smaller coalition partners, the FDP and the CSU, may chafe at the
allocation of ministerial portfolios, but neither of them could seriously
contemplate jumping ship to join forces with the opposition social
democrats. The SPD is, if anything, in deeper disarray than the government
parties. Moreover, the CDU may be unpopular in the polls just now, but it
does not face any elections - at national or regional level - until 1994. As
Mr Kohl is well aware, he has a breathing space of about 18 months in which
to sort out his government's political and economic problems.
Excessive burdens
The important question is how he uses it. For if the chancellor is to
complete the task he began with unification, and engineer the transition to
a market economy in eastern Germany, without imposing excessive burdens on
the west, he will need to break with the style in which he has governed up
to now.
The immediate imperative is to hold the line on public sector pay. No matter
what pressure the unions apply, it would be immensely damaging if the
government were to climb down now from its determination to keep wage rises
below 5 per cent - in terms not just of public spending but also of the
signal such a move would send to private sector negotiators, and to the
Bundesbank.
Beyond that, the government needs to develop a clear and decisive strategy
for controlling its own finances in the face of the spiralling transfers to,
and debts being amassed in, the east. Such a plan is more easily called for
than elaborated, not least because the way revenues and expenditure are
apportioned at present between the federal government and the Lander (many
of them SPD-controlled) provides little incentive for spending reductions.
But Mr Kohl has done it before, in happier times - it was he, after all, who
presided over the marked reduction in Germany's budget deficit during the
1980s.
Running as a common strand through these issues is the need for candour
about the difficulties Germany now faces. The days are long gone when the
chancellor could claim that unification would be complete in a matter of
three to four years; everybody now knows it is a much deeper, costlier and
more enduring challenge. Mr Kohl will not be able to meet that challenge on
his own, but neither can it be overcome without him.
