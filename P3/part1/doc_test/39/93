<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F>
Dirk Koch and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date not given: 
"Red-Green Does Not Frighten" -- ellipses as published] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, do you think that the 
offended reaction of leading Social Democrats, particularly 
Rudolf Scharping, to Johannes Rau's defeat in the presidential 
elections is a good strategy for recruiting new voters? 
  [Verheugen] Our reaction was well-considered. We had enough 
time to think about it.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...because you knew long before the elections 
that Rau would not win.... 
  [Verheugen] ...we did not know it, but we had to assume a 
defeat as being realistic. I am sure that the media criticism 
of our reaction and what the people are thinking are two 
different things. I think it is necessary to tell those who 
want to preserve our state's liberal face that the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is not available for this, but 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is indeed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you accuse the FDP of having been 
consistently loyal to the coalition? 
  [Verheugen] The FDP deceived the public. Even in the days 
and hours before the Federal Convention met, Messrs. Kinkel and 
Solms gave the impression that the FDP was free to decide in 
favor of the candidate who was best suited in the view of 
liberal party. In reality, the FDP was not free. I assume 
Kinkel had promised the chancellor to vote for Herzog long ago. 
On the other hand, the allegedly liberal party is failing in 
its own claim if it votes for the one candidate out of four who 
is the only one who cannot be called liberal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] As former FDP secretary general, can you 
imagine the price that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] had to pay for this voting behavior by 
its coalition partner? 
  [Verheugen] Yes, the at least silent tolerance of a second 
vote campaign for the Bundestag elections. And this will come 
with absolute certainty, because the FDP is now approaching zero 
in the polls. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Since last week, the loser Johannes Rau, 
looking very thoughtful, can be seen on the poster for the 
European elections. Is the appeal "revenge for Rau" supposed to 
make undecided voters enthusiastic for the SPD? 
  [Verheugen] Our strategy is focused on the up to 40 percent 
of voters who are undecided, and there are also those who do not 
yet know whether they are going to vote at all. They see things 
differently than you do. The majority of them wanted Rau. We 
are bringing to the fore the discrepancy between the will of the 
majority of the people and the existing conditions of power, 
which we want to change. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And these arguments are supposed to strengthen 
the SPD after the meager 33.5 percent in 1990? This looks more 
like therapy for the loser than like a recipe for success. 
  [Verheugen] Don't worry. We will not replace our election 
topics with the discussion about the presidential elections. 
This topic will disappear within a relatively short period. 
However, we should be driven out of the Erich Ollenhauer House 
if now, after Rau is again available as a party politician, we 
were to hide a man with his reputation and his popularity in the 
final stage of the European election campaign. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the SPD's course of cozying up to those in 
power now over? 
  [Verheugen] We are not cozying up; we want to replace this 
government. Things are now getting really exciting. The 
conflict will escalate. This is necessary. The voters must 
realize why they should vote for another party. After all, the 
SPD must make a number of voters vote differently at the next 
Bundestag election than at the last election. For this purpose, 
the differences must become clear. The party's profile must be 
worked out quite clearly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This has not been done so far. 
  [Verheugen] I think this is wrong. I was unhappy about a 
few things in the recent past. I have been most unhappy about 
the course of the program discussion. It is conceived as the 
substantiation of a large reform project, for modernization and 
renewal. The program was not taken because of one or two 
conventional issues. It was wrongly defamed as a program of 
adjustment and the blurring of Social Democratic positions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Well, perhaps the paper is not worth much? 
  [Verheugen] The program is a draft that counters the policy 
of the current government. It provides the justification why we 
are making the claim to a change in power and it justifies this 
claim in terms of issues. After all, it is not enough to say in 
a democracy that it is good if power changes every few years. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Chairman Scharping in particular has done 
more to rid the citizens of the fear of a change than to explain 
to them the different policy of an SPD-led government. 
  [Verheugen] This is true to the extent that we have to 
fulfill a complicated dual task. We must free the citizens who 
have not voted for the SPD so far of the fear that an SPD 
Government -- I am deliberately exaggerating -- will open up a 
new chapter in the text books of Marxist Socialism. Therefore, 
over the past months, we have concentrated very strongly on 
social, economic, and internal security. And we must convince 
those who call for a fundamental change in policy. I cite 
topics such as ecological change, the reform of state and 
administration, and the correction of social imbalances. We 
must live up to both demands. We have decided to do one thing 
after the other. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] "Safety Instead of Fear" is the slogan; and 
the SPD poster show a floating boat with father and son, both of 
whom are asleep. Where are they floating to -- perhaps to power 
in the Federal Government? 
  [Verheugen] This is a completely impermissible exaggeration. 
The poster transposes a political demand into an image; nothing 
else. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The slogan sounds as defensive as the picture 
looks sleepy. 
  [Verheugen] I think "Safety Instead of Fear" is an 
aggressive formula: The policy of the current government causes 
fear. The whitewashing of the government and the media that are 
kindly disposed toward it does not change anything about the 
dramatic unemployment, the gigantic debts, and the social 
injustice. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In contrast to your advice, Mr. Verheugen, the 
SPD has not managed to rid the people of the fear of higher 
taxes. 
  [Verheugen] We had to comment on the supplementary tax, 
which is supposed to replace the government's solidarity 
surcharge -- better early than too late before the elections. 
By the way, it means less tax for more than 80 percent of the 
tax payers, not higher taxes. Our central statement for the 
next years is: No higher tax quota with the SPD, but 
redistribution. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This does not reassure those citizens who are 
afraid of a higher payroll tax and more expansive gasoline. 
  [Verheugen] This is correct. Since 1982 the Kohl government 
has put a burden on medium and smaller incomes to ease the 
burden on top earners and companies; here corrections are 
necessary -- therefore, we want the supplementary tax only for 
single people with incomes of 60,000 German marks [DM] and 
couples with incomes of DM120,000; therefore we want tax 
exemption for the subsistence level; therefore we want a limit 
to the advantage of tax splitting, therefore, we want a DM250 
children's allowance for everyone. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why was the SPD suddenly frightened when 
Scharping spoke of burdens for high-wage earners? That is, 
after all, the point. 
  [Verheugen] The concept of who is a high-wage earner in 
Germany differs so much that this term cannot be used 
politically. We did not use it, either. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This Social Democratic confusion of language 
has contributed to attacks on the SPD from all sides. The 
economic associations, by whose support your party leaders felt 
flattered for a long time, accuse the SPD of a mentality of 
redistribution. "I do not know where Mr. Scharping wants to get 
to. I do not know why he is actually in politics," Frankfurt 
functionary Tom Koenigs, a Green reform politician, said. 
  [Verheugen] The reaction by some representatives of industry 
is not typical for the general mood. Party followers have taken 
a stand here. Just let them continue. When they tried it the 
last time, in 1972, the SPD got its greatest victory. That Mr. 
Koenigs is not interested in saying anything positive about 
Scharping is quite obvious. As regards the program: You may 
well trust us to streamline the reform projects contained in it 
in such a way that they become unmistakable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not already too late? At the moment, it 
looks as if Chancellor Kohl has turned the negative trend around. 
  [Verheugen] Don't make me laugh. For more than half a year 
there has been no poll that gives the coalition more than 43 
percent of the votes. Shifts to the benefit of the CDU take 
place at the cost of the FDP. Just wait for the upcoming 
discussions, when unemployment once again raises by 400,000 to 
500,000 on annual average, when the people realize that DM1 out 
of DM4 in the federal budget must be spent on interest and the 
repayment of debts. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What would the SPD have to offer in detail for 
the first 100 days of its government? 
  [Verheugen] Purposeful investment promotion for job creation 
measures, relieving labor of taxes and contributions, more 
flexible work times, and more intensified labor promotion. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This means primarily redistribution of 
existing work, not stimuli for growth. 
  [Verheugen] No, the point is growth and consolidation. We 
want to profoundly transform our economy and society through 
ecological change. Saying simply that we need growth is 
nonsense, because we will not be able to ecologically tolerate 
purely quantitative growth at the level that would be necessary 
to combat unemployment. Therefore, the SPD will not agree to a 
return to nuclear energy. I can compare such a social change 
only with Willy Brandt's great reform project in 1969. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do these prospects for reform not 
automatically result in a preference for a red-green coalition? 
Or do you think that you can implement the ecological change 
more easily in a grand coalition or in an SPD-FDP-Greens 
coalition? 
  [Verheugen] If a coalition is necessary, I would prefer a 
small one, just two parties. The SPD-FDP-Greens coalition is 
not a tempting idea at the federal level. We have already said 
we do not want a grand coalition. I think we cannot -- which 
will be the case -- wage the election struggle claiming it is 
time for a change and then include in the government the very 
people whose politics we want to change. This would make us 
lose our credibility. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does a party that wants to bring about a 
change in power with reforms need a trademark, in this case a 
coalition statement in favor of red-green? 
  [Verheugen] In any case, for a reform-oriented policy we 
need a majority that is ready for reforms. A clear policy 
automatically gets its majority. I am firmly convinced that 
this will also happen after this Bundestag election. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the idea of a red-green coalition still 
give rise to fear in the bourgeois camp? 
  [Verheugen] I assume that red-green no longer frightens 
anyone at the federal level, either. This is quite clearly 
shown by election results and polls. We have good reasons to 
want an election result that offers us options. Which option is 
then chosen depends on how we can best implement our policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you think of reforms that would be easier 
to implement with the FDP than with the Greens? 
  [Verheugen] If I look at the current Bundestag group and at 
the FDP leadership, I do not see at all where one can still 
expect any readiness for reform in this party. However, one 
must not forget: The most important thing for the FDP is 
participation in government. Being the second or third 
strongest opposition party would be an existential risk for it. 
This might force the FDP to pay high prices for participating 
in an SPD-led government. The ecological changes could 
certainly be implemented more easily with the Greens. However, 
they too must move from unrealistic positions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you imagine that the FDP might get enough 
votes for a majority with the SPD but not with the CDU/CSU in 
the autumn? 
  [Verheugen] At the moment I see the FDP somewhere on the 
fringe. I do not even see it back in the Bundestag. The second 
vote campaign of the FDP, which I assumed will be at the cost of 
the CDU/CSU, and raises our prospects for becoming the strongest 
party. Purely in terms of numbers, neither of the two people's 
parties currently has the opportunity for a coalition with the 
FDP. However, this is really bad only for Kohl. He can no 
longer assemble a majority. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How long do you want to keep your voters 
waiting? 
  [Verheugen] We will begin the hot stage of the Bundestag 
election campaign with a Germany meeting on 4 September. There 
we will present our 100-day program. The better we streamline 
our goals there, the easier it will be to answer the coalition 
question -- which will, in the end, practically answer itself. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your chairman, Scharping, is burdened with the 
image of being respectable but boring. Is he the candidate for 
reforms and visions? 
  [Verheugen] Does Helmut Kohl have charisma? In any case, he 
won elections. Rudolf Scharping has those qualities that an SPD 
candidate for the chancellor's office needs in 1994 in order to 
win the elections. An election year like this one has its very 
own drama. In the end, one must still have enough breath for 
the final effort. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, thank you for this interview.
