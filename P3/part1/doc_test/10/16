RICHARD NIXON: HE CAN GO TO CHINA AS ENVOY EXTRAORDINAIRE, BUT THE WORLD TODAY

By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris is the author of Richard Milhouse Nixon: The Rise

"You're crazy. No one goes to China." 
</P>
<P>
It was the spring of 1934, and young Dick Nixon was earnestly warning a fellow 
graduate at Whittier College against accepting a fellowship at a Chinese 
university. It was much too risky, he told Osmyn Stout. "Don't get in trouble 
with all those militarists." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, more than a half century later, there was Richard Nixon himself back 
in China, taking the political and public-relations risk of talking to a 
Communist leadership that so recently and so brutally crushed popular 
demonstrations for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For Nixon at least, the visit was a small replica of his diplomatic master 
stroke 17 years ago, when in a sense he gambled his own presidency on a trip to 
China and began the opening that would change the face of world politics. It 
was also an escape, a redemption of sorts. The week that began with an actor 
re-creating on ABC television the hunched shoulders and rambling dialogue of 
that tragic twilight of the Nixon White House, the death throes of Watergate, 
ended with news photos of a real-life, smiling Nixon working a crowd in 
downtown Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
He informed the Chinese leaders "in unminced fashion," said an aide, that they 
had better ease the crackdown. In 20 hours of talk, we are told, the 
76-year-old former President ranged over the turbulent horizon of international 
affairs -- the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Indochina, the world economy. 
Nixon the grand strategist, the blunt but skillful diplomat, just like old 
times. 
</P>
<P>
China has always been a strange, twisting thread in Richard Nixon's remarkable 
life. He grew up in a California where anti-Orientalism was virulent, where 
local politicians pandered to prejudice no less than in the Deep South, where 
conditions were so awful at one point that Chinese families traveled to Los 
Angeles to disinter their dead from the basin's ground. 
</P>
<P>
He would find no Chinese history, no real view of Asian or the non-European 
world, in the narrow, parochial curriculum of 1930s' Whittier High or College. 
But on occasion when speakers would visit the campus to talk about the 
momentous current events of the era -- China's civil strife and Japanese 
aggression, the crucible from which Communist China would eventually emerge -- 
Nixon paid attention. "We'd let it pass off," one of his college friends said 
of those talks. "Nixon listened." 
</P>
<P>
Later, China would exert a fateful, often hidden force in Nixon's political 
rise. Alfred Kohlberg, a millionaire thanks to Chinese textile sweatshops, was 
an early backer and crucial nexus in the Alger Hiss case. The China lobby of 
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek was instrumental in Nixon's election to the 
Senate in 1950. Even through his years in the political wilderness, after his 
defeat for the California governorship in 1962, there were recurring stories of 
his fascination with China and of an involvement with a beautiful Eurasian 
woman from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
He would begin planning his diplomatic China Card in the mid-1960s, long before 
he announced his return to politics. And, with rich irony, it would be Anna 
Chennault, an element of the old China lobby, who played a crucial role behind 
the scenes in his presidential election of 1968. For those who knew the history 
and his secret ambition, the startling visit to the Chinese Communists and 
seeming betrayal of his old Nationalist patrons came as no real surprise. "The 
Chinese are a great and vital people who should not remain isolated from the 
international community," he wrote to the staff of the National Security 
Council in 1970, more than two years before he went to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was always something more here than China itself. Instinctively, 
temperamentally, Nixon vastly preferred the symmetry, the neatness and 
conclusiveness, of secret diplomacy. Especially with tyrants, with men who 
could make things stick, it was all far preferable to the heated, chaotic 
byplay of American domestic politics. No messy congeries of interests to 
accommodate, no leaks to the press to spoil the drama, no anarchy of popular 
pressure. Like his office and home, the starched white shirts his mother ironed 
and the presidential cuff links he always wore, this was an orderly universe. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sense about the Nixon who came to the White House in 1969 that he 
was somehow in the wrong office, that he had so studied and relished foreign 
policy that he was preparing all those years not to be President, but rather a 
great secretary of state, a foreign minister absorbed in his beloved 
initiatives with none of the fears and flailings of a political existence he 
half despised. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it was -- and is -- not to be. In February, 1972, he first went to China 
in the shadow of sagging popularity polls and uncertainty at home. Three months 
later he was in Moscow for another bold stroke, but the "plumbers" had already 
made their first try at the Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Nixon makes his reappearance as envoy extraordinary, the world is less 
than ever amenable to his quiet, controlling talks. The young men of the 
intifada, the peasants of the Brazilian rain forest, the striking workers of 
Poland and the Soviet Union, and, yes, the brave students of Tian An Men Square 
-- they and so many others are taking decisions out of the chancellories. While 
Beijing and a few other capitals are the last holdouts against democracy, their 
days are clearly numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon's grand diplomacy of 1972 may account for his enduring stature as 
politician and President, but it is not a feat anyone, not even the master 
himself, is going to repeat.
