NIXON LIBRARY A TRIUMPH EVEN WITH OMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN E. AMBROSE, Stephen E. Ambrose, a history professor at the 
University of New Orleans, has written two volumes of a Nixon biography and is 
working on a third to be published this fall. He also was the official 
biographer for Dwight D. Eisenhower.

<TEXT>
<P>
There is much to criticize, including some lies, some continuing cover-up and 
some glaring omissions, but overall the Nixon Library and Birthplace is a 
stunning triumph. 
</P>
<P>
It is easily the best of all the presidential museums in terms of size, scope, 
coverage, use of audio and visual material, and just plain appeal to people. 
This is partly because it is the most expensive at $21 million, partly because 
it is the most imaginative in concept and design, but mainly it is because of 
the subject. Nixon's longevity in national politics and his central role in 
many of the great events of the last century combine to provide an ideal theme 
around which to build a dramatic museum. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, naturally and inevitably, dominates everything. The purpose of the 
museum is more to glorify Nixon than to explain him, as is true of every 
presidential museum. There is not a hint of criticism about anything he ever 
did. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the gift store that features Nixon as author, this is a 
library without books or manuscripts. Although some research materials are 
promised next year, the truth is the name of the establishment is deliberately 
misleading. It is not a library; it is the Richard Nixon museum. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the biggest disappointment is the treatment of Nixon and Vietnam. The 
biggest surprise is the fairly extensive, albeit one-sided, treatment given to 
Watergate. The best section is Nixon's early life and campaigns. The most 
appealing segments cover Pat Nixon and family life. 
</P>
<P>
In the entry hall, the initial display covers Nixon's ancestors, parents and 
life before he entered politics. Some highlights include evocative photos of 
Yorba Linda and Whittier in the early 20th Century and good coverage of his 
college days and early law practice. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the museum proper, visitors go through a movie theater where there is 
a continuous showing of a 25-minute film on Nixon's life. It is a piece of 
campaign puffery that will embarrass all but the most extreme Nixon supporters 
and infuriate his foes. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the theater, a wall display carries 30 of the 66 Time magazines 
with Nixon on the cover, easily the record. Then the museum moves on to Nixon's 
first campaign, in 1946 for Congress, against incumbent Jerry Voorhis. It is 
visually attractive and relatively fair; for example, the display does mention 
that Voorhis had been voted the "hardest-working" congressman in the House. It 
mentions, if only briefly, Nixon's red-baiting of Voorhis. What it does not do 
is provide an understanding at all of why it was that, starting with this 
campaign, so many people hated Nixon so much. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is a major shortcoming of the entire museum that nowhere is there 
any attempt to grapple with the problem of why Nixon, more so than any other 
politician of this century, elicited so much hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the importance of the Alger Hiss spy case to Nixon's career, and 
the political courage he showed in pursuing Hiss after older Republicans 
advised him to back off, the Hiss display is disappointingly brief. 
</P>
<P>
It does contain a replica of the Woodstock typewriter that ultimately nailed 
Hiss, and it does have one of the State Department documents Hiss stole to give 
to the Soviets, but there is relatively little on Whitaker Chambers, who 
fingered Hiss. There is absolutely nothing on why an aristocrat like Hiss would 
find communism a compelling ideology, or on why Nixon, the kid from the wrong 
side of the tracks on the wrong coast of the country, would so resent this Ivy 
League intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
The 1950 campaign against Rep. Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate has 
three items of special interest: the first is the infamous "pink sheet" in 
which Nixon implied that Douglas was at best a communist sympathizer and at 
worst an active agent of the Communist Party. It was red-baiting at its lowest, 
according to Nixon's critics. 
</P>
<P>
The second is another handbill, put out by Douglas, in which she charged that 
it was Nixon who voted the Communist Party line. Her attempt to red-bait Nixon 
is something his critics have either ignored or long since forgotten. The third 
is a replica of the late 1940s station wagon in which Nixon toured the state 
and which was the real key to his landslide victory -- he just worked so hard. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign is a long excerpt from 
his "Checkers" speech played on a small television set, in which Nixon 
successfully defended himself against charges he accepted money from a slush 
fund. This was the first major political event on television in American 
history, and the speech introduces a theme that dominates the remainder of the 
museum -- Nixon and TV. The "Checkers" speech was only separated from the 
Senate campaign by two years -- but what a difference. In 1950, he spoke to 
hundreds from the top of his station wagon; in 1952, to millions via TV. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's eight years as vice president are covered in a series of wonderful 
photographs. His foreign trips get the biggest play, with the emphasis on his 
1958 South American tour when he was stoned and spat upon, and his 1959 
"kitchen debate" with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev when Nixon told him he 
was guilty of enslaving millions. 
</P>
<P>
The vice presidential section also contains a document that will surprise many 
visitors, a long letter written in 1957 from Martin Luther King Jr. praising 
Nixon for his forthright advocacy of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The central feature of the coverage of the 1960 campaign is a period living 
room with two sofas for visitors to sink into as they watch the Kennedy-Nixon 
debates on a small black-and-white TV. The footage is well-chosen; the 
commentary emphasizes that it was in the first debate that Nixon learned that 
style was more important than substance. Most viewers thought Kennedy won, 
because he looked so much better than Nixon on television; most voters who 
listened on the radio felt Nixon won. The museum does not claim that the 
election was stolen by the Democrats; it does stress the close vote. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was, as former President Lyndon B. Johnson once observed, a chronic 
campaigner. The next campaign came in 1962, against Edmund G. (Pat) Brown for 
governor of California. The treatment is as bland as was the campaign. The only 
real excitement came the morning after Nixon lost the election when he held his 
"last press conference" and said reporters wouldn't have him to kick around 
anymore. Filmed footage of that press conference exists, but no part of it is 
shown in this museum. That is a mistake and a pity, as the news conference 
shows Nixon at his best and worst. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's "wilderness years," 1963-67, are skipped over quickly. There is no 
inkling of Nixon's role as the leading hawk on Vietnam, constantly criticizing 
Johnson for not escalating the war. Nixon called for more men and more bombs 
daily and loudly -- but not in this display. 
</P>
<P>
The following room, called "World Leaders," is absolutely stunning, 
extraordinary and all but overwhelming. By itself, it makes a visit to this 
museum worth a trip. The room consists of 10 life-size bronze statues of 
leaders Nixon dealt with in his long career, posed in relaxed postures, 
chatting with each other. 
</P>
<P>
The display on Nixon as president concentrates on the opening with China, with 
precious little mention of the fact that for 20 years, Nixon was the American 
politician most responsible for the isolation of China. Nixon's love affair 
with China and with Mao Tse-tung is evident everywhere, to the point where the 
surprisingly brief section on Nixon's relations with Soviet leader Leonid 
Brezhnev is contained within a Chinese pagoda. There is almost nothing on arms 
control or other aspects of Nixon's detente policy, a curious omission. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the Vietnam War is extremely one-sided. There is no agonizing, 
there are no doubts -- Nixon was right, the doves were criminally wrong. Almost 
all of Nixon's Nov. 3, 1969, "silent majority" speech is shown on a color 
television set. The commentary asserts that "this speech remains the milestone 
against which all other presidential addresses are judged." One wonders what 
happened to the Gettysburg Address. 
</P>
<P>
Barely mentioned are the 1970 Cambodian incursions and the Kent State tragedy 
in which National Guardsmen killed four students during a demonstration. The 
1971 invasion of Laos is not mentioned at all, the Christmas, 1972, bombing of 
Hanoi is downplayed and no attempt is made to explain why Nixon launched the 
bombing or what he got from it. 
</P>
<P>
The next room belongs to Pat Nixon, and it shows this truly great woman as she 
really is, heartwarming and wholesome, kind and considerate, loyal and 
hard-working. There are dozens of photos showing her from childhood to old age. 
Many presidential libraries feature a re-creation of the Oval Office. The Nixon 
Library re-creates the Lincoln Sitting Room. There is Nixon's stuffed chair, 
his ottoman, his pipe and his legal pad. A wall display contains many yellow 
sheets with Nixon's speech and book drafts scribbled on them. 
</P>
<P>
A single large room covers domestic affairs. The theme is "Nixon the 
innovator," which is a tough sell in some cases. The Environmental Protection 
Agency, for example, is offered as an illustration of Nixon as the far-seeing 
statesman without noting that he signed the bill creating the agency 
reluctantly and only after forcing the Democrats to soften the bill 
considerably. On energy conservation, the museum understates Nixon's 
farsightedness. He was urging Congress to reduce oil consumption and to 
increase domestic oil production six months before the 1973 Arab oil embargo 
caused the energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one tiny display on Nixon's vice presidents, Spiro T. Agnew and 
Gerald R. Ford. There is not one mention of Ford's pardon of Nixon, an omission 
that is inexcusable. Also inexcusable is the absence of any reference to 
illegal surveillance or wiretapping activities against anti-Vietnam War 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Watergate is covered in a single long, dark uninviting room with more written 
commentary than any other section. The presentation makes the best possible 
case for Nixon, mainly in Nixon's own words, and is entirely self-serving. 
There is one Watergate tape, complete with a headset, but it is far from 
complete and a commentator puts a spin on the tape that would almost convince a 
listener that Nixon never ordered a cover-up or a payment of hush money. 
</P>
<P>
Two things stand out about the Watergate treatment. First, it is impossible to 
make a solid case for Nixon, because he was guilty. The museum does the best it 
can with a hopeless case. Second, there is no attempt to assess the meaning of 
Watergate, or to describe what, if anything, was learned from the greatest 
political crisis of this century. 
</P>
<P>
But then it is not the purpose of museums to be retrospective, or to be 
critical, but rather it is to praise and honor. The Nixon Museum does this 
well. It allows the man it glorifies to speak in his own words, to make his own 
case. Nowhere is this better done than in the Presidential Forum room, the last 
in the tour. Visitors touch a computer display to ask Nixon a question -- there 
are about 800 listed -- and he comes on screen with the answer taped from past 
public appearances and a recently taped interview. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is the most fascinating of all our 20th-Century politicians. His museum 
is almost as fascinating as the man himself, and frequently as contradictory, 
and often as contentious and always as partisan. It is a personal triumph for 
Nixon -- his supporters will love it, his critics will gnash their teeth -- and 
who could doubt but that this is just the way that Richard Nixon wants it?
