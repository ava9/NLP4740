White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, reflecting President Bush's anger, 
has warned aides against "bad-mouthing" former President Ronald Reagan, a 
spokesman acknowledged today. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy apparently was touched off by complaints from former President 
Richard M. Nixon. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who also was 
spokesman under Reagan, was obviously angered in discussing the matter with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, who at one point accused a journalist of fabricating quotations, 
said Sununu had noted a report that some staffers were making disparaging 
remarks about Reagan and had cautioned them, "Don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
One source was quoted as saying "Reagan would still be asleep" at 7 a.m., when 
Bush typically arrives at the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed the concern of Bush and Sununu in responding to an 
article by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, which said 
Nixon "was so disturbed by what he read about Reagan-trashing inside the White 
House he fired off a protest" to Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was incensed, the columnists wrote, by a report from Knight-Ridder 
newspapers White House correspondent Owen Ullman that said Bush aides were 
depicting Reagan "as a dunce and making unflattering comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater today would not confirm any protest by Nixon but said, "The staff was 
told if (Ullman's) story is correct it's not helpful." He added that anyone who 
would ridicule Reagan should not be working in the White House under the man 
who was Reagan's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anybody who has been bad-mouthing Reagan," Fitzwater argued, 
accusing Ullman of "making up the quotes. It's a silly story. I don't know if 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ullman, who was present at the briefing in the White House press room, shot 
back immediately that Fitzwater was challenging his "integrity." The spokesman 
responded, "In that case I apologize. I just disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Ullman later told fellow reporters that he did not want to comment further but 
said, "Everyone here knows I don't make up quotes." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon reportedly told Sununu that the source of Ullman's report should be fired 
as an example to other staffers tempted "to play the same game." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater called the reports "irrelevant" but emphasized, "President Bush would 
not want any idea to prevail (that) this is going on. . . . We take it 
seriously in human terms." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added: "In my opinion, history will treat (Reagan) as one of the 
greatest Presidents ever. Everyone here certainly believes that."
