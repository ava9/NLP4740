'TITTERING AT NIXON'

Roger Morris' diatribe against former President Richard Nixon ("While Tittering 
at Nixon, Don't Underestimate the Web He Wove," Op-Ed Page, March 5) can best 
be understood in terms of a subject neither Morris nor The Times, in its 
biographical blurb, saw fit to mention. It is impossible to discuss President 
Franklin Roosevelt without reference to the Depression, or President Lincoln 
without mentioning the Civil War. That Morris managed to get through four 
columns on Nixon without mentioning the central event of the Nixon years, the 
war in Vietnam, is particularly fascinating in view of Morris' own actions as a 
member of the Nixon Administration at a fateful moment during that war. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, American and South Vietnamese forces were suffering terrible and 
unnecessary losses at the hands of communist troops who for years had been 
attacking from privileged sanctuaries in Cambodia. President Nixon ordered the 
sanctuaries cleared out, a move which objective historians of the war concede 
saved untold American and South Vietnamese lives and shattered the communists' 
offensive capacity in the region for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Your blurb about Morris neglects to mention that he was serving on the National 
Security Council staff at the time of the Cambodian incursion. What did he do 
when President Nixon ordered an attack on the sanctuaries? He quit. He, and 
many others, made the absurd claim that by depriving communist troops of the 
wherewithal to kill Americans and South Vietnamese, Nixon was "widening" the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
During 1973-75, congressional support for Saigon evaporated, and Soviet support 
for North Vietnam escalated. It is no surprise, therefore, that the South 
ultimately could not prevail. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam the new communist regime has driven half a million souls to their 
deaths in the South China Sea, and in Cambodia 1 million to 2 million have 
perished in an awful holocaust. Someday, we as a nation will have to come to 
terms with what happened in Indochina when American authority was withdrawn. I 
don't expect Morris to help us solve that problem. But I would suggest that The 
Times should have seen fit to inform its readers that its correspondent was not 
a dispassionate historian but a man who has a personal interest in debunking 
Nixon. For if history proves him right about one of the most controversial and 
fateful decisions of his presidency, where will that leave Morris? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of history, I wonder whether Morris' column contains an example of his 
historical method. He writes of a virtual chorus of "ridicule and . . . dismay" 
among conservatives about Nixon's just-published White House memos and then, to 
prove his point, quotes from a single column by James Kilpatrick. That's the 
only negative statement I've seen or heard from a conservative about the 
collection, and I suspect I read and talk to more conservatives than Morris 
does. On the other hand, after reading the same book, the New Republic's 
Hendrik Hertzberg wrote, "The last eight years have made Nixon look good in 
unexpected ways. Reading his memos, one has to admire his formidable 
intelligence, his analytical sharpness . . . his vast knowledge of politics and 
government." Using Morris' technique, I would define this as "a vast outpouring 
of praise from the former President's erstwhile critics."
