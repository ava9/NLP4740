  [Text] Ottawa, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Canadian Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien said today that his country pays great attention 
to its further development of friendly relations of cooperation 
with China. 
  Meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua here, Chretien 
said mutually beneficial cooperation between Canada and China 
hold out great potential because the two countries, which are 
vast in territory and rich in resources, have their own 
advantages and share a lot of common ground. 
  Canada's advantages in the economy and its advanced 
technology will be useful for China's development of 
infrastructure and modernization drive, he said. 
  Chretien expressed his warm welcome to the Chinese vice 
premier who arrived in Canada 10 days ago for an official visit. 
It was a wise and foresight decision in 1970 when the Canadian 
Government led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau established 
diplomatic relations with China, he said. 
  Chretien said he is confident that the two countries will 
make their efforts to strengthen the good relations. 
  During the meeting, Chinese Vice Premier Zou said he is 
delighted to see the emergence of new trend towards all-round 
development in the Sino-Canadian relations. 
  He said China and Canada are faced with a rare opportunity 
to 
enhance their ties and a lot of things can be done in the 
development of the mutual cooperation between the two countries. 
  He hopes that the two countries will make common efforts to 
promote the Sino-Canadian relations to a new high. 
  On behalf of Premier Li Peng, Zou also invited Chretien to 
visit China later this year at his convenience and Chretien 
accepted the invitation. Chretien said he will head a group of 
businessmen and provincial premiers for the China visit. 
  Present at the meeting were Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet, 
Finance Minister Paul Marti and Secretary of State 
(Asia-Pacific) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Raymon Chan on 
the Canadian side. 
  On the Chinese side, Vice Chairman of the State Planning 
Commission Zeng Peiyan, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, vice 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation Zhen Silin 
and Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun attended the 
meeting. 
  After the meeting, Zou left Ottawa for the United States by 
a 
special plane to attend the funeral of the former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu also left here 
in the same plane.
