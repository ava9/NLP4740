<P>
fierce ideological rivals met backstage at "CBS This Morning" today and there 
were neither fireworks nor fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Richard M. Nixon and radical lawyer William Kunstler appeared 
on the show separately, and Kunstler went searching for Nixon, whom he had 
never met. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is he? I've got to find him," Kunstler said after he had been part of a 
discussion about the First Amendment. He finally found Nixon in the makeup 
room, where he was being prepped for his own interview. Kunstler asked the 
former President if he really was Richard Nixon and then they shook hands and 
they chatted briefly but pleasantly. The topics were aging and baseball.
