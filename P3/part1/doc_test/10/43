  [Text] According to XINHUA, President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng today sent a message of condolences in 
connection with the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon. 
  The message says: We are shocked to learn that Mr. Richard 
Nixon has died of illness, and we wish to express our profound 
condolences. 
  Mr. Nixon was a statesmen with strategic foresight and 
political courage. When he was U.S. President, he and the late 
Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai opened the gate of Sino-U.S. 
relations and created a new situation for the relations between 
the two countries. After he was relieved of his office, Mr. 
Nixon continued to concern himself with Sino-U.S. relations and 
make important contributions to safeguarding and developing the 
two countries' relations. 
  We are convinced that, under the joint efforts exerted by 
China and the United States, Sino-U.S. relations which the late 
Mr. Nixon cared about certainly will continue to improve and 
develop. We wish to express our sincere sympathy to Mr. Nixon's 
family. 
  Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen also sent messages of 
condolences.
