<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "How Iraq Foiled America's </F>
Opportunity To Colonize the World"] 
  [Text] In his book "Seize The Moment: America's Challenge 
in a One Superpower World," former U.S. President Richard Nixon 
admits that cursed criminal George Bush's idealistic dream of 
establishing a new world order has been shattered by three main 
factors: Iraq's liberation of the governorate of Kuwait, the 
alertness of the national movement in Russia and Eastern Europe 
which opposes U.S. hegemony, and the failure of the capitalist 
system, the market economy, in Eastern Europe. 
  Nixon says that the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait 
was a serious turning point which changed and confused U.S. 
plans, and exposed the false cover that gave the impression that 
the world was stable and willing and ready to accept the U.S. 
dream of leading the world. The liberation of the governorate 
of Kuwait has disrupted the U.S. attempt to calmly colonize the 
world without any fanfare. But, the Mother of Battles changed 
the basic components on which criminal Bush had depended to 
control the world. That's why Nixon describes the plan of 
cursed Bush to establish a world order under U.S. leadership as 
an idealistic dream that faced and was shattered by solid 
reality. 
  This is the gist of what Nixon had admitted. All that we 
have done is replace the spiteful words he used to describe 
Iraq. Thus, Nixon joins the convoy of those who admit that the 
Mother of Battles was the midwife which gave birth to the 
factors of rejection and confrontation of U.S. colonialism, and 
has exposed the U.S. impotence in quelling the people and 
nations and controlling them. 
  When we used to say this before Nixon's book was published, 
some would view what we said as some sort of exaggeration, or 
unrealistic wishful thinking. But, here we have the strongest 
U.S. President after Kennedy admitting that the Mother Battles 
and Iraq's leader, Saddam Husayn, have changed the course of the 
major big events in the world and steered them in a direction 
that is opposite to that wished by criminal Bush. The era of 
fierce resistance to U.S. colonialism has thus begun.
