"Common Interest Is the Crux of Sino-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text]China and United the States Are Still 
Deadlocked on the Human Rights Issue 
  After winding up his trip to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher left Beijing to visit Russia. During his 
short visit to China, Christopher again applied pressure on the 
human rights issue, but China remained tough. Will the United 
States "wield" the "magic wand" of denying China most-favored 
nation [MFN] status? It seems unlikely, or we can say that both 
parties will always set store by their common interests and not 
come to a rupture. 
  Chinese leaders have pointed out on many occasions: 
Sino-U.S. relations have never been based on common ideology 
and values, but on common interests. This is a pertinent 
remark. Since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger visited China 
more than two decades ago, and since the 4 June incident, there 
have been frequent "cold wars" in Sino-U.S. relations, but never 
have they fallen out with each other. In the final analysis, 
this is because the common interests of the two countries, which 
still servs as a basis, have never changed. 
  Although the two countries have differing views on the human 
rights issue, China is still ready to discuss it with the United 
States on the basis of equality in order to increase 
understanding. It is known to everyone that China gradually is 
improving human rights, but the United States has no reason 
whatsoever to pressure China into accepting a U.S.-style concept 
of human rights. 
<H3>  A Japanese Newspaper Attacks the United States for Applying 
Pressure on China </H3>
  ASAHI SHIMBUN carried an editorial on 15 March. From some of 
its unbiased remarks on this issue, it is not difficult to see 
where the rights and wrongs lie. The paper says: "Japan is 
very much concerned about what China will become. China is now 
Japan's second-largest trading partner, while Japan is China's 
largest. If China is thrown into chaos, Japan will be 
tremendously affected. Therefore, Japan does not want to see a 
deterioration of relations between China and the United States, 
both of which are nations friendly to Japan." The paper added: 
"China holds that, as far as developing countries are 
concerned, 'the rights to survival and development are the basis 
of human rights.' This argument is not hard to understand. The 
U.S. practice of forcing China to make concessions on the issues 
of democratization and human rights is too impatient and is 
disgusting." 
  Moreover, the paper also has said something to China. It 
says: "Respect for human rights is a world trend. As the 
economy develops, it is also natural that people are pressing 
growing political demands. If China wants to have long-term 
stability, it needs to attach importance to democratization and 
human rights." 
  Let us look at the following fact: The Chinese and U.S. 
foreign ministers reached a five-point agreement in their talks. 
It includes a memorandum on prison labor products signed 
between the two parties. If the United States makes a request, 
it can go to a suspected prison within 60 days to investigate 
whether prison labor products are still exported. These, of 
course, are part of the steps China has taken to improve human 
rights. 
A Huge Chinese Delegation Will Go to the United States Next 
Month [subhead] 
  China's democratization must be developed gradually; it 
cannot be copied from Western practice. This is China's 
national condition, and it will not waver on this. As the 
people's living standards improve and as education is 
popularized on a larger scale, democratization and reform of the 
political structure naturally will advanced simultaneously. 
However, in the course of such major reforms as the market 
economy, there must be an appropriate degree of macroregulation 
and control in terms of stability, development, and the 
deepening of reform. Otherwise, if society were to be thrown 
into chaos, a large country with a population of 1.2 billion 
would not be able to sustain it. A case in point is the failure 
of Russia and Eastern Europe in their overdrastic 
democratization and democratic reform. 
  Based on their common economic interests, it is advantageous 
to both China and the United States to expand economic 
cooperation and exchange. China will dispatch a high-ranking 
200-man delegation to the United States next month to discuss 
economic cooperation in 800 industrial and agricultural 
projects. This is beneficial to the rapidly recovering U.S. 
economy and to China's construction. Barring ulterior motives, 
we really cannot see any benefit that can be derived from 
exerting pressure on China, which leads to losses to both 
parties.
