Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "China Appreciates Sino-U.S. 
Relations in the Nixon Era"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (HSIN PAO) -- China and the United 
States hold the balance in international affairs, hence 
Sino-U.S. relations are always the focus of the world. 
Sino-U.S. relations were at a low ebb after the 4 June Incident 
in Beijing. In November 1993, PRC President Jiang Zemin met 
U.S. President Clinton in Seattle at the latter's invitation. 
Since this was the first official meeting between the heads of 
state of the two countries in more than four years due to a 
break in high-level dialogues, it was considered a new beginning 
in the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations. However, to 
everyone's surprise, and at a time when a thawing of Sino-U.S. 
relations was expected, the United States unilaterally announced 
on 6 January that China's textile import quotas would be reduced 
by 25 to 35 percent starting 17 January. Although China has 
already agreed to settle this issue through talks by 17 January, 
it was, after all, the United States which stirred up the 
Sino-U.S. trade war. In viewed of this, people cannot but ask: 
How will Sino-U.S. relations develop? In order to answer this 
question, we must first understand how the Clinton 
administration has revised its policy towards China and how the 
Chinese Government is reacting to the United States. 
<H5>  Clinton Revises His Tactics Towards China </H5>
  According to a source in Beijing, after studying U.S. 
foreign 
policies since Clinton came to power, Chinese experts in U.S. 
affairs judged that the United States had decided to revise its 
policy towards China before Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to 
Seattle. The United States did not give up its strategy of 
facilitating changes in China through peaceful evolution, but 
due to the consideration of revitalizing the domestic economy 
(the United States has elevated economic issues to the high 
plane of national security), it decided to change its tactics 
towards China and establish multilateral relations through 
dialogue with various Chinese ministries. On 7 September 1993, 
the Clinton administration pointed out in the "Evaluation Report 
on U.S. Policies Towards China in Recent Years," of which the 
Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of 
Representatives were informed by memorandum (the report was 
passed later): It is necessary to treat U.S. national 
interests, rather than human rights in China, as a top priority. 
It showed that Clinton wanted to change the past practice of 
dealing with foreign relations which treated human rights in 
China as the top priority and which neglected economic issues 
related to U.S. national interests and national security. 
  U.S. political circles described the revised policy towards 
China as a "policy of contacts," which implies: On the one 
hand, with the Clinton-Jiang Summit as the beginning, the United 
States will have more and more contacts with China. In 
particular, the two "forbidden zones" of mutual visits between 
senior leaders and of military contacts set up by the United 
States have been abolished, thus implying that the atmosphere of 
Sino-U.S. relations will be improved. On the other hand, if the 
United States mainly resorted to the practice of "facilitating 
changes by exerting pressure" on China in the past several 
years, it will, more often than not in the future, try to 
influence China and ask China to change its existing systems and 
policies through contacts and cooperation. 
  However, Chinese experts in U.S. affairs pointed out: It is 
true that the Clinton administration treats the reinvigoration 
of the domestic economy as the top priority and the 
consideration of economic interests has a greater share in its 
foreign policy, but U.S. diplomacy in the post-Cold War era 
still considers the pursuit of economic interests, defense of 
national security, and promotion of "democracy and human rights" 
as three interrelated and complementary goals. Compared with 
other powers, U.S. diplomacy has strong ideological colors. The 
House of Representatives sticks to the principle that human 
rights diplomacy can never be abolished, otherwise the United 
States will lose its spiritual leadership in the world and 
friction will arise in economic cooperation. Hence, although a 
thawing of Sino-U.S. relations after the Seattle Summit is 
expected, substantive issues have not yet been resolved and 
China should make a sober estimate of the difficulties in 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The source said: Chinese experts on U.S. affairs and Chinese 
leaders hold that senior U.S. Government officials (for example, 
President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher) are not as 
farsighted as former U.S. President Richard Nixon and former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The unremitting efforts and 
courageous policy decisions made by Nixon and Kissinger for the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States 
and China are still a much-told tale. For this reason, they 
established friendship with China and become friends of the 
Chinese people. Not long ago, DACANKAO [LARGE REFERENCE 1129 
0639 5072], a CPC journal published internally for senior 
cadres' perusal, compared the three letters separately sent by 
Kissinger and James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) to 
the U.S. presidents and its intention was obviously to praise 
Kissinger and censure Lilley, which shows that the Chinese 
authorities very much appreciate Sino-U.S. relations in the 
Nixon-Kissinger era. 
<H5>  Beijing Appreciates Nixon and Kissinger </H5>
  DACANKAO said: In order to normalize American-Chinese 
relations, Kissinger wrote two letters to President Nixon and 
one to President Reagan. He volunteered to pave the way for 
Nixon's visit to China and later helped bring about 
U.S.-Vietnamese peace talks. Consequently, he and Vietnam's Le 
Dec Tho were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Late PRC 
Premier Zhou Enlai said when congratulating him, "Dec Tho will 
get longevity and you will get valuables." The non-isolation 
policy pursued by Reagan was also facilitated by Kissinger. The 
Chinese people will never forget Kissinger's contributions to 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the 
United States. 
  DACANKAO went on to say: Lilley also wrote three letters to 
the U.S. president (Bush). His second letter, which is still 
sensible, suggested that it was inadvisable for the United 
States to link human rights with trade in formulating its policy 
towards China. However, his first letter (which was written 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union) maintained that 
the United States should fully support Taiwan independence, and 
his third letter maintained that the United States should 
vigorously and unequivocally support Hong Kong Governor Patten's 
political reform package. Obviously, these two letters were 
antagonistic towards China. In particular, his advocacy of 
Taiwan independence helps China see clearly that there are two 
persons surnamed "Li" working for Taiwan independence, the first 
one is Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and the other is James Lilley of 
the United States, which may be called a "two-man comic show, 
with one singing while the other acts." It is impudent enough 
for people like Lilley to try to play Kissinger's role in the 
present time, but are they qualified? 
  Chinese experts in U.S. affairs said: By praising Kissinger 
and censuring Lilley, DACANKAO hoped that in dealing with 
Sino-U.S. relations, the Clinton administration can, just as 
Nixon and Kissinger did, bear its own long-term strategic 
interests in mind and, at the same time, respect China's 
interests according to the principles of mutual respect and 
equality without haggling over differences in social systems and 
ideologies, thus properly resolving the issues between China and 
the United States. 
  The source also said: The Chinese Government is fully aware 
that Clinton has revised his policy towards China and is willing 
to have dialogue with China, but so far he has not had the same 
strategic courage as Nixon and Kissinger had. He will still 
couple threats with promises and frequently stir up troubles in 
the process of making contacts with China. Moreover, China 
cannot but notice that recently the Clinton administration aims 
at China and has taken some abnormal moves on the issues of the 
DPRK, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. 
<H3>  China Pays Attention to Abnormal Moves Taken by the United 
States </H3>
  As far as the DPRK issue is concerned, the United States 
once 
held that with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China's 
strategic position declined. But with the emergence of the DPRK 
nuclear issue, the United States affirms the importance of 
China's strategic position and wants to win over China to 
jointly deal with DPRK. 
  As far as the Vietnam issue is concerned, the United States 
wants to win over Vietnam so as to make it become another China 
in the Cold War period, whereas China is regarded as the 
then-Soviet Union. Hence, on the one hand, the United States 
announced the decision to relax the 18-year-long trade ban 
against Vietnam to reciprocate Vietnam's assistance to the 
United States in searching for MIA's from the Vietnam War, and 
on the other hand secret talks have been held in Paris and 
Vietnam, which will be elevated to the ambassadorial level or 
even the level of special envoy. Clinton described the U.S. 
envoy taking part in the talks as a modern Kissinger. 
  As far as the Hong Kong issue is concerned, members of the 
U.S. House of Representatives and the person in charge of the 
Republican Party's Human Rights Committee have already promised 
leaders of Hong Kong's radical democrats that they will put 
forward a motion at regular Congressional sessions in the near 
future: First, to amend the "Law of Hong Kong Relations" and 
ask the State Council to submit a report on Hong Kong issues to 
Congress once a year instead of twice a year; second, to urge 
Patten to table his original political reform package to the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion; and third, to ask 
Congress to open a hearing on the issue of democratization in 
Hong Kong. 
  As indicated by various signs, there is a thawing of 
Sino-U.S. relations, but the path is still not easy. As 
compelled by reality, the Chinese authorities must 
conscientiously study tactics to deal with the United States. 
Hence, the development of Sino-U.S. relations in the future 
will still be the special concern of the world.
