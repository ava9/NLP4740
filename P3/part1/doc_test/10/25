On the eve of its dedication, the Nixon Library once again became a center of 
controversy as Bush Administration officials Wednesday criticized limitations 
on press coverage imposed by the former President. 
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from the White House and news organizations, library 
officials announced a compromise under which reporters will be able to take 
part in a tour of the library today that previously was open only to 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Rules ordered by Ronald Walker, an aide to Richard M. Nixon -- at Nixon's 
request, according to Administration aides -- would have allowed only 
photographers to be present during major portions of the dedication today of 
the museum and library complex in this Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would have been a sharp break from the usual coverage of White House 
events. 
</P>
<P>
After the criticism, library officials agreed to allow media representatives to 
accompany Presidents Bush, Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford on two of 
their four stops during a tour of the library. The media people will be 
permitted in the lobby of the library and around the reflecting pool outside 
the facility, but quarters will be too cramped for the entourage to join the 
Presidents in the World Leaders Room and at Nixon's birthplace next door, a 
library spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a space consideration and we've worked out an acceptable compromise, to 
the best of my knowledge," said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. 
"We're dealing with a numbers situation. We're not dealing with a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
However, White House aides said they had originally been given a different 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't want anyone asking questions," one White House aide said, 
adding that the decision -- communicated to the White House over the weekend 
and to reporters who traveled to California with the Bush party Wednesday 
afternoon -- came as a surprise to Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library project has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy. Most 
recently, Hugh Hewitt, the library's executive director, told The Times that 
the library would bar researchers who were seen as anti-Nixon, specifically 
citing the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, who as a reporter helped break the 
Watergate story that led to Nixon's resignation. Hewitt later backed down, 
saying he had spoken without consulting Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides, however, said Walker, a longtime Nixon aide who is handling 
logistics for the library dedication, had specifically said the restriction on 
reporters was at the former President's request. Nixon has a long history of 
feuding with the press throughout his nearly five decades in public life. 
</P>
<P>
Even Nixon's quest for historical redemption of his presidency, a powerful 
subtext underlying many of this week's activities, has stirred some 
disagreement among the former President's admirers gathered in Southern 
California for the dedication. On Tuesday, former President Reagan said history 
would treat his predecessor well, adding that "much of the criticism was based 
on nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, while 
agreeing that Nixon will be vindicated by history, took issue with the rest of 
Reagan's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were definite, huge errors," Kissinger said. "I have always 
believed that he was punished much too severely . . . but I think there were 
huge mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon himself has been mostly invisible in the events leading up to today's 
dedication. He briefly appeared with members of his family Wednesday as they 
arrived to tour his birthplace, but he declined to answer questions shouted 
from an area reserved for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the ceremonies for the opening of the library, Nixon plans to lead 
President Bush and Ford and Reagan on a tour of the library and his boyhood 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The tour will mark only the second time in history that so many U.S. Presidents 
have gathered. The last time was before the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, any such appearance by Bush would be covered by a pool of reporters 
who cover the White House -- representatives of the two U.S. wire services, a 
newspaper reporter and a magazine reporter, one television network crew with a 
correspondent, a radio reporter and several photographers. Membership in the 
pool rotates daily among the news organizations that regularly cover the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
That pool format is used even during White House photo opportunities. Bush has 
made a rule of usually not answering questions during photo sessions, but 
reporters are allowed to ask them. Often, photo sessions provide the only 
opportunity for reporters to question the President on the events of the day.
