Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath said Monday that a united Europe was 
"logical and inevitable . . . the only question is when are we going to be wise 
enough to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Heath, who served as prime minister of Great Britain from 1970 to 1974, spoke 
to a gathering of the World Affairs Council of Orange County at the Richard 
Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to today's world events, Heath said: "There are distractions in 
China, Africa and the Middle East. . . . The main changes are taking place in 
the ancient continent of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Heath, 74, told reporters that he would meet with Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein when he makes a humanitarian visit to the Middle East later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate on the Middle East crisis beyond saying that he would 
hope to free the "suffering and dying" British citizens who are being held 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
The British member of Parliament devoted the major portion of his address to 
the prospects of a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Heath said European countries must pool their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sovereignty is not something you take to the cellar and once a week you go 
there with a candle to see if it's still there," Heath said. "It is there to be 
used for the benefit of the people. Europe will never again be a continent of 
little states fighting each other. It will be governed by supranationality." 
</P>
<P>
Heath was taken on a brief tour of the Nixon Library. He described the facility 
as "impressive," saying, "You know how to treat your presidents." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from being an inveterate world traveler, Heath is also a champion 
deep-water sailor, author and an internationally active conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Heath pursued his musical interests when he visited the 
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. After meeting with the Rev. Robert Schuller, 
Heath played the church's organ for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
His small delegation stood at attention when he broke into "God Save the 
Queen." 
</P>
<P>
Heath promised to take up Schuller's offer to return next year and conduct a 
concert with the Pacific Symphony, the Pacific Chorale and the Crystal 
Cathedral Choir. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the Crystal Cathedral, Heath headed for Newport Beach, where he 
met several Orange County yachtsmen , against whom he had competed in 
international sailing events.
