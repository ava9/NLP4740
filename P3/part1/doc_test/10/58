  [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Former U.S. President Richard 
Nixon will continue his unofficial visit to Moscow, Dimitri 
Simes, political scientist accompanying the ex-president, told 
reporters on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  Thus he rejected media speculations that Nixon decided to 
cut 
short his visit after President Boris Yeltsin and some other top 
officials refused to meet him. 
  The refusal came after Nixon's extensive contacts with 
opposition leaders including former Vice President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy amnestied last week.
