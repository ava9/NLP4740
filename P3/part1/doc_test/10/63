  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Boris Yeltsin has refused to 
receive the former U.S. President, Richard Nixon, who is paying 
an unofficial visit to Russia. He announced this during a short 
conversation with journalists at the Kremlin Wall, after the 
laying of wreaths at the grave of Yuriy Gagarin. 
  The Russian president said that: Nixon has met Rutskoy and 
Zyuganov, but the interesting thing is that he came here to meet 
me. After that, Yeltsin noted: I will not meet Nixon, the 
government will not receive him, and Filatov [Yeltsin's chief of 
staff] will not receive him. 
  It should be realized that Russia is a great country. It 
simply cannot be played around with like that, the president 
said, noting: I am impressed by the position taken by Bill 
Clinton, because he phoned me and distanced himself from Richard 
Nixon's trip." 
  Referring to Russian-U.S. relations, Yeltsin said that the 
two countries' foreign ministers were due to meet in Vladivostok 
shortly. He stated that: The U.S.-Russian partnership must be 
preserved and developed. The president noted that Russian-U.S. 
partnership: Is a great achievement that we worked very hard 
for, and we must not lose it. Moreover, I am convinced that we 
will not lose it, Yeltsin stressed. 
  Asked by the journalists about the Ames scandal in the 
United 
States, Yeltsin said: I would not like to draw any dramatic 
conclusions from this. He expressed hope that it should not and 
will not affect Russian-U.S. relations. Yeltsin believes that 
one should not get upset about the fact that both countries are 
conducting intelligence work.
