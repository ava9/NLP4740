  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- "Russia was and remains a 
great power and Russian-American relations are the most 
important for my country," ex-President Richard Nixon told 
members of the State Duma Committee for Foreign Affairs at a 
meeting here today. 
  The former U.S. president, who is visiting Moscow for the 
tenth time, noted that statements alleging that "America has 
triumphed over Russia" are a myth. Nixon also said that America 
jointly with Russia can cope with the global problems which 
"impose certain obligations on the two great powers." 
  Richard Nixon did not rule out the possibility of some 
frictions between the United States and Russia in the future but 
expressed confidence that "these will be differences between 
friends, not enemies." Nixon stressed the importance of open 
discussions of these differences. 
  Nixon described as "a positive phenomenon of the new time" 
the good personal relationship between Presidents Clinton and 
Yeltsin. 
  Along with this, Nixon sought to bring home to the Russian 
parliamentarians the concern felt by a part of American society 
about Russia's relapse to the aggressive policy. The 
ex-president said, "Russia is of course entitled to make its own 
steps in foreign policy, which do not always coincide with 
America's." 
  "We are now friends, so let us work together in order not to 
poison our relations," Nixon stressed. He pointed out the 
importance of strengthening cooperation between Russian and 
American parliamentarians.
