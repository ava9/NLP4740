Morningside and Palos Verdes high schools, the only South Bay basketball teams 
still in contention for state titles, will play home games tonight at 7:30 in 
the Southern California girls regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Morningside (29-3) meets Mt. Carmel of San Diego (23-5) in a 
Division I match-up, while Palos Verdes (28-5) faces Costa Mesa (18-11) in a 
Division III game. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Wendell Yoshida was happy his team bounced back Tuesday with 
a 53-37 victory over San Diego's Our Lady of Peace in the first round of the 
regionals. It came one game after the Sea Kings lost to Brea-Olinda, 50-33, in 
the Southern Section 3-AA finals last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We hated to end the (Southern Section) season not playing well," Yoshida said. 
"We had a good season. But one bad game, especially the last one, can leave a 
bad taste in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a reprieve, a second life." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Sea Kings received a balanced effort against Our Lady of Peace, 
the San Diego champion. Guard Lisa Humphreys had a triple-double of 13 points, 
14 rebounds and 10 assists; sophomore center Monique Morehouse had 10 points, 
11 rebounds and five blocked shots; forward Kristen Jaconi had 12 points and 
seven rebounds, and point guard Susan Wilhite played a "great floor game," 
according to Yoshida. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa, the Southern Section 3-A champion, advanced with a 44-42 win over 
Selma, the Central Section runner-up. Guard Olivia DiCamilli scored the winning 
basket on a last-second shot and finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's winner advances to the Division III regional final at 9:30 a.m. 
Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, gunning for its third consecutive appearance in the State Division 
I final, turned back a stubborn Ventura Buena team Tuesday, 56-49. Center Lisa 
Leslie produced another triple-double of 30 points, 11 rebounds and 13 blocked 
shots despite sitting out part of the game after drawing her fourth foul early 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel, the San Diego Section runner-up, defeated Southern Section 5-A 
champion Hart of Newhall, 65-42. 
</P>
<P>
The Division I regional final will be played at 6:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports 
Arena.
