Neville Saner, who four San Diego Section titles in seven years, resigned 
Thursday as boys' basketball coach at Poway High School. 
</P>
<P>
Saner cited two reasons -- one personal and one professional -- to Principal 
Fred Van Leuven and John Self, Poway's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to spend more time with my family, and I want to pursue my education 
further," he said in a letter to the administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Saner compiled a 139-42 record (.768) while at Poway. In 1984, he took a team 
that started one junior, three sophomores and a freshman to the section 3-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
That team, which boasted NCAA Division I players John Colborne (Southern 
Methodist) and Jud Buechler (Arizona), went on to win section titles in 1985 
and '86 as well. 
</P>
<P>
Poway failed to make the playoffs in 1987, but rebounded with a 19-9 season in 
1988 and a fourth section title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team (18-7) was eliminated in the Division I quarterfinals by Mt. 
Carmel last week. It had two of the three victories by San Diego County teams 
over second-seeded Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Saner did not rule out a return to coaching, possibly at the collegiate level. 
That is one consideration for getting his masters degree, in either physical 
education or geography. 
</P>
<P>
"The masters is something I would like to get whether I get into a college 
coaching situation or not," he said. "But for the time being, I'll be able to 
give my family more time, and that's more important than basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Saner and his wife of 13 years, Diane, have have an 8-year-old daughter, 
Heather. 
</P>
<P>
He said he first considered leaving the program in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a rigorous seven years; I've worked hard at it and been very 
conscientious," Saner said. "It takes its toll a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a change. (But) it's very difficult, too. I'm leaving something I've 
been doing quite a while. When you make a change, it's always difficult, 
particularly when it's something you've done particularly well at. 
</P>
<P>
"Poway High has been very good to me, and I've reciprocated, I believe, and I 
leave on very good terms." 
</P>
<P>
Also important to him is that he doesn't leave the cupboard bare. This year's 
team had only two seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Saner coached 13 years before taking over for Poway's Doug Wealch. He coached 
at St. Francis High in La Canada, Alemany High in the San Fernando Valley, 
assisted at Mater Dei in Orange County and coached at Salesian High in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He played basketball for John Wooden at UCLA for three years (1966-69), where 
he backed up Lew Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to winning the 1984 section title, Saner said the 1989 championship 
was important because it had no ties to the program that existed before he 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The other highlight, he said, was this year when his team rallied from a 
15-point deficit with 5:40 left to defeat Mt. Carmel, 80-78.
