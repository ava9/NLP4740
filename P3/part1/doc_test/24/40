The girls' basketball team from Mt. Carmel High in San Diego journeyed more 
than 2 1/2 hours Tuesday to play Hart, which had not lost a home game in more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? Mt. Carmel ran the Indians right out of their own gym -- and 
the state playoff tournament -- with a 65-42 victory in a Southern California 
Division I regional. 
</P>
<P>
So much for home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little stunning," said Hart Coach Dave Munroe, whose team won the 
Southern Section 5-A Division championship Friday with a 49-45 victory over 
Buena. "We're better than what we played tonight. We were flat." 
</P>
<P>
Flattened is more accurate. This one got ugly fast and stayed that way. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel (23-5), the San Diego Section Division I champion, led 19-9 after 
one quarter, 40-13 by halftime and 55-24 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
From there it was all substitutions and dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a 40-point half all year long," Mt Carmel Coach Peggy Brose 
said. "Maybe we should take a 2 1/2-hour bus trip before every game." 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils kept Hart (25-5) bottled up, especially in containing 6-foot-3 
senior center Sara Wilson, who scored just nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, last season's Times Valley Player of the Year, did not score until she 
sank a free throw midway through the third quarter and did not make a field 
goal until the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore point guard Anjanette Dionne, the other half of Hart's one-two punch, 
poured in a game-high 19 points -- including three three-point baskets -- but 
she also was largely neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's highlight of the evening came with 2 minutes 47 seconds to play when 
Dionne, after fouling out, received a standing ovation for her season-long 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the intensity tonight," said Dionne, who averaged 23 points a 
game this season. "I'm glad to see that everyone stayed until the end instead 
of leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel moved the ball swiftly, mostly to 5-8 junior forward Vicki de Jesus, 
who scored a team-high 17 points. Kris Grazzini, a 6-2 sophomore center, added 
16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Tara Schwerin (13) and Rachel Velasco (12) also scored in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a team that has no superstars but just plays well," Brose said. 
"Our shots were falling." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel made 27 of 53 (51%) from the field while Hart was 18 of 55 (32%). 
</P>
<P>
"We dug a hole," Munroe said simply. "But we played 30 games this year, we're 
allowed to make a mistake."
