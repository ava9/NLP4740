Aaron Wilhite, a 6-foot-8 senior center, set a San Diego Section rebounding 
record of 39 Friday as No. 2 Lincoln closed out its regular season with a 
105-59 victory over Hoover at Lincoln High School. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite, who also had 24 points, broke the old record of 38 set by Sweetwater's 
Michael Pitts against San Diego on Nov. 20, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"They were 39 legitimate rebounds," Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski said. "We had 
three different people keeping track. He looked at the record book earlier 
today and said, 'All I care about tonight is going out and getting rebounds.' 
And he got a ton of them." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive City Central League title for Lincoln (25-1, 
10-0). The Hornets' City Central League record during that span is 39-1. 
</P>
<P>
Bracey Simmons scored 18 points for Hoover (2-21, 1-9). 
</P>
<P>
In other City Central League games: 
</P>
<P>

quarter. Clark James was six for six from the line and Milton Miller was five 
for six. James scored 18 points and Miller added 16 for San Diego (17-4, 8-2). 
Christian is now 12-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>

lead visiting Crawford (16-8, 6-4) with 22 points.

<P>
Point Loma 54, Patrick Henry 53 -- The final day of the regular season began 
with the league looking at a possible five-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
Morse and Point Loma each were tied atop the league standings at 6-3 with a 
chance to win the title outright. Patrick Henry, Serra and Madison, all a game 
behind the leaders at 5-4, played in hopes of gaining a rare five-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma held off a furious Patrick Henry rally in the final minute to clinch 
the title at Point Loma High. Over at Morse, Serra did its part while searching 
for a co-title, knocking off Morse, 70-62. 
</P>
<P>
Madison tied Serra and Morse for second at 6-4 with a 98-70 victory over Mira 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry (16-10, 6-4) led for most of the game. With just over a minute to 
play, Point Loma's Beau Pack made a three-pointer, and Rob Quintana made one of 
two free throws to to give Point Loma (16-10, 7-3) a six-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Caesar then made a three-pointer for Patrick Henry, Bart Brandenburg made 
a jumper in the lane, Jason Lonsdale stole a pass and Patrick Henry called 
timeout with 7 seconds. Terence Hamilton missed from a step behind the free 
throw line, and Brandenburg's follow-up missed. 
</P>
<P>
Serra 70, Morse 62 -- Jermaine Jordan and Conrad Jones, a pair of quick 
5-foot-9 guards, controlled the game for Serra (14-9, 6-4) by combining for 35 
points and consistently beating the Morse press. 
</P>
<P>
Jones (16 points) did his damage mostly from the free throw line, making 11 of 
12, six of six in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who scored 19 points and made seven of 12 free throws, was more 
damaging when he wasn't scoring. He had five steals, five rebounds and 
exhibited an uncanny ability to find the open player under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Serra took a 34-27 halftime lead and increased it to 41-29 2 minutes into the 
third quarter. It maintained that 10-point advantage for most of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 2 minutes, the pressure began to rattle the Conquistadors. 
Leading, 64-54, with 1:58 to play, Morse's Jimmie Rose was fouled making a 
layup and made the free throw to close the gap to 64-57 with 1:44 left. Serra 
committed a turnover and with 1:36 to play, Darrell Lewis sank a three-pointer 
to close the margin to 64-60. Serra called timeout, then missed, and Rose set 
off on the fast break. Looking for a foul, he drove into Maurice Wade, who held 
his ground and took the charge as Rose's shot rolled off the rim.
