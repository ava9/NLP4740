For all of the wild plays, all of the six touchdown passes during regulation -- 
only one shorter than 20 yards -- the clincher to Friday's Point Loma-Orange 
Glen San Diego Section 3-A quarterfinal at Mesa College was a simple 10-yard 
pass during overtime. That and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma quarterback Danny White completed the pass to Marlon Manassa, and 
when Point Loma's Brett Callan intercepted a Daren Wilkinson pass two plays 
later, the game was over. Finally. 
</P>
<P>
The final score technically was 28-28, but Point Loma scored three touchdowns 
to Orange Glen's one during the California tiebreaker overtime to move Point 
Loma (8-4) into the section semifinals against the winner of tonight's Rancho 
Buena Vista-Southwest game. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma needed just two overtime touchdowns, but Callan ran 99 jubilant 
yards with his interception to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
This was after each team scored on its first overtime possession. Orange Glen 
took the ball first and scored on its second play. Wilkinson handed off to Noel 
Toloumu, who turned around and passed to Wilkinson in the end zone. David 
Napier made the conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma scored in more dramatic fashion. White passed 14 yards to J.J. 
Stokes on fourth and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen forced the overtime by scoring 15 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 28-13, Wilkinson passed 25 yards to Chris Ybarra with 3:59 left to 
make it 28-20. A minute and a half later, Orange Glen's Gabriel Munoz recovered 
John Faulkner's fumble at the Point Loma 35. Four players later, Ryan 
Strathearn bowled over from the two. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen then tied the game when Toloumu caught Wilkinson's pass for the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Point Loma nearly came back to win in regulation. White passed 16 
yards to Stokes and 33 yards to Callan on the Pointers' first two plays to give 
Point Loma first and 10 on the Orange Glen 15 with 16 seconds left. But Bob 
Simoneau missed a 33-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Strathearn's two-yard run to tie the game was the shortest touchdown play in a 
wild game. 
</P>
<P>
White had touchdown passes of 80, 59 and 19 yards to Stokes, and Manassa went 
55 yards for a touchdown on a fake reverse. Meanwhile, Orange Glen's Wilkinson 
passed 30 yards to Toloumu, 40 yards to 5-foot-8, 130-pound sophomore Kris 
Plash and 25 yards to Ybarra. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen led at the half, 13-7.
