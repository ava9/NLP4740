In a jigsaw puzzle, a tree with a missing piece is still as tree, just not as 
aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, a team with one of its top scorers out is still a team, just not 
as effective. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday night's Division I boys' basketball semifinal at Torrey Pines -- in 
which San Diego defeated Valhalla, 79-67 -- all personnel were accounted for 
but not present. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind, said San Diego Coach Dennis Kane. What matters is the kids on the 
court when it counts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of talking about the kids who are playing and the kids who aren't 
playing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who was playing: Clark James and Milton Miller for San Diego and Tony Clark for 
Valhalla. Clark finished with a game-high 35 points. James had a team-high 26 
points and Miller added 21. 
</P>
<P>
Who didn't play: Rafid Kiti for Valhalla and Raynard Wells for San Diego. 
Earlier in the day, Kiti suffered a collapsed lung, a condition that kept him 
out of six games in the regular season before he helped the Norsemen reach the 
round of four. 
</P>
<P>
Wells has been ailing academically and has been ineligible since early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Kane admitted that Kiti's presence would have made for a closer game. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kiti there, it's a different story, but we just had more then they did 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla played with San Diego in the first quarter but then fell further 
behind as the clocked ticked away. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavers pushed a 17-14 lead after one quarter to 37-32 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Any kind of a Valhalla comeback was then stifled by James (who scored four 
consecutive times for the Cavers to push them in front, 45-38 with 4:20 
remaining in the third) and Miller (whose four baskets in a row early in the 
fourth gave San Diego a 66-55 lead before Valhalla called a timeout with 4:23 
left). 
</P>
<P>
"When we started hitting," James said, "I knew we could keep it up. Coach said 
with their 2-3 zone, we could get any shot off we wanted. And we did." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make any excuses," Valhalla Coach Manny Silva said. "Miller and James 
were unbelievable tonight. I didn't feel that they outplayed us though." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he almost wished Kiti had been there. "I think it would have been a 
real great game if he had played." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE
