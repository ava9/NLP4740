Christian's Tony Clark broke another scoring record Friday, and if he continues 
as he has (he is averaging 43 points a game), he might break a couple more by 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Clark scored 58 points in Christian's 88-52 victory over Clairemont and by 
doing so reached 1,987 points, breaking the San Diego Section record for career 
scoring. Paul Halupa of Bonita Vista scored 1,982 from 1968-70. 
</P>
<P>
The 58 points were the third most scored in a county game. Madison's Mitchell 
Lilly scored 61 against San Diego in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Another record well within Clark's range is points in a single season. He has 
777 in 18 games and a minimum of six games remaining (five league and at least 
one in the playoffs), barring injury. Maintaining his 43-point average would 
give him 1,035 after 24 games, easily beating the record of 960 in 33 games set 
by Helix's Bill Walton in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Valhalla, Clark scored 847 points in 28 games to rank fourth 
behind Walton's record. 
</P>
<P>
The Clairemont girls' basketball team is undergoing yet another coaching change 
following David Watson's departure Monday. Watson, a former assistant, had 
taken over when Ken Grainger was fired Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Watson will be on-site aide Lamont Jackson. Jackson, a former 
Clairemont athlete, will coach on an interim basis for the remainder of the 
season, after which a new coach will be hired. Jackson will have to be teamed 
with a certified teacher, Vice Principal Peter Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Watson is leaving because he will begin full-time teaching at 
Kearny on Monday. Watson had been part-time at Kearny, giving him time to coach 
at Clairemont, but had said he would eventually have to give up the Clairemont 
position if his teaching hours increased. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my decision that he would leave now," Schroeder said. "It is a good 
time since we are between the first and second round of the (league) basketball 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines hopes to attract some of the country's best high school basketball 
teams when it plays host to the San Diego Above the Rim Holiday tournament next 
Dec. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-team tournament will begin at Torrey Pines and conclude at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top-ranked schools that may attend are Mater Dei (Santa Ana), St. 
Anthony's (N.J.) and Miami (Fla.) High. Torrey Pines and three other county 
schools (to be named) will also play. 
</P>
<P>
Having no gym and being forced to practice outside hasn't hampered the Our Lady 
of Peace girls' basketball team. The No. 9 Pilots (16-3, 4-0) defeated 
Christian, 49-38, Tuesday to break a tie with Christian for first place in the 
City Harbor League. 
</P>
<P>
OLP plays home games at St. Augustine but never really feels a home-court 
advantage, Coach Yvonne Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough driving all over, and it takes its toll on the girls," Sanchez 
said. "We had a game all the way out at Valhalla that was tough, and we 
couldn't schedule a home game with them." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said she cringed during the recent rains, although the team was able to 
practice at St. Michael's School in Poway on a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Tavares leads OLP by averaging 18.4 points per game, ninth in the county 
in scoring. April Velk is averaging 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
After a fourth-place finish in the Palomar League last season, the Mt. Carmel 
girls' soccer team has shut out 12 opponents this season and is second in the 
league behind Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (15-0-3, 6-0-2) tied Poway, 1-1, in last year's section 3-A final 
to share the title. Mt. Carmel (12-4-1, 5-2-1) has already broken its school 
record of eight shutouts in a season set in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Senior goalkeeper Heather Petterson is Mt. Carmel's only four-year varsity 
player. She started on the freshman team, but when Coach Jim Dutton needed a 
replacement on the varsity, she was moved up. In her first varsity game, Mt. 
Carmel tied Poway, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Petterson broke her thumb in the second league game her sophomore year and 
missed most of the rest of the season. But since then, she has been a constant 
force for Mt. Carmel with 27 career shutouts, 11 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She has great defense in front of her," Dutton said. "She does an excellent 
job of taking control." 
</P>
<P>
Petterson is backed by senior Michelle Daigle, called by Dutton "the best 
backup goalkeeper in San Diego". 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Leigh Anne Baker leads Mt. Carmel in scoring with 12 goals this 
season -- she had three in a 5-0 victory over Vista last week -- and has six 
assists. She had 35 goals on the freshman team last year. Jan Dolloff, also a 
sophomore forward, has six assists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're peaking when we need to," Dutton said. "We're reducing mistakes and 
playing smarter ball. We want to play 80 minutes of good soccer and more team 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel's senior midfielders have been with the program since they were 
freshmen -- Theresa Miranda, Kim Franzen, Christine Phillips and Jennifer 
Timms.
