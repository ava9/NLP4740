In Lisa Leslie's final home game at Morningside High School Thursday night, the 
Monarchs were afforded the surprising luxury of an easy victory, beating Mt. 
Carmel, 78-42, in the semifinals of the Southern California Regional Division I 
girls' basketball tournament.

<P>
Morningside (30-3), with 22 points from Leslie and 19 from sophomore Janet 
Davis, will play Friday at 6:30 p.m. at the Sports Arena for the championship 
and the right to defend its State Division I title in Oakland next week.

<P>
"We were able to rest some people, especially Lisa and Janet," Coach Frank 
Scott said, "which is nice with another game coming up so soon." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki de Jesus scored 18 points for Mt. Carmel (23-6), which advanced to the 
semifinals with an upset at Hart Tuesday night. Mt. Carmel never led and was 
unable to get to within 10 points of Morningside from early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who scored 101 points in one half of a game earlier this season, 
admitted that the Monarchs did almost whatever they wanted against the 
Sundevils but added: "They gave us a good game. I wish we had teams this 
competitive in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie made seven of 20 field-goal attempts, with 12 rebounds and eight blocked 
shots. "My shot was wasn't falling like it normally would," she said, "but I 
was glad to see Janet and my other teammates get into the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Bridgete Williams, a starting junior guard for Morningside, suffered torn 
ligaments in her lower leg in an accident at home earlier in the day, was 
placed in a cast and is out for the season. Junior Tyesha Whiting, starting in 
her place, scored six points. Princess Murray scored 12, all on four 
three-pointers.
