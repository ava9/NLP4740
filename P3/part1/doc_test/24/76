Southwest's baseball team is tired of having the word "upset" attached to its 
victories. But for now, the unranked and unheralded Raiders will settle for it. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday in a Metro Conference game, Southwest upset seventh-ranked and host 
Montgomery, 3-1, making the top of the league standings a crowded place to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it bothers me that people are calling these upsets," said Southwest Coach 
Tom Hernandez. "We're beating good teams, but we have the talent. I'm very 
happy with the way they're performing." 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. It is the second time this week Southwest has met a 
formidable opponent and come out a winner -- Tuesday it knocked off 
eighth-ranked Sweetwater, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
For Montgomery, is was a giant and costly step backward. The Aztecs (12-6, 4-2) 
began the week undefeated in league, but dropped a 2-1 decision to 10th-ranked 
Hilltop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the best team won today," said Manny Hermosillo, 
Montgomery coach. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest loaded the bases in the sixth with the score tied, 1-1. But relief 
pitcher Luis Arroyo got the next batter to hit into a force out, then 
registered a strikeout and another ground ball out to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried," Hernandez said. "We have been able to play catch-up a lot." 
</P>
<P>
And so in the seventh, Hernandez wasn't surprised when Ernie Negrete led off 
with a single to right, moved to second on a groundout and scored the winning 
run on Carlos Sanchez' RBI single to center. Rafael Padilla walked and a balk 
moved Sanchez and Padilla to third and second, and Sanchez scored on David 
Silva's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Especially impressive was the seven-inning, two-hit performance of sophomore 
Salvador Sanchez (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
"He was awesome," Hernandez said. "We're hoping he'll stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest improved to 7-10, 5-1. 
</P>
