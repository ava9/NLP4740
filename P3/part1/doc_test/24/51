Rancho Buena Vista 5, Sweetwater 4 -- Rancho Buena Vista scored the eventual 
winning run on a balk -- a call that Sweetwater (20-9) protested. Sweetwater's 
Larry Meza, a right-hander, had just taken the mound -- after Rancho Buena 
Vista scored two runs -- when he stepped backwards off the mound with his left 
foot. The umpire called a balk, and the Longhorns (16-11-1) went ahead, 5-4. 
Steve Valencia was two for four, and George Hadden (7-4) was the winner for 
Rancho Buena Vista, which will play host to Mira Mesa if the protest -- to be 
decided today -- is denied.

Miller (12-1) won in relief for Poway, which will play host to Monte Vista in
