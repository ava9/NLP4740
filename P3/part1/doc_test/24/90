John Farrell, Torrey Pines High's boys' basketball coach, was sitting just as 
close to the edge of his chair, chewing his gum just as hard and shouting 
instructions just as loudly in the second half as in the first half of his 
team's 95-58 Palomar League victory over Mt. Carmel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he remembered. Last season, Mt. Carmel was the only team to defeat the 
Falcons in the regular season. A learning experience? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Farrell said with a smile. "We learned that they beat us. We don't want 
that to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
If Wednesday's game at Torrey Pines was any indication, it probably won't this 
year. The suspense was over almost as quickly as the national anthem, which the 
Torrey Pines band played briskly in 1 minute 14 seconds. For all practical 
purposes, the Falcons (16-1, 2-0) put the game away about 3 minutes into the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied at 9, Torrey Pines went on a 14-2 run with center Kevin 
Flanagan and guard Kyle Armstrong scoring 6 points apiece. Flanagan scored 23 
first-half points, his high of the season, and finished with 25 after an 
unspectacular second half. Courtie Miller added 22 for the Falcons, Armstrong 
had 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons led, 32-16, at the end of the first quarter, 63-29, at halftime 
and, 81-44, at the end of the third quarter. Armstrong was 4 of 5 from 3-point 
range in the first half. Flanagan led Torrey Pines in rebounding with 10; 
Miller had 9. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel (9-6, 1-2) played without center Shane Knight, who is sick with the 
flu. In last season's Mt. Carmel win, Knight, a slender 6-foot 7-inch forward, 
burned the Falcons with backdoor layups and defensive rebounds. His services 
were sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have Shane next time," said Mt. Carmel Coach John Marincovich about the 
teams' other league meeting. "That will make a difference. We don't have much 
experience after him." 
</P>
<P>
Without Knight, Mt. Carmel was easy pickings for the Falcons, who broke a 
school record of 61 with 63 first-half points. Torrey Pines looked well on its 
way to a 100-point game when Farrell decided to have his team work on 
man-to-man defense and some new offensive schemes. So the second half lacked 
punch, and the entertainment factor waned anyway as the game's 2 dunks came in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"The second half left a lot to be desired," Flanagan said. "I think we tried to 
work on some things that we're probably not as good at." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel was led by 6-3 forward Mike Graves, who scored 10; Jason Mann and 
Mike Herman added 8 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said Torrey Pines had a little extra incentive for this game. Last 
year's game is still clear in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I forget?" he asked. "I was sure we wouldn't lose this one." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' only loss this year came against Miami Carol City in the final of 
the Palms Tournament 2 weeks ago in Ft. Myers, Fla. The Falcons were 
overmatched against Miami's two 6-10 forwards and its 7-foot center. 
</P>
<P>
"They're solid all the way around," Farrell said. "They've got all the tools 
and they complement each other. They haven't lost a tournament in 5 years." 
</P>
<P>
But here in San Diego, the Falcons are finding few opponents that can stay with 
their quick offense. Morse gave them their closest tussle of the season last 
Saturday in a 3-point Torrey Pines' victory. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, though, doesn't plan to take the Palomar League lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can give you a good game if you're not ready," he said. "This is a 
good league."
