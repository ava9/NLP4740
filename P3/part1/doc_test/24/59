</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three high school seniors have signed national letters-of-intent to play 
basketball at San Diego State, Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The three are Darnell Cherry, a 6-foot-10 forward from Morse High School; 
Marcus Banks, a 6-9 forward-center from East Central High in San Antonio; and 
John Molle, a 6-5 guard-forward from Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots as a junior last 
season. Banks averaged 17 points and 7 1/2 rebounds a game as a junior. In 
three games this season, he is averaging 28 points, 10 rebounds and six blocked 
shots a game. Molle averaged 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. He shot an 
Irvine High-record 89% from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego men's and women's basketball teams have each signed 
a player to a national letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Madden, a 6-0 guard from Bakersfield South High School, signed to play 
for the USD men's team. Madden was a first-team all-Kern County selection as a 
sophomore and a junior. He led the county last year in scoring with a 27-point 
average. Playing mostly point guard, he also averaged seven assists and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Signing with the USD women's team was Brittany Volk, a 5-11 guard from Oregon's 
Tigard High School. Volk averaged 8.6 points, 3.6 assists and 2.1 steals per 
game in leading Tigard to a 20-7 mark.

The San Diego State baseball team has signed eight players to national letters 
of intent, Coach Jim Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent is Jose Silva, a right-handed pitcher from Hilltop High. 
Silva was one of the most highly recruited players in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU also signed two pitchers from Fresno City Community College: right-hander 
Jeff Johnson and left-hander Richie Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
The five others to sign with the Aztecs: Mike Barber, a right-handed pitcher 
from Mt. San Antonio College; Benji Grigsby, a right-handed pitcher from Lassen 
Community College (Susanville, Calif.); Jay Hassel, a right-handed pitcher from 
Rancho Santiago Community College; Malcolm Warfield, an outfielder from 
Columbus Academy (Columbus, Ohio); and Ryan Nettles, a third baseman from 
Woodrow Wilson High (Tacoma, Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
Nettles is the son of former major leaguer Jim Nettles and the nephew of 
all-star third baseman Graig Nettles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the best 10-day recruiting period we've ever had here," Dietz 
said.
