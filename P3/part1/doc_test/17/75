FT  10 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: The Veep does it his way - US
vice-president Dan Quayle

In the summer of 1991, the Washington Post dispatched its two star reporters
on a mission to discover the truth about US Vice-President Dan Quayle.
Over the next six months, David Broder and Bob Woodward conducted more than
200 interviews; they enjoyed unprecedented access to the vice-president, at
home and abroad.
The resulting seven-part series created a mild sensation in Washington,
since it corrected the caricature of the 1988 election campaign, suggesting
it was time to take Mr Quayle seriously in 1992, an election year.
Today, the vice-president arrives in London, the last stop in a seven-day
European tour. He has delivered an address on defence issues to the
Wehr-kunde conference in Bavaria, expressed US solidarity during talks with
the leaders of the Baltic republics, and lunched with the US Olympic Team.
The political rehabilitation of Dan Quayle is well under way.
On the eve of his trip, Mr Quayle invited the Financial Times to take a
closer look, to see whether the Post's magnum opus really was the last word.
The scene was the West Wing of the White House, and Vice-President Quayle
was celebrating his 45th birthday, surrounded by photographs of his family,
two aides, and the Stars and Stripes. He was wearing a broad smile.
Mr Quayle accepted graciously his birthday present - the authorised history
of the Financial Times by David Kynaston - and immediately began to talk
about recent bed-time reading material: The Americans by Daniel Boorstin and
Seize the Moment, former President Richard Nixon's latest foreign policy
tome.
'Fascinating,' said the vice-president, 'balance of power and all that.'
It seemed churlish to interrupt, but remarks by Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa of Japan about the possible decline of the American work ethic had
made front-page news from coast to coast. What was his response?
'No, No,' said Mr Quayle. All very unfortunate. Maybe something had been
lost in the translation. Japan was a very important ally.
Yes, but what about the Japanese prime minister's specific charge that many
of America's economic problems came about because too many American college
graduates went to Wall Street in the 1980s, rather than producing something
of value?
'That's not true,' Mr Quayle shot back. 'If you look at our manufacturing
numbers - as far as our total gross national product, manufacturing is up.
I'm not going to get into a discussion of statistics, but I can tell you one
statistic that I know very well, and that is that manufacturing for us is
up. So we're still producing goods as well as services.'
The vice-president is correct in one respect: figures show that
manufacturing increased its share of gross domestic product in the second
half of the 1980's. But there has been a steady erosion in the manufacturing
workforce. In the 1980s, according to Professor Robert Reich of Harvard
University, one of the country's leading economists, more than 2m jobs
disappeared, 1m in the three years since the Bush/Quayle administration took
office.
Mr Quayle is, of course, a child of the 1980s. As a 33-year-old Congressman,
he rode the Reagan tide in 1980, crushing Senator Birch Bayh, the liberal
incumbent Democrat in Indiana. Over the next eight years, Mr Quayle carved
out a solid, but not particularly inspiring record in the US Senate,
developing some expertise in defence and national security issues.
Today, he has matured, his staff say. One aide noted that he spends between
60 and 90 minutes a day with President Bush when both men are in town.
Indeed, officials stress that the Veep attends all the high-level
intelligence briefings and receives all the top-secret information
rightfully due to someone who is a proverbial heart-beat away from the
presidency.
It is fashionable to engage in political revisionism about Quayle, so what
were the vice-president's views about the 1980s - once seen as the decade
when America regained its confidence, but now viewed as the decade of greed,
the era of easy money and the stretch limousine?
The vice-president paused. Maybe things on Wall Street might have gotten a
little out of hand; but 'even some of the richest people in this country had
to go to trial, and some went to prison. I think it will certainly serve as
a reminder that nobody is above the law'.
Mr Quayle is more exercised about executive pay in the US, especially when
it is unrelated to performance. Without naming names, Mr Quayle said: 'Where
you have those exorbitant salaries, totally unrelated to performance of the
company, it's ridiculous. I will go on record to say that for some,
executive compensation is way out of line.'
We turned to his European tour which includes stops in Finland, Lithuania,
the ski slopes of France - the vice-president likes to ski almost as much as
he likes a round of golf - Bavaria and London. Today he is due to meet Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, followed by talks tomorrow with Prime Minister John
Major, her successor, and Mr Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labour
party.
Would it make a dime's worth of difference if Labour or Conservative formed
the next government? Naturally, this was a matter for the British people to
decide, the vice-president replied. 'But let me just tell you that John
Major, in our viewpoint, has been one outstanding prime minister . . . There
is a very special relationship between the president, George Bush, and the
prime minister.'
And Labour? Well, Mr Bob Hawke, the recently ousted prime minister of
Australia, said the British Labour party had changed, an impression
confirmed during a couple of meetings with Mr Kinnock and other Labour
leaders. But of all the Labour MPs, Mr John Gilbert had a firm grip on
military matters. 'A very thoughtful individual,' Mr Quayle commented.
The vice-president seemed keen to stress the continuing need for an
independent British nuclear deterrent. 'It has worked, and if Great Britain
wants to relinquish its nuclear power capability who do you to abdicate this
to? Pakistan?'
The conversation shifted to Mr Boris Yeltsin who had just left the US after
his inaugural appearance at the UN and Camp David. Mr Quayle was not present
at either meeting, but he has met the Russian president on several occasions
(his staff suggest that both men share a common experience: each had a bad
press early on in Washington).
The vice-president has top-rate staff, both on domestic and foreign policy.
Mr Quayle was consistently sceptical about President Gorbachev and his
reform intentions, even as far back as 1987. What was his impression of Mr
Yeltsin?
'I trust his instincts. Before Gorbachev was willing to let the Baltics go,
he said they were going to go. He was proud that he was the first
democratically elected president of Russia, almost in history. I found him
very direct, very forthcoming.' But did he trust him? 'Trust is something
you hope for . . . something you earn.'
It was a rare moment of reflection. Mr Quayle often seems inclined to rush
to judgment (although other members of the administration credit him for
sound political instincts when it comes to negotiating with Republicans on
Capitol Hill). Yet every so often he also comes across as being caught in a
time-warp.
Asked if the US would support Germany and Japan becoming permanent members
of the UN Security Council, the vice-president stalled, suggesting that
countries such as Nigeria or Brazil would clamour for similar treatment.
Pressed that the US could easily lead the charge toward revising the entry
rules, Mr Quayle responded by minimising US influence: 'Look how losing side
on the UN resolutions that have come up. I wouldn't say that the UN is
pro-American by any stretch of the imagination.
This is an odd judgment coming one year after the US secured UN support for
waging war against Kuwait and when the Bush administration is calling for an
expanded role for the UN. It is a view which is at least five years out of
date.
The vice-president seems much more confident than four years ago when he
suffered a thousand indignities at the hands of the television and press.
Whatever the public doubts, he remains determined to continue his political
rehabilitation, and that includes mastering the intricacies of a second
presidential campaign.
'I am doing it my way . . . And I am going to rely on myself . . . I don't
need a lot of outside advice.' The vice-president speaks with the
conviction, if not yet the authority, of someone who has his sights on
higher office.
