commitment to make America a better place

AN inauguration is the ultimate American political rite of passage, intended
to set the tone for the presidency to come. Sometimes it does, sometimes it
does not.
The most memorable inaugural addresses are the stuff of history. George
Washington's first was held in New York and still holds the record for
brevity - 143 words. William Henry Harrison's in 1841 was the longest at 105
minutes. He caught pneumonia in the freezing cold and died just over a month
later.
Although selections are invidious, four addresses are generally accorded a
special place. Abraham Lincoln's in 1861, delivered to a nation in civil
war, was perhaps the finest exercise in inaugural oratory, exceeded only
marginally by his Gettysburg speech four years later. President-elect Bill
Clinton had no trouble quoting Mr Lincoln on Sunday night when he called on
the 'better angels of our nature' to guide his presidency.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's stirring commitment in 1933 to drag the country
out of the Depression was captured on nationwide radio and newsreel and
offered hope amid desolation.
'This nation asks for action and action now. . . we must act and act
quickly,' might not have a Lincolnesque ring but the words were precisely
what was wanted.
John Kennedy's generational call to arms - 'ask not what your country can do
for you but what you can do for your country' - held out similar promise,
although, unlike FDR's, it was not fulfilled in his brief term.
In 1981 Ronald Reagan switched the site of the inaugural address to the
west-facing steps of the Capitol, a neat symbol for a Californian. He then
declared that government had grown too big and would be cut down to size.
His administration proceeded to do what he had pledged.
His second inaugural was also prescient. It was held indoors because of the
ferocious cold and, although his second four years can be said to have
presaged the end of the cold war, they were also marked for some dubious
policies (such as Iran-Contra) that were never designed to see the light of
day.
Promise, however, often falls short. It was, after all, President Kennedy
who started the long, slippery slide into the Vietnam war and the death of
57,000 young Americans, a disproportionate number black. This, presumably,
was not the fate he had in mind when he asked them to 'bear any burden' so
that liberty might prevail.
In 1977 Jimmy Carter charmed the country with a thoughtful speech about the
inter-dependent world and by becoming the first to walk the length of
Pennsylvania Avenue hand in hand with his wife. Four years later, his
reflections seen as indecisive and the millstone of the hostages in Iran
round his neck, he was gone.
George Bush in 1989 said he would transform the Reagan legacy into 'a
kinder, gentler America' and a lot of people thought he had struck just the
right note. Today he goes back to Texas as a private citizen because his
countrymen concluded he had no idea how to make it so.
It is traditional now that every inaugural speech has grace notes, such as
Mr Carter complimenting Gerald Ford for all he had done to 'heal our
country' and Mr Reagan, less probably, being equally generous to Mr Carter.
Mr Clinton will have nice things to say about George Bush, because it is now
accepted and because he is a good charitable Christian.
It was not always thus: John Adams refused to attend Thomas Jefferson's
inaugural (the election had been determined, perhaps by connivance, in the
House of Representatives) while Herbert Hoover could barely bring himself to
look at FDR as they rode to the Capitol together.
Mr Clinton, who is a keen student of past presidents, has adopted a
quintessentially eclectic approach to his inaugural. This ranges from the
Jeffersonian ride from Monticello, through the extravaganza that marked the
advent of Kennedy and the populist themes so dear to Carter, to tomorrow's
open day at the White House.
This, however, will be by invitation only, perhaps because Mr Clinton delved
into what happened when Andrew Jackson opened the White House up to his
friends in 1829. They muddied the carpets and broke the furniture and
Jackson had to escape through a back window.
Mr Clinton will also strive for a distinctive note. He may not be the
youngest president, a honour belonging to Teddy Roosevelt, but, even more
than Kennedy, he is the representative of a different and younger
generation. This is a generation born after the last world war and not
tempered much, Vietnam apart, by conflict.
For many, opposition to that war was the common denominator. But in an age
deprived of the overweening cold war, yet consumed by so many independent
flashpoints, the 'old' qualifications, including military service, are no
longer deemed pre-eminent.
Many Americans of his age, though fired by the social and political activism
of the 1960s, subsequently dropped out or got law degrees, became affluent
and are now universally known as 'baby boomers' and 'yuppies'. But Mr
Clinton, though a lawyer, stayed in government and pushed for change.
His inaugural, like the better parts of his campaign, must be designed to
reawaken that activist commitment to make the nation a better place, now
stirring after a long sleep. The metaphors he chooses will be unwrapped
today, the promises offered to a hungry nation. There will be for a while a
positive national desire for him to succeed. The tough part, as ever, is
preserving that goodwill when the fires of the inauguration are but embers.
