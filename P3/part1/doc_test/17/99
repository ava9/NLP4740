THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE WHEN AMERICA GOES TO WAR: THE PRESIDENTS AND THE PEOPLE

Having never forgotten the "extraordinary" town hall meetings he would attend 
with his father, John Adams entered public office convinced that "the only 
moral foundation of government is the consent of the people." A representative 
assembly, he wrote, "should think, feel, reason, and act like them." After 
years of trying to quiet Americans' "hysterical" cries to join in the war 
against the French aristocracy, however, the President left office most proud 
of ignoring that public will: "I desire no other inscription over my 
gravestone," he wrote, "than 'Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the 
responsibility of the peace with France in the year 1800.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, American Presidents and their advisers remain no less torn between the 
Populist ideals they learned in school and the elitist temptation to "maintain 
the interest of the American people against their opinions," as Edmund Burke 
put it. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, of course, they are devout Populists, well aware of the longstanding 
antipathy of Americans toward those who govern them in monarchal isolation. 
This was reflected most recently in the televised Iran-Contra hearings, where 
secret government was not so much investigated as ritually denounced. But in 
private, once the hearings had concluded, the senators went back to practicing 
a form of government almost as secretive as the one they had been vilifying. 
</P>
<P>
As Richard Barnet illustrates in "The Rockets' Red Glare," America's top 
leaders have tended to chart foreign policies on their own, presenting them as 
faits accomplis to the public, as "commodities to be sold rather than a set of 
facts to be debated." Agreeing with Alexis de Tocqueville that "democracy tends 
to obey its feelings rather than its calculations," America's foreign-policy 
elite long has believed that our nation's security can be assured only when 
decisions are made independently of imprudent and irrational public pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, pre-election rhetoric often bears scant resemblance to 
post-election policy. As Barnet writes, "Wilson, Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson 
all campaigned on the implied promise to stay out of war; in each case, 
thousands of Americans were dying in battle within a year of their 
inauguration. Richard Nixon pleaded for votes by hinting that he had a 'secret 
plan' to end the Vietnam War with honor, a plan that did not exist. At the same 
time no one who voted for him could know that they were voting for 
normalization of relations with China." 
</P>
<P>
But have the policy makers actually been more prudent and rational than the 
people? Generally not, Barnet convincingly argues in this sophisticated 
revisionist history. As in his 1973 classic, "The Roots of War," he draws on 
his own experiences as an adviser in the Kennedy Administration to illustrate 
how the State Department's hermetic way of thinking has left it out of touch 
with geopolitical realities. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet's targets range from foreign-policy strategies that underestimate the 
significance and durability of indigenous cultures to a masculine ethic that 
makes retreat an unacceptable option. (Against the advice of its own military 
advisers, for instance, the Reagan Administration insisted on installing 
missiles in Europe because not doing so would be seen as "backing down" from 
European protests.) 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Barnet's previous books -- urgent responses to crises of the present 
or recent past -- "The Rockets' Red Glare" travels back to the founding of the 
republic to determine how the policy-makers came to be so far removed from the 
people. This distancing began when George Washington, trying to avoid an 
economically crippling war with Britain, claimed that the Constitution had 
given treaty-making powers exclusively to him and the Senate. The public 
initially rejected the argument, forming democratic "societies" to debate 
policy, but as the western continent beckoned and the population surged in the 
19th Century, vox populi became less dissonant. Turning inward, to the business 
of nation-building, Americans began to seek freedom on the frontier rather than 
in the town-hall debate. 
</P>
<P>
In a shift that created the modern campaign, political parties began 
simplifying issues rather than debating them, and candidates became 
personalities to be followed rather than ideologues to be challenged. Barnet 
recounts, for example, how a crowd trailed Andrew Jackson as he rode his horse 
to the White House after winning the scurrilous 1828 election. The crowd kept 
following, surging into the East Room, spilling punch, breaking glasses, 
putting muddy boots on damask chairs. Forced to escape his admirers by a rear 
window, the President took refuge in a nearby tavern. Lamented Charles Carroll, 
the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, "The tradition of 
cultivated manners is lost. Society is less brilliant and more prosperous." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's successors weren't always blessed with such enthusiastic followers: 
James Polk had to drum up support for the war with Mexico; William McKinley had 
to launch foreign adventures to prevent the spread of domestic strikes. But not 
until the end of World War I, when Woodrow Wilson failed to muster public 
support for the League of Nations, did domestic opposition truly cripple a 
President's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The public's failure to rise to Wilson's noble vision of a world peacekeeping 
force is commonly cited by elite historians to attack precisely the kind of 
participatory democracy that Barnet is trying to affirm. Barnet's response is 
persuasive. The League was a victim not so much of public ignobility, he 
writes, as of Senate-Executive Branch rivalries and, ironically, of government 
propaganda: U. S. attempts since the 1890s to discredit "foreign-inspired" 
labor activists had left Americans suspicious of all dealings with "wily" 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet is only partially successful at challenging the other principal argument 
of elite historians: that American pacifism prevented Franklin Roosevelt from 
standing up to Hitler before the German dictator made his first aggressive 
moves. He convincingly argues, as Clare Boothe Luce did, that Roosevelt would 
have been able to win the people's support had he led them into war through 
reasoning rather than lied them into it through bobbing, weaving rhetoric. But 
Roosevelt's concern over the vein of anti-Semitism in his own country, which 
discouraged him from bombing the Nazi gas chambers, is one indictment of public 
opinion's power that Barnet is unable to explain away. Barnet rightly blames 
the New York Times for burying on Page 12 the story of 750,000 deaths and 
Father Coughlin for fanning fears of a "world Jewish conspiracy." But the 
Times, Jewish-owned, also was responding to existing prejudices, just as the 
demagogue from Detroit exploited the public's need to hear facile explanations 
for social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Such irrationalities, together with a rising body of theory propounding a 
"human need" to barter away freedom for social order, were enough to diminish 
the faith in human reason which had inspired the Founding Fathers. And so, as 
illusions of pure democracy faded, postwar intellectuals began to assent and 
even to collude in the use of propaganda for purposes they deemed beneficent. 
They enlisted in the fight against isolationism, an American tendency following 
wars. Political and cultural propaganda eventually displaced anxiety about the 
Bomb onto the Soviets, and the Cold War was born. As Barnet writes, in the name 
of battling the Closed Society, the Open Society closed down on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet hails the reopening of American society in the 1976 elections. They were 
"a populist counterattack against the imperial presidency," he writes, giving 
"a burst of new energy for greater participation in decision making." But what 
Barnet sees as a lively period of participatory democracy, conservatives saw as 
a demoralizing era of "social disorder." Barnet blithely dismisses this view, 
deriding the New York Times for warning in its Bicentennial essay of "a wild 
disorientation about the style of American life, as though the national compass 
had been lost." 
</P>
<P>
But the view may well have had some truth to it, for statistics gathered in the 
'80s demonstrate that voter participation began declining precipitously in the 
post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era. It seems clear that as Americans grew more 
critical of their government, they also grew less enthusiastic about its 
policies and plans. It is ironic that Barnet does not recognize this 
relationship, for his book so eloquently illustrates its converse: When war 
propaganda has led Americans to uncritically accept their leaders' myths -- 
e.g., Stalin was bent on world conquest; it was the American Indian's "destiny" 
to be conquered -- the national sense of mission has become more energized and 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
Accurately observing that for the first time in our history we have no clear 
manifest destiny, Barnet suggests that we might well succeed in adopting a new 
mission: "mobilizing the energetic power of America to help save the planet." 
But Barnet's optimism is based on the unsupported assertion that Americans "are 
less dependent on stereotypes for simplifying reality" and more aware of 
foreign cultures than they were in the '50s and '60s. More problematically, it 
assumes that the challenge of global intercooperation will be enough to renew 
American nationalism, when his book has shown that nationalism grows primarily 
as Americans unite against others. 
</P>
<P>
Barnet's call for global unity might meet the same fate as the controversial 
1970s public-school textbooks that depicted American culture as but one of 
many, neither better nor worse than other ways of life. Eighties conservatives 
such as Allan Bloom saw these texts as undermining national morale. American 
students "must be taught that American culture is better than others," as 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett put it. 
</P>
<P>
All of this suggests some important questions we have yet to grapple with 
seriously: Can our nation remain stable and energized when its citizens 
question it from differing perspectives, or must it use propaganda to encourage 
a common perspective? Can a patriotic society be brightened by a thousand 
points of critical light, or must it inspire a more emotional devotion to a 
common set of colors, such as the red, white and blue, or the rockets' red 
glare?
