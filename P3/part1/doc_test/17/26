CELEBRATE GEORGE WASHINGTON, NOT FOR THE CHERRY TREE TALE BUT AS A MAN OF 
CHARACTER

This week marks the 257th anniversary of George Washington's birth, this year 
the bicentennial of his inauguration as President. 
</P>
<P>
If the thousands of volumes written about Washington were laid end to end, even 
that legendary hurler probably could not throw a silver dollar across them. Yet 
we do not know the man. We have relegated him to tales of hatchets and cherry 
trees, to antiquarian shrines and February sale ads. He is little more than a 
purse-lipped visage on our money. By trivializing him, we miss the lessons he 
could teach us. 
</P>
<P>
We imagine Washington to have been aloof and stiff. In fact, he was a man of 
personal charm and physical grace. These attributes contributed to the majestic 
presence that his contemporaries found so impressive. "His person," said Thomas 
Jefferson, "was fine, his stature exactly what one would wish, his deportment 
easy, erect and noble. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary War generation feared charismatic figures who could play upon 
the passions of the people in order to make themselves dictators. Washington's 
dignified and reserved demeanor helped to assure them that they could trust him 
with power. 
</P>
<P>
The impression Washington made was no accident. He consciously cultivated a 
style that fit the ideals and fears of his contemporaries. He deliberately set 
out to persuade them of his trustworthiness. In doing so, he displayed his 
genius as a political actor. He was not a hypocritical manipulator or a mere 
image created by media handlers. He and his contemporaries believed that a 
leader's exterior manner should reflect his interior character. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after his appointment as commander of the Continental Army, Washington 
demonstrated the linkage between his skill at political symbolism and his 
trustworthiness. Many Americans feared abuses of military power. History was 
filled with examples of popular military leaders who had become tyrants. New 
York's revolutionary legislature praised the general's ability and virtue, but 
then registered its concern "that whenever this important Contest shall be 
decided . . . You will chearfully resign the important Deposit committed into 
Your Hands, and reassume the Character of our worthiest Citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Washington tailored his reply to allay the fear of military despotism. On 
behalf of his fellow generals, he wrote: "When we assumed the Soldier, we did 
not lay aside the Citizen, &amp; we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in 
that happy Hour, when the establishment of American Liberty . . . shall enable 
us to return to our private Stations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This statement was not just shrewd public relations. It set the tone for all of 
Washington's future public service. "His was the singular destiny and merit," 
said Jefferson, "of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his 
career, civil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no 
other example." Washington's consistent submission to civilian authority and 
the laws helped establish an American tradition of civilian control of the 
military and constitutional restraints on the use of power. Thus have we been 
spared the tragic betrayal of our revolution, so often suffered by other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington deserves our gratitude for his sense of civic duty, but the 
achievement was not his alone. His fellow citizens made it unmistakably clear 
what they required of him. Obedience to legal limits and subordination to 
elected leaders would win him lasting fame. Abuse of the powers granted him 
would bring down everlasting execrations. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us today naively excuse lawless abuses by soldiers and presidential 
advisers and Presidents because they were promoting policies that we favor. 
Others cynically dismiss such misconduct because "they all do it." 
</P>
<P>
Washington and the revolutionary generation would have found our attitudes 
antithetical to the kind of government and public morality they demanded of one 
another and labored to hand down to us. They would never have considered 
Richard M. Nixon an elder statesman or Oliver L. North a national hero. When we 
laud such men or allow them to profit by their violation of the public trust, 
when we fail to hold our leaders to the standard of George Washington and his 
generation, we betray our civic inheritance. Worse, we betray ourselves.
