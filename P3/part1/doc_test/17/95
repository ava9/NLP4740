TEACHER LESS THAN IMPRESSED BY GRIPES OF LOSING CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

One message that is becoming very clear in this current business-political year 
is that "arrogance and indifference" do not sell well with the general public. 
Whether it is Donald Trump, a world leader or a small-fry politician, the 
public's attitude has been one of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, defeated candidate Kenneth Manning has complained about his loss in 
the 52nd Assembly Republican "primary" (Times, June 24). The fact is that Mr. 
Manning only garnered 17% of the actual vote, and only 6% of the registered 
Republicans, hardly a "mandate" for anyone who understands simple math. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that 17% came on the shirttails of his father, Tag Manning, who in his 
own right earned his political respect, instead of assuming that it was his 
"natural right" as did son Kenneth Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Manning hasn't endeared himself to the employees of the Hacienda La Puente 
School District or the community. Mr. Manning was the principal effort in 
leading the board to spend over $326,000 on a stadium at Wilson High School 
while approving $3 million in cuts in the school budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Manning did little if anything to bring about a resolve in the teachers' 
labor impasse of 22 months even though he advertised himself as the 
"educational candidate." Nor did Mr. Manning project much of a democratic image 
to the students of our district when he arrogantly stated that all other 
candidates should just quit the primary race because they didn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need a Board of Education member or an Assembly representative 
that mocks the democratic process, speaks with a double tongue on party unity 
or publicly embarrasses everyone with his completely unsportsmanlike behavior 
as a "bad loser?" 
</P>
<P>
As far as Mr. Manning's penchant with conservatism goes, if George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and the rest of our forefathers were ultra 
conservative, we would still be singing "God Bless the Queen," and this country 
wouldn't exist.
