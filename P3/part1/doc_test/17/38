DIPLOMACY: A WARNING FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON SHOULD BE HEEDED ANEW: IT IS OUR

As Eastern Europe throws off its shackles, now's the time for the United States 
to shed its chains as well. For almost 50 years we have been in a bondage 
eloquently described by President George Washington in his farewell address of 
1796. Usually dismissed as a caution against entangling alliances, his remarks 
actually warned of a much more insidious danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more essential," he said, "than that permanent, inveterate 
antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others 
should be excluded. . . . The nation which indulges toward another an habitual 
hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its 
animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray 
from its duty and its interests." 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, our allies more than our adversaries have been the ones who have 
led us away from our real interests. Our animosity to the Communist Bloc led us 
to see the world as a zero-sum game in which allies became counters in the 
win-lose equation. The more allies you had, the better you were doing. 
Realizing the power that gave them, many of our so-called friends became adept 
at using the threat of encroaching communism to bilk the United States at every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the Army War College conducted a study on the effectiveness of 
U.S. security assistance and found that, for all the billions expended, the 
United States had purchased few friends and precious little influence. Further, 
in many cases, reverse influence had developed, "making it difficult for the 
United States to disengage from a relationship which no longer serves U.S. 
interests." These nations had become, in Stanley Karnow's phrase, "puppets who 
pulled their own strings." 
</P>
<P>
With the attenuation of the Soviet threat, now is the time to cut those strings 
and divest ourselves of "allies" who continue to beggar and enslave us. As 
Washington said, "a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a 
variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation (facilitates) the illusion 
of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists 
and . . . leads also to concessions . . . of privileges denied to others." 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to substitute practicality for passion. 
</P>
<P>
Using American interests as the litmus test, do we really need to put up with 
Spanish and Greek blackmail to maintain bases in the Mediterranean, bases whose 
usefulness is now in question? And do we really need to put up with the insults 
of Philippine officials and their unseemly demands for ransom for our bases 
there? With America's opening to the People's Republic of China almost two 
decades ago, the Philippines' strategic usefulness has passed. The days of 
extortion are over, and those who try it should be told to take the bases and 
do with them what they may. 
</P>
<P>
The days of the United States as nattering nanny are over as well. Although 
then talking about Europe, George Washington could have been talking about the 
Middle East today when he warned "she must be engaged in frequent 
controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. 
Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial 
ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics. 
</P>
<P>
With his words in mind, why are we paying more than $3 billion in foreign aid 
each year to Israel and another $2 billion to Egypt, now that the chances of 
Soviet encroachment in the area are almost nil? The likelihood of the Soviet 
Union's arming Syria and Iraq for another Arab-Israeli war is fast diminishing. 
Why, then, is the Middle East peace process an American responsibility? After 
all the grief he caught over his recent remarks about East Jerusalem, George 
Bush ought to take the words of George Washington to heart and opt out, thereby 
encouraging the region to grow up and settle its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in constructing a viable post-Cold War strategy should be to cut 
through the animosities and affections that have grown up in the course of that 
Cold War and to rediscover and build on our true national interests. But, as 
Washington pointed out, that will not be easy. We are still plagued by 
"ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who devote themselves to the favorite 
nation" and who have the "facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of 
their own country without odium." 
</P>
<P>
We must wake up and turn a jaundiced eye toward our so-called friends. The rest 
of the world is throwing off its chains. It's time we Americans did so as well.
