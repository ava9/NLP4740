<P>
France mourned one of its most popular and prolific writers Wednesday as the 
body of Georges Simenon, author of more than 500 books, including the immensely 
successful Inspector Maigret detective series, was cremated in a family 
ceremony near his home in Lausanne, Switzerland. Simenon died in his sleep 
Monday night after a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
The French government television network, Antenne 2, suspended regular 
programing Wednesday night for special broadcasts on the life and work of the 
Belgian-born author. Homage to Simenon, whom the French Nobel laureate Andre 
Gide honored in 1939 as "perhaps the greatest and most genuine novelist of 
today's French literature," poured in from every corner of the French-speaking 
world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Giant' 
</P>
<P>
Actor Jean Richard, one of 22 performers who played Inspector Jules Maigret in 
movies and on television, described Simenon as "a giant who has disappeared." 
In all, 52 films and 211 television episodes were made from Simenon's books. 
</P>
<P>
Even detectives at Paris police headquarters, the Palais de Justice at 36 Quai 
des Orfevres, the setting for most of the Maigret books, said they had been 
inspired by Simenon's work. 
</P>
<P>
"For us here at '36,' " Police Director Jean-Pierre Sanguy said, "Simenon was a 
lesson of classic discipline in his investigations and humanity in his 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
In Maigret, the pipe-smoking intellectual police commissioner with great, 
almost omniscient, objectivity that allowed him to see even the most brutal 
criminals "without pity or hatred," Simenon created an idealized Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Simenon's many biographers contend that the author himself began to 
adopt Maigret's traits as the character evolved, beginning with "The Strange 
Case of Peter the Lett" in 1931, through more than 80 books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unflattering Biography 
</P>
<P>
One writer commented Wednesday in the newspaper Le Monde, "Simenon gave birth 
to Maigret and then adopted his tastes, his tics, his methods to the point that 
one could ask who is the father of the other." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Denise Quimet Simenon, the author's second wife, from whom he 
separated in 1969, said in an unflattering biography that he even demanded that 
she imitate the fictional detective's wife, including gaining weight. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector and Madame Maigret were what many consider an ideal petit-bourgeois 
couple. He was absolutely respectful and faithful to his wife. She brought his 
slippers, filled his pipe and always had a hot meal waiting when he arrived 
home late from work. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Simenon was much more complicated than his character. He said in his 
characteristically copious memoirs that he had made love to 10,000 women, 
ostensibly to study female traits for his novels. He described his stormy 
second marriage as an "infernal symphony." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Committed Suicide 
</P>
<P>
The most telling blow in his life came when his beloved 25-year-old daughter, 
Marie-Jo, committed suicide in 1978, shortly after he began a relationship with 
his second wife's chambermaid, a lasting arrangement in which he claimed to 
find "complete harmony." In his will, Simenon stipulated that his ashes be 
spread on the same spot as his daughter's under a 250-year-old cedar tree 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Liege, Belgium, on Feb. 13, 1903, Simenon quit school at 16 and worked 
as an apprentice baker before launching his writing career as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Paris in 1922 and began producing books under 17 different 
pseudonyms, including comical names such as Monsieur Le Coq, Bobette and La 
Deshabilleuse. An early financial success, he began to enjoy literary 
recognition in the 1920s when the writer Collette spotted his work and 
encouraged him. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled extensively and lived in the United States and Canada before moving 
to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple, Direct Style 
</P>
<P>
Simenon had a crisp, clear writing style, a strong sense of the mot juste that 
is admired in French writing and a genius for descriptive writing. His simple, 
direct style helped make him one of the most exported French writers in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
His books have been translated into 55 languages. A United Nations survey in 
1973 estimated that more than 500 million copies of Simenon's books, including 
pirated editions, had sold worldwide. He was especially popular in the Soviet 
Union, where editions of his works sometimes sold 500,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of Simenon's work, in fact, has always detracted from his reputation 
as a writer. He appeared to produce books without effort, bragging once to Gide 
that he could complete an entire novel in three days. During his peak years of 
production, in the 1960s, he wrote an average of six books a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complete Works Planned 
</P>
<P>
His Paris publisher recently decided to publish the complete works of Simenon, 
an effort that will require 32 volumes of 800 pages each before it is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I have an idea for a book," Simenon once joked, "I have to ask 
myself if I have already written it." 
</P>
<P>
Simenon's productivity, which may have kept him from winning the Nobel Prize 
that some believed he deserved, was best illustrated in an anecdote attributed 
to Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to reach Simenon on the telephone, Hitchcock was intercepted by the 
writer's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"Impossible to connect you," she said, "he's just started a book." 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," Hitchcock is said to have replied. "I'll wait on the line until 
he finishes."
