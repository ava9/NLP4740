No comments were received on the Federalism implications of this rule. The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule
under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The authority to issue regulations requiring ballast water management practices for vessels navigating the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ, has been committed to the Coast Guard
by the Act. Standardizing the minimum requirements for these vessels is necessary to effectively prevent further
introductions of nonindigenous species. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt state and local regulations
that are inconsistent with the requirements of this final rule. These regulations were developed in consultation
with the Task Force which is charged with coordinating among, and providing technical assistance to, regional, State,
and local entities regarding environmentally sound approaches to prevention and control of aquatic nuisance species.

No comments were received on the environmental implications of this rule. The Coast Guard considered the environmental
impact of this final rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An
Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available for inspection or copying where indicated

. The exchange of ballast water in open ocean will benefit the Hudson River environment and the Great Lakes environment
by helping to prevent potential infestations of nonindigenous species through ballast water emptied into the Hudson
River north of the George Washington Bridge and transferred through the Hudson River and into the Great Lakes. Introduction
of nonindigenous nuisance species through the ballast water of vessels has caused millions of dollars of damage to
date in the Great Lakes area.

Initial study has concluded that the amount of vessels' seawater-ballast to be discharged into the Hudson River will
constitute such a small volume that no change in the salinity or temperature levels will occur. Species contained
in water collected from the open ocean are unlikely to survive a fresh water environment. Any nuisance species contained
in the ballast water will not therefore, create a new infestation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these regulations will help to prevent potential infestations of species introduced through the ballast water
of vessels, data from the Army Corps of Engineers shows that no vessel traveled north of the George Washington Bridge
in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast
water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has concluded that the regulations will have no negative impact on the environment.
