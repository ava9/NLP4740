In the heart of Orange County, in a typically stylish Irvine home, but in a 
ceremony as old as China itself, Tze-fan Deng will be there to honor her 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
This family observance Jan. 26, the eve of Chinese New Year's Day, will be led 
by the tiny 78-year-old matriarch herself and held in her son Eh Deng's 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her children and grandchildren will attend. The incense will be burned. 
The traditional wine, fish and meats will be meticulously arranged. 
</P>
<P>
As it should be. As members of this clan have done on each ancestral ceremony 
wherever they lived. Shanghai. Taipei. Singapore. Montreal. Dallas. Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot forget the old customs, the old ways of respect," the matriarch said 
during a recent visit to the home, also in Irvine, of her daughter, Ping, and 
son-in-law, Hon Yow. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Tze-fan Deng has not forgotten tradition. She still prefers wearing 
the traditional Chinese dresses, speaks only in the Mandarin and Shanghai 
dialects and remains unfailingly polite to outsiders, especially those who 
speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
But the matriarch, born in China's Jiangsu Province, an exile for years in 
Taiwan and now an American resident, still has a commanding aura, unflinching 
eyes and fierce ethnic pride. 
</P>
<P>
And the mission now is to pass on the Chinese heritage, even here in America, 
even though she is all-too-mindful of the enormous erosion to her native 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she felt the younger Chinese-American generations are becoming too 
Americanized, too forgetful of their Chinese past, Tze-fan Deng replied -- with 
politely terse but sweeping understatement: 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think so. A little." 
</P>
<P>
Hon and Ping Yow already fear that their daughters, Loraine, 8, and Rowena, 6 
-- both American-born and American-raised -- may be losing too much of their 
Chinese-ness. 
</P>
<P>
So, like all the other parents affiliated with the Irvine Chinese School, the 
Yows have taken certain precautions. They speak only Chinese to their children. 
They impress upon them the importance of traditional Chinese obligations at 
home and exemplary performance in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
And each Sunday morning at the Irvine Chinese School, the Yow girls join the 
other children, practicing spoken and written Chinese, being told about Chinese 
cultural and scientific achievements. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Yows, like the other Chinese school parents, said it is "wrong" 
and "a misunderstanding" for others to contend -- as some "English only" 
American advocates do -- that this kind of bilingual, ethnic-pride activism can 
perpetuate Asian isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, this issue, the Yows suggested, is not really so simple. For one 
thing, no one is questioning the obvious fact that English "is America's 
language." And Hon said their belief is strong that "America is the best place 
in the world in so many ways -- the best democracy, the most stable system, the 
most opportunities for our children." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hon added, Chinese immigrant parents "believe we can be proud of being 
American citizens and still be proud of being Chinese." Most of the parents in 
the Chinese school, including the Yows, are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"America is famous as a multicultural society, where other people -- from 
Europe, from Latin America, from other countries -- also want to preserve the 
languages and heritage," said Ping, who was principal of the Irvine school in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the old language is the key to preserving the old culture," she said. 
"For many (immigrants), it is the way we communicate." 
</P>
<P>
The Yows' most personal goal -- their "Chinese dream," they said -- is to 
return sometime in the next few years to Taiwan or Singapore with their 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if bringing their children back to live in Asia might be resented by some 
Americans, Ping, who was born in Shanghai, replied: 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the same as American students, those in college, who go abroad to 
study or work to learn about a second culture," she said. "Only, we want to 
give our children this same opportunity while they are younger." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be for only a few years," she added. "It would not be forever." 
</P>
<P>
"Books are fine, and we are grateful for having a Chinese school" in Irvine, 
said Hon, who was born in Malaysia, his father an immigrant from China's 
Guangdong Province. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "this is not quite the same. Our children should have the chance 
of direct experience, of being there in the old society." 
</P>
<P>
The Yows themselves have engaged in this kind of global mobility. Hon, 45, an 
engineer, was schooled in Singapore and Bangkok and studied at Taiwan National 
University. Ping, 42, a graduate of the same university, went on to study 
sociology in Canada in the early 1970s and hold jobs in Houston and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
And after they were married in Taipei in 1978, Hon's line of work took them 
elsewhere on the international circuit -- first to Olympia, Wash., back to 
Singapore, then finally to Irvine in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan for their children would greatly please the family matriarch. After 
all, said Tze-fan Deng's daughter, the issue, as always, comes down to passing 
the torch. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what can happen to the children," Ping said. "They go through a period 
of doubts. They are not proud of our heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Ping, her voice subdued, then added: "We don't want that to happen. We must do 
our best to avoid it. It would be a very terrible loss." 
</P>
<P>
Like the other Irvine Chinese School parents, the Yows feel an immense loss 
over the martial-law crackdown in China. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, a return to the mainland was unthinkable, particularly for such 
families as Ping's, who fled to Nationalist-governed Taiwan in the late 1940s 
and have their own stories of Communist persecution to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Ping was barely 2 years old when her father -- Jack Deng, a Shanghai textile 
entrepreneur -- had to bring the family to Taiwan, just as the Communist armies 
were sweeping closer to the Yangtze River delta. 
</P>
<P>
When her father returned alone to Shanghai in early 1949 to find a sister and 
recover some textile machinery, he was captured by the Communists and 
imprisoned. Later, the new regime allowed him to run his old factory. But in 
1962, he managed to flee to Hong Kong, where he eventually rebuilt his 
business. In 1977, he died of a lung ailment, the result, his family said, of 
his Communist imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, when the Beijing regime was opening the mainland to more 
tourists and foreign ventures, Chinese from outside regions began returning to 
see aging relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hon Yow, then working for a Singapore corporation, in 1986 made a 
hotel-development business trip to the mainland -- his first visit ever there 
-- that included a meeting with relatives in Guangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
And Ping's 78-year-old mother, Tze-fan Deng, in 1986 traveled to Shanghai for a 
reunion, the first in 38 years, with her sister and other relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
Ping did not go. 
</P>
<P>
"Before (last) June 4, I thought I might eventually go. I felt there was some 
hope there," Ping explained. "But no, not after Tian An Men (the massacre). 
People are scared to go now." 
</P>
<P>
Neither she nor Hon plan to return. "All of a sudden, any hope is crushed. It 
makes us feel so angry, so sad, so helpless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Ping Yow added, softly: "I don't think there is any more hope for 
democracy there. Not in my lifetime."
