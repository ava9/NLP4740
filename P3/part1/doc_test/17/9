</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The peaceful transfer of power in America -- what George Bush called 
"democracy's big day" -- was celebrated Friday with moments of pageantry, 
solemnity, joy and politics as tens of thousands crammed into the monumental 
center of Washington to wait, jostle and crane for the barest glimpse of the 
inaugural excitement. 
</P>
<P>
On an extraordinary sunlit winter's day, with winds sending swirls and clusters 
of cloud across the sky, President Bush made the wait worthwhile for thousands 
of well-wishers by emerging from his new $600,000 limousine three times during 
the inaugural parade, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue with his wife, Barbara, 
at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching Mrs. Bush's hand, the new President, hatless but wearing a gray 
overcoat and scarf in the sometimes biting wind, waved happily to the crowds 
who cheered in return and then shouted, "No, no, no," whenever nervous Secret 
Service bodyguards succeeded in ushering the Bushes back into the limousine 
with the "USA-1" license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see him walking?" a woman cried out to her children at the corner of 
Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street. "You got to see him and wave to him. All 
right!" 
</P>
<P>
Bush handled the mixed mood of the day -- the blending of happiness and history 
-- with great ease and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Minutes Late 
</P>
<P>
He actually took his oath of office on the West Front of the Capitol a few 
minutes late -- just after the noon hour set by the Constitution for the end of 
the term of President Reagan. Perhaps to make up for the lost moments, Bush, a 
hand on both the Bush family Bible and on the Bible used by President George 
Washington at his inauguration 200 years ago, got ahead of himself in repeating 
the oath, breaking in before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist could finish 
reading the first few words. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush soon calmed, his serious features forming into a half-smile as the 
oath neared its end and finally breaking into a full smile, practically a 
happy, boyish grin, when it was over. Then, for the first time as President of 
the United States, he heard a military band play "Hail to the Chief" in his 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the symbol of an American presidential inauguration was 
demonstrated most clearly by 43-year-old Cynthia Levi of Chattanooga, Tenn. She 
had shown up before dawn at 4:30 a.m. to become first in line for the standing 
room at the foot of Capitol Hill. A Democrat, she explained simply: "I'm here 
because he's our new President." 
</P>
<P>
Other patient enthusiasts included Paul Gleason, a history teacher from 
Lincoln, Ill., and his wife, Cheryl. "We're used to standing," he said. "This 
is my fifth inauguration." 
</P>
<P>
Levi and the Gleasons were joined later by more than 100,000 others -- 
including a group of seniors who spelled out the message, "Good Luck Mr. 
President," with a single letter on each of their blue shirts. All crowded 
beneath the hill to see and hear a distant figure of a new President take the 
oath and then deliver his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from most inaugural addresses, Bush, who had attended a 
non-televised service at St. John's Church on Lafayette Square across from the 
White House in the morning, included a formal prayer in his own speech. Calling 
it his first act as President, he prayed to the heavenly father to "write on 
our heart these words: 'Use power to help people.' " 
</P>
<P>
With five enormous flags hanging from the Capitol -- two copies of the 13-star 
flags from the first days of the republic in 1789 and three modern 50-star 
flags -- Bush stressed the continuity of American history. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington, the President said, "would, I think, be gladdened by this 
day. For today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity 
these 200 years since our government began." 
</P>
<P>
In a message to schoolchildren watching the inauguration on television screens 
in their classrooms, Bush said: "Thank you for watching democracy's big day." 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural parade, led by Bush and a presidential honor guard, also linked 
the new Administration with history, for inaugural parades have been a hallmark 
of presidencies since Andrew Jackson on horseback led his followers down 
Pennsylvania Avenue in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 12,000 marchers, 54 bands, 79 floats and 457 horses took part in 
Friday's parade along the 2.2-mile route between the Capitol and the White 
House. For some it was old hat. Robert Auguste, a trumpeter for the Connecticut 
1st Company Governor's Foot Guard, has marched in every parade since the John 
F. Kennedy inauguration of 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to feel proud and patriotic because you're involved in it," said 
Auguste, a 54-year-old plumber. 
</P>
<P>
Some were obviously not supporters of Bush. Paul DiTeodoro, a 20-year-old 
member of the Purdue University marching band, wore a badge under his uniform 
supporting the defeated Democratic candidate for President, Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis of Massachusetts. But he was good-natured about his difference. "It's 
better not to be too bitter about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some high school students muted their excitement somewhat. Jane McDonald, who 
marched with Shawnee Mission Northwest High School of Kansas, said: "I like 
George Bush and I'm glad I came. But it's kind of cold. . . . I hope we get to 
go to the Super Bowl next year." 
</P>
<P>
"We came because we want to see Bush," said 13-year-old Lauren Rubin of 
Rockville, Md. "And so we could get out of school." 
</P>
<P>
A number of protest signs cropped up along the parade route when President and 
Mrs. Bush passed by. Some called on the new Administration to "Keep Abortion 
Legal" and "Free Nicaragua." In one case of special pleading, followers of 
Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., the political extremist recently convicted in a fraud 
case, carried signs demanding: "Pardon LaRouche." 
</P>
<P>
But the protesters, though accepted without rancor, were vastly outnumbered by 
the cheerers and clappers along the parade route, including a large number who 
chatted in Spanish to their children, pointing out the strolling Bushes to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Bush, wearing high-heeled shoes, often had to trot to keep up 
with the President along Pennsylvania Avenue, she rarely fell behind during all 
the many events of the day, chatting with friends, blowing kisses, waving, 
flicking a speck off the cheek of an Episcopal minister outside St. John's 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
And there was little doubt about the affection for her. When the Bushes showed 
up at church in the morning, some in the crowd of onlookers applauded Bush but 
shouted, "Hey, Barbara," at her. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Walbrecht of Alexandria, Va., attending only her first inauguration 
despite living in the Washington area for 20 years, said that she had done so 
partly because she liked the Bushes so much. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially Barbara," she said. "She's marvelous. She's a grandma. I'm a 
grandma. I say good for her."
