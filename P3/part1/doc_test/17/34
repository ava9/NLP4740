When the American painter Benjamin West first saw the Apollo Belvedere
during a visit to Rome in 1759, he exclaimed: 'How like a Mohawk warrior.'
What did he mean? His likening that supremely elegant classic figure, clad
only in a decorative cape, to an equally naked James Fenimore Cooperhero
wearing war-paint and feathers, showed a very 18th-century concept of
nobility and a profoundly literary attitude towards native Americans. But
the reaction also shows the long association between American artists and
Italy.
That relationship, is explored in a carefully selected exhibition first
shown at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The Lure of Italy, American Artists
and The Italian Experience 1760-1914 (it moves on to Cleveland and Houston).
West, later to settle in London, is represented by several works, including
a portrait of his wife and their oldest son, called Raphael, and as a
further homage to the Renaissance artist, West imitated the pose of the
Madonna della seggiola - a picture often copied by visiting painters to
satisfy requests from art-loving customers back home.
West studied other classical works in Rome, among them the Ara Pocis, whose
ritual procession is echoed in his neo-classical composition, Agrippina
Landing at Brindisium with the Ashes of Germanicus, painted after the artist
left Italy and settled in England. His powerful patron the Archbishop of
York, who had commissioned the picture, then presented it to the King, who
also became a patron of West's.
Foreign travellers in those days tended to give Florence short shrift while
concentrating on Rome, Naples and its nearby Pompeii and Herculaneum. Italy
represented classical civilisation and even in portraits, like the 1775 John
Singleton Copley double portrayal of the wealthy Carolina merchant Ralph
Izard and his wife, there are numerous references to Roman and Greek
culture: an urn, a column, the Colosseum in the distance and, in the middle
ground, the 1st century AD group of Orestes and Electra.
As the 19th century began, a taste for landscape developed; and Lake Nemi,
the Alban hills, the campagna with the arches of a solitary Roman aqueduct
became standard ingredients of often large paintings. The tone was even more
arcadian in the works of Thomas Cole and George Inness, major exponents of
the Hudson River school, ready to abandon the untamed nature of wild America
for Italian landscape rich in literary resonances.
One of the most revealing curiosities of the exhibition is a canvas painted
by three men (George Healy, Frederic Church and Jarvis McEntee) in 1871,
entitled 'Arch of Titus'. The arch, framing the colosseum, is certainly the
protagonist of the picture, but it also depicts two contemporary groups;
one, in the right foreground, comprises the three artists; in the other
shows an elderly, white-bearded man strolling with a blond young girl. They
are the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his daughter Edith. Though
Longfellow had unkind things to say about Italy he was a devoted scholar of
Italian culture and a thoughtful translator of Dante.
Appreciation of American 19th century sculpture has lagged behind studies of
the painting of the period; but this exhibition devotes considerable space
to the works of Horatio Greenough (a Canova-like, idealised George
Washington), Thomas Crawford, William Wertmore Story, Harriet Hosmer and
Randolph Rogers.
Some Americans lived in Italy while remaining indifferent to modern Italy;
but others shared in the turmoil and excitement of the Risorgimento years.
There are occasional reflections of 19th century reality among the works to
be seen: Albert Bierstadt's genre scene at the Portico d'Ottavio fish-market
has a Fellinian vivacity, and Martin Johnson Heade's 'Roman Newsboys',
showing two urchins against a wall with Risorgimento graffiti, is perhaps an
indirect tribute to the brief Roman republic of 1848-49 , which allowed a
free press and the publication of Don Pirione, the satirical sheet that the
boys are selling.
By the end of the century, the capital of expatriate artists had moved to
Venice, where American hostesses fought over Henry James and Robert
Browning, where Whistler visited briefly, as did the neo-impressionist
Maurice Prendergast. The Italian-born, cosmopolitan John Singer Sargent paid
long visits to Venice, as he did to Rome. The Whistlers and Sargents in this
show are particularly appealing.
Prepared bu Boston curator Theodore Stebbins, also responsible for the fine
catalogue, The Lure of Italy opens at the Cleveland Museum in February, and
in May it goes to Houston for six weeks.
