The parents of a cancer patient who died shortly after being forced to undergo 
a Cesarean section have ended their three-year battle, winning an unprecedented 
settlement that the ACLU called "an important victory for women's rights." 
</P>
<P>
"All through her short life, Angie wanted to help other people," Nettie Stoner 
said of her daughter, Angela Carder. "Through her last tragedy, little did she 
know that even though she would not be here, she would continue to help 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement Monday between George Washington University Hospital and 
Carder's family includes a monetary award and an agreement by the hospital to 
establish policies protecting pregnant women's rights to determine their 
medical treatment. Both parties agreed not to disclose the size of the award. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not want the dollar amount to overshadow what we think is the more 
significant outcome of the case, which is the policy perspective," said Terry 
Thorton, an attorney working with the ACLU who represented the family. 
</P>
<P>
Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient at the hospital, died in 1987, two days 
after doctors performed a Cesarean section, ordered by a lower court, in an 
attempt to save the life of her 26-week-old fetus. The baby died less than 
three hours after the operation, which was listed as a contributing factor in 
Carder's death. 
</P>
<P>
Carder's parents, who live in Clarksville, Md., appealed the order, saying that 
their daughter, who was conscious and coherent at the time of the operation, 
did not give informed consent. Further, the family charged that the surgery 
violated Carder's right to bodily integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in the family's favor, saying: 
"A fetus cannot have rights . . . superior to those of a person who has already 
been born." 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Stoners, the ACLU brought a civil suit and a medical 
malpractice case against the hospital, charging that it had not taken 
sufficient measures to determine Carder's wishes and did not consult the family 
before requesting the court order. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has agreed to establish policies aimed at precluding court 
intervention in such cases.
