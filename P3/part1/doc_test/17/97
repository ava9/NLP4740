RUNNING MATE IN 1968.

Curtis Emerson LeMay, the tough bomber general who directed the smashing of 
German and Japanese cities during World War II and then built the Strategic Air 
Command into a powerful nuclear strike force, died Monday of a heart attack. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
The four-star general relayed President Harry S. Truman's orders to drop 
nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the war, despite his 
later-expressed belief that Japan could have been defeated with conventional 
incendiary bombs. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay died at 8:08 a.m. in the 22nd Strategic Hospital at March Air Force Base 
near Riverside, an Air Force spokesman said. He would have been 84 on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, LeMay had been living in Air Force Village West, a retirement 
community for Air Force officers near the air base. Before moving there, he 
lived in Newport Beach for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the most patriotic and honest American I have ever known," said his 
son-in-law, James Lodge, in a telephone interview Monday night. "He cut a wide 
swath through a major part of our history. . . . He was a terribly interesting 
and dynamic man." 
</P>
<P>
He had remained in Southern California since he was fired from his 
post-military job as board chairman of a Chatsworth electronics firm for 
serving as the running mate of George C. Wallace in the 1968 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
To an adoring American public during the war against the Axis powers, LeMay was 
"Old Iron Pants" and usually described as "cigar-chomping," "gruff" or 
"brusque." He was a strict disciplinarian who asked much of his fliers, but no 
more than he asked of himself. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding that his bombers were missing too many targets while zigzagging to 
avoid heavy flak over Europe, LeMay clamped a cigar in his jaw and personally 
led the next raid over Saint Nazaire, France, holding his plane on a 
straight-in course for seven perilous minutes. The next day he issued orders 
that there would be "no more evasive action on the final bombing run." 
</P>
<P>
His hero image began to fade somewhat during ensuing years as he continued to 
talk like a combat man, observing that most Americans had a "phobia" about 
nuclear weapons ("just another weapon in the arsenal"), and suggesting that 
North Vietnam be bombed "back into the Stone Age." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounded him in the early 1960s when, as Air Force chief of 
staff, LeMay feuded with then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara over the 
latter's push to cut back the number of manned aircraft in favor of more 
intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
It intensified when LeMay saw fit to be Wallace's running mate, attracting 
demonstrators who chanted "Bombs away with Curtis LeMay!" He caused some 
embarrassment for Wallace by saying he would use nuclear weapons "if I found it 
necessary," a comment Wallace angrily contended was reported out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Already known as a man of few words, LeMay grew even quieter in retirement. 
When he reluctantly attended an Orange County soiree in 1984, the old warrior 
said only, "I just stay at home and keep my mouth shut. That's always the best 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
A pure military man, he did not go around in peacetime expressing regrets for 
his battle actions. "I have indeed bombed a number of specific targets," he 
conceded in the foreword of the 1965 book "Mission With LeMay," which he wrote 
with novelist and fellow World War II flier MacKinlay Kantor. "They were 
military targets on which the attack was, in my opinion, justified morally. 
I've tried to stay away from hospitals, prison camps, orphan asylums, nunneries 
and dog kennels. I have sought to slaughter as few civilians as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Off duty, LeMay was an enthusiastic ham radio operator, gun collector and 
big-game hunter. 
</P>
<P>
He was known for backing his men when they made understandable mistakes, but he 
did not tolerate the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
Once, invited to dinner by a group of colonels serving under him, the crusty 
LeMay refused. "A man should have dinner with his friends," he growled. "The 
commanding general has no friends." 
</P>
<P>
LeMay was born in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 15, 1906. He was the eldest of six 
children of itinerant ironworker Erving LeMay and Arizona Dove LeMay. 
</P>
<P>
He was fascinated by airplanes from childhood. He recalled in his book seeing 
pioneer stunt aviator Lincoln Beachy flying around the 1915 Panama-Pacific 
Exposition in San Francisco. After Beachy crashed into San Francisco Bay and 
died, LeMay wrote, "I wondered a little where he had gone -- but mostly I 
remembered how he felt when he was alive and flying." 
</P>
<P>
He ached to go to West Point, but did not get appointed by his congressman, so 
he enrolled at Ohio State University as an engineering student, joined the 
Reserve Officer Training Corps and paid his way through college working in a 
foundry and at other jobs. He had to work so much that he did not get his 
degree until after he was in the service. 
</P>
<P>
He won a reserve Army commission through the ROTC, going on active duty with 
the 62nd Field Artillery Brigade at Camp Knox, Ky. He enlisted in the regular 
Army in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay got into air cadet school at March Field (now March Air Force Base), and 
by 1930 was a second lieutenant in the regular Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
He served in bomber and pursuit squadrons, participating in a 1937 goodwill 
flight of B-17 Flying Fortresses to South America. He was a pioneer of 
over-water navigation and of ferry routes to Africa via South America. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after World War II erupted, LeMay was a colonel in command of the 305th 
Bombardment Group. He took the group to England in the fall of 1942. As part of 
the 8th Air Force, it was one of the first U.S. air bombardment units to enter 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay flew five combat missions over Europe, winning the Air Medal and the 
Silver Star. In addition to leading the raid over Saint Nazaire to establish 
his rule against zigzag bombing runs, "Old Iron Pants" also led the Aug. 17, 
1943, shuttle mission of B-17s from England over Regensburg, Germany, and on to 
landings in North Africa, the first such mission flown. 
</P>
<P>
For his heroism in leading that attack on Germany's principal Messerschmitt 
plant at Regensburg, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Promoted to brigadier general and then major general, LeMay was commander of 
the 3rd Bombardment Division through mid-1944, then was sent to the 
China-Burma-India Theater to head the 20th Bomber Command. Under him, 
China-based B-29 Superfortresses attacked Manchurian industrial centers. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over the 21st Bomber Command in the Mariana Islands, LeMay ordered his 
bombers to fly at previously unheard-of low altitudes. He sent his full force 
of 300 B-29s on a nighttime incendiary raid on Tokyo. They flew at only 5,000 
feet, below the effective range of Japanese antiaircraft batteries, and dropped 
2,500 tons of firebomb clusters that set off a firestorm that burned out more 
than 256,000 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay piloted a B-29 on a record-breaking flight from Guam to Washington, D.C., 
just before the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
When the Air Force became an independent service in 1947, he was assigned to 
command U.S. forces in Europe, where he headed the 1948 Berlin Airlift to break 
the Soviet blockade. He flew several of the trips in and out of Berlin himself 
-- usually unannounced -- in order to straighten out problems. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1948, LeMay took over the Strategic Air Command, finding it to be 
made up of weary fliers left over from World War II. He set up headquarters in 
Omaha and built SAC into a proud, energetic outfit that kept nuclear-armed 
intercontinental bombers in the air around the world at all hours of the day 
and night. Aerial refueling was perfected. 
</P>
<P>
SAC went from 600 bombers and smaller planes at 18 bases to a force of 3,000 
hydrogen-bomb-carrying jets at more than 50 bases worldwide. LeMay saw to it 
that his men lived comfortably, and that there were plenty of hobby shops and 
other leisure facilities to keep them from getting bored. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, after heading SAC for eight years, LeMay became vice chief of staff 
for the Air Force. Months later, he set a record flying a giant jet tanker 
nonstop from Buenos Aires to Washington. The following year, he broke another 
record piloting a jet tanker from Tokyo to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named him Air Force chief of staff, even 
though LeMay had already raised hackles by criticizing the Air National Guard 
as inefficient. Many thought he was simply too blunt for the job. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay tangled with Secretary of Defense McNamara over the RS-70 (formerly B-70) 
bomber program (which was halted by McNamara and Kennedy despite LeMay's 
support of it) and over McNamara policies that LeMay felt were leading to a 
narrowing of the U.S. military lead over the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After he retired, LeMay said he thought McNamara's planned cutbacks in manned 
aircraft "may be signaling the end of the country." 
</P>
<P>
As board chairman of Networks Electronics Corp. of Chatsworth, which was headed 
by former Romanian fighter pilot Mihai D. Patrichi, LeMay was a civilian 
speaker popular with conservative groups. He was a hawk on Vietnam and saw that 
war as part of the overall attempt by communists to control the world. He 
wanted to "wipe out" Haiphong harbor. He thought the United States should pick 
"more expensive targets" in North Vietnam, warn people to evacuate and then 
bomb "like we did in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
LeMay was married to Helen Estelle Maitland in 1934. They had one daughter, 
Patricia Jane.
