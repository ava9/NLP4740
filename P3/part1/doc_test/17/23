A pregnant patient's decision to refuse medical treatment is almost always 
paramount, even when survival of a fetus is at stake, the District of 
Columbia's highest court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in a widely watched case is binding only in the district, but it 
is expected to influence other courts wrestling with questions of maternal and 
fetal rights in connection with medical treatment and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that in virtually all cases the question of what is to be done is to 
be decided by the patient -- the pregnant woman -- on behalf of herself and the 
fetus," the D.C. Court of Appeals said in a 7-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not quite foreclose the possibility" that the patient's wishes may be 
overridden, the panel said, "but we anticipate that such cases will be 
extremely rare and truly exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in the case of Angela Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient 
pregnant with a 26-week-old fetus. The D.C. Superior Court found it unclear 
what the heavily sedated Carder wanted done with the fetus and told George 
Washington University Hospital to perform an emergency Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
The premature infant died 2 1/2 hours after the surgery; her mother died two 
days later. The Cesarean section was listed as a contributing cause of Carder's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority, Judge John A. Terry said the lower court should have 
tried to determine what Carder would have wanted to happen had she been able to 
make a clear decision. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the judge wrote, the court proceeded straight to a "balancing 
analysis" weighing Carder's rights against the interests of the state -- in 
this case the survival of the fetus -- and found for the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate opinion, Judge James A. Belson said he agreed with the lower 
court's decision to weigh the interests of Carder, her fetus and the state. The 
judge said an unborn child's interests and the state's interest in preserving 
human life are entitled to "substantial weight" when they are in conflict with 
a patient's decision on medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women, 
which fought the court-ordered procedure, said the appeals court decision 
affirmed the rights of pregnant women to control their own medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU said the decision "stands as solid authority" for rejecting the idea 
that a fetus has rights superseding those of a person already born. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Lynn Paltrow, who brought the case, said the lower court treated 
Carder as if she were dead. "The bottom line is you can't deny women their 
civil rights. You can't treat women as dead just because they're pregnant," she 
said.
