DANCE: THE KING ISLANDERS FROM ALASKA RESCUED A WAY OF LIFE THAT ALMOST

<P>
Paul Tiulana was sitting at his kitchen table in the city, reaching into the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Back there on King Island," he said, recalling the tiny Bering Sea settlement 
on which he was born, "back there, you need some kind of entertainment. Long 
winters. We danced." 
</P>
<P>
It's been 24 years now since the government moved Tiulana, his family and their 
neighbors off King Island -- 24 years since they scattered to Anchorage and 
Nome and other points south, places with better schools, better housing, less 
dangerous weather. 
</P>
<P>
One thing has kept the community alive in the years since -- Eskimo song and 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana, 68, is the founder and leader of the King Island Inupiat Singers and 
Dancers, one of Alaska's better-known native performance troupes. In a state 
where traditional song and dance remain an important, living part of culture in 
many Eskimo and Indian settlements, the King Island group has become one of the 
most traveled, performing in Washington, London, Siberia and throughout their 
home state. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the King Islanders arrive in Southern California for the Los Angeles 
Festival, which officially opens Saturday at Angel's Gate and Point Fermin 
Park. They will be among native performers from throughout the Pacific who are 
scheduled to participate in opening ceremonies at a variety of venues through 
Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
With pulsing rhythms from walrus-skin drums, the 20-member King Island group 
performs songs that originated with their ancestors thousands of years ago. 
Songs celebrate successful hunts, relate myths, pass on information. In the 
Inupiat world, without a written language, songs and dance were how history and 
values were passed on from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
For the King Islanders, especially Tiulana, his wife and the two other older 
couples that form the group's core, the leap from aboriginal villagers to 
performers sometimes seems like a journey across millennia. 
</P>
<P>
King Island is a mountaintop poking out of the icy waters 35 miles off the 
western Alaska coast. The 200-or-so residents lived off the land and the sea 
with little contact with the white world until earlier this century. They lived 
in tiny, ramshackle houses on stilts clinging to a steep hillside above the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The dances evolved within the limits of the cramped environment -- crouches 
with intense hand and arm movement that became more frenetic as the intensity 
of the music grew, but which needed almost no floor space. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana was raised to be a polar-bear hunter. He used some of the Stone Age 
tools of his ancestors. He stored his game in a cave. He grew to be a man on a 
King Island diet of walrus, bearded seal, puffin soup and wild greens. 
</P>
<P>
Then World War II came along and Tiulana was drafted into the Army and 
simultaneously catapulted into 20th-Century American society. He visited the 
mainland for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he returned to the island, married and raised seven children. But 
by the 1960s, King Island was becoming a ghost town. People began drifting away 
to easier lives elsewhere. A tuberculosis epidemic hit. The Department of the 
Interior finally closed the school and the Tiulanas were relocated in Nome, 90 
miles away. Paul went to work as a janitor in a bank. The Inupiat culture began 
to slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost lost it," Tiulana said recently. But then, a few years ago, he had 
an idea: Why not get the King Islanders together and dance, like the old days? 
They rented a community hall and everyone had a blast. They started getting 
together regularly until the dance group became a sort of government-in-exile 
for the villagers without a village, a way to remember who they were in a 
changing world. 
</P>
<P>
Tiulana and other islanders traveled to Anchorage, performing their dances and 
selling ivory carvings. Business was good. The family decided to stay and the 
King Island troupe was born. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like starting a new life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on King Island prepared the Tiulanas for their new life in the city. 
Paul learned to drive a truck in Nome, but recalls the terror of pulling his 
car into city traffic in those days. His wife, Clara, always sat next to him 
with a big road map unfolded, navigating their course through town. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many more rules and regulations living in the city," he said. "Out 
at King Island, we were more independent." 
</P>
<P>
But the Tiulanas adapted. Paul made a living as an artist. Eventually the 
National Endowment for the Arts honored him with a Heritage Award, and two 
years ago he published his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulanas are a study in cultural contrasts. Clara sits in the living room 
of their modest Anchorage home watching a game show on television while sewing 
a pair of boots out of the hide of a bearded seal, hunted by a son earlier this 
year. The rich, fishy aroma of seal oil, a staple of the Eskimo diet, fills the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Clara occasionally break into Inupiat, one of three major Eskimo 
dialects still spoken here. Their children speak the language, too, although 
the grandchildren understand little of what they say. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulana grandchildren have recently become more involved with the dance 
group to learn about their roots, he said. His daughter, Lillian, a computer 
programmer for an oil company, points out that they have done so with the help 
of videocassettes and a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiulana daughters are all college graduates who have gone on to 
professional careers. The sons became ivory carvers and followed their father's 
path. Each spring, some of them return to Alaska's western coast to purchase 
ivory and join the hunts for walrus and seal. Sometimes, on a rare calm day, 
they take a skiff out into the sea to visit the island they were born. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the grandchildren, who never lived on the island, the songs and dances 
are threads connecting them to a past they otherwise have trouble 
comprehending. It's a thread more native people in Alaska are looking to as a 
way to make sense of dizzying cultural change. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tiulana is particularly proud of his 14-year-old grandson, Edward, an 
up-and-coming star of the King Island group. During the performances, he dons a 
hand-carved wooden masks of a walrus and the raven and breaks into urgent, 
confident dances. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he asked me, 'How am I going to dance? I can't dance,' " Tiulana 
said. "But he never resisted. He learned and he graduated into the Eskimo 
world."
