UCSD TO STUDY TIE BETWEEN HORMONES, HEART DISEASE

UC San Diego School of Medicine is taking part in a national study to determine 
if commonly used postmenopausal hormone therapies can reduce a woman's risk of 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The program could have "a significant impact on the health care of millions of 
women," Dr. Robert Langer, director of the UCSD study, said. About 250,000 
women die each year of heart disease, which Langer said is the leading cause of 
death in women older than 50. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial, funded by 
the National Institutes of Health, will involve about 840 postmenopausal women 
ages 45 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to UCSD, trials will be conducted at UCLA, Stanford University, 
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the University of Texas, the University 
of Iowa and George Washington University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the seven participating clinics will enroll about 120 participants, 
according to Dr. Bradley Wells, a professor at the Bowman Gray School of 
Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., which will 
coordinate the study results. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will use television commercials featuring cast members of the NBC 
sitcom "Golden Girls" to attract participants, according to Dr. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Connor, a UCSD professor who served as chairwoman of the committee that 
designed the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to address "many unanswered questions" about 
estrogen-replacement therapies that many postmenopausal women regularly 
receive, Barrett-Connor said Friday. Although researchers suspect that some 
replacement hormones reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease, studies 
also have indicated that "therapy carries risks as well as benefits," 
Barrett-Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Menopause occurs when menstrual periods end and the ovaries stop producing 
estrogen and progesterone, hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle and 
fertility. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of postmenopausal women experience symptoms related to hormonal 
changes. Many women suffer hot flashes, a condition that, although 
uncomfortable, is generally not considered to be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
But, for a significant number of women, the hormonal changes cause serious 
medical conditions, including thinning of vaginal and bladder tissues and 
osteoporosis, the thinning of bones. 
</P>
<P>
While both men and women suffer from osteoporosis, the condition is accelerated 
by menopause. Menopause also increases the risk of heart attack among women in 
their mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, as many as 30% of women experiencing menopause are believed to be 
receiving some sort of hormone-replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Women who participate in the trial will receive a placebo or one of four 
different replacement hormones that are believed to reduce the risk of heart 
disease. The trial also will study suspected links between those replacement 
hormones and a wide range of medical conditions, including osteoporosis, 
diabetes and breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The study will "test the effects of various hormone combinations on cholesterol 
and other blood factors and will help us define the best hormone combination 
for postmenopausal women," Langer said. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-year trial, participants will receive free medical 
examinations, including mammograms, Pap tests, periodic blood-pressure tests, 
electrocardiograms and cholesterol and blood sugar measurements. UCSD 
researchers also will use a special machine to measure bone density. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is seeking healthy volunteers from the ages of 45 to 64 who underwent a 
natural or surgical menopause within the past 10 years. In addition to taking 
hormones, participants will undergo 14 checkups at the university's Clinical 
Research Center in La Jolla during the three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Early results from the clinical trials will not be available until at least 
1994, Wells said. The first participants "will be enrolled around Dec. 1, and 
recruitment will continue for at least a year after that," Wells said. "The 
last participants won't be enrolled until the end of January 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Women interested in taking part in the study are asked to contact the Clinical 
Research Laboratory at 619-534-7150.
