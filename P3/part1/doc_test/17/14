MONTEREY PARK DEBATES MAYOR'S PLAN TO ERECT WASHINGTON STATUE 
</P>

<P>
To social studies teacher and Monterey Park Mayor Barry L. Hatch, George 
Washington represents everything that's great about America. 
</P>
<P>
So Hatch, mayor of the heavily immigrant community, persuaded his City Council 
to approve spending $50,000 on a statue of the first President, adorned with 
plaques of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Asian and Latino newcomers to Monterey Park, he said, have no 
feeling for America's traditions or its hard-earned freedoms. The statue will 
serve as a reminder, Hatch said, to immigrants and longtime citizens alike. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in this San Gabriel Valley community has welcomed this latest 
proposal by Hatch, whose earlier stances in favor of a temporary ban on 
immigration and the establishment of English as the official U.S. language have 
gained him notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Hatch wants the Washington statue to displace an existing City 
Hall sculpture that commemorates the 1984 Olympic Games, an event that promotes 
international brotherhood as well as athletic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, "It would be unfortunate" if erecting 
the Washington statue was a reaction to "something washing up on our shore . . 
. so we have to put up this monument and make some statement." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a teacher at Bell Gardens Intermediate School, said he simply wants to 
boost pride in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a coach in a locker room at half-time. We have to do something to 
win. This country is in more trouble than any time, other than the Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Motive' 
</P>
<P>
But E. George Ricci, a former Chamber of Commerce president, asked: "Why George 
Washington? And $50,000! How about Christopher Columbus, for heaven's sake? I 
wonder what's the real motive." 
</P>
<P>
If the statue's purpose is to educate new immigrants, asked Councilwoman Judy 
Chu, "then why don't we use the $50,000 to set up citizenship classes?" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the immigration issue, Councilwoman Betty Couch said, is the more 
pressing question of whether a city struggling to balance its books can afford 
the luxury of spending $50,000 on a statue. And, she added, "I don't have any 
lack of respect for my country." 
</P>
<P>
Under Hatch's plan, a statue of Washington will replace a 15-foot-high 
sculpture of the Olympic torch and the five interlocking rings. Dedicated in 
ceremonies attended by about 4,000 spectators, the Olympic sculpture marks the 
path where a torch-bearing runner passed City Hall in 1984 en route to the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. Monterey Park hosted the Olympic field hockey competition and 
since then has billed itself as "An Olympic City With a Heart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Standards and Values' 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting to keep the city an American city," Hatch said, "not by face or 
by race, but by standards and values." When Hatch speaks of America, he also 
speaks of his town, a microcosm, he said, of the nation's immigration problems. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when Hatch was first active in campaigns to declare English as the 
nation's official language, he has been a key participant in the city's 
continuing debate over immigration. Elected in 1986 as part of a slow-growth 
ticket, Hatch nearly lost his council post two years ago during a bitterly 
contested recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, when he took his seat as mayor -- a position that rotates among 
council members -- Hatch proposed a temporary ban on U.S. immigration to ease 
the burden that population growth puts on schools, freeways, hospitals, prisons 
and the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the ethnic diversity of Monterey Park, with Asians accounting for more 
than half its 63,500 residents and Latinos another third, Hatch said: "These 
people need to understand why we are a unique nation. They need to gain the 
same pride in this nation that we have." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on a 3-2 vote earlier this month did approve the statue, but 
no decision has been made on whether to follow through with plans to have the 
Washington statue created by Culver City's nationally known sculptor 
Brett-Livingston Strong, who once carved a Malibu boulder into John Wayne's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Olympic Sculpture 
</P>
<P>
And the council has yet to decide on whether to relocate the Olympic sculpture; 
the mayor is the only member who supports moving it. He believes that the 
Olympic sculpture is unattractive and should be moved across town to Garvey 
Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
Said Couch, "We're only going to make enemies if we take that (Olympic 
sculpture) out and act like it is unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
And Lily Lee Chen, a former council member who as mayor in 1984 spoke at the 
dedication ceremonies, said the Olympic sculpture symbolizes "one of the most 
positive reminders" of an international event in the city. "The thought of 
having the sculpture removed is something I cannot even comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of where the Washington monument goes, Hatch said this is one of his 
most important causes since he was elected three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of no logical argument against it," he said.
