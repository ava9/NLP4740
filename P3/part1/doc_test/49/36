  [Text] President Sam Nujoma of Namibia made a brief 
stopover in Accra this morning on his way to Belgium for a state 
visit. He was met at the airport by the vice president, Mr. 
K.N. Arkaah. 
  President Nujoma told newsmen that Belgium played a key role 
in Namibia's struggle for independence. He recalled that in 
1972 and 1986, SWAPO [South West African People's Organization] 
organized international conferences to solicit support from the 
international community for the liberation struggle and Belgium 
readily came to her aid. According to the Namibian leader, he 
is going to Belgium to meet friends and consolidate their 
relationship. He said Namibia has a lot of raw materials while 
Belgium has technology. Both countries can, therefore, enter 
into viable ventures. 
  President Nujoma said Namibia will also consolidate her 
relationship with South Africa to ensure regional economic 
unity. He noted that South Africa is a big country with a large 
population and will be expected to play a major role in 
consolidating African economic community. On Rwanda, President 
Nujoma said the tragedy in that country calls for international 
intervention. He stressed the need for the United Nations to 
cooperate with the OAU to restore peace.
