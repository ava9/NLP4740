  [Text] Parliament today adopted a resolution at its resumed 
sitting in Accra to extend the state of emergency in seven 
districts of the Northern Region for one month. Moving for the 
adoption of the resolution, the minister of the interior, 
Colonel Osei-Wusu, said although the task force has largely 
succeeded in disarming the warring factions, removing 
roadblocks, and initiating resettlement [word indistinct] there 
are still a few isolated attacks and counterattacks in the 
conflict areas. He said the task force is determined that such 
hostilities are reduced to the barest minimum within the coming 
weeks. Col. Osei-Wusu said it is the government's intention 
that the exploratory talks will resume in the next few days to 
find the formula that will enable the state of emergency to be 
revoked within the shortest possible time. He said it is the 
expectation of government that the police will be in a position 
to take over from the military. 
  Adopting the resolution, some MP's impressed upon the 
minister to speed up a peaceful solution to the conflict so that 
there will be no need for the extension of the state of 
emergency at the end of the one-month period. It will be 
recalled that the president declared the state of emergency in 
seven districts of the Northern Region on 19 Febraury to enable 
the government to contain the volatile situation in the conflict 
areas.
