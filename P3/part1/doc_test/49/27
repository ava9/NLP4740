  [Text] The New Patriotic Party [NPP] has appealed to the 
government to keep the strictest vigilance on refugees and 
exiles currently within the country's borders to ensure that 
they do not violate Ghana's hospitality to the detriment of her 
relationship with other countries in the West African subregion. 
  In a statement signed by the secretary general, Mr. J. 
Agyenim Boateng, the NPP expressed concern at the ever-worsening 
relations between Ghana and Togo. It said the Aflao-Lome border 
bombing incident is only one of the lingering and mutually 
suspicious lines of hostilities that have characterized the 
relations between the two sides since the 1960's. The party 
therefore urged the government to take immediate steps to arrest 
this unfortunate trend and restore peace, normalcy, mutual 
respect, and trust between Ghana and Togo.
