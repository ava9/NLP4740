  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] militiamen in Liberia have released 11 out of the 16 
Nigerian soldiers they took hostage in an ambush last Friday [27 
May]. A spokesman for the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] African Command said 
today that negotiations are going on for the release of the 
remaining five. The peacekeepers were captured during heavy 
fighting between the two rival factions of the ULIMO militia in 
the Tubmanburg area, 60 km northwest of Monrovia.
