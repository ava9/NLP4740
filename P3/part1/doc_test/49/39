  [Text] The government has noted with concern the reported 
death of a number of Ghanaians among other nationalities 
following an incident in a police compound in Libreville, Gabon. 
The acting Ghana high commissioner in Lagos, whose mission 
oversees Gabon, has been directed by the minister of foreign 
affairs to proceed to Gabon immediately to express government's 
concern over the incident and to ask the authorities for 
clarification and information and the circumstances surrounding 
the incident. He is also to conduct an independent 
investigation and to report to the minister by the end of the 
week.
