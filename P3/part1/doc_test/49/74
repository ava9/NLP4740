  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings today 
expressed his appreciation for Cuba's cooperation with Ghana and 
sent a message of solidarity to the people of Cuba. President 
Rawlings received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at the 
Presidential Palace. During the meeting, Rawlings said that his 
government still has much to do for Cuba because we must, in 
some way, thank Cuba for what it has done for Africa. Ghana has 
never hidden its appreciation for all that the Cuban Government 
has done for us, President Rawlings told Foreign Minister 
Robaina who has just concluded a two-day visit to Ghana. The 
Ghanaian president also expressed his appreciation to the Cuban 
authorities for sending a medical brigade to help control an 
outbreak of Buruli ulcer. Rawlings also expressed his 
willingness to develop bilateral cooperation in the field of 
health. 
  At the conclusion of his two-day trip to Accra, Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina thanked Ghana for its support of the 
island at international fora, particularly at the United 
Nations. The head of Cuban diplomacy also thanked Ghana for its 
position on issues such as the economic blockade imposed by the 
U.S. Government more than 30 years ago. After describing 1993 
as the most difficult year for the Cuban Revolution, Robaina 
predicted that 1994 will represent the beginning of an ascending 
curve for his people. Robaina said that among Cuba's foreign 
policy priorities are the democratization of the United Nations 
and the strengthening of the role played by the nonaligned 
countries.
