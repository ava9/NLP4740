  [Text] In a lead story captioned Troops Suppress Fresh 
Fighting in Gushiegu District the GHANAIAN TIMES carries a 
report that, despite the state of emergency declared in [word 
indistinct] areas of the Northern Region, renewed fighting has 
erupted in the Gushiegu-Karaga District. According to the 
commander of the Second Brigade, Brigadier Joseph Smith, troops 
have been dispatched to the area to bring the situation under 
control. In a related development the TIMES says normal classes 
for first cycle institutions in the Tamale municipality have 
resumed, but security problems of pupils and teachers of the 
various ethnic groups still remain unsolved. A joint 
military-police task force is said to be addressing the issue.
