  [Excerpts] Lome, Jan 7 (AFP) -- The Togolese Foreign 
Ministry said here Friday [7 January] it was holding the 
Ghanaian charge d'affairs after charging that artillery fire was 
being rained on a border post from neighbouring Ghana. 
  The Togolese Foreign Ministry called on Ghana to intervene 
against "armed elements coming from Ghana," saying in a radio 
statement at midnight (0000 GMT) that it had seized the Ghanaian 
charge d'affairs at 2130 GMT Thursday. 
  The government has alleged that a group of unidentified men 
who led a failed assassination bid against Togo's military ruler 
Gnassingbe Eyademe Wednesday came from Ghana. [passage omitted] 
  Reached by telephone early Friday morning, residents living 
close to the border post which separates Lome from its twin town 
of Aflao in Ghana said that shots and explosions resembling 
artillery fire had shaken the area shortly before 0100 GMT. 
  The Togolese Foreign Ministry denounced what it termed "a 
flagrant act of aggression," which was "against all 
international law." It said that despite holding the Ghanaian 
charge d'affairs, shooting was "still coming from Ghanaian 
territory." 
  "The government calls on the international community to bear 
witness and asks Ghana to put an immediate end to these acts," 
the statement added. [passage omitted]
