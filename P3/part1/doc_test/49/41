  [Text] The Cuban foreign minister, Mr. Roberto Robaina, 
left Accra today for Lusaka, Zambia, at the end of a two-day 
visit to Ghana to continue an African tour. 
  Mr. Robaina, who is leading an eight-member government 
delegation, told newsmen that the international community is 
ignorant about the difficulties the United States blockade of 
Cuba has imposed on the people during the past 35 years. That 
is why the government has launched a worldwide diplomatic 
offensive to let the world know the truth about the embargo. He 
said the blockade has denied Cuba her rightful place on the 
international market because it has virtually been impossible to 
open the country up for foreign investment. 
  Mr. Robaina said in the face of all these atrocities, Cubans 
believe that they have been able to survive the worst of tests. 
He said no other form of pressure, apart from respect for the 
dignity of Cubans can resolve the island's impasse with the 
United States. 
  The foreign minister repeated that Cuba is ready for 
dialogue. However, she will negotiate under one condition only, 
and that is mutual respect for each other's dignity and 
sovereignty. He added that his visit to Africa will afford him 
the opportunity to update his knowledge about the region and 
consolidate the bonds of friendship and cooperation between Cuba 
and Africa. Mr. Robaina will also visit Namibia, Angola, and 
Zimbabwe.
