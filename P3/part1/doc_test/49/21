  [Text] The Parliament has expressed concern about the 
worsening relationship between Ghana and Togo. While some 
members called for stern measures against Togo, others urged the 
government to exercise restraint. This is because any war will 
result in the destruction of lives and property. This followed 
a statement by the member for Hoehoe-South, Mr. Koffi Kedem, at 
today's sitting of the house in Accra. The statement called for 
a quick and resolute response from the government for the 
crimes, unwarranted murders, and flagrant violation of the 
country's territory by Togo. They invited the minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, to brief parliament on the 
situation.
