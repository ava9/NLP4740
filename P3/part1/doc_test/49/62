  [Text] An official statement issued in Accra today says the 
government considers as unfortunate the recent decision of the 
New Patriotic Party, NPP, to pull out of the dialogue between 
the government and the nonparliamentary opposition, in which the 
NPP is involved. The statement said the NPP's decision was in a 
letter addressed last week to the presidential adviser on 
governmental affairs, to which a reply has been issued. It said 
the government is still committed to dialogue as a means of 
achieving national unity, stability, and reconciliation. It 
will, therefore, be prepared to resume dialogue with the NPP 
whenever wise counsel prevails. The statement stressed that it 
is the hope of government that, for the sake of the stability 
and peace of the nation and all Ghanaians, the NPP opposition 
will renounce the politics of violence, abuse, and 
confrontation, and genuinely create conditions conducive to 
dialogue. This is because dialogue is an essential basis of 
multiparty democracy and national development. 
  Meanwhile, the statement blamed the present development on 
the activities of some elements within the NPP. It noted one of 
the early signals as the ultimatum issued by the party last year 
to break off the dialogue when representatives of both sides 
were busy resolving certain technical matters. Besides, since 
the first meeting took place, some leading figures of the NPP 
have made inflammatory utterances contrary to the spirit of the 
dialogue. They have also continued what the statement called 
their media campaign of vilification and character assassination 
against the government. It also noted that while the dialogue 
was still on the NPP continued to pursue their plan to make the 
country ungovernable, through street demonstrations and other 
forms of confrontation. 
  It thus became obvious long ago that the NPP did not enter 
the dialogue in good faith or with any serious commitment to 
achieving any positive result, but just as a propaganda ploy. 
The statement pointed out that the review of the electoral 
system, which was the most important concern raised by the NPP 
during the inaugural meeting of the dialogue, has already been 
taken up by the National Electoral Commission, NEC. Also under 
the auspices of NEC, a series of meetings have been held 
involving all the political parties, with the active 
participation of the international donors. Besides, a number of 
important decisions have been taken which are binding on all 
parties.
