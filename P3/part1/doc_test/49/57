  [Text] The lead story in the DAILY GRAPHIC is the smashing 
of a passports syndicate by the narcotics unit of the police. 
The syndicate, uncovered at a spot near the (?Crepys) Hotel in 
Accra, is suspected to be run by drug barons. The GRAPHIC 
quotes the deputy superintendent of police in charge of the 
narcotics unit, Mr. Robert Ayalindu, as saying that eight 
people, including the owner of the spot, have been arrested. 
  Fifty-nine international and diplomatic passports were also 
seized during the operation. The passports are from the 
Bahamas, Liberia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Kenya, and 
Canada. Some have American visas issued in them while others 
have visible signs that the original pictures have been taken 
off with the view to inserting new pictures.
