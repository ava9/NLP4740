  [Text] Ghana has threatened to pull out of the African 
military force in Liberia unless that country's warring factions 
prove they want peace immediately. Ghana's foreign minister, 
Dr. Obed Asamoah who disclosed this in Tunis today, said the 
peacekeeping effort was a drain in the nation's resources. Dr. 
Asamoah said the renewed fighting has stopped disarmament of 
some 60,000 militiamen in the country and is threatening to 
delay elections which are planned for September. He said 
Nigeria and Tanzania are ready to pull out their troops within 
the month. Apart from Nigeria, Ghana is the second highest 
contributor to the peacekeeping mission in Liberia. Liberia 
will be the main topic at the OAU summit which opens in the 
Tunisian capital on Monday [13 June].
