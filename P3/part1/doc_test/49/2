  [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, 
today dismissed the report that Ghanaians were involved in an 
attack on the main Army camp in Lome. Speaking to the GHANA 
NEWS AGENCY in Accra, Dr. Asamoah said the Togolese authorities 
have no evidence to support the claim that the attackers came 
from Ghana. He said, however, that the government was 
monitoring the situation and would respond at the appropriate 
time. Dr. Asamoah, who is also the acting attorney general and 
minister of justice, recalled that the Togolese authorities 
leveled similar accusations against Ghana on the eve of the 
presidential election in Lome last August. 
  On the closure of the land border with Ghana by the Togolese 
authorities, the minister described it as unfortunate as it has 
caused hardship to people living on both sides. Dr. Asamoah 
hoped it would not be too long for the border to be reopened as 
provided for under the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West 
African States] Treaty.
