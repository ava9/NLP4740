  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has 
granted amnesty to some prisoners to commemorate the first 
anniversary of the Fourth Republic. Some condemned prisoners, 
who have served more than 10 years as at 7 January this year, 
are to have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The 
list excludes armed robbers convicted to death. Others to 
benefit from the amnesty are persons condemned to death for 
economic sabotage, who are to have their sentences reduced to 
fifteen years. 
  Some prisoners serving life imprisonment, who have served at 
least 10 years as at 7 January, are to have their sentences 
reduced to 20 years. This excludes armed robbers. Some 
prisoners serving sentences of 20 years and more, who have 
already served five years, are to have their sentences reduced 
by one-third. They exclude armed robbers and those convicted of 
drug trafficking and rape. A number of first and second 
offenders who have served half of their sentences are to be 
released on parole and would be obliged to undertake community 
service. The details will be implemented by the Ministry of the 
Interior. Those in this category do not include persons 
convicted for murder, manslaughter, rape, armed robbery, and 
drug trafficking. 
  A number of prisoners who are considered seriously ill and 
those sixty years of age are also to be released. This list 
excludes those serving sentences for rape, murder, manslaughter, 
armed robbery, and drug trafficking. 
  An official statement restated that the general amnesty 
granted to all Ghanaian citizens in voluntary exile outside the 
country is still open. The only exceptions are persons 
convicted of any criminal offense or declared wanted by the 
police for any criminal offense, and persons convicted and 
sentenced to death by any court or tribunal. It urged persons 
who wish to take advantage of the amnesty to apply to the 
minister of the interior or to the Ghanaian diplomatic mission 
nearest to their places of residence with the relevant 
information, including the date on which they left the country. 
It is noted that a number of persons have already taken 
advantage of the amnesty and returned home.
