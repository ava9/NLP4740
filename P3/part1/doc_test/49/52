  [Text] The GRAPHIC reports that 30,000 out of an estimated 
150,000 displaced of the Northern Region conflict have so far 
returned to their respective villages. This was stated by the 
minister of information, Mr. Kofi Totobi-Quakyi, at a news 
briefing in Accra. He said refugees at the Wenchi Camp have 
been evacuated to Saboba, while those at Salaga are soon to be 
moved to Kpandae. 
  A TIMES correspondent in Tamale says 33 families, mainly 
Dagombas who fled their homes in the wake of the conflict, have 
returned to their homes in Chindiri, (Bunda), Zongo, (Machiri), 
and Kete Krachi.
