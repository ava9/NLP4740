  [Excerpt] The deputy task force commander in charge of 
administration, Group Captain George Ayitey, has said the war 
situation in the conflict areas of the Northern Region is over 
and warned that anybody found taking the law into his or her own 
hands will be prosecuted. He said the task force is going 
strictly according to the terms of the state of emergency and 
that any person who takes up arms against his or her neighbor 
will be charged with murder. Group Capt. Ayitey was addressing 
a delegation of the Anglican Church in Tamale who donated food 
and other items valued at 13.1 million cedis to the task force 
to assist in resettling the displaced persons. [passage omitted]
