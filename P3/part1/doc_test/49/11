  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says reports 
reaching it in Accra indicate that despite the closure of the 
Ghana-Togo border by the Togolese authorities, several Ghanaian 
traders use bush paths to enter Togo. This they do after paying 
bribes to Togolese soldiers and other border officials. 
According to the reports, the men among the traders are 
arrested by the Togolese soldiers after they have entered Togo. 
A statement by the ministry said efforts by the Ghana Embassy 
in Togo to secure their release are being jeopardized by a 
steady stream of arrests. The ministry therefore advises all 
Ghanaians, particularly traders, not to put themselves at such 
unnecessary risks at this time when the Togolese side of the 
common border is closed.
