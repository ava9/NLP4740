<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia via </F>
telephone from Accra, Ghana -- live] 
  [Excerpt] Good morning from Accra, Ghana, to all our 
listeners. I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to 
participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson 
Mandela tomorrow. 
  Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by 
his 
friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at 
the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international 
airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house 
and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral 
and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation. 
I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the 
South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South 
Africa is also a main point of their conversation. 
  Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over 
the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in 
office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the 
sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when 
he carried out a broad program of activities that included 
participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province. 
  The two countries have also adopted, at different 
international forums, common positions on just causes, when 
firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to 
great enemy pressures. 
  Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the 
spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens 
our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young 
Ghanaians are studying in Cuba. 
  Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban 
personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the 
delegation members reported on the main activities taking place 
in our country. 
  We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where 
the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not 
be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The 
Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of 
the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.
