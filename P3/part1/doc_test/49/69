  [Text] The Togo authorities are getting very upset over 
the continuing mayhem in the wake of the raid on Wednesday [5 
January] night by a contingent of armed men on the military 
headquarters in Lome. It seems President Eyadema was a prime 
target for the guerrillas but escaped with his life. Sporadic 
firing went on for much of yesterday. The Togo authorities 
claim that the raiders came across the border from neighboring 
Ghana but did not point a finger directly at any opposition 
group or the Ghana Government. 
  But yesterday there was shooting along the border and the 
Togo Government has now issued an angrily worded statement. On 
the line to Lome, Alex Martin asked our correspondent Ebow 
Godwin what the statement says: 
  [Begin recording] [Ebow] Well, the Togolese authorities have 
been accusing Ghana of acts of flagrant aggression. They say 
that a group of armed men including Ghanaian soldiers yesterday 
evening opened fire on the Togo border post along the Aflao 
border with Ghana, and that they also opened fire on Togolese 
soldiers but they asked their soldiers not to return fire, in 
order to avoid what could have been a bloody confrontation. A 
government communique was issued by Togo's minister for foreign 
affairs, Ouattara Fambare Natchaba. He said that Togo has 
actually lodged official protest with the Ghanaian charge 
d'affaires in Togo and asked for explanation. 
  [Martin] Has anyone else been saying anything? 
  [Ebow] Well, according to the Togolese authorities the 
Ghanaian charge d'affaires has denied Ghanaian involvement in 
the incident. Well, Mr. Kokou Koffigoh has come out today to 
confirm the incident -- the border incident -- and says that 
Togo has taken notice of Ghana's denial but has appealed to the 
Ghanaian authorities to match their words with action and 
comportment because Togo desires to live in peace with her 
neighbors. 
  [Martin] But according to other reports, there was fighting 
precisely last night from 10 o'clock onwards along the border 
near the security post. What explains the extent of fighting? 
  [Ebow] As at now, I have no evidence of any extensive 
fighting along the border. What I know of is that the Togolese 
authorities, especially the security forces, have been mounting 
a manhunt for fleeing fugitives -- for those who took part in 
armed attack against Togo. Reports say that some of them are 
hiding in houses along the Togolese side of the border and they 
are looking for opportunity to slip into Ghana. There have been 
a lot of shooting along the Togolese side of the frontier but I 
am not aware of any heavy fighting between Togo or Togolese 
soldiers and any other combatants. [end recording] 
  Every time there is trouble in Togo it seems the finger gets 
pointed at Ghana with veiled, or as in this case not so veiled 
allegations. On the line to Accra, Alex Martin asks Foreign 
Minister Obed Asamoah if Ghana was involved in the latest 
trouble: 
  [Begin recording] [Asamoah] As far as we are concerned there 
is nothing yet to confirm that indeed any persons crossed from 
Ghana to Togo. If you consider the intensity of the fighting, 
it would be difficult not to ascribe the fighting to internal 
divisions within the military in Togo. 
  [Martin] It does seem very likely however that elements 
opposed to the government of President Eyadema could have 
crossed over the border from Ghana? 
  [Asamoah] Well, we do not have any evidence pointing to that 
at the moment. And I do not want to speculate on that. 
  [Martin] Is it possible that there are small training camps 
hidden along the border for opposition to President Eyadema's 
government to train supporters to launch this kind of attack? 
  [Asamoah] There is no such thing as far as I know. 
  [Martin] What about the Togolese refugees who are based in 
camps in Ghana. Do you think these could be hotbeds of defense 
to President Eyadema's government? [sentence as heard] 
  [Asamoah] You know, the refugee camps are open places, I 
mean, along the main roads. Anybody can walk in there. And, 
you know, I cannot imagine that these camps are training camps 
for any dissidents. I do not think anything of that nature is 
going on in those refugee camps. [end recording]
