  [Text] Accra, 11 Jan (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina concluded his official, two-day visit to Ghana 
after meeting with President Jerry Rawlings, with whom he 
discussed the situation in Cuba and the latest African events. 
  Robaina presented a message from President Fidel Castro to 
the Ghanaian president during this meeting. 
  During his two-day stay in Accra, the visiting minister also 
met with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah, with whom he 
studied the international situation and, specifically, the 
problems of their Third World countries. 
  Both officials agreed on the need to maintain the Nonaligned 
Movement as an independent force to confront the neocolonialism 
that governs the world's unipolarity. 
  During his talks with the Ghananian hosts, Captain Kojo 
Tsikata, member of the state council in Ghana, asserted that 
they greatly valued Cuba's efforts to maintain its dignity and 
to make its own decisions. 
  Tsikata also emphasized Ghana is willing to continue making 
its modest contributions to helping Cuba do away with its 
current difficulties. 
  Roberto Robaina explained the measures adopted by his 
country's authorities following the collapse of the socialist 
bloc and the disintegration of the Soviet Union to the Ghanaian 
officials. 
  Cuban delegation sources have reported the Cuban foreign 
minister will now travel to Angola, a country with which the 
Cuban Government and people maintain historic ties of friendship. 
  Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura asserted today, in 
exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, that those ties continue 
unaltered despite the ongoing changes and the war in Angola. 
  Da Moura highlighted Havana's cooperation with Luanda and 
emphasized that the blood shed by their Cuban brothers to defend 
the territorial integrity of this southern country when it was 
invaded by South African forces in 1975. 
  Robaina is conducting his first tour to this continent, 
which 
will also include Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.
