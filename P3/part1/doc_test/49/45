  [Text] The Private Newspaper Publishers' Association, 
PRINPAG, condemned the attack on the offices of the Free Press 
in Accra, in which unknown assailants smeared the place with 
night [as heard] soil. A statement issued by the association 
described the attack as part of a long chain of acts of 
commissions and omissions, which have been calculated to 
intimidate the independent press into abandoning its 
responsibility of contributing to the building of a decent 
society in which the principles of probity and accountability 
are respected. The private media representative on the National 
Media Commission, Mr. Adu Kwabena Asem has, in a similar 
statement condemned the soiling of the premises of the free 
press.
