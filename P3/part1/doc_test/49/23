  [Text] Ghana has appealed to the international community to 
make the Togolese authorities realize the dangers of reckless 
conduct and irresponsible accusations. Speaking to newsmen and 
members of the diplomatic corps in Accra today, the minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Assamoah, said henceforth any 
deliberate and unprovoked aggression will be met with 
commensurate response. 
  Tina Tehuda has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah expressed the 
government's concern about the recent events in Togo as well the 
tension on the Ghana-Togo border and used the occasion to refute 
the allegations against Ghana by the Togolese authorities. He 
referred to the accusations by the Togolese foreign minister, 
who said Togo had the right retaliate. Dr. Assamoah said Ghana 
is in no way interested in subverting Togo, with which it is 
bound by so many historical and ethnic links. He pointed out 
that the country is at present too preoccupied with her internal 
problems to get involved in what he called pointless foreign 
adventures. 
  [Assamoah] Each time there is violence in Togo, refugees 
streamed across the border in such numbers as to place an almost 
intolerable burden on our economy and create social and 
political problems. It would be foolish on our part, to 
instigate actions that are not in best interest of the country. 
It is rather illogical to state that Ghana is seeking to 
prevent the holding of parliament elections in Togo when it has 
itself embarked upon constitutional rule and has consistently 
stated its readiness to support the forces of genuine 
democratization in Togo. 
  [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Ghana still demands an apology 
and compensation from the Togolese authorities. He explained 
that if Ghana has so far refrained from responding in kind to 
the extreme Togolese provocations, it is out of anxiety to save 
the life of innocent civilians and to maintain international 
peace and security. 
  [Assamoah] There is, however, a limit to what Ghana can 
tolerate -- and Togo must take heed. Any deliberate and 
unprovoked aggression will be met commensurate response. We 
appeal to the international community to make the Togolese 
appreciate the dangers of reckless conduct and irresponsible 
accusations. May I conclude by stating clearly that Ghana has 
no interest in interfering in the internal affairs of Togo, and 
it is regrettable that the Togolese authorities should 
constantly seek to divert attention from the trouble at home by 
desperately trying to involve Ghana in their internal conflicts. 
I must emphasize that Ghana ensures that those Togolese who 
have been granted political asylum and refugee status in Ghana 
under international conventions abide strictly by the laws of 
the land. 
  We will deal firmly with anyone who abuses our hospitality. 
Ghana pledges to continue to maintain firm control over the 
border areas, to ensure that peace and tranquility prevail. 
  [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Togo's refusal to reopen her 
border with Ghana is causing hardship and tremendous economic 
loss to many ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] 
citizens. He advised the Togolese Government to seek solutions 
to its problems internally otherwise it unduly threatens the 
peace of the subregion and also saps energies which should go 
into nation building. [end recording]
