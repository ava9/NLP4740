  [Excerpts] The government has made available enough money 
to meet the basic requirements, especially food, for the 
displaced persons in the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region. 
The chairman of the Task Force Relief Committee, Group Captain 
George Ayitey, who was briefing newsmen in Tamale today, did not 
disclose the amount. He, however, explained that the task force 
cannot do much with the donations from the nongovernmental 
source, hence, the government's intervention. The task force 
has, so far, registered 132,000 displaced persons in the region, 
the bulk of them, over 60,000 in Bimbila. These figures do not 
include Konkombas, because the task force has not been able to 
reach them in the bush. Group Captain Ayitey said the security 
agencies had been concentrating on the restoration of public 
confidence which has not been easy, especially because of two 
shooting incidents on the Tamale-Salaga road last week. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, reports reaching Tamale indicate that fighting is 
raging at Sakpe in the Yendi District and that the village has 
been burned down. [passage omitted]
