  [Excerpt] The national organizer of the Egle Party, Shaykh 
Ibrahim Amartey, has observed that the call for national unity 
by the Progressive Alliance is in the interest of all political 
parties in the country. This is because no matter which 
political party is in power at any given time, no meaningful 
development can take place in any country which is divided 
against itself. 
  Shaykh Amartey made this observation at a rally of the Egle 
Party at Bawku in the Upper East Region. He drew the attention 
of the politicians and journalists to the fact that the more 
they fan national disunity the more they retard the nation's 
development. 
  Shaykh Amartey announced that the National Electoral 
Commission has given approval to the party to change its name 
from Egle to the Eagle Party. He said the Eagle stands for 
Every Accountable Ghanaian Living Everywhere. [passage omitted]
