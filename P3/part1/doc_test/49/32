  [Text] Parliament has approved a resolution extending the 
state of emergency declared by the president, Flight Lieutenant 
Rawlings, on Thursday [10 February] in seven districts of the 
Northern Region from seven days to three months, in accordance 
with Article 32, Clause 4 of the Constitution. Moving the 
motion at today's sitting, the minister of interior, Colonel 
Osei-Wusu, explained that since the declaration of the state of 
emergency, there have been reports of wanton killings of babies, 
women, and unarmed persons. He said that it is now obvious that 
some of the groups involved in the fighting are bent on causing 
more carnage. 
  Col. Osei-Wusu said the current situation is such that the 
state of emergency must continue to enable the task force to 
achieve its objectives of ensuring the cessation of hostilities 
and disarming the combatants. Parliament appealed to the 
soldiers engaged in the peacekeeping exercise not to act on 
their emotion but to use diplomacy, dialogue, and minimum force 
in the execution of the peacekeeping mission.
