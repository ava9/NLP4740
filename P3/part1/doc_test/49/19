  [Excerpt] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has 
held discussions with a nine-member delegation from the World 
Bank at the Castle, Osu. Our Castle correspondent, Teye 
Kitcher, has the story: 
  [Kitcher] The nine members of the delegation are all 
executive directors of the World Bank and are part of the 
24-member board of the bank, its highest management body. The 
board of the World Bank is responsible for the approval of 
loans, credits, and other forms of assistance. The delegation, 
which is led by Mr. Nicholas Flanol, is on a familiarization 
tour of the country to see how the bank's assistance has been 
utilized so far, and to discuss future prospects with the 
government. It is expected that, after discussions with 
government officials on the economy, the delegation will 
appreciate Ghana's peculiar problems and be in a position to 
react favorably when requests for assistance come before the 
board of the World Bank. The delegation, which has been in 
Ghana for the past four days, has met the ministers of finance, 
education, food and agriculture, trade and industry, and mines 
and energy. [passage omitted]
