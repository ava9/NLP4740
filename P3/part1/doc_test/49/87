    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 6 to 17 May.

  The Volta River Authority [VRA] "banned activities like 
farming, tree felling, bush burning, and charcoal production 
along shores bordering the shoreline of the Volta Lake in six 
districts." The districts are (Asujaman) Kpandu, (Jasikan), 
Manya Krobo, (Fanti Akwa), and Kwahu South. A statement issued 
in Accra yesterday by the VRA explained that these activities, 
which have recently become rampant, are causing serious land 
degradation along the lake. The statement said apart from 
"degrading the environment, these activities have resulted in 
soil erosion, earth movement, landslides, and silting at the 
in-take area of the Akonsombo power plant. It noted that this 
reduces the output of the power plant and also creates 
maintenance problems for the VRA." 
  The statement further explained that bush burning in the 
area 
near the Akosomba dam and the port exposes the area to fire 
hazards due to the storage and loading of petroleum products at 
the port. The VRA appealed to "district assemblies and chiefs in 
the affected areas to assist in the efforcement of the ban to 
prevent further degradation of the environment around the lake."

  President Alpha Oumar Konare received Mr. Billo Soumana, 
Niger's minister of water supply and the environment, on 17 May. 
The latter was accompanied by the executive secretary of the 
Niger River Basin Authority. After the audience, Billo Soumana 
spoke to Alhassan Al- Mohamed: "The Niger River Basin Authority 
was established in 1964 with the objective of rational, 
equitable, and sustainable management of the basin's water, 
fisheries, and forest resources. Today, we are faced with a 
problem, because the Niger River itself is dying. So the Niger 
River Basin Authority must resume its activities in order to 
salvage the river. We discussed the possibility of saving the 
river, which is everything to us." 
  Responding to a question, the minister stated that the river 
was being threatened by the low level of rainfall, and though 
there could be no direct action concerning rainfall, the 
environment could be restored. He disclosed that certain 
sections of the river were silted, and that desilting projects 
must be carried out and the basin protected. He added: "There 
is another threat which is little known to Africans, and that is 
the water hyacinth. This plant is unknown to Africans because 
it originates from Latin America, and has just appeared in 
Africa, threatening all our water resources." He concluded: 
"Efforts by individual countries on their own stretches of the 
river cannot save the river, and are doomed to fail if all the 
other countries concerned do not take the same measures."

  The Delta State Government says "it needs about 4 billion 
naira to effectively combat ecological and environmental 
problems." The commissioner for works, housing and transport 
announced this in Asaba when the staff and students of the 
Administrative Staff College of Nigeria paid him a courtesy 
call. He further said that "about 15 million naira would be 
needed monthly to provide temporary relief from coastal erosion 
and flooding." He used the occasion to urgently appeal to the 
National Committee on Ecological Disasters to come to the aid of 
the state, by providing the necessary financial and technical 
assistance. [Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 15
