  [Text] The government has set up a national emergency 
committee to investigate the cause of the ethnic conflict in the 
Northern Region. The chairman of the committee is the minister 
of defense, Alhaji Mahama Idrisu. There is also a task force to 
deal with the situation in the ground and this headed by 
Brigadier Joseph Smith of the Ghana Army. The setting up of the 
committee was announced at a news briefing in Tamale addressed 
by Brig. Smith. He said although the situation is being brought 
under control, it will lead to severe famine in the region. 
Brig. Smith said life is returning to normal in Tamale. 
  Brig. Smith said the security agencies will conduct searches 
and seize arms and munitions and other offensive weapons in the 
tribal districts. He said with immediate effect, all illegal 
roadblocks in the region are to be dismantled and uncompromised 
searches of vehicles will stop forthwith. He stressed that only 
the security agencies are empowered by law to mount roadblocks. 
Brig. Smith added that the Army has the situation under control.
