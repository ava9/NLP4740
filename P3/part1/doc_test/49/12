  [Text] Togolese refugees, who had settled in Ghanaian 
villages very close to the border with Togo during the 1991 
crisis, are now converging at Aflao following alleged persistent 
bombardment of the villages by Togolese troops. More than 500 
Togolese who settled at Folikope, (Kakakope), and (Aziatakukope) 
near Pillar Six on the Ghana-Togo border last year have deserted 
their homes following alleged widespread shelling of their 
villages. The fleeing Togolese, including women and children, 
are all being put up temporarily at the Roman Catholic primary 
school. The Ketu district secretary, Dr. Andrew Amuzukpeglo, 
has met with the leaders of the new refugee groups and has 
promised them shelter at a refugee camp at Kliko, which had 
accommodates more than 12,000 Togolese refugees. 
  Meanwhile, the fleeing Togolese say Ghanaians are the main 
target of persecution under a house-to-house search being 
conducted by Togolese soldiers in Lome. The reports speak of 
Togolese soldiers demanding Togolese identity cards from each 
household. In another development, Lome radio today announced 
the reopening of Togo's border with Benin and Burkina Faso, with 
that of Ghana still closed.
