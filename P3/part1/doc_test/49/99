  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings left Luanda for 
his country a few moments ago. Jerry Rawlings made a one-hour 
technical stopover in our country after attending the official 
handing over of Walvis Bay to Namibia. Presidents Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos and Jerry Rawlings took the opportunity to review the 
situation in Angola and Ghana. Shortly before his departure, 
Jerry Rawlings told the press that the Angolan Government has 
been taking a generous stand in the Angolan conflict. 
  [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese 
translation] After listening to President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos, I think the Angolan Government has taken a very generous 
stand in the Angolan conflict, which has already killed 
thousands of people. Because of the unjust war carried out by 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
the Angolan people continue to suffer. It is imperative that 
UNITA negotiates seriously to find a solution that would bring 
lasting peace to Angola. [end recording]
