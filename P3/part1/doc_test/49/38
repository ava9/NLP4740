  [Text] THE PIONEER expresses displeasure about the recent 
mock operation involving American and Ghanaian military 
personnel code- named MEDFLAG '94. In the operation, four 
hijackers took over a Ghana Airways plane carrying about 80 
passengers and a crew of four at the Accra Airport. The 
hijackers made certain demands, including the stepping down of 
the government. THE PIONEER says the operation was 
ill-conceived and ill-motivated because apart from causing fear 
and panic, it amounted to putting bad ideas in the minds of 
certain sections of the society.
