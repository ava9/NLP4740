  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings expressed his 
appreciation for the support Cuba has provided to his country 
and sent a message of solidarity to the Cuban people. During his 
meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Rawlings 
stated that his government still has much to do for Cuba because 
somehow they must express their appreciation for all that Cuba 
has done for Africa. 
  Robaina, on the other hand, delivered a message to Rawlings 
from Cuban President Fidel Castro, and described the statements 
by the Ghanaian leader as a reflection of the historic relations 
between the two states. Robaina expressed appreciation for 
Ghana's position on such issues as the U.S. blockade of Cuba and 
human rights. After stating that 1993 had been the most 
difficult year in the history of the Cuban Revolution, Robaina 
predicted that 1994 would be the beginning of an ascending 
spiral for the Cuban people. 
  Robaina concluded his official two-day visit to Ghana as 
part 
of a tour of five African countries. Today, Robaina is in 
Luanda, Angola.
