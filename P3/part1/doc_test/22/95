SUSSEX was remote from civilised society until George IV, the Prince Regent,
turned Brighton from a fishing village into a seaside resort centred on his
pleasure dome, the Royal Pavilion.
Then, with the advent of the railways in Victoria's reign, Sussex changed
for ever. The county of woods and sticky clay, where travelling in a
carriage was a nightmare and where blacksmiths and forgemasters worked the
iron, burning the trees and damming the streams to make 'hammer ponds',
became a Home County.
Bankers and stockbrokers, and their clerks, moved out of London and set
about creating wonderful gardens of rhododendrons and azaleas. (A century
ago, trains to town took the same time as today. The choice of stations was
better.) The Sussex they moved to had largely escaped 18th century
gentrification - there are no Georgian stone stately piles.
Instead, wood, daub, and brick and tile are the basis of the Sussex
vernacular, and near the South Downs, knapped flint also. The houses are
distinctive - their frames are half-timbered, with a filling of daub, bricks
or flint, with the upper part sheathed in vertical hanging tiles as a
protection from the weather. Roofs are tiled and low, giving most Sussex
houses the look of cottages. Inside are low, head-hammering beams and brick
floors and fireplaces, often wide enough to have an inglenook.
The affluent 19th century commuters hastened to enlarge their homes, or
build new ones in the same style, as has continued to happen ever since.
With their look hardly changed for 400 years, it can be hard today to spot
the original bits in an 'old' Sussex house.
As a result, they exude the reassurance of sharing in a living tradition.
Sussex is a large county that divides into three parts. West Sussex,
bordering on Hampshire, has the attractions of Chichester and its cathedral,
theatre, and harbour, and the Roman palace at Fishbourne, racing at
Goodwood, and a beautiful, unspoilt hinterland.
Mid-Sussex is the London-Brighton corridor along the M23/A23 (now being
improved) and the railway line, with easy access to Gatwick, Glyndebourne
(closed for 1993) and the gardens at Wakehurst Place and Nymans. East Sussex
flattens as it nears Kent and the Channel tunnel, and oast houses (for hops)
begin to appear.
A splendid example of a typical East Sussex house newly on the market is the
18th century New House Farm at Bodiam, (where the National Trust has a
famous castle) and close to Battle, where William of Normandy conquered
Harold in 1066. Brick and hung tiles mask its timber frame. Cluttons in
Haywards Heath (0444-441166) are offering it at around Pounds 350,000, with
the adjacent triple oast house for around Pounds 200,000, and up to 320
acres of farmland.
More expensive and basically 16th century (when a family called Thatcher
obtained the property at the dissolution of the monasteries), is Arches
Manor at Framfield, near Uckfield and Lewes, with John D Wood (071-493-4106)
and Batcheller &amp; Thacker in Battle (0424-775577) at around Pounds 600,000.
Nearby is the 17th century Buckham Hill Farm at Isfield, a house rich in oak
and with an 18th century barn offered by Cluttons, at Pounds 575,000.
The Stable Cottage at Wadhurst near Tunbridge Wells, with a Victorian coach
house that could be converted, is available at around Pounds 110,000 from
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge Wells (0892-515035). Next door, Hamptons
(071-293-8222) offer the big house, Best Beech Place, a 1920s Sussex-style
oaken splendour with garden by Gertrude Jekyll, at around Pounds 850,000.
For keen shots, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley are selling Platts Farm at Burwash
looking across to Rudyard Kipling's old house (Batemans) at around Pounds
500,000, to include barns and outbuildings, 71 acres and two duck flighting
ponds.
Oldcastle at Dallington near Battle is a house that grew over 300 years but
did not change its Sussex style. Humberts in Lewes (0273-478828) will sell
it to you with nine acres for about Pounds 625,000. Or they offer the
attractive 17th century Oak Ferrars Farm at Piltdown, with outbuildings and
three acres for about Pounds 269,000.
An intriguing East Sussex conversion is the flint Place Barn at Wilmington,
nestling under the Downs with views to the giant, chalk-cut Long Man of
Wilmington, who stands on the slope holding a stave in either hand. The Barn
(Humberts, around Pounds 275,000) won a Civic Trust award in 1982.
Another recent conversion is the Coach House at Halland near Lewes, a
handsome brick building that has the merit of not being cottage-style.
Watsons in Heathfield (0435-865077) offer it at around Pounds 320,000. The
best Sussex-style house in East Sussex is called Toad Hall: its name must be
reflected in the price of Pounds 395,000 (from Fox in Haywards Heath,
0444-450105). It is an impressive Wealden hall that could have belonged to
an ironmaster, dating back to the 15th century.
But finest of all is a manor house, early 17th century and listed Grade II*,
built in stone by an ironmaster to show he was above the common Sussex cut,
and on offer for only the third time in its history. Court Lodge at
Ashburnham near Battle (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, under offer at around Pounds
450,000) comes with a Grade II barn and 48 acres, including 27 acres of
vineyards which the vendor would like to rent back from the new owner for
Pounds 175 an acre.
In mid-Sussex, a similarly grand manor, now a romantic ruin, is part of
Brambletye Manor Farm near East Grinstead. The total price for a typical
Sussex house, ruins, 26 acres, swimming pool and tennis court is around
Pounds 495,000, or Pounds 100,000 less excluding the farmyard (from John
Powell in Forest Row, 0342-822261, or Savills in Sevenoaks, 0732-455551).
Odder still, and dearer at around Pounds 1.25m, is Laughton Manor near Lewes
(from Hamptons in Mayfield, 0435-872294), a cream-stucco early Victorian
villa with an Italianate belvedere tower that has popped up in the country
from Belgrave Square or Regent's Park.
About half that price is a delightful house (from Fox), the Elizabethan East
Mascalls in Lindfield near Haywards Heath, which a Cheshire family built
with the ornamental half-timbering familiar in the north west. They must
have brought their joiner down with them. Nearby Cockhaise Mill Farm is for
those who want to run a business, as it comes with a thriving farm shop
(with game licence, sausage licence, ice cream licence and liquor licence).
Petfood is a new line and doing well. Humberts offer it at around Pounds
585,000.
Another neighbour is the many-bedroomed 16th/17th century manor called
Tremans at Horsted Keynes, listed Grade II* (Humberts, around Pounds
550,000). Arthur Benson, librettist of Land of Hope and Glory called it
'almost incredibly picturesque'.
Top marks go to Michael Winter-Kaines, a retired British Airways captain who
is marketing his Windmill Cottage at Rowhook, near Horsham, himself
(0403-790513) at Pounds 330,000, provided there is no chain. Not wanting to
pay agents' fees, he has produced an excellent, straightforward brochure for
an attractive listed Grade II house and cottage and barn, and is amazed at
how many people have replied to his advertisements and how nice they are.
'They are delighted to deal directly,' he says.
If you want to farm in mid-Sussex, the 425 acres of Little Danny Farm at
Hurstpierpoint is virtually all the estate once belonging to the imposing
Elizabethan manor house called Danny (now retirement housing with the Mutual
Households Association). It is an attractive proposition: mixed farming,
lovely country, parkland and lakes, in the lee of Wolstonbury Hill (National
Trust) on the Downs, and yet no distance from Brighton. Being sold in lots
by Humberts, the total asking price is around Pounds 1.3m.
Going west, Jackson-Stops in Midhurst (0730-812357) offer an essence of
cottagey Sussex in Old Hill at Lurgashall, near Petworth, three cottages and
a mill run together for around Pounds 220,000. The garden is crammed with
specimen plants. At Washington they are selling (with King &amp; Chasemore in
Pulborough, 0798-872081, at around Pounds 445,000) an 1820s old vicarage, a
good late Georgian box of a house for those who do not thrill to the wealth
of head-height old oak that is the hallmark of Sussex.
