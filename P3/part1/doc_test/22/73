do you want out of a second property? asks Audrey Powell.  And will they
keep their value?

IS IT worth buying a second home abroad? With so many prices reduced or
negotiable, would it prove an investment as well as a holiday home?
The advice of people long in the business is, get a holiday home for
enjoyment, but not for what capital you hope to make out of it. If, like
early buyers, you do well on a rising market, fine. Of course, those who
purchased at high prices and cannot find buyers now that they need to sell,
see things differently.
Even so, there may be other investment aspects to homes bought for leisure
use.
At Port Grimaud, in the south of France, some have been purchasing canalside
houses simply for the benefit of the moorings that go with them. Moorings
for boats of more than 40 ft have become so difficult to find in that area
that Nicholas Beuttler, who handles marketing, has been negotiating with a
German prepared to pay Pounds 380,000 for a house. The buyer is not
interested in the house. He simply wants its mooring.
There is a selection of new waterside properties available in Port Grimaud
(tel: 94.56.21.82 or, in the UK 0243-572001). Typically a one-bedroom
apartment with mooring is Pounds 148,000; a two-bedroom house with mooring,
Pounds 290,000.
Last year Port Grimaud sold 50 new apartments and houses. 'Not as good as
two years ago but very good in current circumstances,' says Beuttler.
Buyers who purchased the first 'fishermen's houses' on Port Grimaud's
waterside in 1966, when the village was started, have not done badly. They
paid Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 8,000. Resales fetch Pounds 240,000.
There can be several side benefits with golf course properties. Many people
who choose such a setting do not play golf. They buy for the security of
their view and the added value of such a location when they sell.
There are other points. Bovis Abroad (081-422-3488), which has been involved
in a number of golf-linked projects, says having a golf membership with a
property can enhance the property's value by 20 per cent to 30 per cent.
This company is about to offer a new scheme in Spain, with 10 years'
'green-fee-free golf' with each property, transferable with the unit if it
is sold.
There is a tendency to write-off areas that have become popular, such as
France's Dordogne, as no longer worth considering for 'budget' purchases.
The feeling is that all the cheap unmodernised properties that started the
British going there to gentrify them, have been snapped up. But the area may
be worth another look.
One man who bought a cottage in the Dordogne for Pounds 750 in the 1960s,
before it was 'discovered,' has used it as an occasional holiday home ever
since. He thinks it is worth about Pounds 50,000 now. Had he modernised it,
it would be worth Pounds 100,000.
London agent Rutherford (071-351-4454) says untouched rural buildings are
still becoming available there, as farmers retire. It has a selection at
under Pounds 35,000. Even after improvement they would have cost much less
than Pounds 100,000.
The possibility of letting can add to a property's investment value. But
there are various ways of doing this.
You may choose a property to suit your own requirements, with the intention
of letting when you do not want it.
That may or may not work. It may not be the right size. You may just decide
you do not want strangers using your property.
The alternative could be to find something with separate accommodation for
letting, as a sideline.
In a village near Avignon, in the Gard area of Provence is a restored
detached stone house on three floors which could be a buyer's holiday home.
In an adjacent quarter-acre plot are ten studio apartments, all on ground
level. They are furnished, ready for an owner to let if he wishes. There is
a swimming pool and boules court with them.
Total cost of house and studios is Pounds 180,000. London agent Domus Abroad
(071-409-0571) says potential net annual income from the studios has been
estimated at Pounds 24,000.
You might prefer a property that would be mostly let, with someone else
dealing with the problems, but which you could use yourself occasionally.
In Switzerland the aparthotel system became popular as a way in which
foreigners could own a property there, when it was otherwise difficult
(though it is less so now).
An example of this sort of proposition is offered by Hilary Scott Overseas,
in West Sussex (0234-554319), an agency which deals in Swiss property.
You buy a furnished one-bedroom apartment, with kitchenette and bathroom, in
a hotel building in a Swiss resort for, perhaps, Pounds 100,000. This is
then leased back to the company and it becomes part of the hotel, with the
kitchenette closed off. It is let to hotel guests and you may get a net
return of up to 5 per cent each year.
Still on the subject of letting, though with investment uppermost, London
solicitor Osbornes has a further batch of apartments available in Rotterdam.
(It had others two years ago).
These are in a street of tenanted flats which are being sold, four at a
time. The two/three bedroom properties, one above the other, are priced at
about Pounds 52,500 for the four (just over Pounds 13,000 per flat).
These Rotterdam properties would not be suitable as second homes, but if an
investor buyer wanted something to keep for himself, or to let to someone
not necessarily working in the area, Osbornes (071-485-8811) can sometimes
offer apartments in Amsterdam, from about Pounds 20,000 each.
