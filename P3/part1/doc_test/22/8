WE MET just after 8.00am on a windy March morning on the first tee at San
Roque golf club in southern Spain. A voice that was definitely not English
said 'Good morning,' and I turned to see a tall, sturdy man with dark hair
who was wearing red velvet trousers, white golf shoes and had slung his bag
of clubs over his shoulder. He had a slow, shy smile.
Jose-Luis Quiros was the caddie-master. Yes, he had played golf for many
years; no, he had never had a lesson. He just watched good players and
copied what they did - and did so with good effect, for he had a firm,
repetitive swing and looked to be a genuine five-handicap player.
As we played we talked, as golfers do, of the course, of our best rounds,
our favourite holes. He said he had some MacGregor clubs that were 50 years
old. I pulled out a nine-iron I carry in my bag, a Fred Daly model made by
John Letters that I bought more than 30 years ago. He admired the face and
classic lines of the clubhead and waved his hands, inscribing the shape of
the club face in the air.
On the 7th, a short hole uphill, I had the honour and hit a one-iron. It
felt good the moment I made contact. I was sure it would be near the putting
surface, if not on it. Jose-Luis stepped forward to play his tee shot, a
quizzical look on his face.
'You no hit it well,' he said.
'Pardon?' I said.
'You no hit it well.'
'Pardon?'
We were entering the realms of Basil Fawlty and Manuel and I felt like
saying 'Que?' in a sarcastic voice. I had just hit the shot of the round, a
one-iron that did not just fly off the clubface but screamed away as if it
was a fighter leaving an aircraft carrier.
I thought he was taking the Mickey. Then the peseta dropped. What he meant
was that I had not hit it full out, that I had saved some juice lest I hit
the ball through the green. He was right. Phew] The temperature dropped. I
nodded, sagely.
We played on and the sun came out to warm our stiff, middle-aged back
muscles. At the 18th I nearly chipped in for a birdie three and Jose-Luis
racked up another par. We shook hands and shared a coffee in the clubhouse.
Then he returned to his duties as caddie-master and I to my room.
The San Roque Suites hotel where I was staying is less than two years old
and already a prominent landmark on the road from La Linea to Marbella. As
you drive east it is high up on the left, the inland side of the road,
bordering the vast acreage of the Sotogrande estate.
In my view it has two things to commend it. It is very comfortable and well
managed by Alex Medina, who formerly worked in hotels in England for nearly
20 years. Its name comes from the fact that it has 50 suites and 50 double
rooms, and when I say suite I mean suite. Mine, for example, comprised a
kitchen, eating area, sitting room, double bedroom, bathroom with heated
marble floor and a separate lavatory. I could swing a golf club, never mind
a cat, in any of the rooms.
Still, for golfers, a greater attraction may be its locality at the western,
less populous end of the Costa del Sol golfing belt, an area which claims to
have 325 days of sunshine annually. Within five minutes' drive of its main
entrance are two superb golf courses to the east - Valderrama and Sotogrande
Old - and Alcaidesa to the west, which could be spectacular once alterations
are completed. When you add San Roque's own David Thomas-designed course,
the appeal of the hotel as a base for a winter golfing break becomes
obvious.
You do not have to take my word for it. In the second week of March, every
room was occupied, many with golfers staying there as part of packages
organised by Longshot, Eurogolf, 3-D and British Airways.
There is little that can be added about Valderrama, perhaps the best course
in Europe. Work progresses daily in pursuit of making it a masterpiece, much
of it with the aim of staging the 1997 Ryder Cup. Whether it achieves this
or not, it is undoubtedly one of the best maintained courses in the world.
The New Yorker used to offer readers a prize if they spotted a grammatical
error in its pages. The attention to detail at Valderrama is such that they
could offer a free drink to anyone finding a weed on its greens and probably
its fairways as well.
Sotogrande Old, the stately old course that Robert Trent Jones laid out 30
years ago, is on the seaward side of the Gibraltar-to-Marbella road. Its
reputation among courses down on the coast is rather like that of the Queen
Mother among Britain's royal family: it is much loved and admired even if it
is slightly past the first flush of youth. The new name on this part of the
coast is Alcaidesa, which is 15 minutes' drive from Gibraltar.
To measure its proximity to San Roque, I used the mileometer of my car and
can report that from Suite 23S at the hotel to the temporary clubhouse at
Alcaidesa is no more than 3 1/2 km, two of which comprise the drive from the
main road down to the temporary clubhouse. It is a majestic drive, a
zig-zagging, tumbling road that took me to the edge of the Mediterranean and
on the morning of my visit to the edge of a swathe of sunlight that lay
still and shimmering on the surface of the sea.
I was awed by the majesty of what I saw of the course. A frisky wind
galloped in off the sea causing the gorse bushes to sway and their yellow
blooms to shake uncontrollably. It is one of the most beautiful and most
difficult courses I had ever seen.
But the fairways were narrow in places, the carries long, the gorse lapped
the edges of some fairways and some of the greens were too severely tilted.
No wonder that when some of the gorse was cut back they unearthed tens of
thousands of golf balls. On a windy day, and more days than not are windy by
the sea, Alcaidesa could be almost unplayable.
Even so, 1,000 rounds each month were played over its 6,500 yards from
October last year to February. Work is currently going on to defenestrate
the course, altering 14 greens, moving tees, hacking away the gorse, making
it less penal.
I climbed into my car and drove slowly back up to the main road, chastened
at the amount of alteration work necessary to adapt what is only a
two-year-old golf course. It is too early to include Alcaidesa in the golden
triangle formed by San Roque, Valderrama and Sotogrande, a triangle that is
the most interesting current aspect of golf on the Costa del Sol.
Besides, to include Alcaidesa would alter its geometrical shape from a
triangle to a rectangle. But it was something to look forward to - the day
when there would be four outstanding golf courses no more than two miles
from one another in a part of the world that, to paraphrase Rupert Brooke,
seems to be 'forever England.'
