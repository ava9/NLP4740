VOLKSWAGEN and Suzuki have abandoned a planned joint venture to develop and
manufacture a mini-car for the European market.
The German company said both sides had agreed the project was no longer
feasible because of recession.
The Japanese group said it had accepted a VW proposal to stop now, but added
that it would continue to develop a car on the basis of results achieved so
far.
The two companies had settled on the final design and were discussing
cost-sharing when the axe fell, Suzuki said.
The plan called for up to 150,000 vehicles a year to be built at the
Barcelona factory of Seat, VW's Spanish sub-sidiary.
The cancellation is a further indication of VW's rigorous efforts to reduce
costs and return to profit. It follows the company's withdrawal last year
from a similar deal with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker, to develop a
high-fashion 'Swatch car'.
Both projects were part of a strategy, developed under the leadership of Mr
Carl Hahn, the VW chairman who handed over to Mr Ferdinand Piech last
January, to give Volkswagen a leading position in the small car market.
At present, VW's smallest vehicle is the Seat Marbella. Growth in demand for
even smaller cars is expected to outstrip that for most other classes in the
latter half of this decade and beyond.
Meanwhile, VW continues to develop its own Chico model to meet demand for
cheap models better suited to crowded urban traffic conditions in western
Europe and the spending power of people in the former communist bloc.
At the same time, the German carmaker is continuing development of a
super-lean, low-cost manufacturing process introduced by Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, appointed production director after he joined the group
in March from General Motors.
Suzuki, in which GM has a small equity stake, had hoped to reap cost-sharing
benefits from the deal and to gain a fresh manufacturing foothold in
continental Europe.
Although most of the Barcelona factory's output was planned to be sold under
the Seat marque, some cars were to be marketed under the Suzuki name,
unaffected by quota restrictions on 'Japanese' vehicles.
Suzuki makes around 35,000 four-wheel drive vehicles a year at its Santana
works in Spain and started manufacturing small cars in Hungary last year.
Output at the Hungarian works, estimated at 15,000 units in the year to the
end of October, is planned to increase to 50,000 in the medium-term.
Most of the Japanese group's expansion efforts are focused on the developing
Asian market.
