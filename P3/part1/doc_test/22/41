ONE OF the oldest surviving private houses in Portugal is for sale. Quinta
da Bacalhoa, at Azeitao, 20 miles south of Lisbon, can variously be
described as a manor house, country estate or summer palace. Its owners have
included members of the Portuguese royal family and aristocracy who either
cared for, or neglected, it. Its last buyer was Orlena Scoville, an
American, who became so obsessed with the house when she saw it as a ruin,
on her first visit to Portugal in 1935, that she spent the last 30 years of
her life restoring it.
The house was probably built in the early 16th century but most of its
records were lost in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. At the end of the last
century a Portuguese scholar published a book about it and from this, and
the advice of experts, Scoville restored the building to its original state.
Mysteries remain, such as why it was built in its Islamic/Italian style and
its name has never been satisfactorily explained.
Behind the high estate walls the main building is L-shaped, with domed
towers. The residential accommodation is on the upper floor. It is not large
but there are dining, drawing and sitting rooms, a library and bedrooms. A
sunken marble bath is in one tower, a chapel in another. The house can sleep
10 and there is staff accommodation at ground level. Decorated, glazed tiles
outline windows, doorways and skirtings and cover large sections of wall.
Some are the oldest in Portugal. Altogether Scoville catalogued more than 70
different designs.
There are also loggias, an arcaded pavilion, a vast reservoir tank, and the
garden which, with its box parterre, fountain, tiled seats and boxes, is
visited in its own right. Scoville died in 1967 but the property remained in
the family and is now owned by her grandson, Thomas, who lives in
Washington. Because he and his family are only able to spend a few weeks a
year at Quinta da Bacalhoa he feels he must sell. He employs six staff and
lets the house for eight months each year. Receipts from letting and from
the vineyard cover running costs. He is asking Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.10m) for
the property and its 14 acres, which include the vineyard.
Some 15 miles north west of Lisbon is Sintra, an area noted for fine, old
properties. One of these is the 19th century Quinta do Biester, a fairytale
mixture of turrets, steep-sided roofs and Gothic windows, built by a German
industrialist. Restored frescos are a feature of the property. The house has
35 rooms on four floors and stands in 22 acres, part of which is an
arboretum. Hamptons International is asking Pounds 2.8m.
By contrast, in the same district is the square, dusty pink Quinta da Ponte
Redonda, an 18th century home on three floors, with seven bedrooms, an
annexe, farm manager's house and several outbuildings in 27 acres. Price
Pounds 1.4m, also through Hamptons.
Developers the world over complain of planners and Portugal is no exception.
Beltico is a Portuguese/British consortium which took over the 550-acre
Praia d'el Rey estate, near Obidos, on Portugal's 'Silver coast'. It applied
for revised planning permission early in 1989 and has just received it, so
work on the development has been marking time. The delay was galling for the
developer since it is eligible for an EC grant and possible tourist
authority aid, but neither could be obtained in advance of planning consent.
'The bureaucracy is an absolute nightmare,' says London solicitor Stuart
Swycher, a director of the consortium. 'It is almost unbelievable. Every
time you go through one door you face another three. We have got the
planning we wanted but it has taken so much longer . . .'
Now work can go ahead on the golf course, tennis courts and other
facilities. Eventually there will be 150 villas, town houses, apartments,
hotels and an equestrian centre.
The wait will bring benefits for eventual buyers. The recession in Portugal,
and competition for work, has cut building costs. Starting prices for
two-bedroom town houses in the development are down from Pounds 80,000 to
Pounds 55,000. Also, with new roads now open, driving time from Lisbon to
the estate has been cut from 80 minutes to 45.
Northern Portugal is a world of its own with few agents offering property
there. CTI, in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, is one which does, working with
associates in the region. It operates most in the area between Braga and
Daminha, at the entrance to the Minho river. Jeremy Lawrence, of this
agency, whose wife is Portuguese, says he has rural properties from Pounds
30,000. One might expect to spend as much again on renovation (which his
agency could arrange).
If you want something a little better he can go up to Pounds 6.3m. This
would buy a 17th century hilltop mansion with views over the Douro river.
The house has 14 ensuite bedrooms, five reception rooms and a ballroom. The
price includes furniture. The property has two swimming pools, tennis
courts, two smaller houses and 100 acres of port-wine grape vineyards.
One advantage of the area is the low cost of living. 'One can eat out in a
good restaurant for a fiver a head, inclusive of wine,' says Lawrence, 'and
where else could one get a puncture fixed for Pounds 1.60?'
One might think that only a supreme optimist would launch a housing project
in the Algarve at present. But work has begun on the Quinta do Rosal
development of 30 villas and 12 town houses on a 14-acre site near
Carvoeiro.
Prices range from Pounds 90,000 for a three-bedroom house and Pounds 112,000
to Pounds 132,000 for a four-bedroom villa, including land. Just to get
things going, the development company, Passarro Verde, has announced a
'special offer' - four two-bedroom houses with roof terraces are available
for Pounds 65,000 each. The properties are being marketed in London by
European Partnership.
Salisbury-based Euro Property Advisers used to handle both new and resale
property in the Algarve but says it is now only dealing in resales because
it became embarrassing offering resales at half the price of similar new
properties on the same estate. Apartments start at around Pounds 50,000 and
villas around Pounds 100,000. Within the Algarve's Quinta do Lago estate,
Bovis Abroad is a long-standing developer. It has 35 villas and apartments
to build in its lakeside village there and expects prices to start at Pounds
115,000. In high season a three-bedroom villa with pool will let there from
Pounds 1,200 week.
Its Sao Lourenco project, on the same estate, has a golf course on one side
and a lake on the other. That development is entirely apartments, with
communal pool and bar. Some 40 units, from Pounds 102,000, have still to be
built. Free golf membership goes with every apartment. There is also a
deferred payment scheme. Lakeside sells to British buyers; Sao Lourenco
attracts Germans and a mixed market.
With the recently completed Pinheiros Altos course adjoining Quinta do Lago,
the estate claims that the area is now the largest golfing complex in
Europe. Pinheiros Altos' developers, Firago, formerly LET Leisure, allocated
91 plots with secured golf membership, around the course. The first
four-bedroom show house has been built and sold for around Pounds 485,000.
Away from Quinta do Lago, farther along the coast, Bovis has its Quinta da
Boavista project, with 350 plots for sale from Pounds 50,000, in 217 acres.
