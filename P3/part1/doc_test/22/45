A growing number of Britons are taking their holidays in the sun not in the
heat of summer but in cold, grey winter.
For them, buying a winter holiday-home in a warm climate makes sense and
they should be able to let at high season rates in summer.
Spain's Canary Islands, off the north west coast of Africa, are favourites.
Breezes keep them from being too hot and the temperature changes little
throughout the year.
Of the seven major islands, Tenerife, the largest, is probably most popular.
Its southern coast has beaches, golf courses - and most of the tourists. The
north is damper and greener.
There is plenty of choice of property. one resort in the south has
apartments, villas, building plots and a country club with 17 tennis courts.
The villas cost from Pounds 70,000 (Pta 14m) to Pounds 200,000, with garden
and swimming pool.
An interesting Canarian house halfway up a cliff looks down on the fishing
village of La Caleta. It needs modernising but has scope for imaginative
conversion, Pounds 28,000.
UK agent Babet, in Somerset, can send details of these and many other homes
on the island. Allow 7 per cent of the purchase price for legal costs.
Since 1965, Chilcott White (Overseas) in Croydon, Surrey, has acted as
selling agent for a Canarian landowner building groups of detached homes in
Tenerife.
Today it offers two to three-bedroom cliff-top properties in the north,
close to the Orotava valley and eight miles from Puerto de la Cruz. These
bungalows or split-level villas are built to order.
Prices, with land, are about Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 50,000 (larger plots
are available). A garage costs from Pounds 3,500, a swimming pool, Pounds
10,000. Add 30 per cent for purchase fees and taxes. Building takes six
months.
Gran Canaria, the third largest Canary island has long sandy beaches, which
make it popular; pine forests and mountains.
It also has areas of caves, both coastal and inland. Many become fascinating
homes. Estate agent Sheena Gallagher, of Property Market, in Las Palmas, can
offer a cave-house with sitting-room, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen.
It is on mains electricity, 'but water comes naturally into an underground
tank in winter.'
The property has its own area of land and can be reached easily by car. The
price is Pounds 50,000.
This agency also has converted farms at around Pounds 350,000 and a number
of old 'character' properties. One, at Pounds 35,000, has two bedrooms and a
cellar, which is a cave.
Another, built in 1670 and well cared-for, has four bedrooms, several
out-houses and an artist's studio. It has attractive views. Price Pounds
145,000.
North of the Canaries, the small Portuguese island of Madeira has a
different character. The Canaries are tourist-orientated, Madeira has a more
settled atmosphere and a faithful winter-sunshine following.
It is a beautiful island, often called a floating garden - so much
vegetation grows so easily in its mild climate, but it is short on beaches.
Its image may have become dated, but Madeira is no longer the 'forgotten
island'. EU money pours in to improve its roads and help it develop a new
business status, with an offshore financial centre, free trade zone and much
else.
Owners of private yachts can benefit from Madeira's international shipping
register, which offers a tax holiday until 2011.
There is a good deal of property and land to be had, though the island does
not advertise this much to the outside world. A third of the population
lives in its capital Funchal, where prices are highest.
Here, among new developments, are blocks of one to three bedroom apartments,
from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 110,000. These are offered by Ilhopredio, in
Funchal, an estate agency run by John Rodrigues and his English associate,
Michael White.
Prices of existing properties range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 240,000.
'The market is a little quieter but still buoyant and prices have settled,'
says White. 'There is a thriving community of English, German, French and
returning Portuguese from South Africa.' But the recession had reduced the
number of buyers from Britain.
Another Funchal agent, Ivo Pereira, belongs to a group building hotels and
apartments. It is building apartments just outside Funchal. They are part of
a project with its own swimming pool and are priced from Pounds 85,000.
