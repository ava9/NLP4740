locations - Venues, The choice is becoming more varied

THERE was a time when conferences were considered an easy source of income
by hoteliers and others who found themselves with large halls or bedrooms
that would otherwise stand empty. Unwary conference bookers were faced with
unreliable service, awkwardly shaped conference rooms and ever-rising
charges.
Now, however, conference planners find an industry with high standards and
enormous capacity to fill during a recession. Customers can assume venues
will be amenable to tough negotiations on price, without withdrawing the
extras - high tech audiovisual equipment, notepads and soft drinks at each
delegate's place, hairdriers and chocolates in every room - which have come
to be expected.
The recession has made many European clients anxious to avoid the appearance
of extravagance, according to Ms Sally Greenhill, of conference production
specialists Spectrum Communications. Conferences have become shorter,
numbers smaller and locations less lavish, though high standards are still
expected for meeting rooms, equipment and service, she says.
Maturing markets also mean that demand for large conferences is levelling
off or declining in most of Europe and the US, but the small meetings sector
of the industry, encompassing training, internal management meetings and
small conferences, continues to expand.
On the other side of the world, there is still considerable room for growth
in the Asia-Pacific region's conference market. There is already a wide
choice of large venues in the region, with another ambitious conference
centre due to open in Singapore next year, but there is space for more hotel
development in some of the newly industrialised countries.
Cultural differences mean the Asian market is developing in slightly
different ways to the more established American and European markets, says
Mr Geoffrey Breeze, vice-president for corporate marketing of Hilton
International, part of Ladbroke. For example, Japanese companies tend to
hold small meetings and training programmes in-house, so clients for
Hilton's smaller meeting rooms in Japanese locations are mostly
international rather than domestic companies, a reverse of the usual
pattern.
The Australian conference industry, with ties to both western and eastern
markets, has seen rapid growth recently. In Sydney, 32 four- and five-star
hotels have opened since the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre on
Darling Harbour began operations in 1989. But the fast rate at which new
accommodation and meeting space has come on line, combined with an economic
slowdown, has left the new hotels competing harder for business,
particularly at the international end of the market.
However, Ms Lani Sullivan, sales director of Novotel's Sydney branch, says
the Australian meetings industry has benefited from a government initiative
which requires companies to spend 1 per cent of profits on training. Demand
for small meeting rooms has soared.
The growing sophistication of British conference planners and intense
competition among meeting-space providers has led some operators to develop
niche markets, while others have reacted by broadening their range.
The De Vere hotel chain, which runs 26 four- and five-star conference
hotels, has been forced to keep prices down, but by branching out into golf
and other leisure pursuits it has raised the average spend by conference
delegates, compensating for slimmer profits on core activities.
Ms Janice Eagleson, group sales and marketing manager at De Vere, says that
as another recession-surviving measure, the group decided against taking
short cuts on quality, and risking the loss of long-standing customers.
Instead, it aimed to increase volume. This has meant pointing out
competitive rates for small meetings to clients who might normally use the
chain only for their biggest events, and cross-marketing leisure breaks to
conference guests, and conferences to single business travellers. Hotels no
longer insist on separating different categories of guest.
One company adopting the opposite approach is Hayley Enterprises, a
subsidiary of A1 Exports, the car parts group. Hayley already owned one
hotel, but saw a gap in the market for a small, business-oriented conference
venue, free from the distractions of holidaymakers and children. Sedgbrook
Hall, in 13 acres of grounds near Northampton, was the result. It opened a
year ago, after Pounds 5m had been invested in converting the Victorian
country house into meeting rooms, and building a new wing containing 60
four-star standard bedrooms, and hotel-type catering facilities.
Sedgbrook Hall's client list is drawn from the top 100 companies, according
to Mr Norman Bellone, its general manager, and the core business is training
and management meetings. In its first year the centre had a turnover of
Pounds 1.5m. 'People have got to communicate with each other, regardless of
the fact that there is a recession on. In fact, they have to communicate
with each other more,' says Mr Bellone.
He attributes Sedgbrook Hall's success to its provision of a businesslike
environment which facilitates communication and learning. For example, a
common request from companies booking rooms for training purposes is for
plentiful natural light. Specialist management centres frequently score
better on this point than hotels, which have often been designed with
evening social functions in mind.
British universities have been used for conferences for decades, but not by
most corporate conference organisers. However, Mrs Carole Formon, general
secretary of the British Universities Accommodation Consortium, says that
the recession has made companies take another look. 'If you hadn't been to a
university for 10 years, and you went back now, you would see a tremendous
difference,' she says. The 63 universities and colleges represented by the
consortium, ranging from former polytechnics to 500-year-old Oxbridge
colleges, have all made investments in upgrading facilities in recent years.
Universities still cannot compete with purpose-built conference centres and
luxury hotels when it comes to upmarket conferences for a few hundred
people, but they do well at two opposite ends of the market: high
attendance, low budget conferences, and smaller training and management
seminar type events.
What other kind of venue could provide meeting rooms, accommodation and
catering facilities for several thousand people within walking distance, at
an all-in 24 hour rate of Pounds 32? Students, as well as conference
delegates, are now accustomed to greater creature comforts, and many
universities are improving standards of student accommodation.
More universities are moving upmarket by opening year-round management
centres for meetings of up to 200 people. Whether purpose-built or converted
from country houses, the centres are usually fitted out to at least
three-star standard, with sophisticated audiovisual equipment. Unlike most
university conference facilities, availability is not limited by the
academic timetable. There are at least 30 such centres, with more due to
open this year.
Jaded conference planners, to whom all conference hotels are beginning to
look alike, might be tempted by a novel meeting package put together by
Stena Sealink, the ferry operator. It offers a one-day conference on board a
ferry plying the Harwich-Hook of Holland line. Guests go on board in the
morning, and by the time the ship sets sail at 11.30am, the conference can
be under way in the purpose-built auditorium seating up to 230.
Before disembarking next morning, delegates have the added attraction of
stocking up in the ship's duty-free shop. Rates start at Pounds 74 per
person for three meals, one night's use of an outside cabin, and conference
room hire.
