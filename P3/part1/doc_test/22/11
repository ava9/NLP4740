SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debarking from the cruise ship that had brought me to this Caribbean island, I 
found myself on a large wharf surrounded by people catering to the needs of 
arriving cruise passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you need a taxi?" a cabbie asked. "No," I said. "I'm just going to La 
Princesa." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," he said with a smile, "you're on your way to jail." 
</P>
<P>
I must admit I didn't get the joke until I walked the few blocks to the 
restored building that is now the headquarters of all Puerto Rican tourism. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, polished and painted and restored, was built in 1837. However, 
Miguel Domenich, executive director of Puerto Rican Tourist Co., proves it was 
once a jail by escorting visitors to the small, rusted old cells that once were 
the quarters of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Although it still is reputed to be the local jail, La Princesa expects this 
Spanish colonial building to set the style for historic old San Juan. Skylights 
let sunlight through to its polished floors and tropical plantings add color to 
its painted walls and to the stone cliffs that back against its spacious 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, however, is just the beginning. On the drawing boards is a 
tree-lined promenade, the paseo, that in other days stretched the short blocks 
to the port. Public areas for dances, concerts and festivals also are part of 
the master plan. So is a fisherman's pier and fish market. The famed rums of 
Puerto Rico will have their own shop. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 passengers arrived in San Juan last year, and future 
estimates indicate the trend is up. 
</P>
<P>
The waterfront master plan, with its $7.6-million initial offering, is full of 
major projects that in 1992 will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' 
arrival in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
La Princesa, originally inaugurated on the birth date of Princess Asturias of 
Spain in 1837, had been closed for 13 years. However, with its huge mahogany 
doors and gleaming brass, it hardly looks like a former prison. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3 million visitors last year saw El Morro, the fortress built in 1540, 
La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World, 
and the Casa Blanca, built for Ponce de Leon, the island's first governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years more than $500 million has been invested by hotel 
companies. There is the giant one-mile swim-way that went into Hyatt's Cerromar 
and the total remake of the Normandie by the Radisson chain. Handy to the 
Caribe Hilton, the Normandie was built in the shape of the ill-fated but 
celebrated ship of the French Line. 
</P>
<P>
It remained unused for years but has been turned into a gem that would please 
the French wife of Feliz Rexach Benitez, who built this Art Deco masterpiece 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandie reopened last year with 180 rooms, 115 of them Art Deco suites. 
The $17-million restoration includes the Normandie restaurant that serves 
everything from sliced baby squid over linguine to stuffed pig's foot in 
Madeira sauce with steamed cabbage. A profiterolle mousse in papaya sauce gives 
it a French and a Puerto Rican flavor. 
</P>
<P>
A Day's Inn has opened 120 rooms in Ponce, and Puerto Rico will get its own 
Ritz Carlton in Palmas del Mar. Also, El Conquistador, long asleep, will awaken 
with 900 rooms, a golf course, a marina, a convention center and a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Conquistador in Fajardo, which is an hour's drive from the airport, 
will be the $350-million Puerto de Rey Marina and Beach Resort. The first 
phase, with a marina larger than any on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, is open. A 
harborside inn is due next year. It will be followed by a 325-room hotel, 1,000 
condominiums, a golf course and tennis and beach clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Here architects returned to the original idea of King Carlos of Spain who sent 
explorers, engineers and architects to the island in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
They envisioned a Mediterranean adapted to the West Indies with waterfront 
towns huddling around plazas. If your yacht is no larger than 200 feet, there 
will be room to accommodate it and 700 others. 
</P>
<P>
On the northwest coast near the town of Isabella, Costa Isabella, the largest 
recreational project ever conceived in these parts, is under way, headed by 
Charlie Passarell Jr., the former Puerto Rican tennis star. 
</P>
<P>
A $1-billion, 2,500-acre vacation and residential complex, Costa Isabella has 
already involved Four Seasons Hotels, Conrad International and the Marbella 
Club of Spain, all to be built around a 19th-Century-style Spanish village. 
Ultimately, Costa Isabella could have up to 2,000 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Puerto Rico is becoming rich. Just how rich, however, its 
discoverers never imagined.
