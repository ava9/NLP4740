VOLKSWAGEN, the German car maker, appeared last night to be positioning
itself to shut down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish car subsidiary, Seat.
The office of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said his deputy,
Mr Narcis Serra, had held several urgent telephone conversations already
this week with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman. The two men are to meet
in Madrid next Thursday.
Up to 9,000 jobs would be threatened if VW were to decide, in the light of
Seat's large losses this year, to close the company's old plant near
Barcelona harbour and concentrate Seat production at its modern new factory
at Martorell, about 25km south of the Catalan capital.
The Seat crisis, which on Wednesday resulted in the resignation of the
company's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, has come at a bad time for
the Madrid government. Mr Gonzalez's minority socialist administration is
trying to negotiate a wages pact with the main trade unions in Spain and to
win support from regional parties in Catalonia and the Basque country so as
to be able to pass its 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday.
Yesterday, though, the unions accused government of conniving with VW to cut
jobs.
In Barcelona, union officials promised fierce resistance to any effort to
close down the plant, which produces Seat's new Toledo and old Marbella
models.
Spanish government officials said Madrid would do everything possible to
help the plant survive, but this was likely to boil down to little more than
persuasion.
Mr Piech plans to spend several days in Spain next week to try to calm
political tempers and popular fears roused by his demands for harsh cuts at
Seat.
The fire-fighting exercise will begin at the VW headquarters in Wolfsburg
today, when leaders of Spain's most important trade unions, the UGT and
CCOO, fly in for talks.
Mr Piech and Mr Klaus Volkert, leading spokesman for the German workforce on
the group supervisory board, would explain Seat's structural and financial
problems, VW said.
Mr Daz Alvarez's 'mutually agreed' resignation was announced one day after a
VW group board meeting had rejected as insufficient his rationalisation
proposals, including a 22 per cent cut in Seat's 23,000 workforce.
VW's demands for radical and rapid action had followed the recent disclosure
that Seat was heading for an 'unexpected' DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this
year. Volkswagen undertook to inject DM1.5bn but has refused any further
financial assistance.
