<TEXT>
SUZUKI and Volkswagen are to develop jointly a European minicar to be built
by VW's Spanish subsidiary SEAT in Spain. The car will replace the Marbela,
which SEAT makes under licence from Fiat, its former partner.
Minicars, of which Suzuki is a big producer in Japan, are smaller than
virtually any car produced in Europe. Both SEAT and Suzuki-badged versions
are expected to be sold throughout Europe, through each partner's
distribution network.
