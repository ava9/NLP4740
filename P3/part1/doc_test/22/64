It was like coming home, except that we did not paint a wall or prune an
orange tree or unstop a drain.
But, driving down from Fiumicino airport, we felt the familiar wonder that
we should be among the few foreigners who knew - had half lived in - the
special corner of Lazio so beloved by Italians.
In nine years we commuted along those 70 miles dozens of times. Passing
Latina, we would watch the terrain changing. From there it distends, as flat
and nearly as green as a snooker table, westwards to the beaches below
Anzio, inland across the Appian Way to collide abruptly with the mountains,
and south to where they drop into the sea at Terracina.
This great plain was for centuries the putrid, mosquito-infested Pontine
marshes. It was drained and invigorated by Mussolini in the 1930s to more
lasting effect than his efforts with the trains.
Soon we would look eagerly for the incongruous eruption that rears on the
horizon, seemingly a rugged island, which in pre-historic times it was.
Nowadays the coast, skewing east, embraces the craggy, 1,700-ft high saddle
of Monte Sirceo, so that one flank is turned to the abundant sun. Falling to
rocks and clear, clean water, this is one of the most beautiful, balmy and
unpolluted shorelines of the Mediterranean.
Scattered white houses peep out of verdant vegetation. Nearly all, including
the one we still presume to call our house, are the second homes of Romans.
The scene never changes, for this is a national park with strict controls.
At one end, the mountain serves to shield the two-tiered town of San Felice
Sirceo. The medieval walled part, astride a hill-top, is officially
sign-posted as Centro Storico; locals never call it anything but the Paese.
It commands the newer, sea-level district of La Cona, with its shopping
centre, promenade, beaches, seafront hotels and man-made port.
At the other end is the stylish hotel and villa complex of Punta Rossa,
draped over the point of that name. We had always assumed it to be above our
station. Now here we were spending Pounds 900 to rent one of several
apartments - virtually a little house - at the foot of the hotel for two
weeks.
Perched a few feet above the sea, it had some pluses over our house. We
could be snorkeling among shoals of small fish in moments. We were used to
trekking down the garden path, amid lemon, orange and apricot trees,
oleanders, hibiscus and masses of bougainvillaea, strolling along a lane and
descending exactly 100 steps to gain a rock perch. At weekends, when
exuberant youths arrived with radios, we were miffed that Italians should
invade our territory.
If the sea was petulant, an alternative was the La Cona beaches, most of
which are kept pristine in season by concessionaires - at a price. We
preferred to drive round the Circeo to the superb sands and dunes that
stretch 15 miles north from abeam of Sabaudia. There development is
restricted to a few beach houses and bars.
At Punta Rossa we had another option - an adjacent sea-water pool, gouged
into a vertical cliff festooned with greenery. We usually had it to
ourselves. And that exemplified the dilemma of such elegant hotels in
southern Italy. With two or three months of hot sun remaining, the ascending
gardens, the guest rooms above, the elevated restaurant with magnificent
views on three sides, were nearly deserted.
For this was the beginning of September, the time called sereno, when
August's excesses of heat and humidity have exploded in spectacular thunder
storms, leaving the sea warm and generally placid. But the tide of visitors,
virtually all Italian, which starts to rise in late July, streams out on the
last Sunday of August. Only for a few more weekends will San Felice bulge.
Ten years ago the cordial San Feliciani readily accepted us into their
community as an Anglo-Saxon minority of two. We are still a bit of a
novelty. For this is no Costa del Sol, or Provence, or even Tuscany. No
expatriate parties here, no golf courses, hardly any private swimming pools.
How smug we were. Occasionally stray fellow-countrymen would appear in
Carletto, La Sona's small supermarket. Inglesi we would hiss from the sides
of our mouths as we dodged behind the pasta shelves.
Along the main street many friends would shake our hands when we returned
from even a brief visit to Surrey. Like Claudio, in the Sant' Andrea
cantina, who fills your five-litre damigiano from a cask for Pounds 3 as you
sample his several varieties of wine. And Pita, always smiling, dispensing
pasta all' uovo, filled and unfilled.
On Friday evenings the street is in turmoil, double-parked Masseratis,
Ferraris and Range Rovers with Roman number-plates disgorging big spenders
in very dark glasses and shoulder-slung jackets.
A place of somewhat grim fascist architecture, Sabaudia is in fact a lively
place with smart shops and several restaurants worth the 15-minute drive
from San Felice. La Pineta, for instance, does wonders with fresh mussels,
clams and scampi.
San Felice has adequate eating places, many combining a pizzeria with the
restaurant. But our favourite outings for Sunday lunch are along the coast.
We always feel euphoric eating seafood in the sunshine at an outside table
on the quayside at Anzio, with a sweeping view of the harbour and fishermen
selling their catches nearby. On the way back, digestion is much assisted by
an espresso or an ice-cream in adjoining Nettuno, a good-looking town with
handsome villas, a big marina and a highly-organised beach.
Our other choice is La Campania on the beach at Terracina. Further on,
Sperlonoa, an attractive combination of hill-top alleyways and golden sands,
makes a good day-out. Indeed, so does Rome - preferably by rail.
From Fossanova, a 25-minute drive inland from San Felice, trains to Rome
take an hour, though it can be worth missing one to visit the 13th century
abbey along the road from the station. A mere 90 minutes from Rome, San
Felice will nevertheless continue to hide from foreigners. This is fine with
us - but what a waste.
