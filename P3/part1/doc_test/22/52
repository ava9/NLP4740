houses in East Anglia

UNUSUAL houses at reasonable prices, and a rich choice of things to do,
await those who venture into East Anglia. Pass on from Essex to Suffolk and
you can go racing at Newmarket and sailing in the estuaries.
After sailing, how about a concert in Aldeburgh? Benjamin Britten's music
paints the fickle North Sea, the bleak mud flats and the free spirit of East
Anglian towns, as robustly independent as Delft or Hoorn are over the water
in Holland. Oysters and Muscadet at the Oysterage in Orford will bring
memories of holidays in Brittany. Then visit Blythburgh church, the
cathedral of the marshes, and Dedham and Flatford, where Constable painted,
and you know you are still in England.
Stunning churches throughout East Anglia beat anything Brittany offers. They
rose from the profits of the Middle Ages' wool trade. Often, the village has
disappeared, leaving a powerful ghost in a church you see for miles across
the low ground. And, for the mystery of it all, read The Nine Tailors of
Dorothy Sayers, who grew up in a Norfolk rectory.
Church crawling becomes a major sport and a diversion from beach holidays at
Great Yarmouth or at Brancaster and Blakeney, on the north Norfolk coast,
which became popular when Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, rebuilt
Sandringham. Today, the towns and villages boast good shops and restaurants.
The delicatessen in Cley-next-the-Sea, near Blakeney, sells fresh pasta and,
in a shed in a Blakeney garden, lurks a second-hand book shop of rare
quality.
Norwich is the heart of its county. Treats in town are the Castle Museum
with its collections of John Sell Cotman and Lowestoft china and, for
something more piquant, the Colmans Mustard Museum. Then, go out to the
University of East Anglia to see its campus, designed by architect Denys
Lasdun. The jewel is Norman Foster's 1975 Sainsbury Centre for the Visual
Arts, and its modern art. It began as a resplendent aluminium and glass
palace that shone in the sun, but lost some of its gleam two years ago when
white plastic panels replaced the aluminium because they leaked. It
continues to be worth the journey.
Trains to East Anglia are good, as are the main roads (but watch the
juggernauts). The A12 from London speeds up to Ipswich, Lowestoft and Great
Yarmouth, and the M11 and A11 to Norwich. Across country to the Midlands,
the soon-to-be-completed A45 leads from Felixstowe to Bury St Edmunds,
Cambridge, Northampton and Coventry. In a tiny, remote Norfolk village, the
big world is still near.
House prices soared late in the 1980s, especially in Norfolk from the impact
of the M11, and have fallen as dramatically - to 40 per cent below the
levels of four and five years ago. Agents have accustomed vendors to the
realism of reduced expectations. But that looks to be changing. Demand is
picking up, and there are more serious buyers with cash who are tiring of
temporary living in a flat.
If confidence really is returning, prices should harden. But Norwich remains
affected by employment worries, as Bidwells reports in its quarterly review;
this could hold back recovery. All agents agree, though, that they want new
instructions to sell - at sensible levels - and foresee that there might not
be enough houses for sale to meet the demand. It is a problem in East Anglia
that while there are splendid properties in all price ranges, there are not
so many of them as in the rest of the country.
Heveningham Hall, much discussed in the media last year - and 'the grandest
Georgian mansion in Suffolk,' according to art historian Sir Nikolaus
Pevsner - remains unsold and still has a guide price of Pounds 4.5m (from
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Savills).
New on the market is a more modest mansion: the 16th-l8th century, brick,
Grade II Narborough Hall near Swaffham, which comes with an ice house,
cricket ground, two lakes, a boat house, lordship of the manor and 79 acres.
What more could you want for around Pounds 800,000? (from Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley). Unless, that is, you wish to spend Pounds 500,000 less and buy
Narside (through Bidwells in Norwich).
This looks as if it were the dower house of the hall and has the mill leet
(the channel taking water to a mill) in the grounds. A bridge spans the leet
and has a bench where you can watch the water flow by, or fish for trout.
Still on the grand side are Irmingland Hall and its estate 16 miles
north-west of Norwich (Pounds 1.4m from Strutt &amp; Parker); and Sproughton
Manor, near Ipswich, a Victorian house for around Pounds 450,000 (from
Carter Jonas) and designed to impose - as was an Elizabethan counterpart,
The Hall at Burrough Green, near Newmarket (around Pounds 375,000 from
Hamptons).
The double bow-fronted, late-Georgian old rectory with 29 acres at Hitcham,
near Stowmarket, recalls the social position of the clergy (around Pounds
600,000 from Bidwells in Ipswich).
In the humbler vernacular of half-timbering are the same agent's
pink-painted Aspen Grove at Assington Green, near Sudbury (around Pounds
250,000); and, with thatch, The Walnuts in Wattisfield, near Diss (around
Pounds 179,000).
Carter Jonas offers The White House - which is white and looks like three
cottages joined together - at Foxhall, just outside Ipswich (Pounds
238,000); and a flint and brick farmhouse at Woodbridge (Pounds 197,500).
Jackson-Stops is selling the flint and brick Victorian Gothic Gazeley Mill
Cottage near Newmarket (Pounds 129,000), and the truly ancient Old Hall at
South Wootton, near King's Lynn (Pounds 220,000, down from Pounds 240,000).
Frost offers the charming Grade II, pink, half-timbered Corner House in
Kersey, near Hadleigh (Pounds 175,000).
Curlews, on the edge of Blakeney, is a brick, flint and thatch house
overlooking the salt marshes (Bidwells in Norwich, Pounds 275,000). The
Georgian Rosalie Farm is just six miles from Newmarket and has three
paddocks (Bedford, Pounds 395,000). In Norwich, Strutt &amp; Parker is selling
two Georgian brick houses in The Crescent (Pounds 215,000 and Pounds
225,000).
Two unusual names are Mausoleum House in Felsham, near Bury St Edmunds,
which has been in the same family since it was built in 1780 (Brown, Pounds
195,000); and Sally Beans on the edge of Cromer (Strutt &amp; Parker in Norwich,
Pounds 99,500). And for a truly unusual house (or, perhaps, four flats),
there is the converted Redgate Water Tower at Hunstanton, a 1912 Norman keep
in red brick. From its Astroturfed roof garden, you can man the battlements.
Jackson-Stops is asking Pounds 200,000 as a whole or Pounds 100,000 for the
penthouse on the top two floors.
