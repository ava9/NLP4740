Dubai wants to be everywhere else in the world at once. It would like its
ports to be the Singapore of the Middle East and its air-cargo terminal the
Seattle of the Middle East; it wants to become a Miami-style cruise centre
for the Middle East and it wants its golf courses to make the emirate the
Wentworth of the Middle East. There are plans to make it the Epsom of the
Middle East with a new horse-racing track.
And those are just a few of its ambitions - leaving aside for a moment plans
to build its own GulfoDisney-type theme park.
About the only places in the world Dubai apparently does not want to
resemble are Riyadh, for example, or Abu Dhabi, its big-brother emirate down
the coast.
When Dubai's promoters, who are ubiquitous, talk of this magpie city-state
being 'cosmopolitan', what they mean is that Dubai is not a particularly
typical Gulf, or even Arab city.
Even its indigenous locals apparently feel much the same way. 'I love it
when people say Dubai is like San Diego,' says Mr Mohammed al-Abbar, the new
head of the city's Economics Department, in his impeccable US accent. He is
just back from six years in Singapore.
One obvious reason why Dubai does not have a specially Arab feel is because
local Arabs make up a only small proportion of the city's estimated 600,000
inhabitants - perhaps only a fifth. Indians, Iranians, Pakistanis,
Filipinos, Sri Lankans and a large helping of Americans, Britons and other
Europeans make up the rest. And it was ever thus.
Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, arrived in Dubai circa 1948 to find
the soukhs crowded with 'pallid Arab townsmen; armed Bedu, quick-eyed and
imperious; Negro slaves; Baluchis, Persians, and Indians. Among them I
noticed a group of Kashgai tribesmen in their distinctive felt caps, and
some Somalis off a sambuk from Aden.'
Dubai's promiscuous port has attracted buyers and sellers from everywhere
since it was settled by the Maktoum family, who seceded from Abu Dhabi in
1833. The Maktoums have traditionally barred few from entering Dubai who
might add to its wealth.
Today, as a result, quick-eyed armed Bedu are thin on the ground. There are
a couple slung with worn wooden carbines guarding the British Bank of the
Middle East, one of Dubai's founding colonial institutions, but these days
they are allowed only one, symbolic, bullet between them.
Thesiger would also recognise little of the town itself - in his heyday a
sparsely-settled Gulfside village with a fort, now the city's museum, and
few big buildings among the settlers' palm-frond houses.
Although Dubai's first concrete house was not built until 1956, the advent
of oil and the development ambitions of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed bin Maktoum,
the emirate's second ruler who died in 1990, quickly turned Dubai into a
sprawling, low-rise city which today is crossed by multi-lane highways
roaring with traffic and which is studded with prestige modern hotels and
occasional high-rises.
You can spot the desert from some of these, but you would need a car to find
a camel.
Its plethora of soukhs, shopping streets and cavernous marbled malls burst
with cloth, clothes, watches enough for the wrists of a small continent,
cameras, TVs, walkmans and almost anything else, at knock-down prices which
brave and persistent souls can try knocking down further.
If there is a shopping equivalent of Stendhal's Syndrome - a condition
identified in Florence of dizziness brought on by excessive exposure to
great works of art - its first victims will fall palpitating in Dubai.
Just as dizzying is Dubai's kaleidoscope of cultures. By wanting to be
everywhere at once, the city ends up not really knowing what it is.
The streets of Satwa, with their curry houses, tiny tailor shops and
mirror-tiled barbers, might be the suburb of an Indian city. The Chicago
Beach village, just out of town, could be a corner of Marbella; its
satellite shopping malls perhaps Calgary or Edmonton. It may reflect Dubai's
cultural indecision that the city has roundabouts with traffic lights.
Its interiors can be equally bemusing. Sit in one of the hotels' de rigueur
English-style pubs and you will likely be served by a Filipino in full
oriental dress against a backdrop wallposter view of the Eiffel Tower -
probably while enjoying 'Caribbean night' music. The new and elite Aviation
Club is resplendent with roman pillars, pagodas and English lawns, all done
with an austere Swedish finish. As a rule of thumb, what is not Arabesque in
Dubai is pastiche and everything, preferably, is brand new.
But Dubai specialises in its incongruities. No sight in the Gulf is more
arresting, for example, than the Emirates Golf Club, an undulating 18-hole
oasis in the greened sands east of the city, which earlier this year Seve
Ballesteiros conquered to win the first round of the PGA circuit. The Creek
golf club, nearing completion in the city's south, with its sharpened Sydney
Opera House clubhouse and a yacht marina to follow, is a similarly defiant
sight.
These golf clubs, and Dubai's beach resorts, innumerable sports clubs and
other grand facilities are not folies de richesse - even at a cost of Dhs8
per gallon of water to green the fairways. Rather, they are part of a
concerted and extremely high-energy campaign to champion Dubai as the Gulf's
most attractive centre for foreign investment. And without more foreign
investment, the emirate's opulence will not survive the drying of its oil
wells - at present rates due some time early next century.
Behind this lies the determination of Dubai's government - that is Sheikh
Maktoum bin Rashid, the ruler, and his brothers - to do all in its power to
make the city-state an atypically easy place to do business by Gulf
standards.
Flowing from this desire are the development of the Jebel Ali free trade
zone outside the city, where foreign companies can enjoy 100 per cent
ownership; the creation and aggressive marketing of Emirates airlines; the
sponsorship of world-class sporting events and the selling of Dubai as a
tourist resort; the golf courses, and a generally hands-off approach to
government.
About the only thing preventing the government from turning Dubai into a
full-blown Hong Kong is the emirate's place within the seven-city state
United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is dominated by the far more
conservatively Gulf Arab, and far more oil wealthy, Abu Dhabi.
'They're more capitalist here than Thatcher,' is how one expatriate
businessman puts it. 'The only reason they don't deregulate things more is
because of the UAE and the Gulf Co-operation Council (which groups the six
main Arabian Peninsular states): they don't want to upset people.'
Instead, and in keeping with an abiding rivalry with its bigger neighbour,
Dubai seeks to distinguish itself by the audacity of its ambition.
After the golf courses will come a horse-racing track which will host an
international meet. Dubai will host a round of the world's power boat
championships; then build a theme park. Then, perhaps, run its own cruise
liners; maybe build a new cricket pitch which some people are already
suggesting might vie for the cricket world cup. Perhaps it will even install
a monorail linking all Dubai's hotels to the theme park.
One rumour even has it that Dubai is considering creating a ski-slope on the
mountains to its west, with real snow. Presumably the idea is to turn Dubai
into the Gstaad of the Middle East.
