A Spanish businessman accused of stealing $22 million from the state's Medi-Cal 
program cannot be prosecuted here because he fled to his country before 
authorities raided his Diamond Bar home, government fraud investigators said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Faustino Pascual Crespo flew to Spain, which does not extradite its citizens to 
the United States, after fraudulently billing Medi-Cal for hundreds of 
thousands of medical items for incontinent patients, authorities said. The 
state attorney general charged him with grand theft last week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the money represents the biggest theft by an individual in 
the history of Medi-Cal, which pays for medical care for poor Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo, 47, was investigated as part of a statewide probe of unscrupulous 
medical suppliers suspected of stealing at least $200 million from Medi-Cal 
through fraudulent bills for adult diapers, rubber bedsheets and similar items. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have filed charges against about 100 people and closed 60 medical 
supply firms in an effort to stop the practice, which is concentrated in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities charge that Crespo, using a series of temporary business visas, 
flew to California from Spain at least six times during three years to commit 
the fraud. During his visits, Crespo allegedly filed fraudulent claims and 
returned later to cash the state checks he received, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Medi-Cal investigators, Crespo set up four medical supply 
companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties from 1987 to 1989. The firms 
billed Medi-Cal a total of $24.4 million, virtually all of it for incontinence 
supplies, investigators said. The firms were identified as Neighborhood Medical 
Supply in Cypress; Argus Enterprises in Santa Fe Springs; Lahke Home Care Inc. 
in Pomona and Meditech Technology Corp. in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the supplies never were delivered, said Dennis Cowan, the 
state's chief Medi-Cal fraud investigator in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo's attorney, Dennis Warren, said state authorities "exaggerated the 
$22-million figure" for the purposes of getting a higher bail on Crespo. 
</P>
<P>
"They have substantial evidence of deliveries of millions of dollars of 
products to individual beneficiaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo purchased Medi-Cal stickers from independent "sticker bandits" who get 
them from Medi-Cal recipients at nursing homes, mobile home parks and 
government-subsidized housing projects, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal recipients are issued five stickers a month, which they exchange for 
doctor's visits and other medical services. The stickers must be attached to 
bills sent to Medi-Cal for payment. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, bandits give Medi-Cal recipients small bags of toiletries in 
exchange for the stickers, which cannot legally be sold or traded. In other 
instances, bandits impersonate Medi-Cal officials and steal stickers, Cowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators raided Crespo's businesses and Diamond Bar townhouse March 2 but 
were told by his 21-year-old son that Crespo had left for the airport the night 
before, court papers said. Crespo lives in Marbella, on the Spanish Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Crespo remains in Spain, U.S. authorities cannot seize him and bring 
him to trial, said Assistant Atty. Gen. Steven V. Adler, who heads state 
investigations of Medi-Cal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo may have decided to flee after he was notified that Medi-Cal was 
auditing him, said M. Teresa Franco, a supervising Medi-Cal fraud investigator 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Warren said Crespo left the United States not to escape authorities but to 
take a "pre-planned business trip" to Europe, where he owns several companies 
that manufacture or sell medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Since Crespo's departure, authorities have seized $2.7 million in cash and 
property belonging to him in California, including an 11-unit condominium 
complex under construction in Pomona. But Crespo managed to transfer more than 
$6.6 million to Spain from bank accounts in California, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo also is the target of a $250,000 fraud investigation by officials of the 
federal Medicare health program for the elderly, according to court records.
