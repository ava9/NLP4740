Regent's Park had more peasants than crescents. Things have changed

MANY WOULD count Regent's Park as the jewel in London's rich crown of
parkland. But it is more than just space and greenery; the necklace of
creamy, neo-classical terraces which edge it was designed by John Nash as an
integral part of the whole. The area was mostly farmland leased from the
Crown - more peasants than crescents - when the Prince Regent and Nash, his
favourite architect, decided to develop it in 1811. The ambitious plan was
for a 'garden city' stretching all the way down Regent Street to St James's
Park; but only the terraces and a handful of the 56 villas planned for
Regent's Park had been built when it was opened to the public in 1835.
Today, property in and around the park, next door to the West End, is among
the most sought-after in London; a modest two-bed flat will set you back
Pounds 250,000. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a three-bedroom flat in Cumberland
Terrace (which, unlike the other terraces, contains only apartments) for
Pounds 400,000. At the other end of the scale, this is where you will find
the most expensive house ever sold in London. The Holme, which lies beside
the boating lake and includes four acres of land and a nine-car garage,
fetched Pounds 25m in spring 1991.
This, however, was something of an exception. Neil Gilchrist, of estate
agent Lassmans (who handled the sale of The Holme), says since the end of
1990 the market has, by and large, been 'completely dead.' He explains: 'Our
biggest problem until recently has been the lack of overseas buyers because
of the weak dollar. As a consequence, prices have fallen at least 25 per
cent. It has taken this long for them to come down to sensible levels
because a lot of owners were just not prepared to drop their prices at
first.'
For some, though, the bleak scenario has involved more than a price drop.
Lassmans has on its books a Grade I-listed house in Hanover Terrace, on the
west side of the park, which was repossessed from the previous owners. They
paid Pounds 1.9m in 1988; it is now on offer at Pounds 1.35m complete with
four double, en-suite bedrooms; numerous living rooms; a staff suite; sauna;
60ft garden, and a mews house.
Admittedly, it lacks niceties such as a kitchen: that was ripped out and
sold before the eviction. Gilchrist estimates the new owner will have to
spend Pounds 200,000 to restore the property. 'This hasn't the cachet of,
say, Eaton Square (in Belgravia),' he says, 'but then, it would cost about
Pounds 4.5m there. This is really good value now.' Meanwhile, Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley has a similar house next door (but with some fitments) for around
Pounds 1.475m.
Unlike much of the property around the park, the 20 houses of Hanover
Terrace have private gardens. But Chester Terrace, on the eastern side, has
communal gardens instead and Gilchrist describes it as 'secure and popular.'
Lassmans is selling numbers 34 and 41 at Pounds 1.35m and Pounds 1.4m
respectively; for that, you are looking at recently refurbished five-bedroom
houses with staff accommodation in the basement and great views.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has one of Nash's few villas for sale. Nash House,
which he is thought to have built for his own use, is a pretty, Grade I
property in Chester Terrace for which the agent is asking Pounds 1.55m -
Pounds 200,000 less than when it first came on the market in May 1992. But
it is not necessary to move into the million-plus league for a house in
Regent's Park. If you are prepared to sacrifice the view, you could pay less
than Pounds 1m for 5 Chester Terrace, just round the corner. And for smaller
houses such as 8 Chester Place - which still contains five bedrooms and is
also on Lassmans' books - the asking price falls to a mere Pounds 600,000.
Although it was the prolific Nash whose work established Regent's Park as
the cutting edge of architectural design in its day, he did not monopolise
the area entirely. St Katherine's Precinct by the Danish Church, which was
built as an ancient charitable foundation, was designed by Ambrose Poynter,
a student of Nash but no fan of his (indeed, they hated each other). The
precinct's collegiate Gothic style cocks a hefty snook at Nash's classical
facades, pillars and statues. One six-bedroomed house there, modernised
fully and with a 60 ft garden, has come onto Savills' books recently at
Pounds 1.275m. Another, with Lassmans, needs around Pounds 250,000 spent on
it but compensates with an asking price of Pounds 450,000.
In a late-'80s neo-classical extravaganza, Ouinlan Terry designed three
showpiece villas. The Ionic Villa sold in a couple of months two years ago,
but number two, the Veneto Villa, has been on the market for well over a
year at Pounds 6.75m, complete with every conceivable mod con and Palladian
flourish. Poynter would turn in his grave.
