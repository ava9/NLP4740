Australians Peter Fowler and Wayne Grady both eagled the 12th hole today to 
combine for a 10-under-par 134 total to give Australia a 7-shot lead after the 
opening round of the World Cup golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler shot a 6-under 66, Grady a 68. Both three-putted the 18th green for 
bogeys, costing Fowler a chance at matching the course record of 65 first set 
by American Johnny Miller in this tournament in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, with Jose Maria Olazabal shooting a 70 and Jose Maria Canizares a 71, 
was in second place at 141. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Lanner birdied four of the last five holes for a 69 to combine with Ove 
Sellbers (73) for a 142 and third place for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champion United States was fourth at 143 as Paul Azinger (70) 
four-putted from just off the 18th green for a double bogey and Mark McCumber 
shot a 73 in a round marred by slow play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concentrating well," said Grady, who with Fowler had survived a 
72-hour trip from Australia marred by bad weather conditions in London and 
Malaga. The trip ended with the two sleeping in a rental car Tuesday night on a 
back road from Seville to Marbella. 
</P>
<P>
At Mizayaki, Japan,, Tom Watson used a chip-in birdie to finish one shot off 
the lead after the first round of the Dunlop Phoenix tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Naomichi Ozaki fired a 6-under-66 today to take a one stroke lead over Watson.
