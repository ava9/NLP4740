FT  08 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Trafalgar House wins Pounds 30m
orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE GROUP companies have won more than Pounds 30m of work in the
last few weeks for projects at home and abroad.
In central London, Trafalgar House Construction Management has secured two
contracts together worth Pounds 18m. The Croydon-based company is to
refurbish the Willis Corroon Group's five-storey corporate headquarters at
10 Trinity Square while the client is still in occupation and without
disrupting its daily business.
At the BBC's Bush House headquarters in the Aldwych, WC2, work is underway
to upgrade the World Services studios in the central block of the north
wing. This project includes demolishing redundant studios, offices and
continuity suites and replacing them with offices, audio workshops and
studios.
The company has also been awarded the initial stages for the first phase of
a Pounds 100m residential golf community in Marbella, Spain, called Altos de
Los Monteros.
The regional business of Trafalgar House has been awarded orders worth
almost Pounds 12m for building work at HMS Heron, HMS Warrior, RAF Lyneham
and civil engineering projects in Essex, the West Country, Scotland and the
Midlands.
