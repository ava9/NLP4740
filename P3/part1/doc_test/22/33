Three years to go and already Valderrama's suitability as a Ryder Cup venue
is being questioned. Last week's Volvo Masters at the Spanish venue produced
record crowds but they in turn heightened alarm that the course will be
unable to cope when much larger numbers attend in 1997. The fundamental
question is whether such events as the Ryder Cup should be held on
traditional or modern courses.
Valderrama was built only in 1975 but is firmly traditional in design.
Anyone who attended the last three Ryder Cups in Europe at the Belfry, for
example, will certainly enjoy the better aesthetics. Almost every hole is
marked by the vivid shapes and luminous bark of cork trees.
The course swoops both uphill and down and offers splendid views of the
Andalucian countryside. Its owner, a retired tin billionaire from Bolivia,
Jaime Ortiz Patino, is thought to spend Pounds 4m of his own money each year
to maintain the course in splendid condition.
In the six years since he bought it outright, Patino has ironed out some of
the quirks that brought a mixed reaction from the professionals when
Valderrama was first added to the tournament schedule.
'It looks like it was designed by Walt Disney's brother,' David Feherty once
said.
Patino has rebuilt the greens at the rate of two a year so that they spike
up less and drain more quickly. The 17th has been converted from a long and
arduous par five to one that resembles the 15th at Augusta. The bank behind
the green will make a splendid focal point.
There are many feature holes. The fourth is a spectacular par five; the
eighth a gorgeous short par four; the 10th another birdie opportunity; the
12th an enormously long short hole cut through an avenue of woodland; the
15th is a scenic par three. Few who have either seen or played Valderrama
doubt its right to be considered among the top 10 courses in Europe.
But does that make it a great Ryder Cup venue? The trouble with traditional
courses is that they were never meant to accommodate heavy traffic. Who
could have foreseen, in a country where few people are interested in golf,
that one day Valderrama would have 25,000 spectators walking around it?
There are bottlenecks everywhere that will make it a logistical nightmare
for those who like to follow the Ryder Cup matches around the course. To get
from the second to the third involves going through a small tunnel. To get
from the 14th to the 15th means clambering up a steep bank, and people were
slipping and falling as they endeavoured to follow Severiano Ballesteros on
the final day last week. Walk along the left of the 17th and it is not
possible to see a thing until the green is in sight.
The trees which add so much to the course's splendour heavily restrict the
numbers who can walk around. The 18th, the most crucial hole of all, is one
of the worst in this respect. Few people will be able to see anything.
Patino has his answers to some of these questions. There is talk of a bridge
being built between the second and the third. He is discussing with an
electronics company the possibility of constructing a giant television
screen behind the 17th so that people will not have to fight to catch a
glimpse of a match that goes down the last. On the 18th, eight of his
beloved cork trees are to be removed to accommodate a grandstand.
Some of the problems, though, seemed to have escaped his notice until they
were pointed out. He was unaware that viewing was impossible from the side
of the 17th fairway.
To these concerns Patino added one of his own. A section of the road that
links Malaga to Valderrama has still to be built and so for 11 miles the
traffic is down to one lane in either direction. Patino, in his Ryder Cup
bid, said this would be a dual carriageway by the time of the match itself
and there would be no problems.
He was wrong. The construction work is in grave doubt. The Spanish
government wants it to be a toll road and is awaiting bids to build it. None
are forthcoming. If the money to build is not in the transport budget by
next March then Patino doubts that it will be constructed in time. In that
case, he estimates, spectators could take six hours to travel the 30 miles
from Marbella to the course.
Patino is clearly adopting a high risk strategy in making known his dismay.
He hopes to shame the government into action. But his views merely reinforce
the long-held thoughts of many in Britain, that the Ryder Cup will be
damaged by Spanish inefficiency.
Would not the Ryder Cup be better on a modern course, which may be bland,
but will be easy for spectators and accessible? It is a question that
Valderrama, the sum of our hopes and fears, raises.
