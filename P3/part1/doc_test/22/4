MANY visiting Spain for the Barcelona Olympics (July 25 to August 9) or Expo
'92 in Seville (until October 12) will combine these events with a holiday
and see more of the country.
Plenty will use Spain's new EC-funded motorways linking its Mediterranean
resorts - and find the road journey much safer and more enjoyable than it
used to be. Some, tired of crowds, may explore the inland areas. After all,
there are 197,000 square miles of the country, with a population of only 38m
spread around it. A number may consider Spain for a second home. There are
plenty of smart new buildings and cut-price resales.
Some may want to view the results of the much-publicised activities of the
mayor of Marbella, Jesus Gil y Gil, in cleaning up the town, tearing down
buildings and planting hundreds of palm trees along the roads, at Pounds
1,000 a time.
Stories of his television interviews, given in a jacuzzi while wearing his
chain of office, do nothing to spoil the legend and may help sell apartments
being built by his company, on a plot running down to the Marbella
waterfront.
Los Cipreses del Mar consists of three blocks in the centre of the town. One
white marble confection has a vast marble and smoked mirror foyer. Security
is tight and seems to be run entirely by computers. There are pools, garage,
restaurant. Every apartment has a hi-fi system. The prices of the balconied
flats range from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 1m.
A more relaxed development is the Marina Puente Romano apartments adjacent
to the Puente Romano hotel. There are 234 units in three groups. Prices
start at Pounds 139,000 for a two-bedroom apartment. A duplex penthouse with
its own pool could be Pounds 700,000.
Such projects tend to be targeted at a specific market. This would suit
tennis buffs. It has 11 tennis courts and is next to the Manolo Santana
tennis club and buyers get free life membership of the club.
In the hills nine miles from Marbella, 400 plots are for sale in La Zagaleta
country club. Buyers will be able to build detached houses, and play golf on
an 18-hole course. There is riding, tennis, swimming, a heliport and a club
house, with lounges, bars, restaurants, glittering disco and a pavilion
suitable for large-scale entertaining.
The 2,000-acre estate was owned by Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer. The
sumptuously furnished clubhouse was one of his many homes. It is now in the
hands of the Spanish bank which repossessed it.
Hamptons International has just opened in Marbella, working with established
agent Barry Randal-Williams (London tel 071-493-0222; Marbella tel 861-909).
These three projects are on its books.
Along the coast, Bovis Abroad is having a sale. It is offering properties at
La Manga club, near Cartagena (a long-established golfing and holiday
resort), at prices reduced by up to 25 per cent.
A one-bedroom flat is available at Pounds 36,000; a two-bedroom villa with
pool, at Pounds 105,000. 'These are odds and ends we have left over,' says
sales director Charles Weston-Baker. (Bovis, London Tel 081-422-3488).
Above Alicante is Denia, a typical small Spanish resort. It is a cheerful
venue for package holidays in summer when its population swells from 28,000
to 150,000. On the edge of the town, looking into the hills, Bovis has a
compact development of terrace houses and flats. There are two swimming
pools. Prices start at Pounds 50,000 for a two-bedroom house or flat.
Expected high-season rentals: from Pounds 1,300 a month.
A glut of apartments in and around Barcelona will be on sale once the
Olympics are over and advance offers are being sought.
There are stories about blocks of flats in the city collapsing because of
defective cement. Britain's Building Research establishment was consulted by
Spanish authorities about this problem. Shaun Pilgrem, an architect with
British and Spanish qualifications practising in Barcelona, says the stories
are true, but the problem is localised and the authorities are dealing with
it. Others in the property world are less sure. Clearly professional vetting
of a property there would be wise.
What of Spain's little known regions? South of Seville there is the coast on
either side of Cadiz, the Costa de la Luz.
Home seekers might look at the estate of Atlanterra 90 minutes from
Gibraltar overlooking the largely deserted silver Atlantic beaches.
Civilisation in this southernmost tip of Europe is represented by the
village of Sahara de los Atunes, which boasts a four star hotel. Adjoining
it is the office of Ignacio Silva, who speaks English and handles sales for
the Atlanterra estate (tel 43-91-51). Normally, he says, the minimum total
price for a plot and a house built to your requirements is Pounds 240,000.
But there is one house available, right on the beach. The living room opens
on to the garden, swimming pool and sands. There are two bedrooms and
bathrooms in the house and two in a separate guest section. The property is
Pounds 682,500.
The holiday home hunter in a different price bracket might usefully explore
the rural villages inland from the Mediterranean coast. Many, like similar
areas in France and Italy, are becoming ruins as the young people leave for
the towns.
In his Overseas Homebuyer's Handbook, property expert Geoffrey Pilgrem
explains that few agents bother to offer such property partly because prices
are so low that it is not worth their trouble. In some areas whole villages
have been abandoned. Pilgrem suggests the valley and lake region south west
of Andorra.
He warns that there might be difficulties acquiring such a rural home and
'one needs one's hand firmly held.' Some people might see the abandoned
villages as 'spooky.' He sees the area as 'quite magical.'
One British agency that specialises in this corner of Spain is Bradley
Vaughan, in Haywards Heath, Sussex. (tel 0444-412551). It offers properties
for renovation from Pounds 8,000. But Pounds 15,000 might be more realistic.
