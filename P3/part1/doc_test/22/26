FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (9): Tee time for
millionaires in spacious Provence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Trent Jones, the world's most prolific designer of golf courses (he
has more than 500 courses to his credit) bought 2,500 acres of beautiful
countryside in the south of France, outside Vidauban in Provence. That was
about 20 years ago
He wanted to build Europe's largest golf resort, where he could ensure that
the best land would be used for golf. As he knew from experience:
'Developers too often want to take the best land for housing, and leave the
dregs for the golf course.'
Les Domaines de Vidauban, 15 miles inland from St Tropez and St Maxime, in
the foothills of the mountains of Maures, is now taking shape. It will be
not only Europe's largest but also its most expensive golfing resort.
One of the first buyers of a Pounds 2m villa, Alain Prost, the former world
motor-racing champion, has been made president of the Golf Club even before
the first of three 18-hole golf courses is completed this autumn.
Robert Trent Jones, now 85, has undertaken the design and construction at
Les Domaines de Vidauban with his elder son Bobby. Bobby has 130 courses to
his credit, including the new one at Wisley, Surrey.
Though Robert Trent Jones bought the land at Vidauban with the help of Jaime
Ortiz Patinho, a Bolivian tin magnate, they decided not to undertake the
Pounds 600m development themselves. They brought in Pierre Schnebelen, who
developed the ski resorts of Tignes, Val Thorens and Valfrejus. Schnebelen
has been building international resorts for 30 years, but this is his
largest project.
At Les Domaines de Vidauban, he is associated with Malik Bencheghib, of
Fonciere Malbe in Paris. Other backers include the French hotel group Accor,
Interconstruction, the firm of contractors which built the Grand Arch at La
Defense, Paris), and the Doliner group.
In addition to its three challenging golf courses, Les Domaines de Vidauban
will have six hotels, 225 shops and restaurants, a tennis ranch with 40
courts, a polo centre, two artificial lakes for water sports, botanical
gardens, parkland, and three villages with a total of 2,000 villas and
apartments.
The first championship golf course, with wide, lush fairways threading
through the elegant umbrella pines and cork oak of this part of Provence,
will be ready for play in September 1992. The second course will open in
1993, the third in 1994. Accor, whose managing director, Sven Boinet, was
French amateur golf champion, will open its first four-star hotel in 1993.
Showhouses in the first of the three villages are for sale at prices ranging
between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 500,000. More than 60 of the 750 villa
plots around the golf courses have already been sold; on these, houses will
be built which will cost from a minimum of Pounds 600,000 for half an acre,
up to Pounds 4m for eight acres.
Many of those who have already bought villa plots are industrialists with
businesses in Sophia Antipolis, the decentralised commercial centre about 25
minutes from Vidauban. It can take between one and two hours to get from
Nice or Cannes to Sophia Antipolis in the summer - which is why one German
industrialist, who has had a home in Theoule for 16 years, took only two
days to decide to spend Pounds 1.3m on a villa at Vidauban.
Pierre Schnebelen says: 'One of the great surprises is the number of people
who want to live here all year. Our average price of property may be Dollars
1m, but for Dollars 1m here - which is the price of a small apartment in
Nice or Cannes - one can get a villa with a swimming pool and half an acre
of land.,'
International businessmen are likely to be attracted by the fact that you
can get to Vidauban on the A8 motorway from the airports at Nice or
Marseilles in less than an hour, or from Toulon airport in 15-20 minutes.
'We are targeting the buyer who wants to play golf on a Robert Trent Jones
course, dine in St Tropez, anchor his boat in Port Grimaud, spend a day on
one of the beaches at Pampelone, ride on horseback through the Maures
mountains, enjoy almost Californian spaciousness and yet be only a few
minutes away from the motorways and the airports,' says Schnebelen.
At present there are more than 300 golf courses in France. 100 more are
being built, but the French Golf Federation says that more than 500 new
courses are needed within the next five years to satisfy the demand.
Schnebelen and Bencheghib (of Fonciere Malbe) see Les Domaines de Vidauban
becoming the golfing capital of Europe, attracting those who go now to the
Costa del Sol in Spain or the Algarve in Portugal.
Robert Trent Jones says: 'When finished, Vidauban will rank high among my
finest works, from the standpoint of marvellous golf courses as well as
unparalleled facilities for the combination of golf and business.'
Les Domaines de Vidauban has a sales office on site (telephone
010-33-94-7355-87). The agents in the UK are Don and Catherine Law, of
Guildford, who specialise in the sale of property in France under the name
Le Cl (telephone 0483-68846).
