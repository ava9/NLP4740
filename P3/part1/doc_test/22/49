up their advance into Europe and threatening the domestic industry

The first engine is due to roll off the assembly line at Toyota's Pounds
140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales, next week, heralding the next
wave of a formidable assault by Japanese carmakers on the European car
industry.
The array of Japanese vehicle plants and new models poised to enter
production in the UK, Hungary, Italy and Spain was planned in the late
1980s, when car demand in west Europe was accelerating powerfully, with
record sales every year from 1985.
The extra capacity from Japan is about to hit the market, however, when the
European appetite for buying new cars is succumbing to economic
retrenchment. Sales are weakening in important markets, while some, such as
the UK, remain stubbornly mired in recession.
Now Europe's indigenous carmakers - busy building plants of their own and
already wringing much higher output from existing facilities as part of a
determined drive for greater productivity - are confronting the spectre of
rapidly growing overcapacity.
Japanese vehicle production capacity in Europe is expected to exceed 1.2m a
year by the end of the 1990s. European car production totalled 12.7m last
year with the Volkswagen group accounting for 2.44m and Renault, the
smallest of the big six volume carmakers, for 1.55m. Japanese carmakers
captured 12.3 per cent of west European new car sales of 13.49m last year
and this is forecast to rise to between 16 and 20 per cent by the end of the
decade.
The battle with the Japanese carmakers is about to be joined in earnest by
Honda and Toyota, who start up their first European car plants during the
final three months of the year. Both are located in the UK, which the more
staunchly protectionist European auto industry leaders such as Mr Jacques
Calvet, chief executive of Peugeot, the French carmaker, have likened to 'a
Japanese aircraft carrier just off the coast of Europe'.
Toyota and Honda are developing a total capacity to produce 300,000 cars a
year by the mid-1990s at the UK plants, and the figure could easily double
by the end of the decade.
The UK is not the only Japanese springboard into Europe. At Esztergom, 40km
north of Budapest, the first Suzuki Swifts are also set to leave the line of
Magyar Suzuki's more modest assembly plant this autumn, while in northern
Italy, Daihatsu will begin production by the end of the year of small vans
and pick-ups at its joint venture with Piaggio.
Back in Britain, Nissan, which pioneered the route for the Japanese motor
industry into local car production in Europe during the mid-1980s, is about
to launch its second UK-built car range.
The Toyota, Honda and Suzuki plants may start slowly, but the Nissan example
shows how fast the trickle will become a flood. Japan's second largest
automaker began car production modestly enough in Europe in 1986, but it is
now pulling out all the stops to stay a jump ahead of its Japanese rivals.
Output of 125,000 Primera large family cars in 1991 is planned to rise to
175,000 this year as Nissan adds the new range. Production is planned to
surge to 270,000 in 1993 as the plant rapidly approaches its presently
announced capacity of 300,000 cars a year, and the company has already
indicated its ambition of reaching 400,000 cars a year in the UK by 2000.
While it is Nissan's growing UK operations that claim much of the limelight,
the company is also investing heavily in Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish
commercial vehicle maker, in which it acquired majority control a decade
ago. From 1990 to 1995 it is putting Pounds 600m into Spain. This month it
is starting European production in Barcelona of its new Serena multipurpose
vehicle - rival vehicles planned by Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot are
still a couple of years away from launch - while in the spring the company
will roll out a new-generation four-wheel-drive vehicle.
As a sign of this changing order in Europe, Nissan will supply part of its
Spanish output of the four-wheel-drive vehicle to Ford for sale in Europe
under the Ford badge.
The link between the two in Spain shows how quickly the arrival of Japanese
vehicle makers in Europe is set to move on to a more sophisticated plane, as
the world's automakers further refine their global square dance of competing
in some regions of the world, and linking arms in others.
Rapidly mounting research and development costs are the impetus behind new
alliances, and even the industry giants are being forced to find partners.
Volkswagen of Germany is poised to finalise a deal with Suzuki for the
production of a range of small cars in Spain.
The Japanese carmaker, a leading minicar producer in its domestic market,
will engineer the new cars for production at the Barcelona plant of Seat,
VW's Spanish subsidiary. It will replace the outdated Seat Marbella. Output
is expected to start in 1995, with a target volume of 150,000 cars a year.
While protectionist-minded volume carmakers in Europe might have preferred a
comfortable existence behind the import barriers, life in the global auto
industry is no longer so simple.
The Japanese vehicle makers have set up their own local plants inside the
barriers. At the same time, less protectionist European producers are
scrambling to gain their own Japanese links to win some competitive
advantage, or to help overcome earlier failures.
While VW studies its link with Suzuki, Rover, formerly British Leyland, has
fallen gratefully into the arms of Honda, and Volvo, the ailing Swedish
carmaker, has sought refuge for its medium-sized cars with Mitsubishi Motors
in a joint venture in the Netherlands.
Honda, in addition to its own UK car and engine plant, also holds a 20 per
cent equity stake in Rover's vehicle operations, and Honda technology
essentially underpins all Rover's new cars launched since the mid-1980s.
Volvo has brought Mitsubishi in as a joint-venture partner at its Dutch
plant, where a new range of cars - badged both Volvo and Mitsubishi, but
mainly engineered by the Japanese carmaker - will emerge in the mid-1990s.
The deals may vary, but the driving forces for the Europeans are the same:
the imperative to improve production technology and create more
cost-effective new products.
Waking up to their competitive deficiencies, European carmakers have been
engaged in an intensive campaign of so-called 'benchmarking' to measure
themselves against the world's best standards - and then to try to close the
gap. Five years ago they had to look to Japan for the standards, but
Japanese carmakers' global expansion means that the competition has now
arrived on their own doorstep.
When the Japanese assault on Europe was first planned, the European motor
industry focused on the fear that the Japanese would build a series of
'screwdriver' plants in Europe with minimal local content.
The fear was naive. In the event Japanese plans are proving much more
ambitious and their roots in Europe will go much deeper. They are in the
process of constructing a top-to-bottom manufacturing system, and they are
already meeting UK requirements for 80 per cent local European Community
content.
Even as the concrete is drying at the assembly plants, the leading Japanese
producers are also pressing ahead with the establishment of research and
development facilities in Europe, where they will be able to engineer
locally some future models exclusively for Europe, as well as draw
increasingly on local European component suppliers.
The Japanese share of the west European new car market ranged from 2.7 per
cent in Italy to 14.8 per cent in Germany and 45.2 per cent in Ireland. The
overall share is now set to rise rapidly through the 1990s as:
remaining barriers to direct imports from Japan are eased and then removed,
local Japanese production capacity in Europe is expanded, and
new Japanese supply sources for Europe are developed in North America, Asia
and Australia.
The pattern is complex, but already Honda and Toyota are shipping cars to
Europe from their US plants, while Mitsubishi is about to start exporting
cars from Australia to Europe. Maruti, the Indian carmaker in which Suzuki
holds 40 per cent, is carving out a niche in southern Europe with a car that
is a clone of the Suzuki Alto. Proton, the Malaysian national carmaker, is
already claiming almost 1 per cent of the UK market with cars based on old
Mitsubishi technology.
Japanese carmakers' finances may be weakening, but the assault on Europe can
only be slowed marginally. It will not be reversed.
The model for Europe is already evident in North America. Following
investment of about Dollars 7.5bn in assembly plants in North America in the
1980s - eight in the US and three in Canada - the Japanese transplants'
total car and light truck production capacity is planned to reach some 2.7m
vehicles a year by 1993-94.
According to Professor Dan Jones and Mr Jim Womack, co-authors of the
ground-breaking auto industry study, The Machine that Changed the World,
'nothing like it has ever occurred in industrial history.
'In effect between 1982 and 1992 the Japanese will have built in the US
Mid-West an auto industry larger than that of Britain or Italy or Spain and
almost the size of the French industry. By the late 1990s the Japanese
companies will account for at least a third of North American automobile
production capacity - perhaps much more - and have the ability to design and
manufacture entire vehicles in a wholly foreign culture 7,000 miles from
their origins.'
A similar description could well apply to Europe in the year 2002.
