Sweeping interest rate cuts across Europe encouraged several top-quality
borrowers to tap the international bond market in a variety of currencies
yesterday.
The European Investment Bank launched its expected Eurolira offering,
raising L300bn through 10-year Eurobonds callable at par after five years.
Joint lead manager Credito Italiano said the bonds sold quickly to domestic
retail investors. When they were freed to trade, the bonds were quoted at
98.80, 20 basis points within fees.
SNCF, the French state railway, also tapped the Eurolira sector but
syndicate managers said its deal proved less popular because of the 12-year
maturity, even though the bonds are callable at par after five years and
annually thereafter. In the late afternoon, the bonds were trading at 98.80,
10 basis points within fees.
Credito Italiano said persistent demand from Italian investors for callable
bonds was likely to attract more borrowers to raise funds through this type
of instrument.
After absorbing a steady flow of issues in recent days, the Euroyen sector
saw a Y50bn offering of five-year bonds from Baden Wurttemberg L-Finance, a
financing subsidiary of Germany's L-Bank. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said
the deal met good demand from European, US and Japanese investors.
Exim Bank became the first Japanese government-guaranteed issuer to do a
fungible transaction when it raised Y30bn by reopening its outstanding Y75bn
offering of 10-year Eurobonds launched last September. Lead manager Nomura
said half the bonds went to investors in non-Japan Asia and the rest to
European investors.
Sweden also reopened its benchmark Dollars 2bn offering of Eurobonds due
December 1995 to raise a further Dollars 500m. Lead manager J. P. Morgan
said the maturity of the bonds coincided with that of a large
Ecu-denominated syndicated loan which Sweden took out in 1992 and which it
was in the process of repaying.
KfW, Germany's triple-A rated reconstruction agency, issued CDollars 150m of
5 1/2 -year bonds which lead manager ABN Amro said were largely targeted at
continental European retail investors who are likely to want to roll over
their Canadian dollar bonds when they mature. Redemptions are likely to be
particularly heavy in June.
However, other syndicate managers said the pricing of the bonds should have
been at least five basis points wider and added that the timing was poor,
coming before today's Ascension Day holiday which will close many parts of
continental Europe until Monday.
Few new issues are expected today or tomorrow due to the holiday. Up to 40
syndicate managers are also due to fly to Marbella tomorrow for a weekend of
golf and tennis, organised by Lehman Brothers.
The Province of British Columbia yesterday signed a Dollars 2bn
multi-currency Euro-debt issuance programme arranged by Lehman Brothers.
Notes to be issued have been rated double-A one by Moody's and double-A plus
by Standard &amp; Poor's.
