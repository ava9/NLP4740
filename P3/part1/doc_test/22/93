at the heated debate over mounting applications to build golf courses

WHEN the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews, Scotland, warned some time
ago of a progressively acute shortage of courses in Britain, farmers and
their land agents started to see bunkers by every cowshed. At a time of
deeply-depressed agricultural land values, turning surplus fields into
fairways became a pleasant and potentially profitable prospect.
The majority of Britain's courses were established before the Second World
War and golfers had become concerned about the shortage of new facilities at
a time when television coverage of international tournaments had boosted the
sport.
But farmers' enthusiasm to find alternative use for their unproductive land,
and the conversion of more and more armchair golfers to active play, has led
to a heated debate on whether there are now too many planning applications
for new courses.
Local planners have, by and large, been favourable to such schemes, since
they tend to involve little extra building while adding to the leisure
facilities of an area. In practice, as Mark McAndrew of estate agent Strutt
&amp; Parker says: 'There have been a lot of sites where the owners have consent
for golf use, but a lot will never be developed as golf courses.'
Planning consent offers no guarantee of being able to attract
member/subscribers to a self-financed club, or of attracting play-and-pay
customers on a more open course. And, as McAndrew notes: 'Finance for any
leisure scheme is terribly difficult to get hold-of now.' But he dismisses
suggestions of any widespread withdrawal of support by backers and doubts if
he could identify as many as 10 financially-doubtful projects among the many
dozens under way nationally.
Strutt &amp; Parker, with more than 1m acres of farm and estate land under
management, is keen to be seen as a firm with particular expertise in golf
projects. And anyone offering a site for a prospective course at an asking
price of Pounds 3.25m can be expected to be optimistic about the scope for
fresh golf projects. McAndrew is no exception.
He argues that there still is substantial interest assuming the property
fits the bill with a prime, well-located site. In this instance, it is the
180-acre Leggatts Park in Hertfordshire, north of London, that has been
added to S&amp;P's open-market sale list.
Having won planning consent for an 18-hole course, and permission to convert
an existing building into a clubhouse, the family that has farmed the land
since the late 1960s had tried to sell the property privately. But despite
being just two miles (3.2 km) from the M25 London orbital motorway, and
close to the dormitory town of Potters Bar, there was no interest from
offshore investors or leisure development groups. The fact that the property
is mature, undulating parkland with a good crop of trees still failed to
draw the offers. Now that Leggatts Park is on the open market, S&amp;P claims
the asking price represents 'only a limited premium value over
residential/agricultural levels.'
As a working farm alone, it is unlikely the property would be worth even
half its price tag. But Leggatts is unusual in having such a substantial
main house (nine bedrooms plus two additional staff flats) as well as four
other houses, two of which have five and six bedrooms, with additional
out-buildings.
Roger Pryor, head of S&amp;P's leisure department, thinks it is 'the best
commercial golf development site available at present.' How long it remains
available could depend on how avidly prospective buyers have read the
European-wide survey of golf facilities produced by Greene, Belfield-Smith,
the leisure industries arm of Touche Ross, the accountancy-to-management
consultancy group.
This 20-country survey, based on figures for golf facilities at the
beginning of 1991, re-affirms and extends the projections of the forecasters
at the Royal &amp; Ancient. It expects that the pace of development of European
golf schemes will overtake that of the United States in the near future and
that Europe overall will become 'the most rapidly-growing golf market.'
The consultants' forecasts, while interesting, pale beside the core of the
survey which is a course-by-course, hole-by-hole exposition of the state of
golf in Europe. The most striking fact is that England on its own has more
than a third of all the golf courses in the area between Norway and Greece.
The survey records 1,377 courses in England, with a total of 23,081 holes.
Add Scotland's 471 courses and 7,247 holes, plus 126 with 1,958 in Wales,
and the UK has more than half of Europe's grand total of 3,687 courses with
59,465 playable holes.
Self-evidently, golf facilities in the less-wealthy areas of southern Italy
and Greece, rural Portugal, and the more northern regions of Norway and
Sweden are few and far between. These golfing fringe areas do bring the
Euro-averages down. Nevertheless, the survey does help to discount any
concern that the TV-inspired upsurge of interest in playing the sport would
result in a mass exodus of golfers to the heavily publicised Mediterranean
courses.
The level of marketing and promotion for villas and apartments by Spanish
and Portuguese golf courses belies the comparatively-limited golf facilities
available in those countries.
Spain, as the survey shows, has only 108 courses with 1,777 golf holes
(fewer than Wales and only twice the score-card of Finland). Portugal has
just 20 courses with 252 holes.
The consultants worked out that there are 112,000 people for every 18-hole
golf course in Europe. That compares with 23,000 a course in the US. On the
same line of argument, if every region of Europe became golf-conscious and
sought to match present US golf facilities, an additional 15,000 golf
courses would need to be completed. Even the Royal &amp; Ancient might balk at
that.
