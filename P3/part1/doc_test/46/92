<P>
The United States detonated a nuclear weapon 2,000 feet beneath the Nevada 
desert Friday, the third such test since the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The blast registered 5.7 in magnitude at the Earthquake Center in Golden, 
Colo., and was felt in Las Vegas, 105 miles away, less than one minute after 
the 10:30 a.m. detonation. 
</P>
<P>
Some Las Vegas residents reported feeling a slight swaying in the wake of the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Energy spokesman Jim Boyer, speaking from a control point 34 
miles from ground zero, said no radiation leaked into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes and helicopters equipped with cameras and radiation detection 
equipment circled ground zero at blast time. 
</P>
<P>
"The test was successful. Everything went well," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The test of the nuclear weapon, with a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons, was code 
named "Tenabo" and was the seventh announced nuclear detonation by the United 
States this year. It was the third U.S. nuclear weapons test in the last four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was a 13-kiloton 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear weapon detonated Friday was positioned in a mined-out chamber at 
the bottom of a vertical shaft sunk into Pahute Mesa, a 5,000-foot-high 
volcanic plateau located deep within the boundaries of the Nevada Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
The test shaft was plugged with grout and cement to prevent radioactive 
material and gasses from escaping into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The detonation, originally scheduled for 7 a.m. Thursday, has been delayed 
several times -- once because of a technical difficulty and other times because 
adverse winds would have carried an accidental leak of radiation toward Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Nevada Test Site became operational in 1951, a total of 706 nuclear 
tests have been conducted at the facility, including 501 since the signing of 
the Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviets in 1963. The treaty, in effect, 
requires that nuclear weapons tests be conducted underground to prevent 
accidental radiation releases from drifting across international borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Test Site, the heart of the country's nuclear weapons testing, is a 
1,350-square-mile outdoor nuclear testing laboratory the size of Rhode Island.
