<F P=106> [Article by Kamil Bayalinov under the "Chinese Ceremonies" </F>
rubric: "Chinese People's Nuclear Tests Fall to the Lot of the 
Kyrgyz People"] 
  [Text] The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry has finally responded 
to this Chinese nuclear explosion with a "statement." The mild 
document, retouched by experienced diplomats, says that 
Kyrgyzstan..."welcomes the aspiration expressed by China for the 
complete destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, as well as 
for the achievement of a universal ban on nuclear testing." The 
whole tone of the statement is couched in a spirit as if 
Kyrgyzstan were apologizing for its nuclear tests. However, at 
the end of the "memorandum," the diplomats got down to business: 
"In the space of not quite two years, China has carried out 
three nuclear tests. To us it is obvious that such tests have a 
negative effect on the environmental situation and the health of 
people in the region. Kyrgyzstan, as a state which borders 
directly on China, is experiencing justified and growing concern 
about this matter." 
  Having carefully studied the document, the Chinese Embassy 
in 
Bishkek delivered its answer to Kyrgyz representatives. It 
reports that China unfailingly advocates "the complete 
destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, and, in this context, 
the implementation of a universal ban on nuclear tests." But 
since China understands the concern of its neighbors perfectly 
well, then it is exerting every effort to conclude treaties on a 
universal ban on nuclear explosions.... 
  Following such an answer, it evidently remains for the 
Kyrgyz 
to apologize for the trouble caused to the Chinese. 
  The Chinese nuclear test range at Lop Nor is situated to the 
south of East Turkestan, which is now part of the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region. The first explosion occurred in October 
1964. By the late 1960's there had been a series of tests of 
hydrogen bombs. At first the test range occupied a modest area 
-- 56 km by 36 km -- but then it expanded considerably. The PRC 
nuclear research center is located here. Three operating sites 
for conducting explosions on land, underground, and in the air, 
are located on the territory of the test range. A test range 
for the study of the effect of radiation on animals and plants 
is situated near the city of Hotan. But the zone of the effect 
of radiation on people does not just include the entire Chinese 
autonomous area, but also one-half of Kyrgyzstan and part of 
Kazakhstan. According to figures from the 
"Nevada-Semipalatinsk" international antinuclear movement, after 
every hydrogen bomb test at the Lop Nor test range, the infant 
mortality rate in Alma-Ata [Almaty] and the area has gone up by 
30-60 percent. 
  It is interesting that at the time of the latest test at Lop 
Nor, east winds have been blowing over the test range (this is 
very rare in the area, incidentally), in a direction away from 
Central China and toward Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Following 
the nuclear explosion in May 1992, aerosol tests in Bishkek 
showed an increase in the activity of ruthenium and strontium 
radiation by a factor of 20. And after all, Bishkek is 1,000 km 
away from the test range! 
  However, as far as radiation is concerned, there are no 
borders or distances. The Chernobyl tragedy is an example of 
this. 
  In four months' time, the Lop Nor test range will be 30 
years 
old. During this period, the Chinese military have conducted 22 
surface and 15 underground tests of nuclear and thermonuclear 
weapons. Naturally, without informing either their own citizens 
or the governments of adjacent countries about it. 
  The latest explosion resounded 10 June of this year. A 
powerful cyclone swept over northern Kyrgyzstan within several 
days. Information about an increase in the radiation level has 
not found its way into the press yet. The Kyrgyz leadership is 
adopting all possible measures to reduce anti-Chinese moods 
among the people, which are being intensified from one day to 
the next. And not only because of the nuclear tests being 
carried out by the mighty neighbor.
