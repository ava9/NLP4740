<F P=106> [Unaattributed article: "Disarmament Conference in Geneva: </F>
The Way to Nuclear Test Ban"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 25 Jan (ATSA) -- The opening of talks on a 
nuclear test ban marked the resumption of the Conference on 
Disarmament in Geneva on Tuesday [25 January]. The United 
States, which refused Iraqi participation in the conference, 
joined France in criticizing the "nuclear ambitions" of North 
Korea. 
  In a message to the Conference on Disarmament, U.S. 
President 
Clinton underlined on Tuesday that "the first priority" is to 
quickly conclude a treaty on a complete ban of all nuclear 
tests. This objective was made possible in light of the 
consensus reached among the five recognized nuclear powers 
(China, United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia) in 
1993. 
  However, French Ambassador Gerard Errera, who was elected 
conference president, noted that "it is hardly conceivable that 
the five powers will agree to impose new constraints on 
themselves if other countries remain free to develop clandestine 
nuclear armament programs." 
<H5>  North Korea Condemned </H5>
  Ambassador Errera denounced the refusal by North Korea to 
"meet its international commitments in the field of 
nonproliferation." That country is opposed to the inspection of 
facilities which are suspected of engaging in the development of 
atomic bombs. 
  John Holum, director of the U.S. Disarmament Agency, 
mentioned the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle 
East and between India and Pakistan, but he also pointed out the 
progress made in Latin America and Africa in this regard. 
<H5>  Enlargement </H5>
  An issue to be solved is the enlargement of the membership 
of 
the Conference on Disarmament (currently 37 states), so as to 
allow a better regional breakdown and to include "threshold 
countries" which have the capability of acquiring the nuclear 
bomb. 
  The United States recalled on Tuesday that it did not oppose 
an application by North Korea. It turned down Iraq's request, 
however, as that country is under UN Security Council sanctions 
and "disregards" UN resolutions.
