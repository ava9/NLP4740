  [Text] United Nations, January 21 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative today called for "all nuclear states to undertake 
not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states and 
nuclear free zones." 
  Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation to the session, 
expounded on how to effectively prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons at the second session of the preparatory committee for 
the 1995 conference of parties to the treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was held this week 
and concluded today. 
  Sha said "China attaches great importance to the prevention 
of nuclear weapons proliferation and the maintenance of an 
effective international legal mechanism for that purpose." 
  "At the same time, China also believes that 
non-proliferation 
by itself is not the ultimate goal for mankind, and that the 
objective must be complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons." 
  As the nuclear countries fail to agree to ban and destroy 
nuclear weapons, "the imbalance inherent in the treaty in the 
rights and obligations between the nuclear and non-nuclear 
states is perpetuated and the security demand by many 
non-nuclear states cannot be genuinely assured." 
  So, people should put emphasis on the commitment by the 
nuclear nations to non-first-use and non-use of nuclear weapons, 
Sha stressed. 
  "The Chinese Government believes that conditions are now 
ripe" for making that commitment, Sha said. 
  The reason, he went on, is that with the ending of the Cold 
War era, the first-use defense doctrines of the East and West 
based on a balance of nuclear terror and nuclear deterrence 
against conventional supremacy have lost their validity and 
pretext. 
  Sha criticized some big super nuclear powers for lack of 
sincerity for peace. 
  "Should the nuclear states, the largest nuclear states with 
global nuclear attack capabilities in particular, emphasize only 
non-proliferation and their own absolute security to the neglect 
of the legitimate concerns of the non-nuclear states,... how can 
they expect the large number of non-nuclear states trust their 
sincerity for peace," he said.
