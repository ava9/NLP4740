  [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China said 
today that international arms transfers should help ensure 
self-defense and not undermine peace and security. 
  Arms transfers should neither be used as pretext for 
interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states, 
affirmed Chinese Ambassador Hou Zhitong when addressing the UN 
Disarmament Commission. 
  The key to solving the problem of unrestricted arms 
transfers 
lay in the political will of a few countries which have the most 
advanced defense industries and most arms exports, he noted. 
  The international community should call on certain countries 
to stop their exports of large quantities of arms to other 
states for ulterior motives, stressed Hou. 
  He called on the world community to take immediate steps 
forcefully against the illicit arms transfers. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador also clarified his 
country's positions on some other issues concerning disarmament. 
  China supported efforts to conclude negotiations on the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty by 1996, he said. The 
negotiations began earlier this year at the conference on 
disarmament in Geneva. 
  Hou reiterated that his country had undertaken not to 
threaten the use of, or to use, nuclear arms against 
non-nuclear-weapon state and it had also called on other 
nuclear-weapon states to do the same. 
  Hou expressed China's support to many developing countries 
in 
their demand that non-proliferation should not hinder 
international technological cooperation, much less be used as an 
excuse for blocking their acquisition and development of science 
and technology.
