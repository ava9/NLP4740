  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan protested to China on 
Friday [10 June] against its underground nuclear test earlier in 
the day and warned it could adversely affect Tokyo's economic 
assistance, now being detailed, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Jiro Saito called Chinese Ambassador 
to 
Tokyo Xu Dunxin to his office and "strongly" protested the test, 
officials said. 
  Saito told Xu that Japan, the world's only country to have 
suffered atomic bombings, has especially strong feelings against 
nuclear testing and called on China not to repeat such tests in 
the interest of bilateral relations, the officials said. 
  Another senior ministry official took similar action in a 
separate meeting with a Chinese embassy minister, voicing 
concern that such a test would have an undesirable effect on 
Tokyo's effort to win understanding and support of the Japanese 
people toward economic assistance for China, they said. 
  It was an indirect reference to Japan's fourth package of 
yen 
credits pledged to China. The two countries are currently 
identifying projects to be financed by the loans. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also urge 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their meeting in 
Beijing on Sunday to refrain from nuclear tests, the officials 
said. 
  Earlier Friday, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement in which he called the Chinese test "extremely 
regrettable."
