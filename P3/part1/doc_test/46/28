A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) could be completed within a
year, Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch, chairman of the United Nations negotiating
committee, said yesterday, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. He said the
negotiations, which began in January, had made faster progress than expected
and he hoped for an initial draft treaty text by late spring 1995.
A treaty could be finished just before or just after the April 1995
conference on extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A number of
developing nations have made a test ban treaty a condition of their agreeing
to an indefinite extension of the NPT.
Mr Marin-Bosch said there seemed to be broad agreement for the treaty 'to
ban all tests in all environments for all time'. This would include
so-called 'peaceful' nuclear explosions as well as nuclear weapons tests,
though the possibility of exceptions was being discussed. The treaty would
contain verification measures and provisions for sanctions against countries
violating the ban.
China, the only one of the five declared nuclear powers still testing atomic
weapons, says it will stop tests after 1995.
