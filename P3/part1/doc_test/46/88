THE US is urging China not to conduct an underground nuclear explosion which
would break a year-old worldwide moratorium on nuclear testing.
US intelligence reports suggest China is preparing for an explosion at its
Lop Nor test site.
President Bill Clinton yesterday said China should 'step away' from any
plans to test a nuclear bomb. The US president earlier this year extended
the moratorium on US testing. This effectively precludes any British tests
which use the US Nevada test site. Russia is not expected to resume testing,
and France, which would like to conduct tests, appears likely to refrain so
long as only China among the nuclear powers is testing.
Diplomats have speculated China would delay any resumption of nuclear
testing until after the decision next Thursday on the location of the
Olympic Games in the year 2000, to avoid damaging Beijing's chances.
Yesterday China's top Olympic official ruled out a 1996 Games boycott but
refused to say that Chinese athletes would actually go to Atlanta.
Earlier the chief executive of the Beijing bid committee, Zhang Baifa, said
a boycott was possible because of political interference by the US House of
Representatives, which passed a resolution in July opposing China's bid on
human rights grounds.
Zhang stressed that this was a personal opinion he first expressed last
month. But He Zhenliang, vice president of the International Olympic
Committee (IOC), dismissed the apparent boycott threat as 'unfortunate
rumours' based on an erroneous interpretation of a statement. 'There will be
no boycott,' he said categorically. Boycott is a non-question.'
President Bill Clinton yesterday told Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime
minister, that the US would like to see a political initiative to stop the
violence in Somalia, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Clinton said he could not provide details of a possible settlement
because 'our position is not well enough formed yet .' But he said 'it
certainly doesn't mean more troops there.'
