The Department's responsibilities are mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization
and appropriation. Other activities may be directed by regulatory mandates identified in compliance agreements
or orders or other enforceable documents.

The Nevada Test Site occupies 1,350 square miles in southern Nevada, and is located approximately 65 miles northwest
of Las Vegas. The Nevada Test Site is bordered to the north, west, and east by the Nellis Air Force Range, and on the south
by Bureau of Land Management-administered lands. To the east, the Nevada Test Site shares a nearly contiguous border
with lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Desert Game Range. The western half of the Game Range
is also used by the U.S. Air Force, which shares a contiguous boundary with the Nevada Test Site. The Nevada Test Site
is a remote, secure facility for conducting underground testing of nuclear weapons and for evaluating the effects
of nuclear weapons on military communications systems, electronics, satellites, sensors, and other materials.
Since the signing of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1974, it has been the only site used by the United States for underground
nuclear weapons testing. In September 1992, Congress, within the framework of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, imposed
a nine-month moratorium on underground nuclear testing. President Clinton extended the moratorium in July 1993
for an additional 15 months and subsequently, in March 1994, extended the moratorium through September 1995.

Existing land use on the Nevada Test Site falls into four general categories: Testing Areas; Reserved Areas; Industrial/Research
Areas; and Waste Management Areas. Most of the work on the Nevada Test Site has been and continues to be related to national
defense, with a growing emphasis on environmental restoration and waste management programs. Changing world conditions
and national policies have reduced the need for testing programs, and other DOE and non-DOE activities are now being
considered for siting at the Nevada Test Site. A map showing existing land use at the Nevada Test Site and the locations
of the off-site tests is available on request to Donald R. Elle at the above address.

The Nevada Test Site is a unique facility. It is a large remote area with tightly controlled access, with a substantial
infrastructure, and the capability to conduct tests with hazardous and radioactive materials. The southwest region
of the Nevada Test Site provides support for nonweapons and nonnuclear weapons programs and for short term activities
such as the nuclear weapons accident exercises conducted by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. In 1993, DOE designated
the Nevada Test Site as a National Environmental Research Park. The Research Park is available for use by the scientific
community as an outdoor laboratory for research on the effects of human activities on the desert ecosystem. Land not
used for mission or other purposes has been designated as reserved areas, available for future development. The northern
part of the Nevada Test Site is reserved as an underground nuclear weapons testing area. Nuclear test locations are
at Yucca Flat, Pahute Mesa, Rainer Mesa, and Buckboard Mesa.

Waste management activities have been ongoing at the Nevada Test Site since 1952. For ease of identification, the
Nevada Test Site has been divided into numbered geographic ``Areas''. Waste Operations are conducted in several
areas. Sanitary and solid waste are disposed of in Areas 23 and 9. Hydrocarbon-contaminated soils are disposed of
in a permitted landfill in Area 6. Radioactive waste management sites are located in Areas 3 and 5. Area 5 is also the
location of a 90-day hazardous waste accumulation site. Waste streams continue to be generated, stored, and disposed
of at the Nevada Test Site. Radioactive wastes are also shipped to the Nevada Test Site for disposal from other Department
and Department-authorized sites. Waste management operations at Nevada Test Site include: Accumulation of hazardous
waste; disposal of low-level radioactive waste including some classified waste; management of mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste; storage of mixed transuranic waste; and disposal of sanitary waste.
