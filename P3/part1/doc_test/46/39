  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- China has staged another 
underground nuclear test despite repeated appeals on the part of 
several states, including Russia, a representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said here today. 
  "This event provokes deep Russian regret, the more so China 
did it at a time of the Geneva multilateral negotiations on 
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, which has been supported by 
all nuclear powers," says the statement received by ITAR-TASS. 
  "We are also alarmed with the fact further Chinese nuclear 
tests may endanger the observation of the nuclear tests 
moratorium by other nuclear powers. 
  "We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand 
its genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the 
international community and together with other nations help to 
achieve complete termination of underground nuclear tests and 
fulfilment of the Chinese-declared intention to conclude a 
treaty on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," says the document.
