China and the US have agreed to increase the frequency of their military
consultations in a further sign of improving relations.
The move follows the decision by President Bill Clinton earlier this year to
sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said in Beijing that the two sides
would enhance their military contacts in regular high-level briefings to
begin next month. The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with
the briefings. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr
Perry said. Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less
secretive.
The US has also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its
nuclear tests. The purpose has been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying
out tests. Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on
testing but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes
into effect in 1996.
Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the transfer of nuclear
technology. The US has long suspected Beijing of helping Pakistan to develop
a nuclear capability.
