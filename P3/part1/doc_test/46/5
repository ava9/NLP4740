China yesterday ignored appeals for a moratorium on nuclear testing and
strongly defended its second underground test in four months.
The Chinese insist that they lag well behind other nuclear powers in
testing. 'Among all the nuclear states, China has conducted the least
nuclear tests,' the foreign ministry said. China is believed to have
conducted 41 tests compared with 1,000 by the US.
Beijing said it remained committed to a comprehensive nuclear test ban
treaty by 1996 and repeated its proposals for treaties on the
'non-first-use' of nuclear weapons and the removal of threats of nuclear
attack against non-nuclear weapon states.
But western governments lodged protests over the test at the Lop Nor site in
far-western Xinjiang province. Britain 'regretted' the test and Australia
instructed its embassy in Beijing to 'convey its concerns'. Russia expressed
regret and concern and advised Beijing to rethink its policy. Mr Miguel
Marin-Bosch, chairman of the conference on disarmament committee on a
nuclear test ban said in Geneva the latest blast was 'not conducive' to
advancing the 39-nation negotiations.
The foreign ministry in Beijing said China would end its nuclear tests once
a comprehensive test ban treaty came into effect. 'China is actively
participating in the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
held in Geneva and hopes to see the conclusion of the treaty at the earliest
possible date or no later than 1996,' it said.
Australia's seismological centre in Canberra detected the test early
yesterday and said the detonation was consistent with a
medium-to-large-explosion. Yield was estimated at the equivalent of 40-150
kilotonnes of TNT.
China conducted its last test in June in spite of demands by the US and
Japan to refrain. Beijing has steadfastly refused to join a US-sponsored
two-year moratorium.
The foreign ministry official said China possessed a small quantity of
nuclear weapons 'solely for the purpose of self defence.' He urged nuclear
weapons states to agree to the destruction of all nuclear weapons soon.
In Canberra, Mr Gordon Bilney, Australia's acting foreign minister, said
China's continued testing was 'out of step with the positive atmosphere' of
negotiations on a comprehensive test ban.
'China must come to terms with the imminent fact of a ban on nuclear testing
for all time and in all environments,' Mr Bilney said.
