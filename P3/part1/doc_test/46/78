  [Text] Geneva February 2 TASS -- Now it is important to 
give a good and energetic start to the U.N. disarmament 
conference, which is encountering new difficult problems, above 
all, the task of working out an international treaty on a 
universal ban on nuclear tests, Russia's permanent 
representative in the conference Grigoriy Berdennikov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  Berdennikov noted Russia's principle readiness to go in for 
concluding at present such a treaty, which can be subjected to 
checking, and emphasised that Russia will construct its stand at 
the talks in such a way that they are mainly completed, possibly 
by the spring of 1995. 
  The Russian delegation attaches top priority to the nuclear 
test ban talks in 1994, Berdennikov said. According to him, the 
question of the scope of the treaty should be decided on the 
basis of already existing international accords, above all, the 
Moscow treaty of 1963, which bans nuclear tests in three 
mediums, of course, with the inclusion of a ban on underground 
tests. Russia advocates an unlimited and non-discriminatory 
character of the treaty and equal rights and responsibilities of 
all its participants, he said. 
  The agreement should apply not only to nuclear states, but 
also to those which are capable of making nuclear weapons. The 
treaty should come into force after the submission of 
ratification deeds, provided they include deeds of all states, 
which possess nuclear power plants and research reactors at the 
time of signing the document. There is a need to impose the 
strictest sanctions on participating countries which violate its 
main statutes, right up to imposing economic or other measures 
of compulsions stipulated by the UN Charter. 
  The delegation also favours working out a multilateral 
agreement on guarantees of the security of non-nuclear states.
