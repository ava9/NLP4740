  [Text] Will China's recent underground nuclear explosion 
not encourage Russia and the United States to carry out new 
nuclear tests? 
  [Signed] S. Boychenko, Lipetsk 
  The underground test in the PRC of a nuclear explosive 
device 
with a yield of 80-90 kilotonnes carried out 5 October last year 
has indeed complicated the situation. So far the leading 
nuclear powers have abided by their voluntary unilateral 
commitments to refrain from such actions ideally until the 
signing in 1996 of an agreement on a complete ban on underground 
nuclear explosions. Tests in the atmosphere, in space, and under 
water were banned earlier by the international treaty of 1963. 
  However, the members of the "nuclear club" decided not to 
follow China's example and will continue to observe the 
moratorium on underground explosions although both Russia and 
the United States proclaimed a little over four months ago their 
readiness not to hold such tests only so long as the other great 
powers refrained from them. So far only the leadership of 
France has expressed the theoretical possibility of staging a 
series of tests in the period up to 1996. 
  As of now the nuclear powers have officially given notice of 
2,166 nuclear test explosions (954 by the United States, 936 by 
the USSR, 192 by France, 44 by Britain, 39 by China, and one by 
India). Of that number the 1,641th nuclear device has now been 
detonated underground at the test sites shown on the attached 
map. [Note: A map accompanies the article showing test sites at 
Nevada, Mururoa, Novaya Zemlya, Semipalatinsk, Lopnor, and the 
Tar desert] 
  As far as is known, neither Russia nor Britain intends to 
detonate even those test charges that they have stored in 
underground galleries: In Russia's case at the test site in 
Semipalatinsk, in Britain's at the U.S. site in Nevada. So let 
us hope that 1994 becomes nuclear-free at least on the territory 
of the main nuclear countries.
