  [Text] A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement says China 
conducted an underground nuclear test on Friday [10 June]. 
  The statement says China believes in a complete prohibition 
and elimination of nuclear weapons, as well as a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban. 
  The Foreign Ministry says China has exercised great 
restraint 
in conducting nuclear tests over the years. 
  The statement says China fully respects and understands the 
position and concern of many non-nuclear weapon states on the 
question of nuclear testing. 
  Right now, China is actively participating in negotiations 
on 
a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement says China calls on other 
nuclear weapon states to stop the policy of nuclear deterrence 
and commit themselves to the prohibition and destruction of 
nuclear weapons.
