While delegates in Cairo wrangle over ways to deal with the world population
explosion, another international conference, no less crucial to the future
of the planet, is being prepared in Geneva: on extending the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
The success or failure of such conferences depends in large measure on work
done beforehand. Today's meeting of the preparatory committee for the NPT
conference should begin to 'discuss seriously the agenda and content',
according to a report just published by a group of specialised arms control
think-tanks*. This means the bargaining positions of the main parties,
nuclear and non-nuclear, should for the first time be clearly staked out.
The conference, to be held in New York next spring, is prescribed by the NPT
itself: it has to decide whether the treaty should 'continue in force
indefinitely, or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or
periods'. The treaty, signed in 1968, divides the world into nuclear-weapon
and non-nuclear-weapon states, the former being those which had exploded a
nuclear device before 1967. By that definition there were five
nuclear-weapon states - the US, Soviet Union, UK, France and China - and the
NPT aim was to freeze them at that number. Many non-nuclear states would
have liked to abolish nuclear weapons altogether, but had to content
themselves with a pledge to 'pursue negotiations in good faith on effective
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and
to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control'.
One thing the signatories could not agree on was how long the treaty should
remain in force. The nuclear powers wanted an indefinite treaty, while some
of the non-nuclear wanted to keep a nuclear option open for themselves in
case the treaty failed. So they left the matter to be decided at next year's
conference, held when the treaty will have been in force for 25 years.
The decision on extending the treaty must be taken by a majority of the
parties, which on the latest count means at least 83 states. Most
governments would prefer a decision taken by consensus, which would carry
greater political weight. But few would want the treaty to lapse just
because one or two states (such as Iraq or North Korea) refused to go along.
So western governments are keeping open the option of a vote, to ensure that
the conference reaches a decision.
Many governments, including four of the five official nuclear powers, Nato,
Japan and nearly all European states, favour indefinite, unconditional
extension. China is thought to favour indefinite extension on certain
conditions. Only Iran, so far, has come out clearly against an indefinite
extension; but it is not alone among third-world states in thinking that
extension for fixed periods would keep the nuclear powers under greater
pressure to move towards disarmament. How exactly this would work is not
clear, but it could mean the present exercise being repeated at regular
intervals, perhaps every 25 years.
Amendment of the treaty, everyone agrees, would be impossible, because the
procedure is too complex. Nor is there any chance of it being scrapped and
replaced by a new treaty - for instance, one with tougher and more binding
obligations on the nuclear powers - before next spring, or any time soon.
The existing treaty now has 164 signatories. No new one could quickly gain
anything like such wide support.
Many non-specialists believe that the NPT has failed, or was useful only in
cold war conditions; that proliferation in the real world is rampant; and
that extending the treaty amounts to little more than 'shutting the stable
after the horse has bolted'. But such views are not shared by experts such
as John Simpson, head of the non-proliferation programme at Southampton
University. He points out that the world of 20 or more nuclear powers which
seemed imminent in the 1960s is still far off; and that in several respects
the situation has lately improved.
Until 1990, he says, six countries which had not signed the NPT were
'threshold' or 'suspect' states, assumed either to have a nuclear weapon or
to be actively developing one. That list has now shrunk to three: South
Africa has scrapped its nuclear programme and joined the NPT as a
non-nuclear weapon state; while Argentina and Brazil have signed bilateral
non-proliferation agreements and joined the regional Tlatelolco treaty,
which makes all Latin America and the Caribbean a nuclear weapon-free zone.
And Algeria, potentially a seventh 'suspect', has promised to join the NPT
and accepted a safeguard agreement for its nuclear reactor.
That leaves India, Pakistan and Israel. The India-Pakistan relationship
remains tense, and this may be the region where the danger of nuclear war is
greatest. But from a proliferation point of view the two states form a
stable sub-system, with no other state in the region aspiring to emulate
them. Israel's de facto nuclear status is more dangerous to the NPT regime,
because of the asymmetry between it and the Arab states. Many Arabs cite
this as a reason for not ratifying the convention banning chemical weapons;
and they may refuse to support NPT extension unless the US presses Israel to
denuclearise.
Meanwhile the dissolution of the Soviet Union has confronted the NPT with a
new problem: the division of one nuclear-weapon state into several, all of
which could have claimed to inherit that status. An international consensus
was swiftly reached that only Russia should be allowed to do so.
All tactical nuclear weapons have been transferred to Russia from other
ex-Soviet republics, as have strategic weapons from Belarus and Kazakhstan,
which have joined the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. Ukraine has agreed
in principle to do the same, but has not yet done so. For the time being,
strategic weapons remain on its territory, but they are being shipped out
and, in any case, Ukraine could not target or fire them without Russian
co-operation. Ukraine has also agreed to an audit of all nuclear materials
on its territory by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the body
charged under the treaty with verifying non-nuclear states' compliance.
Proliferation within the former Soviet Union is now overshadowed by anxiety
over the smuggling of plutonium and other nuclear materials from there to
would-be proliferators elsewhere, as exposed by the recent interception of
Russian plutonium shipments in Germany.
Meanwhile, France and China - the two acknowledged nuclear powers which
rejected the NPT in the 1960s - have acceded to it. Even Israel, India and
Pakistan, which have not signed, pay the treaty a back-handed compliment by
not declaring themselves nuclear powers (though last month Nawaz Sharif,
former prime minister of Pakistan, embarrassed his successor by stating
publicly that Pakistan does have a nuclear weapon). The NPT has made
non-proliferation a universally respected norm.
But is it respected in word only? The scope of Iraq's weapons programme,
revealed after the Gulf war in 1991, shook many people's confidence. Iraq
was the first of a new category of NPT 'renegades': a long-standing
signatory of the treaty, it had allowed the IAEA to monitor its use of
imported nuclear fuel. Yet neither the IAEA nor any national intelligence
service detected its clandestine weapons programme. This discovery prompted
nuclear suppliers to tighten their export restrictions, and to insist on
much more intrusive IAEA inspections - though so far they have not endowed
the IAEA with resources to match.
The IAEA can monitor compliance, but only the UN Security Council, on whose
order Iraq has now been disarmed, has the power and authority to enforce
compliance: a distinction highlighted by the next 'renegade', North Korea.
Here the IAEA did its job well, in that North Korea could only conceal what
it was doing by refusing co-operation with IAEA inspectors. But the UN's
ability or willingness to do anything about it is more doubtful.
Perhaps the fear of UN sanctions helped change the late Kim Il-sung's
attitude in June, when he suddenly agreed to 'freeze' nuclear activity
during new high-level talks with US officials. But it is not yet clear how
far this presages a real change in North Korean behaviour. And it is far
from clear that sanctions would have worked, or even have been applied.
China, which is North Korea's main trading partner, might well have vetoed,
or simply ignored, them.
Iraq was disarmed after military defeat. Theoretically, military action
could be taken against North Korea, but it would be extremely risky.
Probably, if North Korea remained recalcitrant, the world would have to
settle for isolating it as far as possible, while trying to block any
further proliferation from it to other potential renegades, such as Iran.
Iran's case further illustrates the difficulty of seeking to prevent
proliferation purely by restricting supply. Iran fulfils all its NPT
obligations and yet, because nuclear suppliers are suspicious of its
intentions, does not get the free access to peaceful nuclear energy it is
entitled to under the treaty. This strengthens many third-world states'
belief that the nuclear powers have not fulfilled their side of the bargain.
Most non-nuclear states did not sign the treaty as a favour to the nuclear
powers, but to enhance their own security. The treaty's main function is to
reduce demand for nuclear weapons, by relieving each non-nuclear state of
the fear that its potential adversaries will get them first. But this will
not stave off proliferation indefinitely, unless nuclear powers do more to
improve the security of non-nuclear ones - or so at least the latter argue.
There are three kinds of thing they can do:
'Positive assurances': pledges to come to the aid of non-nuclear states if
nuclear weapons are used or threatened against them. In 1968 the UK, US and
Soviet Union gave such a pledge in a United Nations Security Council
resolution. But such broad pledges are not very credible. 'Negative security
assurances': promises that they themselves will not use or threaten nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear states. These were only available in heavily
qualified form during the cold war, because both sides reserved the right to
use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances against each other's allies.
But they may now be willing to go further. Last week Iran and 10 other
states tabled a proposal for a protocol on security assurances to be added
to the NPT.
Progress towards general nuclear disarmament, as promised in the treaty.
Many non-nuclear states have decided to judge the nuclear powers' good faith
by their willingness to negotiate a worldwide ban on nuclear tests.
The last conference to review implementation of the NPT, in 1990, broke up
without agreement because the US and UK refused to commit themselves to such
a ban. Since then, there has been spectacular progress towards disarmament
in the form of reductions in the US and Russian nuclear arsenals; France and
China have adhered to the NPT; and the Clinton administration, followed by a
reluctant UK, has come out for a comprehensive test ban. Negotiations on
this began in January, but progress has been slow, mainly because the UK,
France and China are dragging their feet. A draft text was agreed last week,
two months later than most delegates had hoped, and further talks are to be
held at the end of the year. But the prospect of agreeing a test ban treaty
by next April, when the NPT conference meets, is now thought remote.
The nuclear powers, especially the western ones, are still prone to assume
that the NPT's benefits are self-evident. They have perhaps not taken the
full measure of third-world states' impatience with the post-cold war world
order, and the need to convince them that general disarmament is a genuine,
if still a distant, goal.
