  [Text] Geneva, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the floor of the 
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva today, Hou Zhitong, head of 
the Chinese delegation, reiterated the Chinese Government's 
stand and views on nuclear disarmament, nuclear test ban, and 
other issues. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: China has never shirked its 
responsibility for promoting nuclear disarmament. China has 
always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons. Since the first day when it came 
into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has 
solemnly declared to the world its commitment of not being the 
first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any 
circumstances. It has also undertaken not to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-free zones. 
  He said: In order to promote the process of nuclear 
disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the 
Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. On 
December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally proposed 
to the United States, the Russian Federation, and other nuclear 
weapon states that negotiations be started among the five 
nuclear weapon states to conclude a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use 
of Nuclear Weapons." In early March this year, China again 
urged the four other nuclear states to give a positive response 
to China's initiative, and asked them to send delegations for 
talks in Beijing. It is the view of the Chinese Government that 
under the present international situation, the condition is ripe 
for the five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude 
such an international treaty. The Chinese Government believes 
the conclusion of this treaty will significantly reduce the risk 
of nuclear war and provide security to the five nuclear weapon 
states, especially the small and medium-sized ones among them. 
It will also improve mutual trust and contribute to the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. Such a treaty will also 
play an important role in realizing a comprehensive nuclear test 
ban and promoting nuclear disarmament. 
  Hou Zhitong expressed the hope that countries concerned will 
respond positively to China's initiative and start negotiations 
with a view to concluding a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use of 
Nuclear Weapons" as soon as possible. After that, they should 
go one step further by negotiating and concluding an 
international treaty on not using or threatening to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, so as to make a decisive contribution to freeing mankind 
from the threat of nuclear war. 
  On the issue of a nuclear test moratorium, Hou Zhitong said: 
China has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing 
and the number of the nuclear tests it has conducted is 
extremely limited. China has the lowest number of nuclear tests 
among all nuclear powers. China believes that an early 
conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty [CTBT] will 
contribute to the realization of the objective of complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In 
view of the above-mentioned considerations, the Chinese 
Government issued a statement on 5 October last year in support 
of an early conclusion of a CTBT, saying it will join other 
countries in the negotiations in an effort to conclude such a 
treaty no later than 1996. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: It is our opinion that an 
appropriate solution of the issue of security guarantees to the 
signatory states ought to be one of the tasks in the CTBT 
negotiation. The treaty should contain provisions for the 
signatory states with nuclear weapons to undertake not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against signatory states which 
do not possess nuclear weapons. At the same time, it should 
also provide for the signatory states with nuclear weapons to 
undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against 
each other. With all nuclear weapon states undertaking the 
above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of the 
CTBT, further the treaty's universality, and constitute a major 
contribution to international peace and security.
