  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 27 April TASS -- China may stop 
nuclear weapon tests by 1996, visiting State Council Premier Li 
Peng told a news conference in the Kazakh capital of Alma-Ata on 
Wednesday. 
  The Chinese leader said his country was now taking an active 
part in the Geneva talks on armaments control. At present, 
Russia, the United States, Great Britain and France, which are 
also parties to these talks, have suspended nuclear tests. 
  The latest regular nuclear test was performed in China last 
October, after which a rise in background radiation was 
registered in Kazakh areas bordering on China.
