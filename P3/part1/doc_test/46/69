  [Text] United Nations April 26 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin reaffirmed Russia's adherence to continue the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, General Secretary of the Geneva Disarmament 
Conference Vladimir Petrovskiy said at a press conference held 
at the UN Headquarters today. 
  ``During talks with the UN secretary-general at the 
beginning 
of April, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed Russia's 
adherence to continue the moratorium on nuclear tests which was 
initially declared by ex-Soviet president Gorbachev,'' 
Petrovskiy said. 
  Petrovskiy noted that similar steps taken by other nuclear 
states would considerably help the multilateral talks on 
concluding a universal nuclear test ban treaty, now underway in 
Geneva. He called ``realistic'' the conclusion of such a treaty 
by the end of 1996. He said that a draft treaty will be 
presented for consideration in June this year. 
  In this context, he said that participants in the 
disarmament 
conference welcome the decision adopted by the United States in 
March to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until September, 
1995 as an ``important contribution to the cration of a 
favourable climate for talks.'' ``It is important to acknowledge 
that for the first time not only the U.S., Russia and Great 
Britain, but France and China are also now taking part in the 
talks, which directly affect their nuclear interests,'' 
Petrovskiy noted.
