  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan called for China's 
continued cooperation in solving the problems of North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Wednesday. 
  In diplomatic consultations held at the Foreign Ministry, 
Japanese officials told a Chinese delegation that China's role 
is important in solving the problem, the officials said. 
  Beijing supports the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula 
and considers peace and stability on the peninsula important, 
the Chinese side was quoted as saying. 
  They also told the Japanese side that now is the time for a 
"calm and constructive" approach by all concerned parties. 
  China wants talks to be held between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and between 
Washington and Pyongyang, the Chinese diplomats said. 
  Japanese diplomatic officials voiced deep concern over North 
Korea's unmonitored removal of fuel rods from its nuclear 
reactor in Yongbyon, and said North Korea's alleged nuclear 
development concerns the future of the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) system, the officials said. 
  The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement 
Monday "strongly" urging North Korea to cooperate in pulling 
spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA inspectors can 
determine if any material has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  The ministry officials declined to elaborate on the contents 
of Wednesday's consultations with China, saying they were not 
"negotiations." 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda led the Japanese 
delegation at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry, while 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan headed the Chinese 
side. 
  Japan and China have been holding diplomatic talks since 
1980. The previous meeting was held in Beijing in March 1992. 
  Also during the talks, the Japanese side referred to 
comments 
by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying Japan's 
aggression during World War II and the 1937 Nanjing massacre, 
and vowed to make continued efforts to develop bilateral 
relations with China based on remorse for the past, the 
officials said. 
  The Chinese side said China's basic stance is to develop 
relations with Japan by not forgetting the past but by learning 
from it and by looking toward the future. 
  Correctly dealing with the two nations' past is also an 
important political base for promoting bilateral ties, Chinese 
officials were quoted as saying. 
  Japan urged China to refrain from conducting underground 
nuclear tests and expressed hope that Beijing would participate 
in negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty in Geneva, 
they said. 
  China replied that it is participating in the negotiations, 
and reiterated that it supports complete abolition of nuclear 
weapons and conducts fewer tests than other nuclear powers, they 
said. 
  Tokyo also asked for Chinese support in its bid to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  The Chinese side replied that the reorganization of the 
council should be dealt with according to consensus and the 
principles of balance, adding that it would consider Japan's bid 
on this basis, they said.
