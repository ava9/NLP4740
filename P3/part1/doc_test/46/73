PRESIDENT George Bush is likely to sign into law a nine-month moratorium on
US nuclear testing and a 1996 halt to the testing, congressional and
administration sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
But Mr Bush is likely to sign that law with a clear understanding that he
will try to revise it later to allow US nuclear testing beyond 1996, the
sources said.
They said congressional Democrats manoeuvred him into accepting the nuclear
test ban by attaching it to a Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.8bn) energy
appropriation bill funding a huge supercollider scientific project in Texas
that Mr Bush wants.
He could not veto the test ban without also vetoing Dollars 517m in the bill
to continue construction of the supercollider.
Congress approved the bill with the nuclear test ban and sent it to Mr Bush
on Thursday night.
The House approved it 224-151 and the Senate approved it by voice vote.
It would suspend US nuclear testing for the nine months ending July 1 1993,
and then halt all testing by September 30 1996, unless any other country
conducted a nuclear test after that.
Between those two periods 15 US tests would be allowed to assure that new
safety devices on nuclear weapons work.
Though the nine-month moratorium would begin next Thursday, October 1, Mr
Bush would have years if he is re-elected president to try to get Congress
to soften the 1996 US test halt and allow testing after that.
Supporters of the test ban said it was needed to win an international
nuclear test ban preventing any further nuclear weapons development around
the world.
