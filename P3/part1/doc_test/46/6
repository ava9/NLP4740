  [Text] According to a report from XINHUA News Agency, 
China conducted an underground nuclear test on the morning of 10 
June. While making an announcement on this, the spokesman of the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China will completely ban and 
thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons, and that in this connection, 
it consistently supports the realization of a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban. 
  He said that stemming from this fundamental position, China 
has been manifesting great self-restraint from the beginning in 
conducting nuclear tests, and that the number of nuclear tests 
conducted by China is very limited. 
  He said that China completely respects and understands the 
position and worry of many nonnuclear countries in connection 
with the issue of nuclear tests. The spokesman said that 
currently China is actively taking part in the negotiations on 
the comprehensive test ban treaty, and through this kind of 
negotiations, China supports the conclusion of such a treaty 
before 1996. He said that such a treaty must be a measure for a 
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  He said that China demands that other countries that possess 
nuclear weapons must give up their policy on restraining nuclear 
weapons and clearly promise the complete prohibition and 
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The spokesman said 
that to quickly realize this ultimate goal, China is willing to 
continue to persistently make efforts with the international 
community.
