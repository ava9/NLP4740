  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa urged Chinese President and Communist Party 
leader Jiang Zemin on Sunday [20 March] not to conduct nuclear 
tests, Japanese officials said. 
  During an hourlong meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa called for 
China's active participation in the negotiations on an 
international treaty designed to impose a comprehensive ban on 
nuclear tests. 
  There was no immediate response from Jiang, however, the 
officials said. 
  Prior to the meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa talked with 
Premier 
Li Peng and voiced grave concern over recent situations 
surrounding North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. 
  Also during the meeting with the president, Hosokawa 
reiterated his remarks on Japan's wartime responsibilities, 
referring to his policy speech made in August which expressed 
"deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese 
actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused 
unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." 
  Jiang told Hosokawa Japan and China should look at their 
bilateral relations from a long-term perspective. 
  The president was quoted as saying the two nations have 
common points and the two sides are "partners, not rivals," 
despite differences in the social system between Japan's 
capitalism and China's socialism. 
  Hosokawa is currently on a three-day visit to China 
beginning 
Saturday. 
  Jiang referred to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to China earlier this month and said he told 
Christopher that "fighting is the beginning of becoming friends." 
  If the two sides engage in patient negotiations and confide 
in each other instead of resorting to pressure, the negotiations 
would be successful, Jiang was quoted as saying. 
  The Chinese president also said the U.S. extension of most- 
favored-nation (MFN) trade status to China will be mutually 
beneficial. 
  Washington has linked MFN extension to improvement in 
China's 
human rights record. China refuses any such linkage. 
  Jiang also told Hosokawa that patience is necessary to solve 
the problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. 
  Jiang said he realizes there are expectations for China in 
helping solve the issue but that it is necessary to engage in 
"patient and fair" negotiations. 
  Jiang also brought up defense matters and said China's 
military facilities are for defense purposes and will not be 
used for aggression. 
  At the end of the meeting, Hosokawa extended an invitation 
for Jiang to visit Japan again, officials said. Jiang visited 
Japan in 1992.
