WHEN China detonated a nuclear device underground at its Lop Nor test site
last week, it seemed more like a riposte to a world that had not been all
that kind to it recently than a blast in the interests of national defence.
In Beijing, where the mood is decidedly less buoyant than before China's
crushing disappointment over its loss of the Olympics to Sydney, it is
possible to detect a sourness towards the outside world: although Chinese
officials are careful to avoid suggestions they have been bad losers.
The harder edge to Chinese policy statements was apparent in an address by
Premier Li Peng on the eve of the October 1 anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic. 'We are firmly opposed to all acts of interference in
China's internal affairs and acts of violating China's sovereignty and will
absolutely not accept them,' Mr Li said.
While they might not say so publicly, there is no doubt officials apportion
a good deal of blame to human rights campaigners in the west for the
Olympics loss.
Beijing is finding that constructive engagement with the outside world is
not a simple thing, and brings with it pressures that could be ignored, or
at least shrugged off, in the past. Now, it is not so easy, if China wants
to continue to reap the benefits of its increasing interdependence with the
world economy.
The nuclear test in many ways encapsulates the problem, with Chinese
officials claiming Beijing was being subjected to 'double standards' by an
international community whose mission was to keep China weak. The US, as
officials point out, has conducted 25 times the number of China's nuclear
tests.
'The Chinese Government has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear
testing and the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely
limited,' an official statement said. Chinese officials also charge that the
west has a vested interested in applying a moratorium on nuclear testing,
since this would preserve its advantage in the nuclear arms race.
China exhibits similar irritation when an issue is made of its weapons
sales, arguing its involvement in the arms business is dwarfed by that of
the US as the world's biggest supplier of weapons. This was the theme of
Beijing's reaction in August to Washington's announcement that it was
imposing sanctions on the export of high-technology items in protest at
Chinese missile sales to Pakistan.
'The US', a Chinese official charged, 'has poured large amounts of advanced
weapons into the region sensitive to China, threatening its security, and
made groundless accusations against it.'
Western officials in Beijing have been monitoring carefully Chinese actions
in the wake of the Olympics vote for signs of a hardening of attitudes.
Indications that Beijing may again be stiffening its campaign against
Governor Chris Patten's proposals for extending democracy in Hong Kong
before China's 1997 takeover are being cited as evidence of Olympic fallout.
Publication on the front pages of Chinese newspapers the day after the
Olympics vote of an 11-year-old directive from Deng Xiaoping, China's
paramount leader, threatening to seize Hong Kong before 1997 if
circumstances deteriorated there, is seen as one of the more conspicuous
examples of Chinese pique.
Domestically, a wave of executions of criminals and the sentencing to death
of officials convicted of so-called economic crimes are also being portrayed
as a sign of a more uncompromising leadership. But what is almost certainly
true is that China's feelings have been bruised, and its responses to real
or imagined slights by the international community are likely to be sharper
in the months ahead.
