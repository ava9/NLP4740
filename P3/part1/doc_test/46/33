proliferation expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for 
Strategic Studies: "A Chinese Slap in the Face of the Clinton 
Administration"] 
  [Text] Ten days ago the PRC conducted a nuclear test at 
the Lop Nor testing facility in northwest China. This was the 
second test conducted by the PRC in less than a year. The 
Chinese test was a slap in the face of President Clinton, who 
only recently retracted his resolute demands from the Chinese 
leaders with regard to arms exports and human rights. 
  The slap in the face is particularly stinging at this point 
in time when the United States is worried about North Korea 
developing a bomb, seeing that without the PRC's agreement and 
assistance it will be impossible to enforce any sanctions 
against North Korea and that nobody knows how to pressure North 
Korea to terminate its nuclear program except through sanctions. 
  The Chinese test is particularly hurtful because preventing 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a cornerstone of the 
Clinton Administration's foreign policy. An integral part of 
this policy is the moratorium on nuclear tests and the efforts 
to bring about the signing of an international pact banning such 
tests in 1996. 
  The moratorium began back in November 1992, when the U.S. 
Congress forced a nine-month ban on nuclear tests on President 
Bush's administration. After those nine months, Congress 
permitted only 15 such tests to be conducted until 1996 and 
banned nuclear tests altogether afterward. It was President 
Bush who signed the ban, known as the "Hatfield Amendment." In 
January 1993, the ball was passed to Clinton, who initially 
extended it until September 1994. 
  The moratorium on nuclear testing was accompanied by a 
poignant argument between Congress and the U.S. military 
establishment. The argument used by advocates of nuclear 
testing was the need to maintain the high level of expertise for 
laboratory workers and arms developers. As for the tests 
themselves, it was decided to conduct three tests to check the 
reliability of the weapons and nine tests to increase the safety 
of existing weapons. Another proposal was a compromise to 
satisfy all sides and limited the tests to "small bombs" not 
exceeding one kiloton. 
  However, the opponents ultimately had the upper hand. They 
saw the ban as a trump card in the struggle to prevent the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. What the 
opponents saw was "deranged" countries, which at present include 
Iran and North Korea, with Pakistan, India, and Israel as 
potential candidates. Another reason for the ban was the 
ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
scheduled to expire in 1995, at which point the countries will 
meet to discuss its extension and perhaps even to change some of 
its clauses. Tests would put the "nuclear" countries in an 
awkward position when urging other countries to evince restraint. 
  However, for the ban to have the desired effect all the 
nuclear countries have to maintain a united front. Such a front 
existed until the Chinese test last October. With Russia the 
problem is negligible: what could not be achieved in the days 
of the Soviet Union, can easily be attained from Yeltsin, who 
desperately needs all the U.S. support he can get. 
  With Britain the problem is even easier. Although the 
British nuclear establishment wants to go on with the tests and 
the Tory government supports it, the British have a "tiny" 
technical problem: they test their bombs in Nevada, and without 
U.S. permission they can hold no tests. Hence, a problem 
remains with the two "enfants terribles": France and China. 
France has for some time adopted an independent policy, 
inconsiderate of its allies' opinion (not to mention public 
opinion). 
  In spite of all the threats, the Chinese test last October 
did not upset the moratorium and Russia and France did not hold 
any further tests. However, there is no certainty that what 
happened eight months ago will recur today. The global 
moratorium remains a house of cards built on the principle of 
"not-the-first-to-test." Back when the moratorium was extended, 
Clinton ordered the labs "to maintain the ability to resume the 
testing." Yeltsin also ordered his labs to prepare two to four 
nuclear tests, and in recent months Russia has been leaning 
toward an independent policy unconnected to the United States. 
In France, Mitterrand will have a harder time resisting the 
pressure of the Army and the right-wing government to resume the 
tests. 
  The ball is now in Clinton's court. Adherence to the 
moratorium will enable him to come to the NPT deliberations next 
year with a clean record. Pressure on Russia may make Yeltsin 
rein in his nuclear establishment despite his indebtedness to 
the Army and his desperate need to keep employed those nuclear 
scientists who have not yet emigrated, and may also help keep 
France in line. Permission to resume the tests will undoubtedly 
enable the British to test their bombs. France will waste no 
time joining the party, and the price will be paid by the whole 
world in 1995.
