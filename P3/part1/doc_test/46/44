  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Seismologists and 
diplomats from 23 countries met in Tokyo on Monday [14 March] to 
discuss problems involved in monitoring underground nuclear 
tests, a central theme of the Comprehensive Test Ban (CTB) 
treaty now under negotiation, Foreign Ministry officials said 
Monday. 
  Thirty-six seismologists and diplomats in charge of the CTB 
negotiations from such nations as Australia, China, France, 
India, Russia and the United States gathered for an unofficial 
meeting at the ministry, the officials said. 
  The participants mainly discussed seismological methods of 
detecting nuclear tests, including their effectiveness, cost and 
operation, they said. 
  Since it was the first time seismologists and CTB 
negotiators 
have held such a meeting, the two sides exchanged general views 
and did not attempt to reach a particular agreement, they said. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the seismologists will visit the 
Meteorological Agency to study Japanese systems to monitor 
earthquakes, they said. 
  Nuclear tests have been conducted only underground since 
1984, based on the 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty. 
  Artificial earthquakes caused by nuclear explosions are 
registered at seismological observatories in each country. 
  Scientific experts set up a group in 1976 to discuss ways to 
create a system to monitor nuclear tests using seismological 
methods.
