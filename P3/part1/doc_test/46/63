  [Text] Geneva, 19 May -- During a working group session of 
the Geneva disarmament conference on 19 May, under which 
negotiations on concluding a treaty on comprehensive test ban 
are in progress, the Japanese Government presented a proposal 
that will be the basis for the draft accord. The proposal 
incorporates a nuclear inspection system consisting of the three 
on-site inspection methods -- seismological inspection method, a 
method to inspect radioactive fallout, and an international 
inspection method -- as means to inspect nuclear tests conducted 
secretly. 
  At the working session, Yoshitomo Tanaka, ambassador 
accredited to the Geneva disarmament conference, announced for 
the first time that a comprehensive inspection system should be 
established after coordinating and incorporating each nation's 
own inspection methods into Japan-proposed system. He then 
asked the member nations to conclude negotiations by the time 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is extended next April.
