  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will urge Chinese leaders during his upcoming visit to 
Beijing to agree to a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing, 
Foreign Ministry sources said Wednesday [5 January]. The 
sources said Hata will make the call in his talks on Saturday 
with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. They said Japan 
wants China to "positively engage" in negotiations expected to 
get under way this year in Geneva on a comprehensive global ban 
on nuclear testing. 
  Despite Qian's call at the UN General Assembly in September 
for early test ban talks, China on October 5 conducted an 
underground nuclear test that threatened to unravel a fragile 
moratorium on testing by other nuclear powers. 
  Critics said China's move also undermined efforts for a 
renewal this year of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as 
nuclear powers could be seen as practicing a double standard by 
calling for nonproliferation while continuing nuclear tests. 
China subsequently pledged, however, to work with other 
countries to achieve a test ban treaty "no later than 1996." 
  Hata would also convey Japan's support for China's early 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
the sources said.
