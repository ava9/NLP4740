  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang quipped this afternoon in 
reference to the DPRK's nuclear issue: "Lest we have a war on 
our lap even before there is an atomic bomb." 
  Shen stated here at the routine news briefing that in 
principle, China is against the involvement of the UN Security 
Council in the DPRK's nuclear issue and the means of sanctions. 
He held that even now there remain both room and possibilities 
for properly solving the DPRK's nuclear issue. As long as the 
concerned four corners and three sides give 100 percent of what 
they have, they still can promote peace, stability, and 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Shen 
said that it is to this goal that China is directing its efforts. 
  As quite a number of reporters had asked him about the 
possibility of the outbreak of war, Shen Guofang stressed more 
than once that right now he hopes that instead of talking about 
war, people should talk about how to solve the problem. So far, 
there is no evidence indicating that the DPRK has a nuclear 
arsenal. "Lest we have a war on our lap even before there is an 
atomic bomb." "No side wishes to see the outbreak of war, which 
would be highly unfavorable for Northeast Asia." 
  Shen Guofang said that the channel between the United States 
and the DPRK remains open and he hopes for "reopening the 
dialogue." 
  On China's recent nuclear test, Shen Guofang said: China has 
always been restrained in nuclear testing and is the country to 
conduct the fewest nuclear tests among the nuclear powers. 
Equally, China hopes to see a total ban on nuclear testing and 
to participate in talks related to the subject. Shen believes 
that the first step toward global denuclearization is that 
nuclear powers do not threaten to launch preemptive strikes.
