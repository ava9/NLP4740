  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japan has urged China not to 
conduct nuclear tests, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said 
Monday [2 May]. 
  Saito told a press conference Japan filed the request with 
the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese Embassy in Beijing 
also made the same request to the Chinese Government. 
  Japan has obtained information that China may soon conduct a 
test, he said. 
  China reiterated its position that it supports complete 
abolishment of nuclear weapons and that the number of China's 
nuclear tests are far fewer than that of other nuclear powers, 
Saito said.
