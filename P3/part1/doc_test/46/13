  [By reporter Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450]) 
  [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Ambassador to the UN Disarmament Commission Hou Zhitong pointed 
out in his speech on 19 April that the time is quite ripe for 
China, the United States, Britain, France, and Russia to sign a 
treaty undertaking not to threaten the use of, or to use, 
nuclear arms against non-nuclear-weapon states and not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against each other under any 
circumstances. 
  Hou Zhitong said: This treaty, when reached among the five 
countries during their negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear 
test-ban treaty, will greatly reduce the risk of a nuclear war, 
enhance their security, and create a favorable condition for 
achieving comprehensive nuclear test ban and advance the nuclear 
disarmament process. 
  He said: China's proposal has received Russia's support. 
China hopes that the United States, Britain, and France will 
also respond to it in a positive way so that negotiations can 
begin at an early date to conclude this treaty. 
  Hou Zhitong also explained China's position and views "on 
the 
role of science and technology in international security, 
disarmament, and other relevant fields" as well as on 
"international arms transfer." He said: Currently, a number of 
countries have indicated that they would liberalize export 
control of relevant semi-finished materials and technologies. 
At the same time, there are countries considering the 
establishment of new export control regime. Nuclear 
nonproliferation should not hinder international scientific and 
technological cooperation, much less be used by a few countries 
as an excuse for blocking a large number of developing countries 
from obtaining and developing science and technology for 
peaceful purpose. 
  He also pointed out: China has always opposed unrestricted 
international arms transfers. As is known to all, the key to 
solving the problem of unrestricted arms transfers lay in the 
political will of a few countries which have the most advanced 
industries and most arms exports.
