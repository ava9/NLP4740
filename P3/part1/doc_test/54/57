<P>
In the spring of 1945, Arthur Rudolph had the Right Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
One of Nazi Germany's foremost rocket scientists, Rudolph was boosted out of 
the rubble of the Third Reich by an American government eager to add to the 
arsenal of democracy, and to keep the likes of Rudolph away from the Soviets. 
The U.S. Army brought him to America, cleared him for secret research and 
development work on the Pershing missile, and later, after the establishment of 
NASA, moved him to the space program. 
</P>
<P>
At NASA, Rudolph more than proved himself to his new patrons. When Neil 
Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr. landed on the moon in 1969, their ascent through 
space was powered by a rocket that Rudolph had built, the Saturn V. Three 
American Presidents shook Rudolph's hand over the course of his career. The 
Army and NASA each gave him their highest civilian awards. And in Huntsville, 
Ala., which is to rocketry what Detroit is to the auto industry, Rudolph 
retired a respected, pillar-of-the community type. 
</P>
<P>
So when does the Right Stuff become the Wrong Stuff? When it's preceded by the 
Reich Stuff, in the eyes of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a special Nazi-hunting unit of Justice, the Office of Special 
Investigations, caught up with Arthur Rudolph in San Jose, where he had moved 
with his wife, Martha. The OSI men interviewed Rudolph, then told him they had 
evidence linking him with thousands of deaths in wartime Germany. 
</P>
<P>
No, Rudolph hadn't tortured prisoners or conducted gruesome experiments on 
defenseless human beings, the OSI men said, but he had overseen the production 
line at a Wehrmacht rocket factory that relied on concentration-camp inmates 
for labor. Thousands of workers had died of hunger and exhaustion there. The 
OSI men said it was naive to think that Rudolph hadn't known about the deaths, 
or been unable to do something to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, fearing a war-crimes trial and the resulting dislocations for his 
family, renounced his U.S. citizenship and returned to Germany in 1984. He 
agreed never to return to America; the Justice Department in turn promised not 
to prosecute him or cancel his government pension. The Arthur Rudolph case, it 
seemed, was closed. 
</P>
<P>
But once in Germany, Rudolph began to regret what he had done. Friends, 
colleagues, even a small number of former prison-camp inmates turned up, 
seemingly ready to testify to his innocence and good character. One Rudolph 
supporter found a former prisoner who stated that Rudolph had gone out of his 
way to get extra rations for the suffering assembly-line crews. It occurred to 
Rudolph that he had acted foolishly in engaging an immigration lawyer back in 
San Jose, and not hiring a good criminal defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Rudolph had converted a small bedroom in his Hamburg condominium 
to office space and was spending the days there, sifting through the record of 
the case against him and devising a strategy to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
In early July, Rudolph and his wife flew to Toronto, and here, in Canada, set 
in motion a re-examination of the OSI's 
</P>
<P>
case. Canada's immigration laws bar entry to anyone suspected of committing war 
crimes, and Canada, on a tip from Washington, stopped Rudolph when he arrived 
at the airport immigration counter. But that was to Rudolph's benefit, for 
Canadian law also calls for hearings on demand to anyone thus denied entry. 
Rudolph, his family and a circle of visiting well-wishers from Huntsville 
petitioned for one. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to take advantage of Canada's generous immigration laws to get 
him a cheap trial, without the consequences," says Sol Littman, director of the 
Canadian branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Littman notes that if Rudolph 
loses his Canadian case, he won't be any the worse for wear; he'll merely have 
to stay out of Canada. If, however, he persuades Canada to let him in, then he 
will have a "precedent" of sorts to cite south of the border -- where, 
meanwhile, Democratic Congressman James Traficant of Ohio has introduced a 
resolution to have the House judiciary committee take a second look at his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"They know Canada is very likely to say, 'Look, he's an old guy. He isn't 
likely to hurt anybody while he's here. . . . What the hell -- let him in,' " 
says Littman. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian hearings, with a single immigration adjudicator, are now in 
progress in a small, windowless room near the Toronto airport. The hearings 
have pitted Littman and like-minded people against those who fail to see the 
point in "hounding" a shrunken and enfeebled 83-year-old, 45 years after the 
crimes in question are said to have been committed and two decades after he 
proved himself an exemplary immigrant with the moon shot. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph's appearance on the witness stand emboldens this second group: His eyes 
appear to be failing as he peers through a magnifying glass at photocopied 
court documents, and when he pauses for a sip of water, his palsied hands shake 
the contents out of the glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, my health is holding up well," Rudolph said when asked how he was 
feeling during a recess, but his voice was faint and he asked twice to have the 
question repeated. A few days later, Rudolph told the Canadian government that 
he was feeling ill and flew back to Hamburg. Now the hearings on his fitness 
for entry are proceeding in his absence, with Rudolph's lawyer pleading his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than the issue of prosecuting frail and elderly naturalized citizens, 
however, the Rudolph case poses broad questions about American official 
behavior throughout the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
If Rudolph was unsavory enough to be deported in 1984, after all, then why was 
he let into the United States in the first place, four decades earlier? What 
did Washington know about Rudolph in the 1980s that it overlooked in the 1940s? 
If the Army knew Rudolph was a war criminal and embraced him anyway, where then 
would it have drawn the line in its rush to beat the Soviets in guided-missile 
weaponry? At what moral cost did America land a man on the moon? 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hunt, author of a forthcoming book on the U.S. Army's use of German 
weapons designers like Rudolph, thinks she has some answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideology ran everything in this country during the Cold War," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The way Rudolph tells it, he never set out to build weapons for the Nazis; he 
simply grew up fascinated with rockets and their potential for space travel, 
and the only way to get backing for rocket research in the 1930s was to win an 
armaments contract. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph started out at the northern German proving grounds of Peenemunde, home 
not only of the powerful V-2 rocket, with its 200-mile range, but also of the 
devastating German buzz bombs. He and his colleagues tested their first V-2 
rocket in 1942; the following year, Adolf Hitler watched a launching on film 
and is said to have whispered, "If we had had these rockets in 1939, we should 
never have had this war." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, the British learned what was going on at Peenemunde and knocked it out 
with bomber raids. Rudolph escaped injury, but, since he ran the production 
line, was ordered to move the V-2 works to the safety of an old gypsum mine 
under the mountains near Nordhausen, in central Germany. The new rocket 
assembly plant would be known as Mittelwerk. 
</P>
<P>
"He found there a Jules Verne nightmare," wrote a friend of Rudolph in a 
pseudonymous vanity-press biography. "Beneath the mountains, an underground 
labyrinth had been constructed like a ladder. There were two tunnels more than 
a mile long, running parallel 500 feet apart and connected by 47 cross tunnels. 
Several factories were to be set up here, and the V-2 line was to be one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
A concentration camp was built nearby, to house the slave laborers. Their 
working and living conditions were frightful: Even German munitions minister 
Albert Speer, in his autobiographical work, "Inside the Third Reich," called 
Mittelwerk "barbarous" and noted that its Nazi overseers had to be sent on 
forced vacations to "restore their nerves." 
</P>
<P>
The air was freezing and thick with dust. Rations were always short. Weakened 
prisoners collapsed and died at their picks and shovels; others were crushed by 
falling rocks in the tunnels. United Nations and U.S. Army records suggest that 
25,000 inmates perished at the underground factory and its affiliated 
concentration camp, known as Dora. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, in an extensive interview with his friend and biographer, says that he 
was horrified to discover upon arrival at Mittelwerk that he would be relying 
on forced labor from a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I had the overpowering, awful feeling that I was trapped in a cage like an 
animal,' " he is quoted as saying in the book, " 'and that I was caught in the 
claws of the SS system.' " 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from Rudolph's case file suggests, though, that Rudolph in fact had 
wanted to use forced labor. Canadian lawyers have introduced into evidence a 
memo Rudolph wrote in 1943, before moving into Mittelwerk's tunnels, which 
tells of an inspection visit to yet another German armaments factory, one that 
used concentration-camp inmates and got good results. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph details the four-tiered bunk beds, the triple barbed-wire 
entanglements, the watch towers and machine gun -- and then asks for a supply 
of inmates for his own operation. 
</P>
<P>
Innocent bystander or policy architect? Canada is expected to rule in a matter 
of weeks. Meanwhile, the OSI points out that Rudolph joined the Nazi Party in 
1931, two years before Hitler came to power, and thus can't credibly claim to 
have joined simply to go along with the crowd. Rudolph argues that he joined 
the party because he saw National Socialism as the only alternative to 
communism. The OSI record also shows that Rudolph belonged to the S.A., 
Hitler's hated "Brownshirts." 
</P>
<P>
None of these entries from Rudolph's resume were lost on the U.S. Army in 1945, 
when it liberated Dora and lassoed Rudolph and hundreds of other German weapons 
scientists. The Army had set up a scheme, Project Paperclip, for bringing the 
German rocketeers, aircraft designers, wind-tunnel experts and others to the 
United States and to clear them for immigration. It was a tricky project, since 
U.S. immigration laws of the day forbade entry to members of Fascist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Project Paperclip empowered the War Department to screen the scientists, then 
present their dossiers to the State Department for visa clearance. No scientist 
found to "have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal 
participant in its activities" was to be cleared, and the State Department, 
which considered Nazis a security risk, was adamant about enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the military was candid in its analyses of the Nazis. Of Rudolph, 
for instance, an investigator wrote, "100% NAZI, dangerous type, security 
threat . . . ! suggest internment." (Emphasis in the original.) 
</P>
<P>
But later, when the Army realized how serious the State Department was about 
barring really hard-core Nazis, attitudes changed. For a time, a battle of 
memos raged as the Pentagon tried to convince the State Department that the 
Nazi scientists would pose a far greater security threat if sent back to Europe 
than if let in. But in the end, says author Hunt, the Army simply doctored the 
dossiers. 
</P>
<P>
In Rudolph's, she discovered, the investigators now certified that "nothing in 
his records indicat(es) that he was a war criminal, an ardent Nazi, or 
otherwise objectionable." Rudolph became a U.S. citizen in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who first published her findings on Rudolph and other Wehrmacht 
scientists in "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists," and who won an 
Investigative Reporters and Editors award for her work, finds the Army's secret 
revisions of the Nazi scientists' dossiers troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"It raises a whole lot of disturbing issues, which are very relevant today," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
In the relatively well publicized Rudolph case, she says, she sees a parallel 
with the use of deeper covert operatives such as the ex-Nazi Klaus Barbie. And 
the cozying up to Nazis strikes her as a precursor to more recent Cold War 
alliances with assorted dictators and strong men, many of them glorified by 
Washington while they were useful, then discarded just like Rudolph was when 
their usefulness had passed: Ferdinand Marcos, once deemed a bulwark of 
democracy in the western Pacific but later toppled in shame; Manuel Noriega, 
once a CIA "asset" in Central America but now awaiting trial in Miami; even 
Saddam Hussein, an erstwhile American ally but now the "Butcher of Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
"A pattern has emerged," says Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the ideology (underlying) Project Paperclip was that the ends justify 
the means," she says. "The intelligence officers knew what was right for this 
country and they were going to use these people, and if that meant breaking the 
laws, so be it. The question is, 'How far are we willing to go?' "
