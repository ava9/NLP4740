As the sounds of military music filled the downtown area Saturday morning, Pfc. 
Marco Cabibbo, a reservist at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, stood 
behind a tub of toys that eventually will brighten the Christmas of 
underprivileged children. 
</P>
<P>
One of the toys had been tossed into the barrel by a boy who wasn't tall enough 
to look into the cardboard, 50-gallon drum. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'This is for another little boy,' " Cabibbo said. "That was really 
great." 
</P>
<P>
The air was full of Christmas spirit Saturday morning as thousands of people 
flocked to the Civic Center area of Santa Ana for the Sixth Annual Times Orange 
County Holiday Parade and Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's parade, dubbed "California's Other Parade," was 
"Traveling to a Holiday Adventure." The procession included more than 25 floats 
festooned with flowers, 150 horses, 16 marching bands and eight gigantic helium 
balloons that floated several stories above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. Marine Corps helped fulfill the dreams of disadvantaged 
children by collecting for its Toys for Tots program during the 
6,000-participant parade, which wound its way for seven blocks in 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This year's turnout was estimated to top last year's 30,000 attendance. For 
many of the parade goers who lined Broadway, 17th and Main streets, the event 
was a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season, despite the unseasonable 
heat that caused many to doff shirts and shoes. The temperature rose to 83 
degrees in downtown Santa Ana, said Bill Hibbert at WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
Shouts of "Merry Christmas!" and "Feliz Navidad!" to parade participants were 
common along the route. The Disneyland contingent that included cartoon 
chipmunks Chip and Dale passed by blaring, "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the 
Year," a song made famous in the animated television special "Rudolph the 
Red-Nosed Reindeer." 
</P>
<P>
"I like it, especially the big Popeye," said 6-year-old onlooker Cheyenne 
Knight, referring to the oversize cartoon character that floated down the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries in the parade included former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man 
to walk on the moon; Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the County Board of 
Supervisors; 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano boy who 
piloted a small plane around the world this year; Umberto Luna, a popular radio 
personality for the Spanish-language station KTNQ, and cowboy star Monte 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30, parade participants -- many of whom were wearing heavy costumes -- 
began to suffer from the worsening heat. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the city's float was launched, Miss Huntington Beach and her court, 
all in satin dresses, were beginning to wilt along with the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hot," complained Cheryl Martin, one of four runners-up riding 
alongside queen Tracy Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Earl Porter said the crowd was well-behaved and traffic control went 
smoothly although major thoroughfares were closed throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
But the parade was not without some minor glitches. About half an hour before 
it began, workers were frantically trying to patch up holes in the inflatable 
Raggedy Andy that had unexpectedly appeared. 
</P>
<P>
One glitch had scary overtones as a U.S. Marine Corps equestrian team member 
lost control of his mount early in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
The mounted Marine lost his hat and almost lost his grasp on the flag he was 
carrying as the horse bucked and spun around. The horse, apparently spooked by 
the first blaring notes of the Santa Ana Unified School District marching band, 
nearly ran into a crowd of onlookers sitting on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
The parade was held in conjunction with the 16th annual marching band 
competition of the Southern California School Band and Orchestra Assn. 
Twenty-four school bands, chosen from about 450 in Southern California, 
competed in the tournament at Santa Ana Stadium, Corrigan said.
