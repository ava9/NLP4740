As several thousand aviation specialists looked on, an advanced Soviet MIG-29 
combat aircraft crashed in flames on a grassy apron of Le Bourget Airport 
during the opening Thursday of the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet pilot, who had thrilled the crowd with a complicated series of 
high-performance maneuvers just before the crash, managed to eject only seconds 
before the plane slammed nose-first into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Although videotapes of the crash showed that his parachute had only partially 
opened, Soviet officials said pilot Anatoly Kvotchur, 37, was in "more or less 
satisfactory condition." 
</P>
<P>
No immediate cause was given for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Air show spokesman Patrick Guerin said the plane seemed to have "a mechanical 
problem with the left engine." He said the afterburner of the left engine 
failed to fire during a low-speed turn at about 1,000 feet. 
</P>

38th Air Show 
</P>
<P>
The crash was a spectacular start for the 38th Paris Air Show, a huge biennial 
event attended this year by more than 140,000 aviation industry representatives 
from 34 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The MIG-29, first shown in the West last September at the Farnborough Air Show 
in England, was one of the star attractions offered by the largest Soviet 
delegations ever to attend the air show. The Soviet air force has about 450 of 
the combat aircraft in service, and it has been sold to East Germany, North 
Korea, India, Syria, Yugoslavia and Poland, according to the respected 
reference book "Jane's All the World's Aircraft" and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were miffed last month when Turkish authorities returned a 
MIG-29 flown to Turkey by a defecting pilot without letting them have a chance 
to examine the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The accident Thursday occurred just as Soviet officials were holding a press 
conference in the cavernous cargo hold of an Antonov 225, the world's largest 
aircraft. The Antonov carried on its back the Soviet space shuttle Buran. Both 
aircraft were making their first appearance in the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Trade Fair 
</P>
<P>
The Paris show alternates with Farnborough as the industry's prime trade fair 
at which buyers can compare weaponry and shop for new airplanes. About 350,000 
visitors are expected to attend this year's show, jamming hotels and filling 
restaurants with aviation engineers, aircraft salesmen and military officers. 
</P>
<P>
The main American attraction this year is the Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" 
reconnaissance airplane, making its first public appearance outside the United 
States. The Mach-3 aircraft, first delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, has 
rarely been photographed. This year, however, the veil has been lifted and the 
svelte, dark-green, spy plane stood naked to cameras on the tarmac of Le 
Bourget. 
</P>
<P>
Because the show occurs this year on the 20th anniversary of the first American 
moon landing, several former astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, the first 
person to set foot on the moon, are present and met with French President 
Francois Mitterrand during the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris Air Show has been the scene for a number of serious accidents over 
the years, including the 1973 crash of a supersonic Soviet Tupolev 144 that 
killed 13 people. American B-58 "Hustler" bombers crashed here in 1961 and 
again in 1965, each time killing the three-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, an American Fairchild Hiller 1000 helicopter exploded and crashed, 
killing the pilot. In 1977, a twin-engine Fairchild A-10 crashed after 
performing a low-altitude acrobatic loop, also killing the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst air show accidents, however, happened last Aug. 28, at 
Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. Seventy people died after three jets of an 
Italian Air Force aerobatics team collided and one jet plowed into spectators.
