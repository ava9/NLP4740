TRASH IN SPACE HAS SCIENTISTS CONCERNED;

When engineers and scientists discuss the vacuum of space these days, they may 
be yearning for a giant Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
Like other frontiers before it, the heavenly void has succumbed to human 
litter. Ground trackers report roughly 7,500 spent rocket stages, dead 
satellites, screwdrivers and other man-made objects whirling around the globe, 
passing each other at about 22,000 m.p.h. in relative velocity, at varying 
altitudes and in all directions. Most of the items are classified as junk. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only the big stuff -- at least 10 centimeters or about four inches 
across -- visible to the ground-based telescopes and radars of the U.S. Space 
Surveillance Network. 
</P>
<P>
What is giving fits to the orbital garbage gurus are the uncounted trillions of 
flecks, flakes and fragments of tiny trash too small to be tracked but 
traveling so fast that if a piece of aluminum one centimeter across (smaller 
than a marble) collided with a spacecraft, it would have the force -- but not 
necessarily the effect -- of a 400-pound safe traveling 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about global ring around the collar has increased steadily in the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the U.S. Space Command's Space Surveillance Network catalogued the 
20,000th man-made object to be launched into Earth orbit since Sputnik went up 
in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Most are no longer up there. Over time, orbiting items lose energy and fall 
into progressively lower orbits until they hit thicker atmosphere, slow down 
and burn up or, in rare cases, hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The greater bulk of the visible junk still aloft is in 3,000 large objects, 
mostly spent rocket stages and dead satellites, according to government 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are about 4,000 smaller but still trackable fragments, most of which 
resulted from about 130 "fragmentations" -- intentional or accidental 
explosions or breakups -- in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the debris got there through astronaut mishaps. In 1984, for example, a 
shuttle astronaut working outside his craft let go of 10 or 12 screws. A 
space-walking Soviet cosmonaut once dropped a screwdriver. A thermal glove 
floated out of Gemini 4 in 1965. And there is a nice camera adrift somewhere in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
In the infancy of the Space Age, it was the harsh natural environment of space 
-- the whizzing meteorites and cosmic radiation -- against which engineers 
armored their craft. Now the estimated mass of man-made stuff orbiting within 
1,200 miles of Earth's surface is 15,000 times the mass of all the natural 
objects passing near Earth at a given time. 
</P>
<P>
The debris shell has prompted National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
engineers to add at least five tons of costly shielding to the design of the 
proposed space station, and they are studying more exotic measures, such as 
collision-avoidance maneuvering. Space shuttles have collided at least twice 
with tiny objects. 
</P>
<P>
Space debris is also a problem for astronomers because of light reflecting from 
orbiting junk. 
</P>
<P>
Experts disagree among themselves over how serious orbital trash is now and how 
fast the problem will grow. Nobody claims to know for sure. In any case, like 
earthly polluters, spacefarers are feeling growing pressure to clean up their 
act, even though the impact, literally, of all the junk on spaceflight has been 
minimal -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, scientists at Johnson Space Center examined surfaces of the Solar Max 
satellite retrieved after 50 months in space. They found six small holes per 
square foot in some areas, most of them apparently caused by impacts with paint 
flakes from other spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
The first operational spacecraft damage attributed to debris occurred in 1983, 
when the shuttle Challenger was hit by something in orbit that left a crater on 
one of its 5/8-inch-thick glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists found components of white paint fused into the pit. They concluded 
the orbiter had hit a flake less than .01 inch in diameter, traveling two to 
three miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
And on its mission last month, the shuttle Atlantis' window was struck by 
something still being analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
But collisions are still rare in orbit, according to Don Kessler of Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, dean of space debris studies, who has been watching 
orbital hazards since 1963. Collisions may become significantly more likely in 
the 1990s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is because, as collisions happen, each creates many times more particles 
than mere explosions or breakups. Coming together at 22,000 m.p.h., "because of 
the tremendous pressures and temperatures generated in that instant, aluminum 
and other metals become actually fluid," said Jeanne Lee Crews, manager of the 
space center's Hypervelocity Impact Research Laboratory, where she uses 
gas-powered guns to simulate cosmic crackups. 
</P>
<P>
That causes a spray of millions of small pieces, like droplets, many times more 
than a breakup or explosion of the same mass would create. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, Kessler said, collisions will become so numerous they will begin 
a kind of chain reaction of ever more collisions and fragmentations. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps around 2050 or so," he said, the junk might reach "a critical density 
of matter in space and essentially it would grind itself to dust, and low Earth 
orbit would become unusable." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way worldwide to hold debris to a minimum, through improved 
spacecraft design and other measures, as well as to protect spacecraft with 
shielding. 
</P>
<P>
One step, for example, followed U.S. concerns years ago when it was found that 
six orbiting U.S. Delta rocket second stages had exploded, the last in 1981, 
apparently as a result of metal failure that allowed residual fuels to mix. 
Engineers since have modified the rockets to prevent breakups. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Soviet Union's practice of deliberately destroying failed military 
satellites, which has added much to the debris, appears to have ended more than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Soviet, European, Japanese and other space programs now try to ensure 
that their rocket stages are emptied of fuel and pressure once in orbit, said 
Joseph Loftus, a top planning official at the Johnson center. That way, a 
collision with a small object will be no more traumatic than "a rifle bullet 
going through an empty soda pop can." 
</P>
<P>
To protect the space station, NASA has asked industry to develop, at a cost of 
$15 million to $20 million, a ground-based radar system that could spot a dime 
at an altitude of 360 miles. It would track some but not all small pieces of 
orbital debris that could threaten the space station.
