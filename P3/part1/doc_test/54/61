Atlantis' commander got a sore throat today, forcing NASA to postpone for at 
least 24 hours the launch of the space shuttle on a secret, all-military 
mission to put a spy satellite in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a postponement due to the illness of an astronaut. This is the 
first time in the space program," NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
A space agency statement said a bad weather forecast was also a factor in the 
postponement, but officials said that if not for the illness, they would have 
continued the countdown, hoping for clear skies by launch time early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA said Navy Capt. John O. Creighton "developed an upper respiratory tract 
infection during the last 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
"The commander's health and weather will be evaluated on Thursday to determine 
if the launch will be attempted on Friday morning," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off the Apollo 13 crew a few 
days before the flight was to lift off for the moon. But backup astronaut Jack 
Swigert replaced him without delaying the flight. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly before technicians were to begin pumping more 
than half a million gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank for the 
four-day mission, which was to end at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
A bleak weather forecast early today had gradually improved to a 50-50 chance 
for a launch Thursday. But the outlook for Friday and Saturday is even worse, 
with one cold front moving out and another moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Pentagon mission is classified, the space agency would not provide 
the exact launch time, saying only that it would occur between midnight and 4 
a.m. Thursday. However, sources said Atlantis was to lift off at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis' orbit reportedly will cover a greater area of the globe than any 
previous shuttle.
