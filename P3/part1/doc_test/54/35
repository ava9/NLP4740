ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
POPEYE AND OLIVE BIG STARS AT PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a giant Popeye balloon leading the way, the Times Orange County Holiday 
Parade will step off at 10:30 this morning along the streets of downtown Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
With the weather forecast calling for sunny skies and temperatures in the 80s, 
the parade will begin at Civic Center Drive and continue north on Broadway to 
17th Street to Main Street and concludes at Washington Street and Main. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute parade will be shown on KHJ Channel 9, which will precede its 
telecast with a 20-minute performance by the Orange Song and Dance Company in a 
salute to this year's parade theme, "Traveling to a Holiday Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
The parade lineup includes more than 25 floats, all adorned with floral 
decorations, 150 horses, and six helium balloons in addition to Popeye and 
Olive Oyl. (Parade officials say that the 75-foot-tall Olive balloon is the 
first ever to depict a character who is a woman.) 
</P>
<P>
There will also be 16 marching bands from throughout Southern California and 
six other bands from other parts of the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Parade grand marshals include Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and two 
aviation heroes who live in Orange County: Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk 
on the moon, and 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the youngest American to fly 
around the world.
