On the morning of Friday the 13th, Jim Slemons' spanking new home in Newport 
Beach was a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
It had no lawn, no walkway to the front door, no flagstones surrounding the 
back-yard pool. There was hardly a stick of furniture in its 
white-whiter-whitest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning there were 37 pickup trucks out front," said Slemons, a car and 
boat dealer. 
</P>
<P>
That night -- as luck would have it -- the custom-built, 10,000-square-foot 
house was ready for inspection, which is just what it got. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 of Slemons' friends drove to the place the owner called "the top of 
Newport" -- a slice of hilltop real estate in the gated Harbor Ridge section of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
There they walked up the newly laid gray stone path, past a toy black cat 
curled by the door -- the only Friday the 13th touch -- and into a party. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Slemons' employees -- tousle-haired young women dressed in black hot 
pants, spike-heeled pumps, white dress shirts and tux coats -- greeted guests. 
They proffered a guest book, poured glasses of champagne, snapped souvenir 
photos for their boss. 
</P>
<P>
"On a clear day," Slemons told one visitor, "I can see Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In the sunset mists of the 13th, the view from Slemons' vast windows was 
limited to the cube shapes of Fashion Island and a swath of shimmering sea. 
</P>
<P>
But there was much to see inside. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for example, a white grand player piano in one corner of the living 
room, plinking its own ghostly tunes. There were more than a dozen antique slot 
machines in a basement that also featured a fireplace, a pool table and an 
oak-shelved wine cellar (fully stocked). There was a cherry paneled study, with 
artfully arranged leather-bound books. 
</P>
<P>
A sandwiches-and-salads buffet was spread on the dining room table. Mariachis 
serenaded pool side. A fortuneteller read Tarot cards and tossed "astral dice" 
at a table near the self-possessed piano. 
</P>
<P>
On the host's arm was L.A. Gear tennis shoe model Donna Piccioni, a vision in 
turquoise Spandex. Piccioni said she also works as a marketing executive for a 
water bottling company. "And Jim (Slemons) hired me for the 1990 posters for 
his boat company," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among early arrivals was former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who parked his red 
convertible Mercedes with "MARS GUY" license plates right in front of Slemons' 
front door. (When his wife, Lois, arrived an hour later, she parked her red 
"MOON GAL"-plated Porsche right behind it.) 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Virginia Knott Bender and Paul Bender, Alice and Frank 
Mead, Renate and Bill Shafer, Linda and Warren Bauer, Jana and Ken Knapp, and 
Steve and Robin Marmor.
