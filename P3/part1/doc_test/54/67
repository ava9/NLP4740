Under the heading 'True and false etymology', Fowler's Modern English Usage
tells us that 'Welsh rabbit is amusing and right, and Welsh rarebit stupid
and wrong'. 'Stupid and wrong' just about sums up Rhodes Around Britain,
which is obsessed with the style and appearance of its presenter and pretty
weak on recipes (8.30 BBC2). At 9.30 on the same channel comes another
misconceived phrase. When Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon it was
intended, the ponderousness of American PR men being what it is, that he
should say: 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'
Poor old Armstrong, with too many other things on his mind, omitted the
indefinite article, destroyed the distinction between the individual and the
species, and delivered 11 words of gibberish. They can never be corrected
because all the television newsreels stand as witness. One Small Step
re-tells the story of the moon landing. Ireland's crucial match against
Norway is shown in World Cup Grandstand (5.25 BBC1) and ITV shows Brazil v
Sweden in World Cup '94 (8.30).
