Japan put a satellite into orbit around the moon today, joining the United 
States and the Soviet Union in the accomplishment, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's first lunar satellite, Muses-A, completed two missions, a swing-by 
flight designed to boost its speed and enlarge its elliptical Earth orbit, and 
the placement of a smaller satellite in lunar orbit, said the government's 
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. 
</P>
<P>
"Both tests were completely successful, and we deeply thank U.S. and Japanese 
scientists for their cooperation in the probe," said an institute spokesman, 
who was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's chief scientist, Kuninori Uesugi, said the release of the 
smaller basketball-sized experimental satellite into orbit around the moon, 
required extraordinary accuracy, "in baseball terms . . . comparable to hitting 
the eyeball of a bug in the outfield from home base."
