  [Abstract] Most gravitational maneuvers have involved the 
planets rather than the Moon, although as far back as 1959 the 
unmanned Luna-3 craft used lunar gravitation to produce a return 
trajectory that would be better for the transmission of images 
of the far side of the Moon. The researchers here show that a 
good number of missions to asteroids that are approaching the 
Earth's orbit can use lunar gravity to good effect, i.e., the 
fuel savings would enable larger payloads. Most profiles require 
that a velocity of 1.3-2.5 km/s be achieved, which means that 
more than 150 m/s could be saved with a lunar flyby in terms of 
characteristic velocity. The trajectory proposed would 
approximate sectors of conical sections. If used for the mission 
to the McAuliffe asteroid in the INEO project, the savings in 
characteristic velocity would be 183 m/s. Figures 3, references
