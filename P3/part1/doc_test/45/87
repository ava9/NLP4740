You may recall that a month ago, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce forced 
Newhall's Downtown Western Walk of Fame to change its name to the Walk of 
Western Stars. The chamber, ever-vigilant lest Newhall become the world's 
entertainment capital, explained that it had copyrighted the phrase, "Walk of 
Fame." 
</P>
<P>
But . . . Hollywood types are known for showing favoritism toward relatives. 
</P>
<P>
And, today, a sister city of Los Angeles -- Nagoya, Japan -- should pass the 
final hurdle to achieve its dream of installing its own Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Department's Board of Commissioners is expected to 
approve a $60,000 expenditure to supply 25 prefabricated stars (celebrities 
haven't yet been designated), with Hollywood's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
The Walk of Clones is intended to salute the 30th anniversary of the 
sister-city relationship, as well as Nagoya's centennial. "We were trying to 
find something very truly American and certainly very truly Hollywood, very Los 
Angeles," said Julia Nagano, a Harbor Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Walk, incidentally, will be housed in a section of Nagoya called Los 
Angeles Square. No doubt it will come to be known as Little L.A. 
</P>
<P>
We've got everything from Dial-a-Pizza to Dial-a-Prayer. It was only a matter 
of time before the arrival of . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dial-A-Planet. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, space buffs will be able to receive up-to-the-minute details of 
Voyager's rendezvous with Neptune as the data is received and interpreted by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of making the call (1-900-909-NASA) is $2 for the first minute and 45 
cents for each additional minute. The service will be available from 6 a.m. 
Thursday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Then, Dial-a-Planet's line goes dead until 
another area code in the solar system can be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
When a guy's determined, really determined, to BUILD THAT PATIO, he'll pick up 
the supplies even if his car is disabled. For example, there was Al Fisher of 
Eagle Rock the other day, precariously balancing a beam on one shoulder as he 
made the uphill trip home from the lumberyard on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows if it'll ever assume its proposed position above the Hollywood 
Freeway. But a model of the proposed $33-million "Steel Cloud" -- seen by its 
backers as the West Coast's Statue of Liberty -- is on display this month at 
street level in the City Hall East lobby. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time. Like many a controversial production, "Cloud" opened out of 
town -- in a San Francisco exhibit hall earlier this year, where it was 
described as everything from "a jungle gym for adults" to a symbol of "the 
fragmentary character" of society. 
</P>
<P>
The miniature features such attractions as museums, restaurants and aquariums. 
It's also decorated with tiny plastic palm trees (a nice L.A. touch), 
pedestrians and fewer cars than Mel Gibson encounters in the 
post-nuclear-war-era film, "The Road Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
Crescencio Rodriguez drives the real streets of Los Angeles for a living, so 
his opponents in the International Bus Roadeo may argue that he's had an unfair 
advantage learning to avoid traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Rodriguez, an RTD driver on the Wilshire Boulevard line, will 
represent Southern California in the safe-driving finals Sept. 26 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
He beat out 31 finalists in the district competition in the parking lot of the 
Santa Anita Race Track, where he was asked to negotiate a series of mazes 
featuring traffic cones and barrels. The lot was first cleared of its usual 
hazards, race track touts. 
</P>
<P>
It's been an odd year for folks in the Elysian Park area. Forty Medflies were 
discovered earlier this month near Dodger Stadium. And, for months before that, 
the anemic Dodger hitters have also been producing plenty of pop flies.
