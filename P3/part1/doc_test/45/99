HUBBLE: LIKE A SHOT IN THE DARK; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED SPACE AGENCY SENDS UP AN UNTESTED TELESCOPE, LOSES BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration obviously has serious 
internal management problems. There was nothing wrong with the Hubble Space 
Telescope project that a measure of properly organized pre-launch testing 
couldn't have caught and fixed. 
</P>
<P>
But because basic testing of the orbiting telescope's two mirrors was not done, 
the world now sees the inglorious result of NASA's laxity and ineptitude: A 
$1.5-billion piece of equipment that, until a defect with one of its mirrors is 
fixed, is not much more than a hunk of orbiting junk. How was this fiasco 
allowed to happen? 
</P>
<P>
Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has been 
asked fo find out. And Congress, with a hearing already started, will want to 
find out for itself. Inevitably the manufacturer -- Hughes Danbury Optical 
Systems, Inc. -- will be questioned about producing a couple of 
multimillion-dollar mirrors that did not work. 
</P>
<P>
Congress would be wrong to spare the rod on the manufacturer, if the facts 
uncover a design flaw or manufacturer's blunder. But in truth the job of the 
space agency is to monitor such work and prevent fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
This one is a real beaut. NASA's huge budget ($10.9 billion in 1989) now needs 
to be reviewed; its penchant for selling Congress and the American people on 
unbelievably expensive projects called to account. Over the next 25 years NASA 
would like to operate six huge earth-observation satellites. That ambition now 
needs to be examined by Congress with a skeptical eye. Just Thursday the 
shuttle fleet was grounded, once again, after NASA detected mysterious fuel 
leaks on two of the three crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Many warned that the 1986 Challenger disaster, caused by a fuel leak that 
claimed the lives of six astronauts, showed a fundamental defect in the 
management structure and competence of the space agency. Four years later there 
is reason to ask if that warning was understated.
