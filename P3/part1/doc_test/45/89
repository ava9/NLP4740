<F P=106> [Interview with Masato Yamano, chairman of the board of the </F>
National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan; first paragraph 
is source introduction] 
  [Text] In rocket development, which began decades ago with 
the introduction of U.S. technologies, Japan has finally reached 
a point where it can claim that its technology is 100 percent 
domestically developed. Although it had problems for a while -- 
particularly in the development of the new two-stage rocket 
engine -- it has succeeded in completing the entire job, 
overcoming technological problems and the handicap of an 
extremely small developmental budget and scanty facilities by 
comparison with other countries. The completion of the job is a 
result that promises an unending future for the space 
developments of this country. Here is a summary of an interview 
with Mr. Masato Yamano, the chairman of the board of the 
National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), on the 
development of the H-2 and its future tasks. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You have just successfully 
completed the long-awaited launching of the H-2 launch vehicle, 
a rocket based on our own technologies. I am sure you are 
thrilled with that huge success, but let me start with asking 
you how you feel right now? 
  Yamano: Honestly speaking, I am greatly relieved. 
The H-2 development project was indeed a crucially important 
project for NASDA that lasted more than 10 years, and its 
objective was to launch a world-class, technologically 
state-of-the-art rocket based on Japan's own technology. This 
year happens to be the 25th anniversary of NASDA, so that gives 
me a greater pleasure to have been able to accomplish it this 
year. With the success of the completion of this rocket, Japan 
has come to be on a par with the leading countries of the world 
in space development, at least in terms of the transportation 
system. We are pleased to close this catch-up era, which lasted 
for a quarter of a century. I believe we are at the threshold of 
an age in which Japan will be able to play a leading role in the 
world. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What was the critical point 
in developing this rocket? 
  Yamano: We decided early on, as a basic direction, 
to develop a new engine called LE-7 -- an engine based on the 
two-stage combustion method, which, by its own right, is a 
cutting-edge technology -- as the first-stage engine and a laser 
gyro as the inertia guidance system to boost the lifting 
capacity to four times that of the predecessor, the H-1. 
Everything went quite smoothly, except for the LE-7 engine. 
  We ran into difficult problems in the development of the 
LE-7. And the critical point was unquestionably the development 
of the LE-7. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You experienced a 
substantial amount of trouble in the development, didn't you? 
  Yamano: Because of that trouble, we had to 
postpone the launch twice. The first time, cracks were found in 
the turbine blades of the hydrogen turbine pump; the second 
time, the welded portion of the high-pressure piping fractured 
as a result of high thermal stress. We never took any hasty 
actions; we now see that we were right in making those two 
postponements to do the job correctly. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Now that Japan has reached 
the world level in terms of launch-vehicle development with the 
success of the H-2, what do you think that rocket will enable us 
to do in terms of space development? 
  Yamano: First of all, we will have the capability 
of launching a wider range of satellites. For example, we can 
build an enhanced version capable of placing a satellite 
weighing up to 4 tons into geostationary orbit by improving the 
first stage LE-7 engine and the second stage LE-5 engine and by 
adding more booster rocket motors, or we can build a smaller 
version capable of placing a smaller satellite weighing 1.5 tons 
into geostationary orbit by reducing the number of booster 
rockets. Secondly, the H-2 is technically capable of performing 
moon and planet surveys. It will enable us to send a survey 
vehicle to an orbit around the moon or Mars, as well as to bring 
back samples from them. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your plan for the 
development of the next-generation rocket? 
  Yamano: What we are pursuing with top priority at 
this point are a space shuttle of our own, HOPE, which is 
scheduled to be completed by the early part of the 21st century, 
and an enhanced version of the H-2, which will enable us to 
launch payloads of up to 20 tons, including HOPE. Also being 
considered at this point are such improvements as making it a 
reusable rocket or providing an apogee propulsion capability to 
its second-stage engine to broaden the vehicle's capability. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Although it has many 
promising features, the H-2 certainly has its fair share of 
problems, doesn't it? 
  Yamano: The biggest problem is that its launch 
costs are among the highest in the world. While we are confident 
that the high reliability of NASDA's rockets is well 
appreciated, we have to work seriously on cost reduction in 
order to offer decent cost-effectiveness and be competitive in 
the market. We have already initiated a study on cost-reduction 
measures. The other problem is that the launch season of the 
Tanegashima Space Center is limited to only 45 days a year and 
is a season split in half -- one half being in the winter, the 
other in the summer. However, we believe we can manage it for 
the time being. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What kind of synergy effects 
are possible as a result of the success of the H-2? 
  Yamano: A large satellite will be launched this 
summer, one that is also based 100 percent on domestic 
technology. If successful, Japan will secure its place among the 
leading countries of the world in terms of both the 
launch-vehicle technology and the satellite technology. 
  NASDA wishes to enhance its space activities in addition to 
its traditional fields of communications, broadcasting, and 
observation. I believe that a success this time will have a 
major impact on the general industrial technologies as well. 
  [Boxed item] 
  It was 7:20 a.m., February 4, and the H-2 rocket rose into 
the dawning sky over the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima 
Prefecture as it made its maiden voyage into space and reached a 
predetermined altitude that ushered this country into an 
unending voyage to the moon, Mars and beyond. The 
liquid-propellant, two-stage combustion engine developed for 
this vehicle that is based on our own technology is at the 
cutting edge and is equivalent to the engines used by the U.S. 
Space Shuttle. 
  The successful H-2 launch was also the first milestone for 
Japan in its quest to be competitive in the rocket business 
among the leading countries of the world and a step toward the 
role as leader of the world. While the professionals claim this 
is only the "beginning of the first step," it is certain that 
the country is entering an immense rocket age and is standing at 
the threshold of the age of large satellites. 
  Moreover, if we succeed in increasing the power of this 
rocket, we will be able to launch an ultraheavy satellite 
weighing up to 4 tons to geostationary orbit, as well as a 
Japanese version of the space shuttle weighing 20 tons. 
  This success in the challenge of the unknown was 
accomplished 
under the tight constraints of a much smaller budget (&yen;270 
billion) and facilities that are meager by comparison with those 
of other countries, and only 15 engines were destroyed in the 
course of the development. That proves the soundness of the 
technological levels of the companies that participated in the 
project.
