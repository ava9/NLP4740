Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi's "Other Worlds: A Grand Tour of the Solar System" 
certainly interests us. We have a strong suspicion that we're from outer space, 
since not a day goes by that someone doesn't ask: "What planet are you from?" 
The program will include images sent back by U.S., Soviet and European 
spacecraft, and the latest information from telescopes on Earth and in space.

And Fraknoi, who's executive director of the Astronomical Society of the 
Pacific, promises his discussion of the subject won't even contain a syllable 
of NASAspeak. Just plain, everyday language about the rings of Saturn, 
Jupiter's stormy moon Io, asteroids, the search for Planet X and more. It will 
be held Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 2160E of the Dickson Art Center 
at UCLA. Fees vary. For information call (213) 825-7093. Klaatu, barada, nikto.
