  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Russia and the United States 
have embarked on a new stage of cooperation in outer space. 
During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun 
and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar 
system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the 
United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number 
of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the 
universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday. 
  Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian 
optical 
module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has 
been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier 
"Proton" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to 
Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field 
of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the 
sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and 
will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface. 
  Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the 
21st 
century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite 
Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto 
and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American 
interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast 
scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be 
separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its 
satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea 
of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments 
and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made 
descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and 
surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this 
cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet 
of the solar system in less than ten years. 
  Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two 
spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment 
are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001. 
  Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were 
also 
considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project 
will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try 
unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars, 
pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There 
is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory, 
Radioastron. 
  The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley 
Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the 
Russian Space Agency.
