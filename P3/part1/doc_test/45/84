  [Text] New York May 11 TASS -- The U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to launch 
automatic space probes to the planet Pluto and the sun with 
Russia's help. Alan Stern, representative of the 
administration, told ITAR-TASS by telephone that this project, 
dubbed "fire and ice", was now being discussed at top level in 
the United States and Russia. 
  According to Stern, the idea of enlisting Russian scientists 
and experts in the programme for the exploration of Pluto, the 
only planet of the solar system that has still not been reached 
by automatic probes, is explained by NASA's current financial 
straits. According to expert calculations, the cost of launching 
two space probes by means of the most powerful American "Titan" 
carrier-rockets, would by far exceed one billion dollars. This 
made the Americans think seriously about the possibility of 
launching the Pluto probes by means of the Russian "Proton" 
carrier-rocket. 
  However, Stern said that NASA's policy towards international 
scientific missions is that every side involved in them should 
make its own contribution, not merely provide its technology or 
render paid services. The Russians, he noted, did not like the 
idea of exchanging their Proton rocket for the right to instal 
on board the American probe its instrument, weighing not more 
than two kilograms, and to paste a label with a Russian symbol 
on the external surface of the probe. The Space Research 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences moved to "add" a 
Russian jettisonable sonde to each of the two American probes. 
They are to be released from the probes approximately 40,000 
kilometres from Pluto and to descend: one on the surface of the 
planet and the other -- on Pluto's natural satellite Haron. The 
sondes are to carry either equipment for measuring the 
composition of Pluto's atmosphere or photo- and cine- cameras. 
  NASA has still not decided what American equipment will be 
installed on board the probes, but experts of the Pasadena Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in California, who specialise in long-term 
projects for the exploration of planets of the solar system, 
move to install only four instruments. 
  Pluto is the most distant known planet from the sun. It was 
discovered 62 years ago. Its period of revolution around the 
sun is 250.6 years. The composition of the planet's atmosphere 
is unknown. Welsy Huntress, chief of the NASA department for 
studying the solar system, is sure that the Pluto fight 
programme should be among the first on the list of scientific 
priorities. NASA believes that it is inexpedient to further put 
off its elaboration. In order to direct a probe towards Pluto 
it is necessary to use Jupiter's gravitational field to boost 
it. This will be possible only if the space vehicle is launched 
in the period between 2001 and 2003. 
  The solar project also stipulates the launching of an 
American probe, which would split in two upon approaching the 
sun: into a Russian part carrying an optical telescope, and an 
American part -- with instruments to study the physics of the 
plasma on board.
