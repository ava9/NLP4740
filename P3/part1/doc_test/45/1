Every once in a while, a clever screenwriter reminds us that when we peer up at 
some distant star or planet, we are actually looking into the past because the 
light thrown off by the celestial body takes so long to travel to us here on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
On public-television stations around the country tonight, would-be astronomers 
and insomniacs alike can spend the wee hours looking at close-up photographs of 
Neptune's recent past as Voyager 2 zips past the planet and its moons at 38,000 
m.p.h., snapping pictures like a shutter-happy tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling at the speed of light, the signals that make up those photographs 
will take four hours and six minutes to traverse the 2.7 billion miles 
separating Neptune and Earth. And just as soon as the signals are received by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deep space tracking 
antennas in California, Spain and Australia and then turned into photographs by 
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, viewers will be able 
to see them on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic slide show begins at 11:30 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, at 11 p.m. on 
KVCR Channel 24 and at 12:25 a.m. on KPBS Channel 15, and will continue until 
at least 4 a.m. Friday. Anyone willing to stay up will get the first look at 
these pictures from deep space just hours after the 1-ton Voyager spacecraft 
makes its closest pass over the clouds of Neptune, turns 45 degrees with the 
help of the planet's gravity and then flies past Neptune's quirky moon, Triton. 
Voyager is scheduled to buzz within 3,000 miles of Neptune's wispy cloud tops 
tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on Voyager's close encounter with Neptune, the pale-blue eighth planet 
from the sun that was discovered in 1846, will also be carried throughout the 
night on Cable News Network and C-SPAN. CNN will have extended live coverage of 
the mission beginning at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
During its 4.4-billion mile, circuitous journey through the solar system, 
Voyager 2 has already photographed Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Tonight's 
meeting with Neptune, which is four times the size of Earth, will be Voyager's 
final visit to a planetary system before it darts off into the infinity of 
space. Scientists hope that Voyager will provide the first direct measurements 
of the environment outside the solar system sometime in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' "Neptune All Night" will feature 20-minute updates each hour from NASA and 
JPL scientists as they examine and interpret the most recent photographs. The 
remaining 40 minutes each hour will originate live from WHYY-TV in Philadelphia 
and will include a panel of experts on the East Coast and at JPL analyzing the 
new data, live viewer calls on a nationwide toll-free hot line, reaction to the 
Neptune voyage from science-fiction writers and celebrities, a recap of 
Voyager's previous planetary encounters and a frivolous look at space travel in 
movies and science-fiction literature. 
</P>

"We are staying on the air all night to present this program because there 
really has been a rebirth in public interest in the space program," said Don 
Leifer, program director at KVCR in San Bernardino. "We literally had a block 
party on my street with all the people watching the lunar eclipse (last week). 
This show is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. It's the first time anyone 
will have seen such close-up pictures of Neptune, and we felt this falls 
exactly into where public television should go." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Edward Stone, Voyager's chief project scientist, called the 
meeting with Neptune "the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer 
planets, and like a symphony, its tempo is accelerating as it nears the end." 
</P>
<P>
Already Voyager has discovered four previously unknown Neptunian moons, a 
complete ring and several partial rings circling the planet, a huge storm 
system the size of the Earth that may pack winds up to 400 m.p.h. and a strong 
magnetic field. JPL scientists expect further discoveries today as the 
spacecraft sails through the upper reaches of Neptune's atmosphere and then 
within 2,500 miles of Triton, the moon that revolves the "wrong" way and 
appears to have a transparent atmosphere and a pinkish, iced surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It may snow from time to time in places, there may be heavy frost laid down," 
astronomer Bradford Smith said of the eccentric satellite. "What we would 
really like to do is to get some idea of what Triton's geological history has 
been. It's a strange satellite, it's in the wrong orbit, it's going backward 
around Neptune, and something truly catastrophic must have happened at some 
time in its past." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's snapshots of Neptune can also be seen on the NASA-Select satellite 
feed by anyone with their own satellite dish, on some cable-access channels and 
at various locations around the Southland. The NASA-Select feed will contain 
fresh images from space as well as NASA and JPL press conferences and 
discussions of the mission and the spacecraft's discoveries. The NASA feed will 
begin at 9 a.m. today and continue through the night, and also will be 
broadcast from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NASA-Select feed can be seen at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, the Griffith Park Observatory, Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in San 
Diego, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Cal State Long Beach, El 
Camino College, San Diego State, Santa Monica College, UCLA, USC, Ambassador 
College, Southwestern College and on some cable systems. Interested viewers 
should call their cable operators for details. 
</P>
<P>
The Learning Channel will also offer a one-hour progress report on Voyager 
today at 5 p.m. CNN will air a special report, "Voyager: Rendezvous With 
Neptune," Saturday at 5 a.m. And TBS will carry its own special on Voyager at 7 
p.m. Sunday, hosted by Carl Sagan and Sidney Poitier.
