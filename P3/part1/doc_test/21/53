  [Text] Topping the strongly interventionist statements made 
by Congressman Robert Torricelli a few weeks back, James Jones, 
the U.S. ambassador to our country, has now crossed the line 
that separates a mere opinion on a political process -- in this 
case, the Mexican process -- from statements that imply 
intentions to modify it. 
  The Washington Government usually considers our country 
"excessively sensitive" when it reacts to comments made by U.S. 
diplomats on national political, social, or economic issues and 
denies that those statements are made with an interventionist 
intention. However, although the historical background of 
relations between Mexico and the United States offers enough 
reasons to be sensitive, the different representatives of the 
White House in Mexico seem not to be able to resist the 
temptation of slipping in (with more or less subtlety, according 
to the diplomacy of the official holding the position at the 
time) statements geared to pressure the national government to 
adapt its actions to Washington's needs, desires, or whims. 
  The irrepressible tendency shown by successive U.S. 
ambassadors in our country to interfere in Mexico's internal 
affairs reveals, in a modified and polished manner, our northern 
neighbors' old belief that all the nations located south of the 
Rio Bravo are, in the end, nothing more than the backyard of the 
United States. 
  When James Jones asserted, for example, that the recent 
entry 
of Mexico to the OECD and the signing of NAFTA "would oblige" 
authorities to act in a set manner (in this context, it is 
unimportant if the manner is correct or not), the U.S. 
ambassador seems to forget that the implementation of new 
commercial policies is a product of decisions that are the 
exclusive domain of the national government and have no direct 
relation to our country's internal political situation and that 
Mexicans are the ones who have to solve problems that derive 
from this situation. 
  Likewise, when the U.S. representative in Mexico refrains 
from saying whether foreign observers are necessary, but 
emphatically asserts that "they will be here on 21 August," he 
again adopts -- although his manner is more veiled than the one 
used by his predecessors -- the interventionist attitude that 
has characterized U.S. ambassadors in the republic. 
  Either the borderline between opinions and interventionist 
statements is too hazy for U.S. diplomats or our new commercial 
partners insist -- even if they publicly manifest their best 
wishes for our country -- in their belief that their position as 
world power gives them the authority to exert an irritating 
political tutelage over Mexico and its inhabitants.
