  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  The Honduran Government announced a new lempira devaluation 
today, two weeks after President Carlos Roberto Reina's 
inauguration. Finance Minister Juan Ferrera disclosed the 
official exchange rate will go from 6.20 to 7.27 lempiras per 
dollar, effective 15 February. The name the Honduran Government 
is giving the monetary changes is the customs compensation 
factor [Factor de Valoracion Aduanera] for the implementation of 
duties within import and export tariffs and other tax schedules.

  Central Bank President Hugo Noe Pino disclosed today the 
Rafael Callejas administration, which ended on 27 January, left 
a "dreadful" 10.6-percent fiscal deficit. Pino told the media 
it is untrue the Callejas administration left a deficit of 
between 7 and 8 percent, as he announced prior to leaving 
office. President Carlos Roberto Reina and four IMF experts 
began to analyze the country's economic situation this week. 
Honduras pays between $400 million and $450 million for its 
foreign debt per year, a total that amounts to 40 percent of the 
budget. Pino said the country's deficit amounts to 
approximately 2.3 billion lempiras (about $371 million), adding 
such a figure "is dreadful and unmanageable" (Panama City ACAN 
in Spanish 1833 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  The Economic Cabinet, consisting of Guillermo Bueso, Central 
Bank President Hugo Noe Pino, and Finance Minister Juan Ferrera, 
warned this weekend the people should brace themselves, because 
there will be currency devaluations every month. This is within 
a plan by macroeconomic strategists who seek to close the fiscal 
gap. (Tegucigalpa EL HERALDO in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p3) 
  According to the Honduran Central Bank Economic Studies 
Department, the wholesalers price index registered a 1.9-percent 
growth during the last quarter of 1993. It adds during all of 
1993 the wholesalers price index increased an average of 12.7 
percent more than the 10.1 percent of 1992. (San Pedro Sula LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p3) 
  According to the National Plan for Human Development, there 
is a deficit in the housing sector in view of the increasing 
demand and high housing costs. Statistics supplied by the 
Honduran Chamber of the Construction Industry show the housing 
sector reached 11.3 percent in December 1993. (San Pedro Sula 
TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Feb 94 p2) 
  The Economic Cabinet, headed by Central Bank President Hugo 
Noe Pino, met with a delegation of the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) On 14 February to assess IDB projects and 
learn about the new government's priorities. IDB representative 
Federico Alvarez explained this delegation will not establish 
investment or support programs, but that it is a job the 
Programming Commission will do. For his part, Planning Secretary 
Guillermo Molina said the projects portfolio is being reviewed 
to redefine the new government's priorities and aim them at the 
social sector, particularly the effort to fight poverty.
