  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- A bomb planted by 
unidentified individuals exploded in the car of Luis Garcia, 
mayor of the northern city of San Pedro Sula, but there were no 
casualties, the Honduran police reported today, 26 March. 
  According to reports, the explosive device was planted in 
the 
car driven by the mayor's son, Alexander Garcia, while it was 
parked outside the ``Casino Sampedrano,'' a nightclub located in 
the city's southeastern area. Garcia was with local politicians 
and businessmen. 
  The police said the bomb exploded at 2255 (0455 GMT), and 
the 
individuals responsible left a note that read: ``So the rich 
can also suffer,'' attributed to the Human Rights Defense 
Committee (Codeh]. 
  Mayor Garcia said ``there was no mishap.'' The blast damaged 
his car, but nobody was injured, although there were children 
nearby washing cars. 
  He said the individuals responsible for the attack are 
trying 
to mislead the police by attributing the explosion to Codeh, 
because it is absurd to think an organization which defends 
human rights is involved in acts of terrorism. 
  Garcia denied the attack had been aimed at him, and he 
expressed regretted that on the threshold of the 21st century 
certain groups believe in social violence. 
  Colonel Jose Martinez, commander of the 105th Infantry 
Brigade stationed in San Pedro Sula, said several individuals 
who may have been involved in the attack were arrested. 
  Garcia governs Honduras' second largest city located 242 km 
north of the country. [sentence as received] He took office 
last January following the Liberal Party's victory in the 
general elections of November 1983.
