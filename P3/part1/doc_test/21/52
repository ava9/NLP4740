  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar has announced a 
series of measures to prevent the illegal entry of foreigners 
into Honduras. These measures range from heavy sanctions 
against airlines that repeatedly transport them to the 
punishment of officials involved in the trafficking of illegal 
aliens. 
  These measures result from reports an international mafia 
operating from Honduras is involved in the trafficking of 
illegal aliens to the United States. 
  "The government's intention is to clean up public 
administration and whatever is associated with the Foreign 
Ministry in line with its fight against corruption in all 
fields," the minister has said. 
  According to the minister, there are names of people, 
including former officials, who are involved in this business. 
"Irregularities have been detected in the Honduran consulates in 
Hong Kong and Panama," the minister said. 
  "Both consulates are under investigation, and the 
responsible 
officials will, naturally, be punished," Paz has said. 
  He has said the name of a former Foreign Ministry senior 
officer from the previous administration was being used for 
illegal procedures. "The former officer is aware of this, and 
we are investigating the matter." 
  Paz has charged certain attorneys, whom he did not identify, 
handle the documentation of illegal aliens who arrive in the 
country. 
  On the other hand, the minister considers it unfair the 
United States should take steps against the new Honduran 
Government for cases that were not resolved during previous 
administrations. 
  Paz believes most of the claims show delays in the 
application of justice, "something which is linked to the 
general problem afflicting the Judicial Branch, which many 
believe should be brought up to professional standards to allow 
Honduras to offer legal security to foreign investors." 
  Meanwhile, the minister expressed pride over Honduras' 
diplomatic victory as a virtual nonpermanent UN member. 
  "This would be a resounding success for Honduran diplomacy," 
he expressed with satisfaction.
