  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- Cuba has called the forceful 
entry by a group of 20 people into the German Embassy in this 
capital early this morning as an obvious provocation. 
  Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has 
confirmed 
to PRENSA LATINA the illegal entry of 17 men and 3 women into 
the German Embassy by crashing a truck with Camaguey Province 
license plates into the iron gate of the embassy's garage. 
  Shortly after this incident, German Ambassador Georg Trefftz 
reported the incident to Cuban authorities and requested the 
presence of Cuban Foreign Ministry officials. 
  Luis Garcia Peraza, deputy director of the Europe Department 
of the Foreign Ministry, went to the embassy in representation 
of his ministry. The ambassador told him the occupants refuse 
to leave the site despite the fact he personally has urged them 
to leave immediately. 
  The German mission has its own security. PRENSA LATINA has 
learned that four guards are in charge of this embassy's 
protection. 
  Trefftz said he would keep the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
informed about the situation, although he has not given the 
names of the people inside the building. 
  Alfonso explained that the Cuban Foreign Ministry has 
reiterated the well-known Cuban position that this type of 
violation of diplomatic missions accredited in the country is 
unacceptable as an alternative to the legal procedures that must 
be followed to travel outside national territory. 
  Cuba considers this a provocation and also a carefully 
planned illegal action executed at the moment the president of 
Mexico was arriving in Cuba and on the eve of the 4th 
Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias. 
  The spokesman noted that the origin of this incident is the 
growing sense of frustration among people who form what he 
described as the anti-fatherland sector abroad, because of 
Cuba's victories in the international arena. 
  This also constitutes, according to Alfonso, additional 
evidence of the negative results of the United States policy of 
denying visas to people wanting to travel to that country.
