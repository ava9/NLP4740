  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Feb (PL) -- The Mexican daily LA 
JORNADA today reported that President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's government approved the appointment of Abelardo 
Curbelo as the new Cuban ambassador to Mexico. Curbelo will 
assume office in the next few days. 
  LA JORNADA cites statements by outgoing diplomat Jose 
Fernandez de Cossio, who said that "the appointment of the new 
Mexican ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello, was approved three 
days ago and that the appointment of the new Cuban ambassador to 
Mexico was also approved." 
  According to Ambassador Fernandez de Cossio, ties between 
the 
two countries "are fine in every sense and there is excellent 
communication. These ties are longstanding and very strong." 
  The Cuban ambassador said Abelardo Curbelo is currently the 
Cuban ambassador to Uruguay, and "will travel to Mexico City 
shortly." 
  Fernandez de Cossio hosted an official farewell reception 
for 
the diplomatic corps accredited in Mexico. Fernandez de Cossio 
has been ambassador to Mexico for the past 10 years. 
  Mexican Tourism Secretary Jesus Silva Herzog; Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, presidential candidate for the opposition Party of the 
Democratic Revolution; and Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez were among those attending the farewell reception. 
  Fernandez de Cossio stressed that "for reasons of mutual 
geographic interest, proximity, and cultural and historic 
similarities, the ties between Cuba and Mexico have always been 
particularly strong." 
  The Cuban ambassador also recalled the high degree of 
awareness the two countries have regarding the international 
situation and the role the United Nations should play, as well 
as other important matters of current interest. 
  "We must thank Mexico for the position it has maintained at 
the various international forums against all attempts to isolate 
my small island. This position has been an expression of 
friendship and solidarity which we value highly," Fernandez de 
Cossio said. 
  In conclusion, the Cuban ambassador reiterated the 
expressions of love and affection he has received in the 
approximately 10 years of being in this country. "I take with me 
memories and experiences that in these past few days have been 
heightened by the many expressions of affection I have been 
receiving and which can be summed up by the fact that I have 
been awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle."
