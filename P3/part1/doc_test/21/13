<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin in Washington </F>
by unidentified station reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We greet Colombian Foreign Minister 
Nohemi Sanin Posada, who is in Washington. Good morning, 
Foreign Minister. 
  [Sanin] Good morning. We are very sad over the loss of our 
ambassador to Honduras [Lucelly Garcia Montoya]. Words cannot 
describe the cowardly assassination of this great patriot who 
was our ambassador. 
  [Reporter] What official information do you have about it? 
  [Sanin] It is being investigated. She was a woman who served 
the country. She prepared the visit of the Honduran president 
[words indistinct]. She traveled quickly from Honduras to 
prepare it and asked us for leave to organize [words indistinct] 
all her personal matters. I awoke very saddened with the news 
that she had been killed. I am really very sad with the news. 
  [Reporter] Did she tell you that she had been threatened? 
  [Sanin] No, she never did, but she did tell me that she had 
never been happier than with this appointment. She said that 
for a long time [words indistinct] and she was happy. I have 
never seen someone so pleased, devoted to her job, and with 
great spirit. She knew well international affairs because she 
had been a member of the Chamber of Representatives' Second 
Commission. She was very knowledgeable in her field. She was 
good with little details [words indistinct] people. She was 
truly an important person for Colombia because of her knowledge 
of the field. She was a great woman. 
  [Reporter] That is how all Colombians are feeling. By the 
way, what are you doing in Washington? 
  [Sanin] Well, I am holding bilateral talks with the State 
Department. I will be meeting with Mr. Watson and Ambassador to 
the OAS Babbitt. I plan to talk with the 34 ambassadors to the 
OAS. I am talking about the possibility of President Gaviria's 
candidacy [to OAS secretary general] and about [words 
indistinct] the course that the OAS should take. The president 
has been receiving opinions not only about the vote but also 
about the OAS philosophy to see if these opinions agree with the 
president's view of what the OAS should be. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the debate that has 
arisen 
over the differences of opinion between the State Council and 
the president over the presence of U.S. soldiers in our country? 
Do you think all this debate, which many think has weakened the 
president in Colombia, can jeopardize Cesar Gaviria's candidacy 
for OAS secretary general? 
  [Sanin] No, I really do not think so. The fact is that in 
Colombia we are in the middle of an election campaign. For 
example, there are people who say there are Marines in Colombia 
as if it were not known that those are members of a Marine 
infantry corps which many times has been used as assault troops. 
As you said, military engineers or soldiers (?came). I totally 
agree with the president's viewpoint. I also totally agree with 
the defense minister in his explanation that perhaps the 
ministry did not provide good information about these military 
engineers. What is really going on? What must the country be 
told? Military members always train. They always undertake 
simulations of possible occurrences. When these actions are 
carried out with other countries, some of them are covered by 
international treaties. There is cooperation, technology is 
provided, and projects are carried out to train and to simulate 
situations that might occur, for example, an air attack. Then 
they would carry out air cooperation operations. For example, 
there is the Unitas exercise, which is staged in the territorial 
sea of various countries and all the navies agree to simulate a 
naval attack. On land, the engineers simulate circumstances and 
instead of building barricades or useless structures, they train 
by quickly building a school, a road, or a health center to show 
how quickly this can be done jointly through cooperation. In 
this way, they can show how our engineers and the engineers from 
the United States, in this case, can work quickly and resolve 
problems by simulating specific operations. 
  I think there was a shortage of information on the part of 
the government but I do not think that sovereignty was harmed in 
any case. The Colombian Armed Forces have always been in 
control of sovereignty. We have always acted in keeping with 
the principles of international agreements. [Words indistinct] 
information and a political use of the electoral situation in 
Colombia. I think the State Council has not condemned anyone 
because it has declared itself [word indistinct] and has 
remitted the circumstances to the Commission of Charges, but I 
am sure that with the explanations that the government has given 
based on international treaties and the military cooperation 
agreements, and the explanations that the government has 
obviously [words indistinct] internationally will be understood 
because all the countries of America and the world have 
international cooperation agreements. Through them, they 
jointly simulate situations that might occur and they work on 
training for them. It is like target practice, building a 
retaining wall, like any training that must take place because 
of military, security, or other circumstances. For example, in 
the area of radar, we do not have the required technology so the 
military engineers train the Colombian engineers. We cannot 
confuse this with sovereignty. 
  [Reporter] Madam Minister, was the Foreign Ministry 
consulted? Did you agree from the start with the presence of 
those U.S. soldiers in our country? 
  [Sanin] The Foreign Ministry did not have to be consulted. I 
was not consulted because this was based on existing treaties. 
Then, I would have to be consulted every day because every day 
[words indistinct] building (?naval) schools for example. Among 
the existing agreements.... [pauses] My staff would have to 
consult with the Senate and the State Council if it is meeting 
[word indistinct] the joint operations that have been agreed on 
with different countries. The Foreign Ministry was not 
consulted, nor do I think from a legal standpoint that the 
Foreign Ministry should have been consulted. These are normal 
training operations that are conducted, I repeat, to rehearse 
situations that may arise and allow our military engineers to 
resolve them quickly. Building a [word indistinct] quickly and 
effectively. That is what they are doing. 
  [Reporter] In reacting irately yesterday to the State 
Council 
position, President Gaviria defended the war on drugs, and 
(?almost) called those who disagree with him enemies of that 
war. My question is this: Why were the people not told from 
the start: soldiers are coming because they are cooperating in 
the war on drugs? Why didn't the government say what it was 
instead of something else that led to this controversy? 
  [Sanin] I think a mistake was made how the information was 
given. Part of this whole cooperation is the war on drugs. It 
is not the only thing, because they practice operations to face 
different kinds of circumstances, namely, the war on crime or 
defense of national security. Why did the president respond 
irately? Because [words indistinct] to be told that national 
sovereignty was violated. He is responding in proportion to the 
circumstances. The accusation is very grave, and we feel that, 
based on solid legal arguments and the existing military 
agreements, these exercises could be conducted without 
requesting the permission of the Senate or the State Council. 
Now, I share the defense minister's view that the country 
should have been told in a normal manner that U.S. military 
engineers were coming to participate in such and such training 
and operations. 
  On the other hand, we cannot comment on all military 
operations. Imagine, how could we fight crime if we were to 
announce that in such and such place a cooperation operation was 
going to be.... [pauses] that a telecommunications apparatus to 
monitor voices was located in such and such place. 
Technological cooperation to combat crime would not be 
effective then. These operations have to be kept secret and 
guarded by the military. The Foreign Ministry knew that for 
over 30 years these joint operations have been conducted. The 
Foreign Ministry has never been informed because they fall 
within a legal framework and treaties. I do agree with the 
president and the defense minister that the topic should be 
handled differently, and that the initial information given.... 
[pauses] They were not prepared for the question, certainly, 
and it was incomplete. They did not explain as they have now 
that these are training exercises. Instead of [words indistinct] 
building roadblocks that served no purpose, the military 
engineers are building a school, or a road, or anything to be 
able to efficiently build what may be necessary for a specific 
event. 
  [Reporter] The Council of State president's reaction to 
President Gaviria's position in the sense that the Council of 
State statement endangers international cooperation against drug 
trafficking was: Were they building a school or struggling 
against drug trafficking? My question is: Have you just 
confirmed that there is an operation against drug trafficking in 
Juanchaco? 
  [Sanin] Look, the activities in Juanchaco are related to 
cooperation in military engineering. There have been joint 
exercises simulating possible situations that include quickly 
and efficiently constructing facilities to handle specific 
situations related to drug trafficking crimes. Instead of 
wasting time building a barricade or a useless road, they are 
building a school and a health center for the community. 
  Within the cooperation agreements I have mentioned, 
obviously 
many are part of international cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. Why? Because fortunately today 
Colombia is not struggling alone. All recent successful 
actions, which fortunately have been recognized by the 
international community, have been carried out with technology 
from other countries, from several countries, that have made 
available to us equipment to track down the voices and locate 
the place where drug traffickers or kidnappers are hiding or to 
deal with situations that really endanger our national 
sovereignty, security, or citizens' lives. 
  There are no contradictions. They were in an operation 
involving military engineering and joint training. Both our 
military engineers and U.S. engineers were training together in 
harmony, learning how to quickly build facilities that could be 
necessary under a given circumstance, such as building a road, a 
base, and many other aspects a country may need for its defense. 
This joint training is based on existing agreements. Our 
engineers are acquiring new skills to build facilities quickly. 
They have experience and must practice, just as they jog, fly 
planes, or practice target shooting every day. It is part of 
their training to prepare them for the struggle against crime 
and drug trafficking, and to defend our national security and 
people's lives. There are so many circumstances we may have to 
face. There have been no lies, and there is no contradiction. 
The information was initially incomplete. 
  [Reporter] With regard to doing an efficient and quick job, 
yesterday, a group of journalists invited by the Defense 
Ministry visited the projects under construction by a group you 
described as military engineers in Juanchaco, and found out that 
the projects are incomplete and will not be completed before 28 
February, the date when U.S. soldiers and military engineers 
must leave the country. Does this mean their stay in our country 
will be extended? Definitely, they will not be able to meet the 
deadline. The supervisors have said that they will not have 
enough time between now and 28 February to efficiently and 
quickly complete their work. 
  [Sanin] Training means learning to do a job. I do not know 
if they are doing a good, bad, or fair job. That must be 
determined by the supervisors of the military engineers who are 
being trained, and the defense minister. The Defense Ministry 
must decide when they will leave. The decision must be made 
within the legal framework. I do not know if they will be able 
to complete the work they began. I hope they can. In any event, 
they are participating in a training program. When journalists 
are being trained, I do not know if their performance is good, 
bad, or fair. I know they must be trained, because they are not 
going to be asked to do a program without any training. This is 
a military training program during which facilities are being 
built for the benefit of the community. If they are not able to 
complete the work before they leave, at least they started it, 
and the community can do the rest. It was not a waste of time, 
no useless walls or roads were built. The training was an 
opportunity to build facilities for the benefit of the 
community, which in my opinion was good. Since they were going 
to learn how to build quickly, it would have been silly to build 
a barricade that would serve no purpose instead of a project 
that will benefit the community. 
  [Reporter] Madam Minister, the president of the Republic 
during a news conference yesterday upheld or upholds that the 
Council of State statement is a political statement. You have 
also said that in all these circumstance there is a political or 
politically biased climate. Is it not strange for those 
accusations to be made against the top body of administrative 
justice in Colombia given that the ruling was unanimous. The 
authors of that measure were 26 justices: 14 Liberal Party and 
12 Conservative Party members. 
  [Sanin] I have not seen the ruling, I have only seen the 
press communique that does not contain the legal arguments most 
certainly included in the ruling. I remove myself from the 
Council of State position, with all due respect, as this is the 
institution at the highest level on this issue. I totally 
remove myself because all these military cooperation agreements 
are contained within a legal framework established in agreements 
and treaties that have been in force for more than 30 years. 
  I want to repeat, however, I have only seen the press 
communique. I remove my myself from its concept because all of 
these military exercises are undertaken in all the nations 
within the same legal framework as ours; they do not attack 
sovereignty. [Words indistinct] meaning of something very 
important that should be known; transit and stationing of 
troops. By international law, a nation can lose its state of 
neutrality when it allows the transit or stationing of foreign 
troops to mobilize against a third nation. Therefore, the nation 
that allows that transit, that stationing loses its state of 
neutrality. We are not faced with any war situation with any 
neighboring nation or with the stationing of hostile troops. 
They are simply, as I said, training. They are training during 
military cooperation exercises in addition to cooperating in the 
struggle against drug trafficking and other crimes. That is the 
truth, that should have been said since the beginning. 
  [Reporter] In another turn or events, Madam Minister, the 
Venezuelan foreign minister has just said that Colombia and 
Venezuela could reach an agreement any moment now on the 
limitation of maritime and submarine areas. Do you agree? 
  [Sanin] There are some negotiating committees appointed by 
the nation made up of Colombians who are politically well-known 
and very well informed on the matter. I have hopes that one day 
we will find the solution to the limitation of the maritime 
areas. It is impossible, however, to give a date. What is 
important is to reach a balanced decision, accepted by both 
nations, convenient for both nations, thereby solving this 
conflict. It is very difficult to know when. However, my 
intentions are geared toward finding a solution.
