White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said President Bush has told him that 
there was no quid pro quo discussion of expedited military and economic aid to 
Honduras in return for that country's assisting the Nicaraguan Contras when 
Bush met then-President Roberto Suazo Cordova there in March, 1985. Documents 
released at the Oliver L. North trial have implied that Bush played some role 
in a U.S. plan to expedite aid to Honduras in return for its assistance to the 
Contras. White House officials said secret documents will be released to 
buttress the claim that Bush's visit was not part of the quid pro quo deal. 
They will include a State Department cable from then-Ambassador John 
Negroponte, which, Sununu said on NBC's "Meet the Press," "makes it very 
obvious that there was no quid pro quo."
