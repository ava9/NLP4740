  [Text] As Caracol network reported one hour ago, a 
Russian-made helicopter crashed shortly after taking off from 
the Tarqui Battalion headquarters in the town of Sogamoso. 
According to the information confirmed by authorities, the 
Tarqui Artillery Battalion commander, a counterinsurgency 
commander with the rank of major, a judge, her secretary, and a 
noncommissioned officer died in the accident. Several people 
were injured, three of whom were taken to San Jose Hospital in 
Sogamoso. The authorities also reported that the three 
helicopter pilots were Russian nationals. One pilot is injured. 
The information Caracol obtained indicates that three of the 
people taken to San Jose Hospital have been released. One of 
them will continue to receive medical attention but is out of 
danger. Here is German Garcia from Sogamoso with more details 
on the incident. 
  [Garcia] Sogamoso medical officials reported that three 
people were injured in the accident that took place at 1250 
today. Three persons are at Sogamoso Hospital and the Social 
Security's Julio Sandoval Medina Clinic. We have invited Dr. 
Fernando Ortiz, who is the emergency ward chief, to tell us 
about the victims' conditions. 
  [Ortiz] We treated two injured persons. One was a civilian. 
The other patient was wearing civilian clothes, but I understand 
that he is a serviceman. 
  [Garcia] Are other injured people being cared for in other 
local clinics? 
  [Ortiz] I have learned that another injured person was taken 
to the Social Security clinic. 
  [Garcia] What are their names? 
  [Ortiz] Excuse me, the Prosecutor's Office asked me not to 
divulge that information. As you can understand, I cannot 
provide those names. 
  [Garcia] Do you know if Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro 
Guevara was among those wounded? 
  [Ortiz] I do not think so. The colonel was not one of the 
two patients that were brought to this hospital. I do not know 
if he was the injured person taken to the Social Security clinic. 
  [Garcia] Reports indicate at least nine persons were aboard 
the helicopter. The three injured persons were able to jump 
from the helicopter 200 meters before it crashed. Luckily, 
nobody was in that area. Our sources told Caracol that Artillery 
Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro Guevara, two sergeants, two 
captains, one judge, her secretary, and one civilian who has not 
been fully identified were aboard that helicopter. Dr. Fernando 
Ortiz insisted that the Prosecutor's Office is not authorizing 
him to reveal the names of the people who were injured in this 
accident.
