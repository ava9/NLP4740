<F P=106> [Interview with Honduran Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, member </F>
of the Congressional Commission on Drug Trafficking, by Raul 
Valladares in Tegucigalpa; from "The Morning Paper" 
newscast--live] 
  [Text] Valladares: Good morning, we are talking 
with Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, a member of the Congressional 
Commission on Drug Trafficking. What can you tell the Honduran 
people when once again the country is mentioned in international 
news dispatches. This time, a former Colombian drug trafficker 
is saying that drug traffickers are protected in Honduras as 
well as in other countries. He also mentioned Mexico, Brazil, 
and the Dominican Republic. 
  Sosa: [Words indistinct] at some time some drug 
trafficker received some type of protection from some authority 
in Honduras. These types of people frequently appear at the 
[U.S.] Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry. 
Obviously, the more charges they make, the better it will go 
for them in the future. In 1989, we had a similar experience. 
We investigated the statement by a witness of Senator Kerry's 
subcommittee. He was a former Panamanian consul named Jose 
Blandon. On that occasion, the accusation dealt with the links 
of some Honduran military chiefs with former Panamanian dictator 
Noriega and drug trafficking. The accusation was investigated 
[words indistinct] I was able to testify and confirm to a 
Congressional commission chaired by Carlos Montoya that the trip 
of a Honduran military intelligence chief to Panama, during 
which he had some kind of verbal contact with General Noriega, 
was for the purpose of meeting with some leaders of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who at that time were 
in Panama because they did not have the legal status in their 
country that they now fortunately have. 
  Valladares: Who was accused? 
  Sosa: No [words indistinct] Honduran military 
intelligence, whose participation in these types of dealings was 
not confirmed. Therefore, I do not see why I should mention his 
name. I personally confirmed that the information was false 
because by chance I was the one who established contact with the 
late Guillermo Ungo so that this military intelligence chief 
would meet with him. Therefore, the trip to Panama and the link 
with Noriega had nothing to do with drug trafficking. It was a 
meeting with a Salvadoran guerrilla leader, which is what 
Guillermo Ungo was at that time. The U.S. Senate subcommittee 
and Attorney General's Office have the habit of making deals 
with drug traffickers, who know that the more statements they 
make, the more benefits they will obtain from the Attorney 
General's Office and the subcommittee. I am talking about this 
subcommittee. We experienced this situation with consul 
Blandon, who made these types of accusations. 
  The current accusation will have to be verified. I think 
[words indistinct], will have an opportunity to begin or 
continue investigations. The first thing will be to confirm 
whether [Colombian drug trafficker] Taboada, under his real name 
or alias, legally visited Honduras. Immigration documents will 
have to be checked for this. Contacts will also have to be made 
with the Senate subcommittee. I will consult with some of our 
U.S. friends to see to what extent these accusations involve 
Honduran authorities and at what level. 
  What we now have is the fact that our country was mentioned 
among others, such as Mexico, which in the latest State 
Department report have been recognized by the U.S. Government 
for their great efforts against drug trafficking. Now, in this 
testimony, it said that drug cartels are protected in Mexico. 
There have always been judges, police chiefs, and officials of 
attorney general's offices who at some time have been negligent 
or not done their duty and [words indistinct]. But I think the 
accusation must be investigated [words indistinct] is not the 
policy of the Honduran State, and no state organization protects 
drug cartels. This is an assertion by a witness at a U.S. 
Senate subcommittee. One does not know whether or not they are 
serious. I repeat that in the past we investigated these types 
of statements by witnesses at Senator Kerry's subcommittee, and 
we found them groundless. It was much ado about nothing.
