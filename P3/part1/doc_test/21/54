The Sandinista government accused two U.S. diplomats Thursday of encouraging 
labor unrest and ordered them to leave Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The action was a sharp setback to what officials of both countries had hoped 
would be an improvement of relations under the Bush Administration. It 
reflected the Sandinistas' concern over a wildcat strike by teachers and the 
prospect of growing labor upheaval in the months before the February, 1990, 
Nicaraguan elections. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto announced the expulsion orders after meeting 
with John Leonard, the U.S. Embassy's charge d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Embassy has increased its activities to promote and incite 
opposition groups and unions to make disturbances and disorders with the double 
purpose of impeding an economic recovery and the normal development of the 
election process," said a diplomatic note handed to the American official. He 
denied that any U.S. diplomat had acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Joel F. Cassman, the embassy's economic and commercial attache, was declared 
persona non grata and given 72 hours to get out of the country. Kathleen W. 
Barmon, a labor attache based in Honduras and also accredited to Nicaragua, was 
given 48 hours to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The government gave contradictory accounts of what they had done. The 
diplomatic note said they had met Wednesday with teachers in the northwestern 
city of Chinandega and "incited" them to join about 1,500 teachers on strike in 
a four-day-old wildcat action in scattered parts of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper, published a front-page photograph 
of the diplomats amid a crowd of men it identified as teachers. A banner 
headline read: "Yankee Interference in Chinandega." 
</P>
<P>
However, D'Escoto said he knew nothing about any meeting with teachers. He told 
reporters that two diplomats attended an opposition labor assembly in 
Chinandega and promised union leaders financial support if they would "unify 
among themselves and cause disorder, discontent and street demonstrations" 
against the revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Rejected 
</P>
<P>
"We reject those allegations completely and totally," Leonard said as he left 
the Foreign Ministry. "They were doing what diplomats normally do, meeting with 
people and learning about what is going on in Nicaragua. . . . Their actions 
were completely within diplomatic norms." 
</P>
<P>
Cassman said he and Barmon held an "informal meeting" with farmers at 
headquarters of the Labor Unification Central, a federation affiliated with the 
Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on a fact-finding trip," he said. "We were listening to their 
complaints about how hard life was, how they had been wiped out by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we saw this Barricada photographer hiding in a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Washington and Managua, deeply strained by the Reagan 
Administration's backing of the Contra insurgency here, hit a low point last 
July when U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats 
were accused of encouraging anti-government street protests, and expelled. In 
response, the United States sent home eight Nicaraguan diplomats from 
Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann. 
</P>
<P>
The day President Bush took office, Nicaragua offered to end the mutual 
blockade on visas for new diplomatic personnel, but it wasn't until early this 
month that new visas were granted -- three for Nicaraguan diplomats and four 
for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Cassman arrived here May 15 to take up his post. Barmon came this week on a 
temporary assignment, embassy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries have not yet agreed to exchange ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
D'Escoto charged that the Bush Administration is "moving slowly in the 
direction of normalizing relations" and blocking a three-month-old Central 
American peace accord. He said that a May 15 deadline for a plan among the 
region's presidents to close Contra military camps in Honduras had passed 
without action because Washington insists on keeping the now-idled rebels there 
as a potential military threat until after the Nicaraguan election. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything shows that we were too optimistic about Bush," the foreign minister 
said. "Much smells the the same. Reagan is gone, but the stench has not gone 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador of another Central American country who closely monitors the 
political opposition said he doubted that the Sandinistas' charges against the 
two American diplomats are true. Rather, he said, the Sandinista action seemed 
a reflection of "tremendous insecurity" in the government about its ability to 
manage an anti-inflation program that has cost 29,000 government jobs in a 
country of 3.5 million people since Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time they are faced with a conflict with the working class, they're 
getting into a very, very sensitive area," the diplomat said. "Anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega and other officials Thursday warned the nation's 36,000 
teachers, who belong to a Sandinista-led union, that they cannot be granted a 
significant wage increase because it would refuel inflation, which was running 
at 100% per month at the end of 1988 but was cut to 12% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers seeking wage increases of several hundred percent have broken with the 
union leadership and walked off the job this week in Managua, Chinandega and 
the coastal town of San Rafael del Sur. Hundreds of other teachers, who earn 
the equivalent of $10 to $13 per month in primary school and up to $30 per 
month in high schools, have threatened to join the strike.
