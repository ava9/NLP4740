  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (EFE) -- Ernesto Samper 
Pizano, who won the internal primary of the ruling Liberal Party 
to select the presidential candidate for the upcoming 8 May 
elections, appealed today for a "convergence to defend the 
excluded." 
  Samper Pizano, a 43-year-old Bogota attorney and economist, 
former financial leader, former senator, former minister, and 
former ambassador to Spain, won the ruling Liberal Party's 
"internal primary" and became the presidential candidate for the 
1994-98 term to replace President Cesar Gaviria. 
  "I am satisfied and happy with the results," Samper said, 
thanking those who voted for him in the primary, which was held 
simultaneously with the legislative elections. He said he is 
"committed with all Colombians of goodwill." 
  "Our challenge is to seek a new opportunity so the liberal 
ideas will continue to prevail to the benefit of all 
Colombians," Samper said. He vowed to return to the policy of 
credibility. If he wins in May he will head the third 
consecutive Liberal administration since 1986. 
  Ernesto Samper, whose victory will be affirmed on 18 March 
during his party's national convention, obtained 46 percent of 
the votes, beating Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lleras de la 
Fuente, Carlos Lemos, Rodolfo Gonzalez, David Turbay, and Gloria 
Gaitan. 
  Samper urged his rivals to "set aside our differences to 
join 
in the common task of reuniting, renewing, and transforming the 
party, to achieve a rapprochement," not in exchange for 
bureaucratic posts, rather, through "basic understanding." 
  He also announced the economic opening carried out by 
current 
President Gaviria, under whom Samper was development minister 
and ambassador to Spain, must be complemented by creating more 
jobs and "improving many Colombians' standards of living." 
  "The people have spoken and have shown they still trust 
Liberalism, its principles and ideas, as the best way to govern 
Colombia," Samper said. He said the liberal majority elected in 
the Congress today "must be confirmed by a triumph in the 
presidential elections." 
  "The people of Colombia, as in other parts of Latin America, 
want a change of course. They want more job opportunities and 
better living conditions for their families," the Colombian 
candidate stated. 
  Although the 8 May presidential elections will have 10 
candidates from different parties, Samper and Conservative 
presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana are favorites and have 
registered a "technical tie," according to recent polls.
