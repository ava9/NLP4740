<F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The United States has not suspended the exchange of 
evidence and judicial information with Colombia, Ambassador to 
Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan said today, denying reports by 
international news agencies concerning such a suspension. 
  The diplomat said on the contrary, new cooperation systems 
are being studied in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
  According to the Colombian ambassador to Washington, 
although 
there are some differences of criteria between our government 
and the United States over the policy of turning drug 
traffickers over to justice, no break in the exchange of 
judicial information has taken place. 
  [Begin Silva recording] I do not think this decision has 
been 
made, because until recently we have maintained an open and 
clear dialogue with U.S. authorities. At no time has this 
possibility been mentioned. 
  I have stayed frequently and closely in touch with U.S. 
authorities. During none of the official or informal meetings I 
have held with them have they informed me of such a decision. 
[end recording] 
  In the meantime, the attorney general has defended 
Prosecutor 
General de Greiff's administration and said the two countries 
are perfecting the judicial cooperation system. 
  [Begin recording] [Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta] 
The fact of the matter is that there are many people who would 
be interested in blocking this cooperation process. On one 
occasion I have said criminals are the only ones to fish in 
these troubled waters. 
  [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] There have been 
differences that are known to the public, but I trust we can 
embark on a great effort to build and create an atmosphere that 
favors the much-needed judicial cooperation in the international 
area. [end recording]
