  [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- Cuba's ambassador to 
Colombia, Jesus Martinez, affirmed today that Colombia is 
engaged in an international opening process and that in this 
context it is giving important consideration to its relations 
with Cuba. 
  The Cuban diplomat told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba's ties with 
Colombia, renewed in October 1993, are very positive and 
intense, especially in the cultural, commercial, and 
bilateral-cooperation fields. 
  He explained that the two sides have the will to strengthen 
relations and that his country also gives priority to its 
relations with Colombia. 
  When asked about the celebration of the fourth 
Ibero-American 
summit in the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias on 14 and 15 
June, the ambassador said that the Colombian authorities view 
that summit as the most important international meeting of the 
past few years. 
  Ambassador Martinez said that the fact that there were no 
high level meetings before the summit is very positive for this 
fourth Ibero-American summit. 
  He said that this Colombian initiative was viewed positively 
by the Ibero-American family. He noted that the idea is aimed 
at making possible more intense discussions among the chiefs of 
state in the context of the summit. 
  Regarding violence in Colombian streets, the ambassador said 
that the local Colombian authorities have said they will adopt 
strict security measures to prevent incidents that would mar the 
image the government wants to enhance. 
  He noted: That country is interested in demonstrating that 
violence and drug trafficking are not Colombia's most 
outstanding features, that since the adoption of the new 
Constitution there is a new Colombia, very different from what 
it was in the past. 
  The ambassador added: Colombia has always worked intensively 
in the framework of international organizations, but it is 
evident that during the government of President Cesar Gaviria 
there has been a will to intensify those efforts. 
  In the ambassador's opinion, the celebration of elections in 
Colombia this weekend will have no negative effect on the course 
of the presidential summit, which has been held in Mexico, 
Spain, and Brazil in the past.
