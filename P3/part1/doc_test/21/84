  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- A group of Latin American 
ambassadors stationed in Taipei Tuesday [24 May] urged the 
Republic of China [ROC] to encourage its businessmen to increase 
investment in their countries. 
  The envoys made the call during a seminar on relations 
between the ROC and Latin American countries sponsored by 
Legislator Cheng Chien-jen of the ruling Kuomintang. 
  The ROC has shared long-term friendship with Central 
American 
countries. Many of the 29 countries with which it maintains 
formal diplomatic ties are located in Central America. Due in 
part to geographical distance, commercial exchanges between 
Taiwan and the region, however, remain limited. 
  Paraguayan Ambassador Miguel Angel Solano-Lopez Casco said 
he 
regrets that many Taiwan companies, while ignoring his call for 
investing in his country, have made large investments in 
Mainland China and other countries or areas with which Taiwan 
does not have diplomatic ties. 
  Paraguay is the only South American country that 
diplomatically recognizes Taiwan. Lopez said Paraguay not only 
hopes to promote political ties with the ROC but also wants to 
strengthen bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  Taiwan businessmen's overseas investment activities do not 
seem to comply with the ROC Government's diplomatic policy, 
Lopez noted. 
  Speaking at the same occasion, Salvadoran Ambassador David 
Ernesto Panama [name as received] said mutual interests are key 
to maintaining longstanding diplomatic ties. 
  Panama said he appreciates all the assistance the ROC has 
given his country over the past years. He pointed out that his 
country has also suffered from its close ties with Taiwan, 
saying that Mainland China has boycotted his country's 
activities in the United Nations and secretly supported leftists 
in El Salvador. 
  Panama said he is willing to play the role of "go-between" 
to 
help prospective Taiwan investors launch new ventures in his 
country. "I also hope the ROC Government can actively encourage 
local businessmen to invest in El Salvador," he added. 
  Ambassadors from other Central American countries, including 
the Dominican Republic and Honduras, also attended the seminar.
