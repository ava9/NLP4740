  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 8 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia accepted here today a 
proposal made by the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army 
to mediate the conflict that has been going on in this 
southeastern region of Mexico since 1 January. 
  "I accept the proposal to serve as a mediator," said the 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, in 
reference to a communique issued by the armed group published by 
the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA on Saturday. 
  Official reports indicate that nearly 100 people have been 
killed and an undetermined number injured since the armed group 
occupied several towns of the region known as Los Altos de 
Chiapas last Saturday. 
  Bishop Ruiz Garcia talked about "the urgent need to take 
specific steps toward a true consolidation of peace" and said 
that in these times of "sorrow and hope" we must act "with 
responsibility." 
  In the communique the armed group proposed a "public and 
written" dialogue with the government with the mediation of 
Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
Mexican journalist Julio Scherer, director of PROCESO magazine, 
and Ruiz Garcia.
