  [Text] Brussels/Geneva, 13 Feb (DPA) -- Colombia suffered a 
major diplomatic setback and was isolated in the "banana war" 
when it unilaterally announced the withdrawal of its demands to 
the GATT, and the EU disregarded its urgent request to maintain 
the quota distribution offer made in December 1993. 
  New and significant details were disclosed the weekend of 11 
February regarding the desperate diplomatic efforts made on 10 
and 11 February by Colombian Ambassadors Carlos Alberto 
Marulanda in Brussels, and Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez in Geneva 
following Costa Rica's withdrawal from the group made up also of 
Nicaragua and Venezuela. 
  In a last and desperate attempt to convince the Europeans to 
maintain the quotas, Colombia sent a letter to GATT disclosing 
its decision to withdraw its demands against the questioned 
European regulations for banana imports so long as the EU offer 
was still standing. The letter was accompanied by a new offer 
made by the Colombian Government to the EU, which proposed a 
23.4-percent increase in the relative percentage of the total 
quota for Costa Rica while for Colombia the quota was set at 21 
percent, for Nicaragua, 3 percent, and for Venezuela, 2 percent. 
  The EU ignored the Colombian request, from this sterile 
fight 
among the Latin American countries and decided definitively to 
withdraw the 14-December offer once the decision by the GATT 
committee of experts was revealed on 11 February in Geneva. 
This decision declared the EU regulations for banana imports 
discriminatory and in violation of international trade rules. 
  Rene Steichen, the European commissioner for agricultural 
affairs, said that the formula that proposed an increase of the 
quota to 2.2 million in 1995 and a distribution of quotas and 
licenses among the Latin American exporting countries had been 
discarded because two of the exporting countries, namely Costa 
Rica and Guatemala, had not accepted it. 
  In this manner, Colombia's position, which it had secretly 
negotiated with the EU, fell apart and at the same time 
compromised Nicaragua's and Venezuela's position, two countries 
that had supported Colombia's stance. 
  A diplomatic source close to the other countries (Colombia, 
Nicaragua, and Venezuela) indicated that Costa Rica's attitude 
caused "considerable unease" within the group. The weakening in 
this group's position reinforced the stance held by Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico who are challenging the 
European import system and have presented a counterproposal 
consistent with GATT regulations and currently under evaluation 
by the EU. 
  Diplomatic sources have pointed out that Ambassador 
Marulanda's performance, the obvious proponent of the secret 
negotiations held last year during a three month period with the 
EU in Brussels, is fully backed by President Cesar Gaviria and 
his Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos. It has been 
learned that Marulanda is expected to return to Colombia in the 
next few days in response to his government's summon. 
  Since last Wednesday, the Governments of Ecuador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Panama, and Mexico increased their high-level contacts 
with Costa Rica following President Gaviria's and Trade Minister 
Santos' unsuccessful bid to persuade Ecuadoran Vice President 
Alberto Dahik, currently visiting Santa Fe de Bogota, to adhere 
to Colombia''s thesis. 
  Following the inevitable failure of the quota offer made by 
the EU (which was brought about by Colombia's initiative), the 
Latin American countries are now once again trying to close deep 
wounds and restore lost unity. The announcement related to the 
fall of the quota offer was made to the Latin American foreign 
and trade ministers on Thursday in Brussels by Commissioner 
Steichen himself when they delivered the counterproposal. 
  Costa Rica was the first country to realize in time the need 
to reaccommodate its diplomatic position in light of the 
strength of the other countries' initiative which is supported 
within the GATT by Brazil and now also by the United States. 
  GATT General Director Peter Sutherland and EU Commissioner 
Leon Brittan were advised of the U.S. position by Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. Sutherland is attempting to 
reschedule the 25 March deadline for an earlier date in order to 
present proposals to improve the Uruguay Round offers (which 
will finally be signed on 15 April in Marrakesh, Morroco). The 
negotiating period with the EU expires on 28 March, before 
experts committee decision on the banana issue is passed to the 
GATT contracting parties council. 
  There is the likelihood that negotiations between Latin 
American countries and the EU will take place sometime before 27 
March. With the EU withdrawing the quota offer made on 14 
December, the original offer No. 404 made in March 1993 on the 
import system in effect since 1 July of last year remains 
standing. 
  A better offer could rise from new negotiations between 
Latin America and the EU which is in an uncomfortable position 
as well as under pressure that the technical committee decision, 
which establishes a poor precedent as regards international law, 
will be made public during the meeting between the 117 GATT 
member countries. 
  There are several formulas circulating around Brussels as 
well as Geneva diplomatic and technical circles, including one 
by the German Government, another by the U.S. Senate, in 
addition to a counterproposal by a group coordinated now by 
Guatemala. This proposal includes an assistance fund for those 
banana producing countries who are signatories of the Lome 
Treaty (Africa, Caribbean, and the Pacific).
