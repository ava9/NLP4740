  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Government of 
"Honduras rejects an invasion of Haiti," a high-ranking Honduran 
official has told U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and 
Southern Command Chief General Barry McCaffrey. 
  Honduran Vice President Walter Lopez Reyes told NOTIMEX that 
"Honduras disagrees with a forceful invasion of Haiti" and that 
he voiced this position to the U.S. military leaders who arrived 
in Honduran territory today. 
  Perry and McCaffrey arrived at the Palmerola Military Base, 
where they met with Foreign Relations Minister Ernesto Paz, 
Government Minister Efrain Moncada Silva, Vice President Walter 
Lopez Reyes, and Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua 
Elvir. 
  Lopez Reyes made assurances that the government of President 
Carlos Roberto Reina would be willing to cooperate with a 
mission to restore peace in Haiti requested through a UN or OAS 
resolution. He said that military leaders in the Clinton 
administration have never asked Honduras to support an invasion 
and that they only requested our "opinion" on the Haitian 
situation. 
  Another topic discussed by the Honduran and U.S. officials 
was the future of the U.S. base in Palmerola, located in the 
central Department of Comayagua. This installation was built in 
1983 when anti-Sandinist armed groups in Nicaragua, known as 
"contras," used Honduran territory as a base to launch their 
armed operations with U.S. financing and aid. 
  This base legalized the U.S. military presence in Honduras, 
and its construction cost over $30 million. "We talked about 
the future of Palmerola as a regional counternarcotics training 
center," Lopez Reyes pointed out. Honduras is unable to 
maintain this base, and thus, the vice president admitted that 
it could hardly be transferred to Honduran hands. Palmerola 
will also be used by the U.S. National Guard and Army Reserves 
to train in engineering and civilian-military operations, Lopez 
Reyes added. 
  He denied that the United States will transfer to Honduras 
the 82d Airborne Division, which invaded Grenada in 1983, 
because there has been no thought of transferring the Southern 
Command (headquartered in Panama) to Palmerola, as was reported 
in this capital. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will head for Puerto 
Rico today, after visiting Panama and Honduras, and he will 
return to Washington on Sunday.
