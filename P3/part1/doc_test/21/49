    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional public health and epidemiological 
developments monitored through 13 May. 
<H5>  Ecuador </H5>
  Diphtheria -- Ecuadoran Health Minister Patricio Abad 
announced on 12 May that a diphtheria epidemic that appeared in 
Ecuador at the beginning of the year is subsiding and it is 
expected that it will be eradicated in the next few weeks. The 
minister reported that four Ecuadoreans have died since the 
onset of the epidemic. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2255 GMT 12 May 94) 
<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  Meningitis -- Benjamin Bloom Hospital yesterday reported the 
first case of meningitis in the country, a four-year-old girl 
from Cabanas Department. Health Minister Lisandro Vasquez 
announced that his ministry cannot face an epidemic situation 
because it does not have the necessary vaccines and those 
available on the market cannot be acquired by the poor 
population. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 6 May 94 
p 17) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Cholera -- The Health Ministry reported on 9 May that 608 
Guatemalans have died of cholera and more than 50,000 have 
acquired the disease since it arrived in Guatemala in 1991. 
According to the report, in the past few days at least 13 
persons have died and 1,000 became ill with cholera. (Panama 
City ACAN in Spanish 1559 GMT 9 May 94) 
<H5>  Honduras </H5>
  HIV/AIDS -- The Honduran health authorities today reported 
that in April, at the national level, 85 persons acquired the 
HIV virus that produces AIDS. The report reveals that since 
1985 there have been 3,494 AIDS cases and that there are 1,090 
asymptomatic carriers of the disease. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
1659 GMT 11 May 94) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  AIDS -- It was reported on 8 May that according to 
information obtained by the National Council for the Prevention 
and Control of AIDS there are at least 17,732 Mexicans who 
either are carriers of AIDS or already have AIDS symptoms. It 
is believed, though, that thousands of other infected persons 
have not reported their disease and that there could be 
approximately 27,000 persons with AIDS. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
0006 GMT 9 May 94) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  AIDS -- The health minister of Nicaragua announced on 13 May 
that in Nicaragua there have been 133 cases of AIDS, including 
the 10 cases that have been detected since January. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 1705 GMT 13 May 94) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  AIDS -- Eleven persons have died in Colon from AIDS during 
the first 14 weeks of 1994. The people want to know if the 
increase in the number of persons with this disease has anything 
to do with the temporary presence of women from the Dominican 
Republic and Colombia, and that of military personnel from 
countries where AIDS is at epidemic proportions. (Panama City EL 
SIGLO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 5) 
  AIDS -- Regional health director Aurelio Ranger has reported 
to LA PRENSA that two AIDS cases have been detected in Penonome, 
Cocle Province. Rangel reports that in all of 1993 there was 
only one AIDS case in the province. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 8 May 94 p 8A)
