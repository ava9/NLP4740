  [Text] San Salvador [words indistinct] Armando Calderon 
Sol assumes office, ROC [Republic of China] Ambassador Andrew J. 
P. Shen said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  "The ROC and El Salvador have enjoyed long-term friendly 
ties 
and this relationship is not expected to change under Calderon's 
leadership," Shen told the CNA in an interview. 
  During his visit to Taipei last October, Shen said, Calderon 
assured senior ROC officials that he will strengthen cooperation 
with the ROC and support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations 
if he wins the presidential election. 
  "Calderon was pleased when I told him recently that Premier 
Lien Chan would attend his inauguration," Shen noted. Lien, who 
served as ROC ambassador to El Salvador in the 1970s, is an old 
friend of Calderon. 
  Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, will arrive in San 
Salvador Tuesday night to attend the inaugural ceremony 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
  After a 12-year civil war, Shen said, the Central American 
country badly needs international assistance to rebuild its 
battered economy. 
  El Salvador provides many incentives, including a 10-year 
tax 
holiday, to attract foreign investors, Shen noted. "I hope more 
Taiwan businessmen can invest here to help boost this country's 
economic development." 
  Shen said Taiwan companies can use El Salvador as a gateway 
to the North American market because the United States imposes 
no quota restrictions on Salvadoran products. El Salvador has 
also joined with Guatemala and Honduras to sign a "free trade 
agreement" with Mexico to allow freer flow of commodities in the 
region. 
  There are some 10 Taiwan-owned companies in El Salvador, 
mainly producing garments for export. 
  Shen said there is still ample room for Taiwan-Salvadoran 
trade to grow. Taiwan exported US$20.7 million worth of goods 
to El Salvador in 1992, while importing US$50 million worth of 
Salvadoran products.
