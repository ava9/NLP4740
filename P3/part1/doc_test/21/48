  [Text] Caracol has just obtained the text of the letter 
sent by Gabriel Silva Lujan, Colombian ambassador to the United 
States, to U.S. Senator John Kerry regarding the senator's 
repeated criticism of the surrendering to justice policy and the 
interpretation and implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by 
the Prosecutor General's Office. In a strong response to an 
article by Senator Kerry, which was published in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday [6 April], Ambassador Silva Lujan has stated: As 
you acknowledge, the Colombian Government differs in opinion 
with the Prosecutor General's Office, an independent office 
which is part of the judicial branch. These differences, 
Ambassador Silva Lujan has admitted, are still significant; 
therefore, he added, de Greiff's opinions on the negotiation of 
sentences and legalization of drugs do not represent those of 
the Colombian Government. 
  As I have said in the past, Gabriel Silva added, the 
Colombian Government will oppose the surrender of drug 
traffickers under conditions that are inconsistent with their 
level of criminal guilt. Furthermore, the Colombian Government 
has not supported, does not support, nor will support the 
legalization of drugs as a strategy in the antidrug struggle. 
  We at Caracol must add that Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's position on this topic is 180 degrees different from 
that of Colombian Ambassador Silva Lujan in that letter. 
  In his two-page letter, whose original was in English and 
whose translation was obtained by Caracol, the ambassador added 
the Cali Cartel's greatest achievement would be to provoke a 
breakdown in judicial cooperation between the two countries. In 
his document, the ambassador also vehemently rejected the 
assertion Colombia is a narcodemocracy: Colombia, the oldest 
and most politically stable democracy in Latin America, has been 
maintained despite the narcoterrorists' attacks. The Colombian 
people have made enormous sacrifices in defending their 
democracy. Your hasty assertions are an affront against 
Colombians' courageous commitment to their institutions. 
  In his letter to Senator Kerry, Ambassador Silva also denied 
the senator's assertion the Cali Cartel has significant economic 
interests in the sectors of banking, finance, shipping, mining, 
coffee, petroleum, and flowers. The ambassador has said such 
assertions are unacceptable and groundless: It is untrue the 
Cali Cartel controls the most important sectors of the Colombian 
economy. These sectors are formed by respectable businessmen and 
companies, many of which have permanent relations with the 
United States. As in other countries, including the United 
States, organized crime seeks to infiltrate certain sectors of 
the legal economy, but this does not mean it controls some of 
these sectors or that the government tolerates its presence. 
  Colombian Ambassador Silva has also said Kerry's statement 
that the Cali Cartel controls important elements of the 
Colombian media is false: For a long time, courageous 
journalists have been at the forefront of the crusade against 
drug traffickers. Investigative journalism in Colombia has 
played a fundamental role, revealing the illegal activities of 
drug-trafficking organizations. For this reason, many 
journalists and media have been victims of the drug cartels' 
kidnapping, assassinations, and terrorist attacks. In short, 
you have cast an undeserved shadow of doubt over the integrity 
of the Colombian private sector and media. 
  The ambassador also referred to the corruption linked to 
drugs, stating this proliferates not only in Colombia but also 
in the United States; in fact, the ambassador added, according 
to the report on public integrity of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, more than 5,000 federal employees have been found 
guilty of corruption between 1970 and 1990. 
  This is the vigorous official reply by Colombian Ambassador 
in Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan to Senator Kerry, who again 
attacked our country in an article in THE WASHINGTON POST 
yesterday.
