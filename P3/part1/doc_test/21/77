  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina proposed here today to create 
authoritative organizations with economic integration 
decision-making power. He invited other countries to stimulate 
the creation of an Ibero-American Economic Community. Speaking 
during the first session of the Fourth Summit of Ibero-American 
Heads of State and Government, which opened on Tuesday in this 
Colombian port, Reina extended an invitation to endorse "the 
gradual and progressive creation of an Ibero-American Economic 
Community." 
  "The leading role played by commercial enterprises in the 
new 
interdependence schemes should not lead us to think that this 
role ends with the creation of free trade or tariff-free zones," 
he said. Reina pointed out that the Central American countries 
are willing to negotiate commercial agreements jointly with 
third countries and establish a shared economic policy "based on 
sustainable development." 
  According to the Honduran president, the proposed alliance 
between Central America and the United States for sustainable 
development is "the pioneering creative framework" for a 
regional economic integration process. He expressed his desire 
that the multilateral agreement, which was reached during the 
so-called Summit of the Americas, to which the United States 
invited all of the regional countries with the exceptions of 
Cuba and Haiti and which is scheduled to be held in Miami in 
December, be signed. 
  Reina, who is participating in an Ibero-American summit for 
the first time, also asked for the recognition of developmental 
differences among countries that participate in economic 
convergence processes. Regional interdependence "can take place 
only within the context of equality in which all costs and 
profits can be shared equitably ," Reina said. According to 
Reina, development imbalances are compatible with integration 
processes, "provided differences in the countries' 
competitiveness are recognized and taken into consideration at 
the time of the negotiations." 
  Tomorrow, the 22 heads of state and government, in addition 
to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso, will close 
the Ibero-American Summit in this Colombian Caribbean port 
located 1,200 km away from Santa Fe de Bogota.
