  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- In addition to 
attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Cuban President 
Fidel Castro has conducted an intense program of bilateral 
meetings that surpasses those of previous summits. 
  PRENSA LATINA has learned that the Cuban president met with 
the leaders of Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. For Cuba, 
these meetings have been useful and appropriate. 
  The situation in Cuba and in other countries, as well as the 
contents and purpose of the Ibero-American summits, were the 
topics that prevailed during these meetings. 
  It was learned that the Cuban president and his Honduran 
counterpart, Roberto Reina, met early this morning and that the 
meeting was very good. Cuba and Honduras broke diplomatic 
relations in 1961 and since then only some sports and commercial 
exchanges, as well as exchanges at the parliamentary level, have 
been conducted. 
  The leader of the Cuban Revolution, the center of attention 
during this summit, also met with Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy.
