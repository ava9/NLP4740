  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 10 Mar [date as received] (ACAN-EFE) -- 
Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso Discua has ordered the 
reinforcement of the nation's border with Nicaragua and ordered 
troops to answer "with force" any armed groups of Nicaraguan 
recontras. 
  A clash with these groups left three people dead on 8 April. 
A Honduran corporal and two Nicaraguan guerrillas died in the 
clash between a recontra group and the 9th Infantry Battalion 
headquartered in Ojo de Agua in northeastern Honduras. 
  Colonel Hernan Seaman, 9th Infantry Battalion commander, 
told 
ACAN-EFE: "At dawn, the border had an increased military 
presence because of Gen. Discua's orders. He ordered us to use 
force and to repel the recontras to guarantee the safety of 
people residing along the border." 
  The officer said the armed Nicaraguans who entered the 
country "are criminal contra fighters who hid their weapons 
following their 1990 demobilization." He added: "They are 
currently attacking small businessmen, whom they targeted when 
the contras were in Honduras, and are murdering peasants, raping 
women, and raiding border towns." 
  According to a Honduran military report, some 12-15 men 
brandishing "AK-47's, FAL rifles, and RPG-7 grenade launchers" 
opened fire on an Army patrol on 8 April in the area of 
Chilamates along the Nicaraguan border. Seaman pointed out that 
Cpl. Santos Armando Dominguez, 21, died during the clash, as 
well as two "recontras"; other attackers were wounded and 
returned to their country. Cpl. Rodriguez was buried today in 
the eastern city of Danli with honors corresponding to a "hero 
who died while carrying out his duties." He was posthumously 
promoted to sergeant. 
  Seaman also said that two weeks ago, two recontras attacked 
a 
Buenos Aires woman, whom they murdered by shooting her in the 
mouth after stealing her television and radio. They later fought 
with one of the victim's sons, who wounded one of the recontras 
with a machete. The other recontra then shot the son. 
  Col. Seaman added that Nicaraguan authorities were notified 
and that the two recontras were apprehended at a Nicaraguan 
border town. He said that thanks to the Nicaraguan authorities' 
cooperation, relatives of the slain woman will now be able to 
take the alleged perpetrators to court. 
  The Nicaraguan Sandinist People's Army (EPS) has already 
been 
notified of the 8 April incident between Honduran military 
personnel and an armed group that, according to Seaman, could be 
linked to the recontras' 3-80 Northern Front led by Jose Angel 
Talavera, a.k.a. "El Chacal." The armies of the two Central 
American countries are carrying out joint exercises along their 
common border to counter movements by armed groups in the area.
