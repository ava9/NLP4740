<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron; from "The Morning </F>
Paper" newscast] 
  [Text] After participating in the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit of Heads of State and Government, Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina returned to the country very optimistic. 
The economic arena was the predominant subject at this meeting 
of presidents. 
  President Reina said that Central America has much to gain 
and can even obtain some benefits in keeping with the other 
economic blocs that have been formed. He was asked about the 
benefits that Honduras and the Central American region, in 
particular, can obtain from this meeting and replied: 
  [Begin Reina recording] Central America's treatment in trade 
treaties vis-a-vis the other economic blocs. For example, in 
the face of NAFTA, all of Central America is endeavoring to 
obtain parity. This means that in the Caribbean Basin and in 
Central America we can achieve integration with the area that 
encompasses Mexico, the United States, and Canada. That is a 
very specific point. Another specific point is the 
capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic 
Integration [BCIE] with extraregional partners. This will 
permit the bank to dedicate a large amount of funds to our 
country's development, affording the treatment that 
international law, trade, and integration can provide. It is an 
asymmetrical treatment. This means that the same conditions are 
not going to be required of all the partners. For example, for 
Central American products and Honduran products, particularly, 
asymmetry would mean that products that are not strictly of 
Honduran origin can leave the country, because part of the raw 
materials come from abroad. That asymmetry would help 
enormously within the old concept of Central American 
development, which is a form of balanced development. 
  This does not mean that the most developed countries are 
going to wait for the less developed. No, the development of 
the less developed countries is expedited in order to balance 
them all off later in a big push toward development. Those 
specific points are very important and very encouraging in our 
country's development. [end recording] 
  President Reina also noted that another important 
achievement 
was the fact that the BCIE achieved more capitalization through 
extraregional partners. Also, he met with Commander Fidel 
Castro. We asked him what he discussed with Castro. 
  [Begin Reina recording] It was strictly a courtesy call. I 
was accompanied by four or five persons when receiving him. Our 
talks were very general. He was very interested in learning 
about Honduras. He recalls that Jose Marti visited Honduras. 
He remembers that patriot Gomez was also in Honduras. That 
offers us the perspective that we are neighbors of Cuba at a 
time when the Inter-American system should resolve that problem. 
  I had the opportunity to present this on behalf of Central 
America. For me the case of Cuba, which has been sanctioned by 
the OAS, should be resolved within the OAS. That is the 
appropriate forum for resolving this problem. This holds true 
especially now that a great Colombian, President Cesar Gaviria, 
is now the secretary general-elect of the OAS. He can again 
provide a golden era for that continental organization, as was 
provided by his illustrious predecessor [Former Colombian 
President] Alberto Lleras Camargo. 
  Let there be no doubt, it was a courtesy visit by a chief of 
state to another chief of state on the occasion of a summit. 
Second, the solution of the Cuban problem is through the OAS. 
Those two points cover your question. [end recording]
