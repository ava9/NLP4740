Watch for actress Kim Basinger to branch into singing . . . appear in European 
commercials . . . and star in a film opposite pop star Prince. Those are some 
new career wrinkles, industry sources tell us, after her recent decision to 
leave agent Rick Nicita at CAA and attorney Barry Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
Basinger's defection set off a scramble among CAA's competitors for her 
business. But for now, insiders report, the $2 million-a-picture actress is 
relying heavily on guidance from Prince, with whom she's been romantically 
linked. (Prince, recall, covered some songs from "Batman," in which Basinger 
co-starred.) 
</P>
<P>
Basinger also is getting career advice from her new attorney, Gary Stiffelman, 
at Ziffren, Brittenham &amp; Branca -- Stiffelman also happens to represent 
Prince. The firm, which handles a range of rock stars, is well-positioned to 
steer Basinger into a recording debut.

<P>
Meanwhile, Basinger is out of a project at Fox, "Sleeping With the Enemy," that 
was set to begin filming in February. The actress, sources say, was unhappy 
with the latest version of the script for the Joseph Ruben-directed thriller, 
and was concerned about committing to a project without knowing who her male 
co-star would be. Nina J. Easton
