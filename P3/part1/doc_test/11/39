LIZ SMITH: CHER HAS HER EYE ON A REVEALING ROLE: GYPSY ROSE LEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

THE FABULOUS Cher won an Oscar for "Moonstruck," but she still has a child's 
delight in taking on roles that afford the chance to dress up and carry on like 
a mad thing. (Catch Cher in "Mermaids," and you'll see what I mean.) 
</P>
<P>
But now the star has optioned a work that will afford the opportunity to 
"undress" and carry on. Cher is interested in portraying Gypsy Rose Lee, the 
legendary stripper of the '40s. No, she won't do a remake of the musical 
"Gypsy," but Cher has her eye on the Eric Preminger book "Gypsy and Me," a 
true-to-life, Auntie Mameish-type tale of a boy and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Eric is the son of the late Gypsy and movie director Otto Preminger. He was 
born out of wedlock when such a detail could kill a career. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has ever done total justice to the totality that grew to be Gypsy Rose 
Lee -- stripper, philosopher, socialite, writer, painter, actress and sister to 
another great talent, June Havoc. This is a role Cher should really be able to 
sink into -- up to her hips. 
</P>
<P>
KIM BASINGER doesn't have warm and cuddly memories of making "Batman." She 
tells Lawrence Grobel in Movieline that "Jack Nicholson made money. 
Peters-Guber, they made money. And Warner Bros., of course, made money. But 
none of the rest of us made anything. We got raped; everybody did. It was a 
rape deal; it really was." 
</P>
<P>
Kim says she wasn't just another pretty face in "Batman." She claims to have 
made contributions to the script: "I saw what was missing from 'Batman.' I saw 
the reconstruction work that should be done . . . so I just rewrote a lot of 
this crap." (Take that, screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren.) 
</P>
<P>
Kim isn't entirely dour and serious in this interview. She talks of her sexy 
public appearances and how she selects what she wears -- low-cut, transparent, 
split up the front items. "I dress mostly for me. And I find myself dressing 
for the fans, because they have fun. What does the word movie STAR mean, 
anyway? It's not a medical student. It's a movie star, right?"
