'PARADISE' ECHOES NOYCE'S SOFTER, GENTLER TOUCH 
</P>

Hard on the heels of Phillip Noyce's smashing new sea-and-sex chase thriller 
"Dead Calm" comes a much different movie, one which Noyce shot several years 
ago: "Echoes of Paradise" (Fine Arts). 
</P>
<P>
In "Calm," Noyce shows that he knows how to make a smoking melodrama. In 
"Echoes of Paradise," he's trying something softer, gentler: a psychological 
love story about an Australian mother and wife (Wendy Hughes) who leaves her 
would-be politician husband after discovering his incessant infidelities and 
takes up with a Balinese dancer (John Lone) in a Thai tourist paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to cauterize her own pain and humiliation, Hughes' Maria McAvoy drifts 
into a languorous, little alternative community: with the homosexual 
hotel-owner, Terry (Rod Mullinar) and his seductive and ambiguously charming 
guest, Raka (Lone). As she falls, or slides, into an extramarital affair, Maria 
has the self-conscious stance of an uncertain actress, edging into a 
bewildering role. Raka and Terry, theatrical to the core, manipulate their 
performances more adroitly: Raka with a silken, lazy ease; Terry more 
flamboyantly, with witty lines and troubled eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Do some directors keep making the same film, in various guises? Both of Noyce's 
recent films are about triangles, about a husband and wife kept physically 
apart after a crisis in their marriage, and with a third male character -- 
strange, sexually aggressive, possibly with a pathological edge -- coming in to 
roil the waters and to keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Calm" was like "Knife in the Water" with an electric chainsaw; it was all 
swift mechanics, with a technical gleam that burned your eyes. "Echoes of 
Paradise," written and executive-produced by Noyce's wife, Jan Sharp, digs 
deeper into its characters. It keeps its edges cloaked in mist, the sunlight 
dropped and filtered in a latticework of Asian shadows, the love scenes 
unfolding serenely, by candlelight. Both lovers are on vacation, Raka on an 
extended retirement from the stage, and Noyce and Sharp give us a sense of what 
happens when ordinary time hits a stop. 
</P>
<P>
It's a subtle film that doesn't make any obvious errors. And it has two 
splendid, all but faultless, leading performances -- by Wendy Hughes and John 
Lone. They mesh seamlessly, quietly reversing our usual conceptions of 
male-female movie personas. Despite her soft, wounded expression, Hughes' 
acting has the keener edge, the more aggressive, searching attack, while Lone, 
in a role that predated "The Last Emperor," gives his Raka more rounded, 
voluptuous contours, a honeyed smile, eyes like flaming liqueur. 
</P>
<P>
But, somehow it doesn't go far enough, doesn't open up enough possibilities. 
Like the wife, this movie is somewhat trapped; it has lovely moments, but it's 
restrained, hemmed in -- and the cinematography, by Peter James, is a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy and muted and soft, it suggests Maria's repressed home life when she's in 
Australia, but, in Thailand, it doesn't change. It doesn't release you into the 
hot exoticism of her new surroundings, or suggest, even subliminally, the 
danger, glamour or flukey romance that might be sucking her in. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what the film suggests is that interludes are dangerous, that marriage 
is a serious affair, that the world outside can never be avoided. But "Echoes 
of Paradise" (MPAA rated R, for sex and language) also tries for the poetics of 
the unplanned impulse. It's a shame that more of its moments aren't up to 
Hughes' and Lone's best. You're left at the end with two finely delineated, 
perfectly etched performances and a mood that stays languorous, pensive, 
drifting. The paradise vanishes and only the echoes remain. MICHAEL WILMINGTON
