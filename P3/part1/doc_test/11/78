After Mary Tyler Moore's television series, "Annie McGuire," died quietly on 
CBS two years ago, the warm, familiar star silently stepped out of sight too. 
Frustrated by CBS' handling of the show and the shortage of roles for women 
over 50, she sold her production company, MTM, and built a country house in 
Upstate New York with her husband, Robert Levine. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid vegetable gardens and horses and dogs, Moore -- "Mary" to most of 
America -- did something that 35 years on the stage and screen have mostly 
prevented: She enjoyed her role as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily have the guts to take advantage of all the freedoms that I 
have," Moore said. "For example, when I was a co-owner of MTM, I never -- as 
Jane Fonda and a number of other actresses do -- developed my own projects. I 
just wanted to act. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have this country place, I love the serenity, and the gardening, 
and the horses and, you know, I practically carry on conversations with trees." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was taking a break on the set of the black comedy "Thanksgiving Day." The 
"NBC Monday Night Movie" depicts an off-center family coping with life after 
the death of their father, played by Tony Curtis, who drops dead in the 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is Moore's second this month -- "The Last Best Year" co-starring 
Bernadette Peters aired two weeks ago on ABC. The previous time that Moore 
starred in a dramatic television project was in 1987, in the NBC miniseries 
"Gore Vidal's Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are probably fewer roles written for women of a certain age, as 
they used to say," the five-time Emmy winner said politely, her hands folded in 
her lap. Moore spoke from inside her air-conditioned trailer on a dusty, 
stifling day in Malibu Canyon. Her hair was clipped comfortably short, and she 
wore tight faded jeans and a halter top, revealing a taut stomach that belied 
her 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
The former dancer traditionally has played women much younger than her age, but 
she says those days are over, as evidenced by her role as an eccentric widow 
trying to strike out on her own in "Thanksgiving Day." 
</P>
<P>
"What Mary shows is that women over 50 are still sexy, and are still funny, and 
are still vital," co-writer and producer Jeff Buhai said. "In one scene, she 
has a fantasy love dance in a supermarket with Nitro," one of the beefy stars 
of the syndicated "American Gladiators" TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that she can still portray youth, but "not without an awful lot of 
effort. I mean, they'd have to get out every light made in Hollywood and put it 
at just the right angle for me to play a young woman." 
</P>
<P>
After the beloved "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" folded in 1977, Moore dabbled in 
misfired TV series and variety shows, finding film success in "Ordinary People" 
and Broadway nods in "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and "Sweet Sue." She was also a 
hit in TV movies, notably "Heartsounds" with James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Moore was welcomed back by critics in "Annie McGuire," a subtle adult 
TV comedy series without a laugh track. But in a thicket of such fresh TV faces 
as Roseanne Barr and Candice Bergen, CBS scheduled the new thoroughly modern 
Mary in an 8:30 p.m. time slot, after the slapstick "Van Dyke Show" sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some genius thought that would be a nifty idea -- They're back to back 
and back together," Moore said, referring to her years on CBS as Laura Petrie, 
the perky wife on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" from 1961-66. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't belong in that time period," she said. "We weren't a children's 
show. We were aiming for a sophisticated audience, and we should have been on 
at 9 or 9:30 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she would ever return to television in a series, she resounded: 
"No! I really am not interested in doing a series again. What I'd like to 
continue -- well, no, it's just so damn disappointing . . . I'm just not going 
to do that again. I'm not going to put my blood and sweat and tears into 
something, and then have no control over the final and most important aspect of 
the making of a series, which is where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
In person, turning her emotions inside out, Moore was not unlike one of the 
sensitive, courageous women she often portrays. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffer . . . from low self-esteem," she said. "I mean, I'm getting better at 
it. God knows I ought to, by this time, with a lot of self-analysis and 
searching. I used to make myself the center of every disaster, and always blame 
myself whenever a project went wrong. But that can really be the result of a 
big ego." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she is currently arranging a movie-of-the-week package with one of 
the networks and wants to do more feature films. 
</P>
<P>
"I've turned down quite a few (scripts). Not as many as I'd like. I'd like to 
be able to say I've turned down every script that was offered to anybody, but 
there are those long fallow periods where nothing is offered. And at those 
times I revert to my old ways and say, 'Well, of course it figures, because I'm 
not talented, and I'm not likable, and nobody wants me, and it's over."' 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Moore projects will come. In the meantime, what is the actress really 
looking forward to? 
</P>
<P>
She smiled distantly. 
</P>
<P>
"A new asparagus crop." 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving Day" airs Monday, 9-11 p.m. on NBC.
