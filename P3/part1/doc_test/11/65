Racks of colorful dresses, business suits, pants, blouses and night gowns with 
tags from Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullocks, Nordstrom and Neiman-Marcus sit baking 
in the sun outside Kirstie Alley's trailer on the Warner Hollywood lot. Inside, 
between scenes of Carl Reiner's lastest film, "Sibling Rivalry," Alley jokes 
and fusses with her wardrobe people, there to outfit her for the sequel to last 
fall's blockbuster "Look Who's Talking," which will begin production just as 
she completes her work in Reiner's comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to start on "Look Who's Talking II" in Vancouver the day after 
I wrapped here," Alley says in her distinctively raspy voice. "I told them, 'No 
way.' So now I think I have one whole day off to fly up there." She pauses, 
setting up the joke as she's learned to do over the past three seasons as the 
neurotic and obsessively chaste bar manager on NBC's durable hit series, 
"Cheers." "I'm a really big star now, you know. I really do have that much 
power." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aphrodisiac for most actors, though, is not power, but feeling 
wanted. And Kirstie Alley, the 35-year-old star from Kansas whom Ted Danson 
describes as "a biker chick crossed with an earth mother," is a wanted woman. 
Alley may not have been able to finagle many days off this summer, but the 
directors of both "Sibling Rivalry" and "Look Who's Talking II" wanted her 
badly enough to shuffle their shooting schedules to accommodate her busy acting 
life. 
</P>
<P>
She shot Reiner's movie, which will open in October, during May and June. She 
shot the sequel to her one and only blockbuster, scheduled for a Christmas 
release, right after that. And with a break only long enough for an appearance 
in Maria Shriver's recent prime-time celebrity special, Alley has already 
returned for another eight months of "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a cocaine addiction that she kicked before coming to Hollywood 11 years 
ago, despite never having acted in a comedy before "Cheers" and despite the 
overwhelming failure of her last film, "Madhouse," Alley is, according to 
Reiner, about to burst into the elite ranks of comic actresses. Earlier this 
month, as if to prove his point, Alley received her first Emmy nomination as 
best actress in a comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
All this for a woman who could have ruined "Cheers" when she replaced Shelley 
Long in 1987 after forgettable roles as a sultry alien in the movie "Star Trek 
II," an antebellum beauty in the TV miniseries "North and South" and an uptight 
goody-two-shoes teacher in "Summer School." But the much-beloved sitcom 
survived, and even thrived, with Alley managing the bar. Last year, "Cheers" 
won the Emmy for best comedy series; this past season it ended up the third 
most popular program on TV behind only "Roseanne" and "The Cosby Show." Then, 
last fall, Alley teamed with John Travolta and director Amy Heckerling in one 
of the year's biggest and perhaps most surprising smashes, "Look Who's 
Talking," which earned nearly $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very graceful and ebullient and she's funny," said Reiner, taking a 
break from a newspaper crossword puzzle while waiting for his crew to light the 
next shot. "Off the set she cracks everybody up. She's a real cutup. She's 
always thinking funny, and with people like that, you can really use them and 
embellish upon their creativity. She has everything every comedian has had from 
Carole Lombard to Jean Arthur. I'm really going to miss her on my next picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this too much?" he asks, interrupting his foray into hyperbole. "It's not 
too much because it's the same thing I tell my wife. Just watch Kirstie for a 
few minutes. You'll see it." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, Kirstie Alley performs. First, with co-star Bill Pullman, she 
does several takes of a scene in which they argue over who is best equipped to 
remove a condom from a man who died in the throes of passion. As Reiner yells 
"Cut!" for the final time, Alley leaps onto the mannequin corpse as if jumping 
on a runaway horse and pretends to make raucous love to it. Most everyone on 
the set doubles over with laughter. Reiner rushes Alley to the playback monitor 
so she can witness her lusty shenanigans herself, and the entire set erupts in 
belly laughs again. 
</P>
<P>
"She's outrageous," Danson said. "She has this wonderful combination of being 
incredibly vulnerable and extremely outrageous. She knows no fear. Most of us 
walk around concerned about how people perceive us, but she is totally 
unconcerned about that. She's one of those people who is not afraid to do 
anything in life, and her acting, I think, is becoming more and more like her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Alley is afraid of photographers, actually -- so concerned about the way she'll 
look on camera or in stills that the "Sibling Rivalry" crew built a special 
horseshoe-shaped light, covered with blue plastic gel, that fits around the 
movie camera and casts her in soft, pretty hues. When a photographer arrived on 
the set to snap her picture for this story, she insisted that he use her 
special light. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it's odd that Alley, at this point in her career, would go to such 
extremes to manage her image. Of course, no actor, no matter how much they 
protest, is free from that deadly sin called vanity. They have to be at least a 
little vain to get up on stage in the first place. But it was Alley's looks -- 
that big brown hair, those catlike blue eyes, that hard biker-chick/ice-queen 
attitude -- that prevented any director from considering her for a comedy role 
before James Burrows took a chance on her in "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to do comedy films because those were the movies I loved 
growing up -- Doris Day and Rock Hudson and Tony Randall and movies like 
'Pillow Talk.' I loved those romantic comedies," Alley says. "But everyone 
thought I was so serious and such a tight-ass. My agent would say, 'Would you 
consider Kirstie for this role?' and they would go, 'Oh yeah, right, she's real 
(expletive) funny.' They don't believe you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, let's face it, we're not dealing with rocket scientists here. If 
someone has not seen you do it before, they assume that you can't do it. I 
think that they forget that actors are people that act. They want to see you 
only in one way, and I don't know if that's based on your looks or what, but 
it's like after I did 'Star Trek,' I was offered every alien part you could 
possibly fathom. I was the girl who played aliens. So that's why I've avoided 
anything even remotely connected to sci-fi." 
</P>
<P>
Alley admits that she took "Cheers," even though she was relishing a bunch of 
movie offers at the time like her girl-in-trouble part in "Shoot to Kill," 
hoping that it would launch her into the world of comedy films. "Don't most 
actors do that?" she asks. "I mean, the ideal scene is features. But 'Cheers' 
is the best learning experience I could have ever had. I always had an instinct 
for comedy because I knew I was funny in my life, but I had no idea about props 
or physical comedy or even how loud I should speak. Jimmy Burrows would give me 
little bits -- a little shtick here and there -- and that's how I learned." 
</P>
<P>
Burrows, "Cheers' " principal director and one of three executive producers, 
said that they made a conscious effort not to hire a "comedienne" to replace 
Long when she decided to jump full-time into features. He had seen Alley in a 
production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Mark Taper and was struck by her 
"hot and sultry" presence and her "great voice." And, Burrows said, the 
original idea for the character of Rebecca, the bar's new boss, was that of a 
tough, beautiful martinet. The humor would emanate from Sam's growing 
instability over her cool and unwavering rejection of his sexual advances. They 
didn't think they needed someone already facile in the fine art of sitcom 
humor, and Alley, even though the characterization perpetuated the image of her 
as the hard, sultry vixen, fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Burrows said that from her first show, Alley surprised them with her own 
scatterbrained neuroses. In that first episode, Burrows said, Alley was 
supposed to enter her office, but she had a terrible time just opening the 
door. "From that minute," Burrows recalled, "I realized that there was 
something to be tapped there. So we started to write to that neurosis, and she 
became funnier and funnier." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Alley a sought-after comic actress, Burrows said, "is that you don't 
see it coming. She's got that hair and that face, and you don't think a woman 
who looks like that should be funny. And yet she is. Comedy is surprise, and 
comedy coming from this sultry woman surprises you and makes you laugh that 
much harder." 
</P>
<P>
Danson admitted he was nervous about having to work with a new actress and 
learn a "new dance step" after his partnership with Long had proven so 
successful. But Alley, he said, plunged into the show with a reckless 
"chutzpah" and "really did breathe new life" into it. 
</P>
<P>
And, her calculated professional moves paying off big, she breathed life into 
her film career as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers" helped her get "Look Who's Talking" and myriad other offers, Alley 
said, and "Look Who's Talking," her first leading film role and a surprise 
bonanza for Tri-Star, raised her salary. But in the media hoopla over John 
Travolta's "comeback" and director Heckerling's return to the acclaim she 
enjoyed with 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," Alley was largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from the production office in Vancouver, British Columbia, 
where she was about to begin directing the sequel, Heckerling said that Alley 
appeals to audiences because "without being weak, she has a certain 
vulnerability. And without being gross, she can be funny. A lot of the time, 
women who are funny are not attractive or feminine. She has all of that and 
she's funny." 
</P>
<P>
But the director bristled at reminders of all the stories in the press last 
fall slighting Alley, focusing instead on the "comebacks" of Travolta and 
herself. "Where were we before this supposed comeback?" she asked, calling that 
kind of attention "something that just makes you angry." When pressed about 
Alley's role in the success of the film, Heckerling sarcastically replied: 
"Let's see, 3% was the script, 70% was Kirstie, 12% was John. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Alley is more composed when discussing the media's skepticism over her ability 
to bring in the masses. After all, there's no denying that with "Cheers" she 
stepped into television's equivalent of a souped-up Ferrari that had already 
roared its way into the Nielsen Top 5. On "Look Who's Talking," she was teamed 
with a man who once was one of the world's biggest movie stars, but the ad 
campaign focused on the film's gimmick: a talking fetus/baby with voice 
supplied by Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
With a not-so-stellar cast and a not-so-clever gimmick, "Madhouse" flopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with a quiet, quiet success," said Alley, who is married to 
former "Hardy Boys" star Parker Stevenson and is now pregnant with their first 
child. On "Cheers" this season, her condition will be written into the plot. 
"In the first place, my part in 'Look Who's Talking' isn't, like, this great 
acting feat. We're not talking 'Sophie's Choice' here. I think that the goal, 
especially if you're a woman, is to set yourself up with successes, however 
they come, so that you can get the kind of movie you want to do green-lighted 
and into production. It's much harder for a woman to get a movie into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics are that women's movies just don't make as much money as men's 
movies, and this is a business that is about making money, right? Even when a 
woman has a huge hit, she always seems to have a hard time getting any credit 
for the success. I notice that in all of those big Spielberg movies, none of 
those women were ever catapulted anywhere. Maybe if you could get a woman 
character that was Rambette, then you'd have something. But who wants to play 
Rambette? Men are silly. They'll play anything." 
</P>
<P>
What Alley really wants to play is a small-town Kansas trailer park queen. "I'm 
always playing someone who is from a higher income level than I knew growing 
up. A little more sophisticated, a little better educated than I am," said 
Alley, who, to quell deep-seated insecurities, developed a cocaine addiction 
while working as an interior decorator in her hometown of Wichita, Kan., in the 
late 1970s. She kicked her habit with the help of a cold-turkey rehab program 
before moving to Los Angeles to become an actress. She is now the national 
spokesperson for Narconon -- the program she credits with saving her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more of a handle on that kind of babe from Kansas than all these other 
women I'm always playing, and I do have a real desire to act that, to show that 
side of me." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, Alley was ready to show off that wild side Danson finds 
so charming. With the ease of a practiced movie star, she ushered her young 
personal assistant off to hire a car to take her to a private party for rock 
star David Bowie. "Make sure it's a town car, not a limousine," she called 
after him, suddenly remembering her high-profile celebrity-activist 
participation in environmental causes. "It doesn't look too good to preach all 
this concern for the environment and then show up in some superstretch limo." 
</P>
<P>
Then, turning to a female member of the "Sibling Rivalry" crew, she wistfully 
revealed her secret desires for the evening. "I hope Billy Idol is there. I 
just want to sit there and stare at him."
