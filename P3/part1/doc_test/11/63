SARAFINA] (15) Darrell James Roodt
Spring is here, give or take two months, and it is time to fall in love. As
this week's movies show, anyone can do it anywhere. Dog trainers do it,
sopranos do it. Scotsmen surrounded by cattle do it; even grunge rockers in
Seattle do it. You can do it at home or at work. You can even drive deep
into the country to do it, so long as your car starts.
Or your movie, as the week's first love entry demonstrates. A special branch
of the AA should be on 24-hour duty to rescue British road movies from
breakdown or ignition failure. But where exactly should they attach the jump
leads in Soft Top, Hard Shoulder - to the first item or the second?
The soft top belongs to Peter Capaldi as the pea-brained hero, scion of an
Italian-extracted Scottish ice cream firm who is motoring from London to
Glasgow for Dad's 60th birthday and (tsk, tsk, mercenary fellow) a promised
inheritance. The hard shoulder belongs to Elaine Collins as the Scots girl
he picks up en route in his battered sky-blue Triumph. To cry on this icy
gamine's shoulder is to weep on a glacial moraine. At least until she begins
to melt a little - but there, we are giving away the story.
Shot on a wide screen without matching panache in the use of colour or
lighting (cameraman Henry Braham, director Stefan Schwartz) the film seems
at first an unwieldy gas-guzzler with seen-better-days bodywork. But do not
run away: it is also, after a short struggle, charming. As England melts
into Scotland and the film gets over its starting troubles (Frances Barber
as a caricature publisher, too much let's-set-up-the-story), the plot turns
into a modern-dress 39 Steps: two likeable oddballs handcuffed together by
fate while even odder balls come out of the scenery. I especially relished
the old widower who runs a bed and breakfast and shows the newcomers round
with a bad-news pronouncement on every stair: 'My wife choked on a Penguin .
. . My mother came here to die . . .'
Capaldi, who also screenwrote, is winning beanpole with a doleful line in
Italo-Scottish epigrams. And Collins, who would vanquish all rivals in a
Frances De La Tour lookalike contest, is tartly funny as the un-gentler sex.
Man Trouble is another odd-couple romance with ignition trouble. But this
time the engine coughs impotently for the whole 100 minutes. The premise of
Carole Eastman's screenplay - good heavens, did she once write Five Easy
Pieces? - is straight out of a game of Consequences. Guard-dog trainer Jack
Nicholson meets opera singer Ellen Barkin in sun-kissed Los Angeles. He says
to her (in essence), Do you want to rent a dog? She says to him (in
essence), Thank you, I'll take the German Shepherd and I think I'm falling
in love with you. The consequence is . . .
Well, the consequence is the movie. Bob Rafelson - good heavens, did he once
direct Five Easy Pieces? - urges his stars to make funny faces as their
vehicle stutters through farce, romance, an all-sorts supporting cast
(Beverly d'Angelo as Barkin's kidnapped sister, Harry Dean Stanton as nutty
crook) and much covert sermonising about gender politics and sexual
role-playing. In short - but if only it were - a mess.
Seattle, as you will know if you have been there, is a major centre of
Grunge Rock. So it is no wonder that grunge rocker Matt Dillon, in the film
Singles, is adored by blonde single girl Bridget Fonda, whose friend and
neighbour is handsome Campbell Scott, who has taken a shine to emotionally
bruised chance encounter Kyra Sedgwick, who has been loved and left by an
on-the-make Spaniard. And now, as the saying goes, read on.
As the music track fills with Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and Soundgarden (never
heard of any of them but grunge rock friends tell me they are big),
writer-director Cameron Crowe choreographs this fast-growing daisy chain of
amours. Crowe's first feature Say Anything was a riotously charming comedy
about love across the American caste system. Poor boy John Cusack met rich
girl Ione Sky and the twain had many a mishap trying to bridge the chasm
between Ivy League and Poverty Row.
But Singles is too many plots competing for one charm franchise. Crowe runs
from one romance to the other like a conjuror with his spinning plates, but
the only charisma on offer is of the 'Keep smiling at all costs' kind. Signs
of strain are evident in the over-mathematical matchmaking and the winsome
asides-to-camera. (Film-makers should give up the idea that the same matey
rapport can exist between a movie character and his audience as between
their live theatre equivalents.)
However I liked the safe sex party that enjoins guests to 'Come dressed as
your favourite contraceptive.' And please note director Tim 'Batman'
Burton's piquant cameo as a dating agency video-maker dubbed 'the new Martin
Scorsese.'
Sarafina] is the one film of the week in which no one 'meets cute'. But that
is no commendation. The Soweto-set South African musical has stepped off the
stage into the quicksand of location shooting. The sinking feeling is
instantly recognisable. Massed singalongs and fervent knees-ups by the black
schoolchildren who are both chorus and main characters - including pretty,
progressively politicised Sarafina (Leleti Khumalo) - erupt all over the
township and surrounding desert. Yet these big musical scenes always seem to
be falling out of frame, upscreened by the vaster sky and heat-shimmering
scrubland.
Whoopi Goldberg throws herself wholeheartedly into the mayhem, as the
schoolteacher for whom South African history began with the first black man,
not the first over-celebrated white man. (Cue appropriate classroom scene
with no yawning children.) A machine-gun behind her fridge at home signals
Whoopi's guerrilla sympathies and connections, but also telegraphs her early
demise at police hands. After that it is songs and torture scenes in roughly
equal measure.
Director Darrell James Roodt, adapting the hit show by Mbongeni Ngema (of
Woza Albert), has no idea how to unify its tone for the screen; or, if unity
is impossible, how to make the razzmatazz-versus-verismo contrast seem
pointful rather than accidental. When artifice and reality are passed
simultaneously before the camera lens, its eye will always focus sharply on
the second, turning the first into a frothy blur. So here. Sarafina] the
fledgling docudrama kicks the life out of Sarafina] the would-be musical.
The last film of the week should have been Man Bites Dog. But I never got
there. Stuck between Clapham South and Clapham North for twenty minutes - to
a Trappist silence from London Transport - I knew all hope of seeing the
week's most curious-sounding film was draining away. I shall review it, LT
willing, next Thursday.
