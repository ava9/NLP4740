COOL RUNNINGS (PG)John Turteltaub
THE PELICAN BRIEF (12) Alan J. Pakula
Is it good to be gay? For Britain, the sight of Hollywood and the House of
Commons jumping on the same bandwagon in the same week must be the most
startling - and/or stirring - of modern times. Westminster gives us a new
age of consent. Tinseltown with Philadelphia gives us a new age of
moviegoing awareness. And even Uncle Oscar has clambered on the zeitgeist,
with a best actor nomination for the film's star Tom Hanks.
Hanks has this writer's vote. His believability as an Aids-ravaged,
job-dismissed lawyer gives shape and measure to the film's at times
flood-level sentimentalism. The first mainstream US movie ever to tackle
Aids, Philadelphia is directed by Jonathan Demme as if he had been abducted
by Gay Lib and forced to make amends for his Silence Of The Lambs. You
recall that brouhaha: film pilloried by agit-gays right up to Oscar time for
its picture of a (seemingly) homosexual serial killer.
Philadelphia takes a lawyer and crosses out 'seemingly.' Hanks's face
already shows the tell-tale blots of Kaposi's Sarcoma when a job superior
asks 'What's that on your forehead, pal?' Hanks mutters something about
squash balls, but we know better. He is losing weight; his gay friends are
offering make-up tips ('Tahitian bronze' to hide the lesions); and the film
is offering captions like 'Nine days later' to stress that this is ticking
time-bomb territory, where love and illness meet in a countdown to
apocalypse.
While half our brain hardens itself to the threat of hyperbole, the other
half senses something wonderful here. Ron Nyswaner's script plots the film
as a legal suspense story, using courtroom scenes to resolve Hanks's
unfair-dismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the
payroll and torn up partnership promises. This is just the populist approach
 -what filmgoer resists a trial? - to capture all those gay-rights-resistant
audiences in America's Bible belts or Britain's own bigotry zones.
Hanks's co-star Denzel Washington adds another twist to the plot. He is the
radical black lawyer who agrees to be Hanks's legal Galahad, even though the
one flaw in Mr W's liberalism is a tendency to homophobia. While we are
turning to mush during Hanks's big self-revelation scene - a surreally-lit
fantasia in which our tearful hero expounds the Maria Callas aria keening
from his CD-player while he 'dances' with his dripfeed stand - DW looks on
with a blend of cautious scepticism and heterosexual high anxiety. (By the
film's final fade, of course, he has resolved his problems and become as
mushy as the rest of us).
To have made this character a black was a touch of genius. It means that Mr
and Mrs Intolerant Filmgoer, if they want to make an anti-gay alliance with
one of the film's characters, must do so with a member of another 'minority'
they might not be on kissing terms with. Only alternative: to side with the
bigwig bigots (Jason Robards and Co) who spend the movie's second half
pinned to their attorney's table while the camera frisks them for guilty
reaction shots.
Philadelphia knows every trick and plays it. But it will still send all but
the stoniest cineastes sniffling from the theatre. Its heart is in the right
place and whatever else may be sorcery or special pleading, Hanks is the
real thing: no sentimental martyr but a messy, plausible collage of rage,
bewilderment, self-pity, resignation and gallows humour. That puckered baby
face, that elastic voice with the built-in shrugs, preside over a
convincingly wasted body: one from which Hanks shed 30 pounds for filming,
in acting's most heroic dietary crash-course since De Niro went the other
way in Raging Bull.
Philadelphia comes with a big, bold, bells-and-whistles subject. 'Ah, an
Aids movie]' - everyone can say it. But what is Kafka, the second film from
director Steven (sex, lies and videotape) Soderbergh, about? Limping into
London two years after it was made, this Prague-filmed fantasy about Franz K
(Jeremy Irons) and the Gothic adventures he might have had if he had been a
fictional character, chasing murderers, mutants and mad doctors, is like two
hours on a free-association couch in the 'K' section of the Great Literature
library.
Screenwriter Lem Dobbs must have said 'Kafka' to himself and then gone
berserk at his mental word-processor. He gives us vast clickety-click
offices; a pair of sinister twins; Theresa Russell as one of FK's
standard-issue teasing heroines; Alec Guinness and Ian Holm as assorted
authority figures; and a riot of cobbled streets, graveyards and beetling
castles. What we do not have is a plot, unless you count the jumble of
conspiracy shenanigans that climax somehow in a castle laboratory.
Soderbergh and Dobbs may feel they must pay their dues to German
Expressionism, but why should we pay to watch? We tire quickly - and a
perplexed-looking Irons looks as if he tired even more quickly - of the
in-joky names (Murnau, Orlok) and invocations of art gone-by.
Other choices this week are the non-pretentious Cool Runnings and the
somnolently zigzagging The Pelican Brief. The first is all about the
Jamaican bobsled team that made history when they competed at the 1988
Calgary winter Olympics. Four sun-black West Indians, played by actors whose
names seem to have fallen off a Scrabble board, parlay their home-town
sprinting and go-kart skills into the art of hurtling down snow chutes.
A film that might have been 'inspirational' proves 'inspired'. Debut
director John Turteltaub has a comic timing that Hollywood veterans might
envy, and the script rattles around like a crowded bobsled risking sharp
corners. Boldest touch of all was to cast fat and funny John Candy as the
team's trainer, an ex-Gold Medal winner, and then to fill him with a sour,
abrasive, worldweary wit worthy of Walter Matthau. A surprise; a delight.
Neither of those words suggests itself for The Pelican Brief. You remember
the twists and thrills in the John Grisham-based The Firm? Repeat here, with
diminished returns. Julia Roberts is the fledgeling lawyer who flies
straight into a Giant Conspiracy, beginning with the murder of two Supreme
Court justices. And the supporting characters are famous Hollywood names
pushed unceremoniously into the victim or villain lobby - Sam Shepard, John
Heard, Robert Culp - while the plot dashes through every picturesque
power-corridor it can find, ending up at the White House.
The only character you believe in is Denzel Washington as Miss JR's newsman
friend, flying out from Philadelphia to sketch in another sharp-nosed knight
errant. As for Roberts herself, I never felt I was watching a frightened
truth-seeker, more an actress drowning in too much plot. Alan J. Pakula, who
could direct films like this in his sleep (All The President's Men, The
Parallax View), seems to have done so here.
Finally, a brief hat-doffing to the success of these islands at the recent
Berlin Film Festival. The Golden Bear for best film placed its paw on In The
Name Of The Father. The Golden Bear for best actress hugged Crissy Rock in
Ken Loach's new Ladybird, Ladybird. (Mr Hanks got best actor for
Philadelphia). And Loach himself won the International Critics Prize for his
truth-based drama that for all its bureaucracy-walloping OTT tendencies -
multiple mother (Miss Rock) keeps losing babies to overzealous social
workers - had more energy than all the other films in Berlin put together.
