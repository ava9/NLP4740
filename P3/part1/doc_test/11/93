Paced by a horror anthology, a movie about Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and a 
dramatic series about soldiers in Vietnam, HBO dominated the nominations for 
the 11th annual ACE Awards Thursday, the cable industry's version of the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
HBO grabbed 103 of the 338 nominations from the National Academy of Cable 
Programming, with "Tales from the Crypt," the pay-cable network's series of 
horror stories, leading all programs with 16 nominations. Its movie "Murderers 
Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story," which won an Emmy last month for its 
teleplay, was the second-most recognized program with 10 nominations, while 
"Vietnam War Story" placed third with 8. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's spoof of televangelism, "Glory! Glory!" garnered 6 nominations, including 
acting honors for Ellen Greene, Richard Thomas and James Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
With "It's Garry Shandling's Show" paving the way with 7 nominations, including 
3 for its writing staff, Showtime's 29 total nominations made it the second 
most-honored cable service. The Disney Channel came in third with 23, Arts 
&amp; Entertainment had 21, CNN and ESPN tied with 18, TNT nabbed 17, Lifetime 
and TBS each tallied 13 and the Discovery Channel rounded out the top 10 with 
11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty different cable networks, including local sports service Prime Ticket, 
received at least one nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"Not Necessarily the News' " Lucy Webb, who has won the ACE for best actress in 
a comedy series four consecutive years, picked up yet another nomination. Her 
streak might be in jeopardy this year, however, as she runs up against 
Emmy-nominated Blair Brown, the star of "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," 
which moved from NBC to Lifetime earlier this year and grabbed 5 ACE 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Awards in the high-profile categories will be presented during a ceremony at 
the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles on Jan. 14. About 10 cable networks will 
simultaneously televise the ceremony. The bulk of the awards will be handed out 
in a non-televised industry dinner two days earlier.
