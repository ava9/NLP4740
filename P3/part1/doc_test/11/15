Nancy Kwan was just 18, studying dance with England's Royal Ballet School, when 
she was spotted by producer Ray Stark, who tested her and gave her the starring 
role of a free-spirited Hong Kong prostitute who captivates artist William 
Holden in "The World of Susie Wong" (1960). She followed it the next year with 
the hit musical "Flower Drum Song" and became one of Hollywood's most visible 
Asian actresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Both roles were very bold," Wong recalls today. "I've never really played a 
demure little Asian." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-English Kwan spent the '60s commuting between film roles 
</P>
<P>
in America and Europe, but faded from view in the West when she returned to her 
native Hong Kong in 1972 to be with her critically ill father. 
</P>
<P>
Then divorced from an Austrian hotelier, with a young son, Kwan intended to 
stay a year -- but wound up staying a decade. As managing director of her own 
production company, she produced and directed dozens of commercials for the 
Southeast Asia market. She also acted in a spate of films made for Southeast 
Asian audiences, including a 1977 movie, "Fear," that introduced her to 
filmmaker Norbert Meisel, the man she now calls "my other half." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the States in 1979 so that her teen-age son, Bernie Pock, could 
complete his education here. (A martial-arts master who speaks fluent Chinese, 
he's now a stunt coordinator and actor.) 
</P>
<P>
Since returning, Kwan's appeared on numerous TV series and co-starred in the 
NBC miniseries "Noble House" and the recent CBS TV movie "Miracle Landing." 
She's politically active as the spokeswoman for the Asian American Voters 
Coalition, and touts a beauty product, Oriental Pearl Cream, in TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
She's also about to get back into the movies -- this time as a producer as well 
as actress. 
</P>
<P>
The project, "Endless Voyage," set during the fall of Saigon, is an interracial 
love story about an American woman who's been separated from her Vietnamese 
husband. Kwan co-stars as the United Nations delegate who attempts to reunite 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Kwan and writer/director Charles Wallace have already scouted locations in 
Thailand, and have secured government permission to film in Vietnam after a 
visit to Hanoi. Budgeted at $5 million-$6 million for Phoenix International 
Prods., "Endless Voyage" may be the first American movie to shoot in Vietnam 
since the war's end. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that our filming there will be another bridge to peace," says Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, she's seen many changes regarding Hollywood's treatment of 
Asian performers. "When I first came here, it seemed I was the only Asian 
actress. When there weren't Asian roles for me, they cast me as an American 
Indian. I also played French and Italian! That wouldn't happen today -- and I'm 
glad. Hollywood is more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
But there's still progress to be made, Kwan adds. 
</P>
<P>
"There are now many, many Asian actresses -- and not many roles." Pat H.
