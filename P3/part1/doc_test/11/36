HOLLYWOOD'S SUMMER OF LOVE; 
</P>
<P>
ROMANTIC 'GHOST' OUTGUNS MACHO MOVIES TO BECOME SEASON'S BIGGEST HIT

This was the summer when more people went to see Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze 
than Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy, when moviegoers finally seemed to weary of 
car crashes, explosions and automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's macho summer ended with an old-fashioned message: America still 
loves a love story. In a season when nearly all the major movies were 
big-budget action pictures aimed at young men, the surprise success was a 
relatively modest ($22-million budget) love story that offered one of the few 
prominent roles for a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost," an uplifting tribute to yuppie love starring Moore and Swayze, opened 
second to "Die Hard 2" and steadily built up word-of-mouth to become the top 
film of the summer, with $125 million in ticket sales through Labor Day. 
Paramount Pictures poured hundreds of millions of dollars into hardware movies 
this summer, but it was "Ghost" that gave the studio a strong edge over much of 
its competition. 
</P>
<P>
If tickets sales from another love story, "Pretty Woman" -- actually a spring 
release -- are factored in, Disney was the top-earning studio over the summer, 
according to Paul Kagan Associates. Produced for a modest $12 million, this 
Pygmalion tale -- Henry Higgins takes home a hooker -- had grossed $169 million 
through Labor Day, according to the studio. It also returned Richard Gere to 
stardom and made co-star Julia Roberts one of the most sought-after actresses 
in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Disney also was helped by the success of "Dick Tracy," Warren Beatty's comic 
book epic. The No. 4 film of the summer, "Dick Tracy" faced some tough odds 
given that young people were not familiar with either Beatty or the character. 
But a massive marketing blitz and generally good reviews pushed ticket sales to 
$103.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, moviegoing was off 5% from last year's record summer, according to 
projections by Paul Kagan Associates. The firm projects that total box-office 
receipts will top $1.92 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably hurt that there were so many of the same pictures at the same 
time," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which compiles 
box-office figures. "There wasn't the diversity there was in previous years." 
</P>
<P>
The list of the top 10 movies for the summer, as expected, was filled out by 
action-adventure films. But many of the films failed to meet expectations set 
by last year's adventure blockbusters: "Batman," "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2." 
</P>
<P>
The summer's results could challenge the popular notion in Hollywood that big 
stars plus big budgets guarantee big returns at the box office. Analysts say 
that none of this summer's major movies will lose money -- video, TV and 
foreign markets will make up for any shortfall at U.S. theaters -- but many 
industry insiders are predicting that it's just a matter of time before a 
Hollywood studio runs into a high-tech "Heaven's Gate," the 1980 spectacle that 
nearly destroyed United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying the budgets have gotten out of hand," said Elizabeth A. 
Cameron, research associate at Smith Barney, a New York brokerage firm. "I 
think the companies are going to scale back . . . There's this perception that 
you have to spend $60 million for a movie and that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Cameron said that business at the box office also was hurt by a slowing economy 
and rising ticket prices. In addition, she said, the time window between 
theater and video releases closed dramatically. As a result, she said, with 
ticket prices reaching $7.50 at some New York and L.A. theaters, young 
theatergoers are choosing to wait until their favorite movies come out on 
video, rather than standing in line for a second viewing at theaters. Sales of 
videos were up substantially this summer, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
In the body-count sweepstakes, "Total Recall" -- director Paul Verhoeven's 
complex science-fiction thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger -- was the 
clear winner. With a budget that stretched beyond $60 million, the Carolco 
production, distributed by Tri-Star, came in second place for the summer with 
ticket sales of $116.7 million. Given Schwarzenegger's popularity in foreign 
markets, many analysts expect the film to match that figure overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The other action picture with the summer's biggest budget, 20th Century Fox's 
"Die Hard 2" (industry estimates put the production costs above $62 million) 
came in third place with more than $109.7 million in ticket sales. The sequel 
to "Die Hard," (1988's sleeper summer hit), exceeded the original's ticket 
sales by more than 35%. But overall this was not a kind summer for sequels. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Eddie Murphy's name on a summer movie has guaranteed 
$100-million-plus in ticket sales. But Paramount's "Another 48 HRS.," a sequel 
to the buddy-cop picture that originally launched Murphy to stardom, had ticket 
sales of $79.1 million and was rapped by critics for excessive violence and 
insufficient plot. Although that ticket-sale figure is large -- and slightly 
exceeds sales on the original -- it fell far short of expectations for a film 
that cost at least $45 million to make. 
</P>
<P>
Other sequels that failed to meet expectations were Universal's "Back to the 
Future III," ($84.1 million, in contrast to $208 million for the original, one 
of the 10 top films of all time); Orion's "RoboCop 2," ($44.8 million, compared 
to $54 million for the original in 1987); and Warner Bros.' "Gremlins 2: The 
New Batch" ($40.4 million compared to $148 million for the original, one of the 
top five releases in 1984). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cruise's ode to stock car racing, "Days of Thunder," was considered by many 
an earthbound sequel to the 1985 jet fighter hit, "Top Gun" (one critic even 
charted the plot similarities). The Paramount film cost at least $50 million to 
make and grossed $80.6 million -- a figure that has to be split roughly 50-50 
between theater owners and the studio. In contrast, "Top Gun" grossed $177 
million.
