When actress Estelle Parsons arrived on the set of "Dick Tracy" last May, she 
informed producer-director-star Warren Beatty of a small oversight: "I said, 
'Warren, I've never even seen a script. I haven't a clue what you mean when you 
say I'm gonna do the scene now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's not usually so absent-minded, says Parsons, who has a small role in 
"Tracy" as Tess Trueheart's muffin-baking mom. "With Warren, the project is 
really more important than life itself. You know that it's going to be 
perfectly, exactly what he wants. . . . It's like working for some of the old 
theater greats." 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy" opens June 15. And Parsons will be seen again later this year as 
Elliott Gould's tyrannical housekeeper in Miramax's "The Lemon Sisters." But 
the actress hasn't been all that visible on the big screen since winning an 
Oscar for her first film role more than two decades ago as the giddy wife of a 
gangster (played by Gene Hackman) in "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967), which had 
Beatty as star and producer. 
</P>
<P>
(The chameleon-like actress can also be seen in her recurring guest spot as 
Roseanne Barr's mom on ABC's "Roseanne.") 
</P>
<P>
The three-time Tony nominee and two-time Obie winner tells us that she turns 
down several movie offers each year -- theater is her "real" work. On the 
agenda for fall is a starring role as a Kentucky hills woman in an Off-Broadway 
production.

<P>
"Theater is the actor's medium," says Parsons from her Manhattan apartment, 
which she shares with attorney-husband Peter Zimroth and their 6-year-old 
adopted son, Abraham. "Film belongs to directors. The actor has a great sense 
of power in the theater. I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
Even after Broadway roles ranging from a singing nursemaid "The Pirates of 
Penzance" (1981) to a dictatorial teacher in her one-woman show "Miss 
Margarida's Way" (originally mounted in 1977, revived briefly last winter), and 
scores of Off-Broadway and regional theater productions, Parsons says one goal 
is elusive.

someday I will be." Mary Helen Berg
