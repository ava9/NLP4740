GOODFELLA PAUL Sorvino is reaping the benefits of appearing in Martin 
Scorcese's lavishly praised "GoodFellas" gangster flick. He has just signed two 
new movie deals. The first with Rita Moreno, called "Life in the Fast Food 
Chain," and then he moves on to Disney for an as-yet-untitled film with Timothy 
Dalton, who is taking a respite from his duties as James Bond.

IN WASHINGTON, they are talking about Stacy Keach! Keach opened last week at 
the Folger Theater in "Richard III" to incredible reviews -- the kind most 
actors only dream of. Some critics have gone so far as to call Stacy, once TV's 
Mike Hammer, "the new Laurence Olivier"! (Oh, look, let's just leave that 
alone.) 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, his wife, Malgosia, and their new baby are settled in Washington until 
his sold-out stint as "Richard III" closes Nov. 10.

I TOLD you the other day that word of mouth on Barbra Streisand's "The Prince 
of Tides" movie is just great, and how happy Barbra is with her leading man, 
Nick Nolte. Well, it seems that everybody connected with Barbra's labor of love 
(she is the director, the star and the producer) is happy at this point. Pat 
Conroy, who wrote the book on which the film is based, has this to say: 
"Streisand's smart as hell to take this novel of biblical length and pretension 
and break it down into a movie. She's not afraid of anything. Her sheer will is 
the reason this movie is getting made." 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince of Tides" is still filming, and obviously nobody can predict a hit 
or miss, no matter the talent involved. But I do foresee that by the time this 
movie is ready for release, we will be in the grips of Streisand-mania. This 
is, after all, Barbra's first big screen effort since "Yentl," way back in -- 
can you believe it -- 1984?!

THE GREAT actress Sylvia Sidney was all but given up for dead earlier this 
year. She was dreadfully ill and even in a coma at one point. But now Sidney, 
who began her movie career in 1929, has made an amazing health comeback, and 
will be on hand to receive honors from the Film Society of Lincoln Center on 
Nov. 20 in New York.
