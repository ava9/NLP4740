UBAF, the London-based bank which is part of the associated international
Union des Banques Arabs et Francais group, has reported a 36 per cent rise
in profits after tax and provisions for 1991 to Pounds 6.4m (Dollars
10.88m).
The profit is after charging Pounds 10m to take loan loss provisions to
Pounds 11.5m, which the bank says represents 71.6 per cent of identified
problem loans.
Total capital rose to Dollars 87m, a 1 per cent rise on 1990, despite a
write back of a property revaluation of Pounds 7.9m taken into reserves in
1989.
'This more accurately represents a fair value of the premises in the current
depressed market,' said Mr Peter Taplin, the chief executive.
Mr Taplin said the bank saw improvements in profits from all its mainstream
commercial banking activities, high lighting a more than threefold rise in
fees from arranging and syndicating trade and project financing to Pounds
11.5m
Middle East Bank (MEB), which was acquired by the Dubai-owned Emirates Bank
International (EBI) late last year after running into financial problems,
suffered heavy losses in 1990 and 1991, Reuter reports from Dubai.
EBI said MEB's assets fell to Dh2.67bn (Dollars 741.6m) at the end of 1991
from Dh3.28bn in 1989. MEB did not publish a balance sheet in 1990.
The accumulated losses of MEB totalled Dh323m in the past two years, mainly
due to losses in its international operations.
EBI, which holds 86.5 per cent of MEB shares, restructured the bank's
capital by first writing off most of the losses against a Dh260m capital
reduction. MEB's nominal capital stood at DH300m.
EBI than raised MEB's capital to Dh500m, injecting fresh funds to keep the
bank going and to maintain a healthy capital to assets ratio.
