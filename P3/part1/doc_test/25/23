Anyone feeling beaten into submission by hard-sell, high-octane Dubai could
do worse than drive the hour and a half over the Hajar mountains to the
United Arab Emirate's stretch of Indian Ocean coast. It is sandwiched
between Oman and the Sultanate's exiled territory on the Musandam peninsula
which guards the Straits of Hormuz.
This 70 km of coast is as sweepingly picturesque as any on the Arabian
Peninsula. Its small towns are a good deal sleepier than their bustling
high-rise cousins on the Gulf coast. Even here, though, modernity has crept
over the mountains, and visitors are more likely to bump into groups of
western skin divers than gaily turbaned fishermen hauling in shoals of
anchovies and sardines.
Nevertheless, once out of Dubai and through the neighbouring emirate of
Sharjah, the dual carriageway road opens into pleasingly be-cameled desert
scrub, complete with acacia-studded dunes. After an hour, and a right turn
at the one-camel town of Masafi, the road weaves through Hajar's craggy
basalt peaks and deep gulches to the flats on which stands Fujairah, the
lone eastward facing emirate.
Fujairah has no oil and for years depended solely on its fishing industry,
and the compact concrete town which houses its 50,000 or so inhabitants
reflects its more slender means. But its Indian Ocean shores were plied
liberally with cautious trade during the Gulf war, enabling the emirate
better to afford the de rigueur international airport and beside it the
cement factory which is also a pre-requisite of any self-respecting Gulf
city state. Beside this in turn, is a small factory which bakes a form of
the local basalt and spins it into a fibre used to make some forms of
insulation. Even modest Fujairah manages to turn the rocks into wool.
A visitor's most promising first stop is the Hilton International hotel,
which sits amid lawns and palm trees housing some particularly noisy
crickets next to a small strip of sand compactly endowed with every seaside
amenity. Rooms cost Dh220 a night for a stay during the Moslem weekend
(Thursday and Friday nights), and with that comes everything a Hilton guest
would expect - even in what is billed as the smallest Hilton in the world.
For Dh35 a day visitors can use the hotel pool and bar - one of only two in
Fujairah which serve alcohol. The other, the Beach Motel down the coast, is
rather seedier. But it is better beached and hires out windsurfers (Dh25 an
hour), water skis (Dh25 for three starts) or a fishing boat (Dh80 an hour).
Alcohol is pretty much the Beach Motel's main attraction.
On the sea horizon, though, sits the traffic jam of large crude oil tankers
which make Fujairah one of the world's largest bunkering stations, where
tankers sit waiting for passage through the Straits of Hormuz to the oil
terminals of the Gulf. The resulting spillage takes its toll on Fujairah's
beaches, and the Hilton's sign warning of tar on beach is, as the hotel's
staff acknowledge, there for good reason. The day of my visit, a sad-looking
cormorant was airing its wings on the beach in a vain effort to cleanse
itself.
Fujairah's other main tourist trap is the remains of the old town, guarded
by a sandblown, crenellated fort, the rounded lines of which have not been
helped by the addition in the 1960s of a square concrete turret.
In the heat, particularly, this tourist attraction can be safely
accomplished with a fairly brief camera sortie.
A drive north along the coast to Khor Fakkan, which lies in the territory of
Sharjah, is far more rewarding. In winter, which hereabouts means from
October to April, gaily-turbaned fishermen can be spotted, hand-hauling
great curved seine nets from the shore to bring in anchovies, sardines and
the odd small but nevertheless disconcerting shark. The sardines are then
laid out in great silver strips over the sand, dried and sold as cattle
fodder, much to the delight of local seabirds.
Khor Fakkan immediately betrays the greater opulence of oil- and gas-endowed
Sharjah - its main street is greened and trim and the corniche along the
coast road towards the Oceanic hotel, one of the UAE's three main beach
hotels, is colourfully paved, ornately gardened and relieved at appropriate
intervals by ice-cream kiosks.
The Oceanic, under the gaze of the summer palace of Sharjah's ruler, sits
opposite Khor Fakkan's less-than-sightly port, but also beside craggy coves
with clean white sand and limpid azure water.
'The coastguards here are rather more environmentally aware than down the
coast,' says Mr Arun Kapoor, the hotel's assistant manager, in a
characteristic display of inter-emirate rivalry. The beach, to back him up,
looks tar-free.
Like the Hilton, the Oceanic offers the gamut of water sports, at roughly
the same rates. It also offers diving - for those who have had diving
instruction - offering packages from Dh120 for a day trip to the coral reefs
around Paradise Island a few hundred yards offshore, to Dh1,100 for a
package, with equipment, for seven days. If you can spare the 10 days
required to win a diving licence, the hotel can arrange that.
The Indian Ocean coast, or the Gulf of Oman, as the waters which actually
lap the shore are known, is reckoned to offer the clearest water and most
varied sport for divers and snorkelers. The sharks, white tipped and whale
shark alike, are said not to be unfriendly. Other inhabitants of the sea's
coral reefs include barracudas, red snappers and sting rays.
Snorklers or fishermen will have to celebrate their finds and catches either
down the coast or soberly with fruit juice in the Oceanic, because Sharjah
is dry. Nightlife, as in Fujairah, is less than heady, although the Oceanic
threatens 'world-famous entertainment troupes' to break the evening calm.
North from placid Khor Fakkan, the road hugs the curling coast through
chiselled peaks and past long white beaches punctuated only by small,
intriguing fishing villages such as Sharm, a tight grid of squat little
ornately coloured and crenellated palaces which sit in calm private silence,
strolled largely by goats.
The road passes the mosque of Bidya, again guarded by a crumbling
watchtower, which is said to be the oldest - and may well be the smallest -
in the UAE. Its four meringue-like domes are an obligatory photo
opportunity.
Thereafter, the road curves inland to Dibba, once the capital of Oman and
scene of a violent victory in 633 of Moslem forces from Mecca over local
Omani tribes which helped establish Islam in the region. Just beyond Dibba,
by the border with Oman's mountainous Musandam peninsula, lies a bleakly
sandswept cemetery of standing stones said to be the site of the battle.
Dibba sits almost as silent as this monument, its locals wandering only
rarely outside their beautifully adorned little palaces. The small dhow
harbour comes alive only by morning and late evening.
It is only a few minutes' drive from Dibba, weaving through the mountains
(and Dibba's cement factory) to close the circle back to Masafi.
And, as if to acknowledge that a visitor may have encountered few locals
during a short trip to this coast, a road sign just inland from Dibba reads,
rather fetchingly, 'Goodbye'.
