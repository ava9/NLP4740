FT  05 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Arab dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gulf Air president Salim bin Ali Assiyabi on Monday criticised Arab
carriers, including newly-born airlines in the region, for competing in a
limited market by offering lower prices.
Mr Assiyabi, whose airline has faced increasing competition in the Gulf,
contrasted the 'appropriate' European framework for regulating the air
transport industry with the lack of a proper regulatory framework in the
Arab world.
He did not give names but both Qatar and Oman, which together with Bahrain
and Abu Dhabi own Gulf Air, recently set up separate airlines that compete
with Gulf Air on some of its routes. Dubai, also in the UAE, has in addition
set up the thriving Emirates airline.
