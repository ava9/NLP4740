Dubai is probably the only place in the Gulf where the Sporting Life and the
Racing Post are widely available, writes Anne Counsell. Jostling for shelf
space alongside a wide range of sports magazines, the extent of interest in
the subject is evident.
Sport pervades almost all aspects of life in the emirate; many apartments
come with swimming pools, squash or tennis courts while watersports and
other facilities abound.
There are now so many tennis courts and pools that even the semi-government
agency which monitors sports facilities is unable to give precise numbers or
keep track of all the new developments.
A lack of fitness does not exclude anyone from the sporting scene - a
satellite television channel broadcasts all international sports events and
many pubs and restaurants show live sports coverage.
The sporting calender is jam-packed: at almost any time of the year, Dubai
is likely to be hosting an international sports event, drawing the world's
top players. Even at the height of the Gulf crisis in November 1990, snooker
stars nudged Saddam Hussein out of the headlines when they contested the
Pounds 200,000 Dubai Duty-Free Snooker Classic.
Shortly after came the Dubai Sevens, claimed to be the biggest international
rugby sevens tournament in the world.
Each December, the desert dust rises as the Dubai International Rally gets
underway, while the waters of the Gulf swirl to the Dubai Offshore Powerboat
Race and the Emirates Powerboat Race.
Sea and watersports are important to the maritime emirate which has recently
revived the traditional dhow sailing race, now held each May. Each entrant
builds a boat - a replica of those once used for coastal trading, pearling
and fishing - at a cost of up to Dh90,000.
Equestrian events also feature prominently; hardly suprising considering the
Maktoum's keen and extensive racing interests. The new racing track and the
Dubai Horse Show and polo events regularly draw top international riders.
Every imaginable sport is catered for and catalogued on the sporting
calendar. From ice skating and sand ski-ing to karate and chess, there is a
venue and a coveted trophy. The competitive spirit is embodied in Dubai
which fiercely defends its crown as sports capital of the Middle East. Where
else but Dubai would host the annual Highland Games with sporrans, the skirl
of bagpipes and cabers being tossed in the desert.
