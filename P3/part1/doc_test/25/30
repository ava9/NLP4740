Shops in the United Arab Emirates pulled pirated videos and cassettes off
the shelves to abide by the UAE's first copyright law which took effect
yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai.
Merchants selling fake cassette tapes, videos and software had until
yesterday to abide by the law which says they must sell or rent only
copyrighted products. Goods which do not have proper copyright certificates
must be destroyed.
'From the first (of the month) onwards we can send out inspectors to look
for these kinds of irregularities. . . for copyright violations,' a Dubai
Department of Economy official said.
Penalties include confiscation of goods, jail terms and fines of up to
10,000 dirhams (Dollars 2,700).
One Ministry of Information official said inspectors had been sent out to
check that shops were not selling pirated goods but he did not say how many
were visited.
The UAE in March became a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, which has provisions to prevent the sale and trade of counterfeit
goods.
It has also came under pressure from its western trading partners to protect
trademarks and patents. The US estimates lost revenue of Dollars 156m a year
in the UAE due to copyright violations.
One video shop worker, Ali Haider, said ministry inspectors visited the shop
with a warning when the law was promulgated in March. Shops were given a
grace period until Thursday.
'Unfortunately we removed all the English films from the racks and are
selling only Hindi films,' he said, adding they were stored in a back room
but they might be re-exported.
One worker at a major supermarket in Abu Dhabi said the store re-exported
more than 100,000 tapes for which it did not own copyrights. He said they
were currently displaying only seven original titles but more were expected
next week.
'This is the last day you can buy the fake ones. . . at 15 dirhams (Dollars
4). The originals are 50 dirhams (Dollars 14),' he said.
At another branch of the same supermarket a supervisor said officials
cleared the shop of 50,000 dirhams worth of videos on Wednesday in
preparation for the new law.
It is intended to prevent unauthorised reproduction of works of literature,
art, films, video and audio tapes and software.
Juma Nabooda, Dubai's Chamber of Commerce president, said in a statement on
Wednesday that the UAE would start implementing Gatt articles yesterday to
coincide with the copyright law.
