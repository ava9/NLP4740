Eleven airlines yesterday announced resumed flights to India after the World
Health Organisation declared most of the country plague-free.
Air India, the international carrier, has been allowed to resume its
services to Dubai and Doha, while Emirates (Dubai's airline), Gulf Air and
Kuwait Airways have also resumed their Indian services after nearly a month.
But Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and other members of the United Arab Emirates, as
well as Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Russian and central Asian countries,
have yet to lift the ban on flights.
The Indian government expressed relief when a team of WHO experts indicated
no evidence existed that plague had been transmitted in Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras or Delhi, and these cities could be considered plague-free. But the
UN organisation has recommended continued precautions while travelling to
Surat in Gujarat and Beed in Maharashtra.
The government has confirmed only 55 plague deaths, but health organisations
hope authorities will heed it as a warning to improve India's inadequate
health system.
Worst hit by the plague panic are exports of fresh food. Officials admit
that exports of perishables have fallen sharply, though no figures are yet
available. India depends on the Gulf countries for 70 per cent of its
exports of fruit, vegetables, meat, and seafood, which last year totalled
Dollars 177m (Pounds 118m), and were expected to reach Dollars 200m this
year. One estimate calculates the ban by Gulf countries has cost India more
than Dollars 6m a day.
Last year, trade between the Gulf states and India exceeded Dollars 3bn,
including Dollars 2bn-worth of Indian exports. 'We have lost over a month of
business due to the plague scare,' says Mr Bilal Lone, who imports
non-ferrous metal scrap from the Gulf to India.
The Indian Commerce ministry is optimistic that trade with the Middle East
will return to normal with the restored air and sea links. 'The specific
impact of the plague scare on trade will be clear when the figures for
October are released next month,' a ministry official said.
Travel experts estimate cancellations of up to 40 per cent of tourism
arrivals this year, the plague scare having coincided with the peak tourist
season. 'India's plans to increase tourism arrivals from 1.82m in 1993 to 5m
by the year 2000 have been badly hit,' a tourism ministry official said.
