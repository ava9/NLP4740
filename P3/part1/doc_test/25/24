  [Text] Abu Dhabi--In spite of the appointment of Ahmad 
Sa'id al-Badi, the UAE [United Arab Emirates] health minister, 
as acting oil minister, succeeding resigning Minister Yusuf 
Bin-'Umayr Bin-Yusuf, the councils and diwans in the UAE have 
not stopped whispering about who will occupy the vacant 
ministerial portfolio. In fact, the speculations have extended 
to a wide-ranging cabinet shuffle or comprehensive change in the 
composition of Vice President and Prime Minister Shaykh Maktum 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum's government, which has lasted nearly four 
years. 
  With regard to the fact that some consider the appointment 
of al-Badi as acting oil minister to be an indication of the UAE 
leadership's tendency to reduce speculations about the identity 
of the next oil minister, some believe this appointment to be a 
temporary transition formula, while awaiting "the cooking up of 
the new ministerial meal," which will not stop at the doors of 
the Ministry of Oil, but will continue to include a 
comprehensive reshuffle in most of the current Council of 
Ministers. According to what some circles are repeating, the 
change may extend to the Presidency itself, and these circles 
say that it is likely that the current president, Shaykh Maktum 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, will vacate his post as vice president and 
ruler of the Emirate of Dubai. 
  If these rumors are true, the most likely candidate to 
succeed Shaykh Maktum in the post of president is Shaykh Hamdan 
Bin-Rashid al-Maktum, the current finance and industry minister 
and the second oldest brother after Shaykh Maktum Bin-Rashid 
al-Maktum. This formula has it that Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan, the current deputy prime minister of the Council of 
Ministers, will retain his position in the new government, which 
tallies with a tradition of separating the two posts so that the 
one who leads the government is an official from the Emirate of 
Dubai when his deputy is from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
  Informed sources have ruled out the possibility that some of 
the major portfolios will change, among them the defense 
portfolio held by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Rashid al-Maktum and the 
higher education portfolio held by Shaykh Nuhayyan Bin-Mubarak 
Al Nuhayyan, as well as some others held by shaykhs like the 
Ministry of State for the Supreme Council's Affairs headed by 
Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Saqr al-Qasimi, the Planning Ministry headed 
by Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Rashid al-Mu'alla, and the Ministry of 
Youth and Sports headed by Shaykh Faysal al-Qasimi. 
  Expected changes are in the service ministries, where the 
sources expect Ahmad Sa'id al-Badi from the Health Ministry to 
transfer to the Oil Ministry, at which he is acting. It is 
expected that Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for 
financial and industrial affairs, will become minister of 
finance and industry, succeeding Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Rashid 
al-Maktum if the latter is appointed president. 
  Among the ministries around which the rumors are circulating 
is the Foreign Ministry--occupied now by Rashid Bin-'Abdallah 
al-Nu'aymi--where some expect Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan to become minister in the place of his current post of 
minister of state for foreign affairs, a post which he has held 
for about four years.
