IF Saddam Hussein launched the mother of all battles, Sheikh Zayed bin
Sultan al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi looks set to become the father of all
funfairs.
The Gulf emirate, putting behind the trauma of war and the BCCI scandal, is
soon to have its own version of Disneyland.
Abu Dhabi has solicited plans from five competing bidders for a giant
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) leisure complex to be built on a 10 sq km
man-made island off the city's seafront.
It is, says Mr Peter Black, senior partner of Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, the
architects leading the British bid, an 'absolutely mammoth scheme'.
The complex will be called Lulu Island - after the Arabic word for pearl -
and is the brainchild of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who decided
two years ago that his city state should offer leisure facilities on a par
with Disneyland.
In its presentation video, Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner describes Lulu Island as
'a land of fantasy which began as the dream of a prince'. Its design centres
on a vast oyster-shaped palace with a latticed dome - the architects claim
it would be the world's largest dome - surrounded by a park containing
replica buildings from Islamic states worldwide. There would also be an
18-hole golf course, ornamental gardens and a coastline studded with
spiralled lighthouses.
The island would be ringed by a monorail, fringed with beaches and dotted
with luxury hotels. The whole project is expected to take 10 years to
complete.
Five companies, one each from the UK, the US, Canada, France and Germany,
have prepared extravagant plans for the project in an extraordinary
competitive tender under which Abu Dhabi paid each group Dollars 400,000 to
prepare their bids.
As a result, the bidders' packages, now on display in Abu Dhabi pending a
final decision on the project from Sheikh Zayed, rival in scale those made
to stage the Olympics.
Societe Francaise d'Etudes de Realisation et de Gestion, leading the French
bid, has created a Pounds 100,000 model, spectacularly swept by laser beams.
The other bidders include Forrec Attractions of Canada, Edaw of the US and a
German group.
Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, which designed Heathrow airport's Terminal 4 among
other buildings, said it approached several British groups as potential
operators of the leisure complex.
These included Pearson (owner of the Financial Times) and British Aerospace.
However, none was willing to take on a project of Lulu Island's scale,
prompting the architects to join forces with California-based Landmark
Entertainment Group.
Mr Black said yesterday that Sheikh Zayed would review the competing
packages next week and is expected to make his decision soon.
Although Kuwait has its own Entertainment City funpark and Qatar is planning
a similar venture, Lulu Island would be far and away the Gulf's most lavish
entertainment complex.
Many of Abu Dhabi's conservative neighbours already consider that the
emirate, as well as Dubai - its exuberant neighbour and rival in the United
Arab Emirates - are akin to Disneyland even as things stand.
Dubai, in particular, has long been the traditional escape for Gulf
expatriates and Arabs seeking sun, alcohol and relief from the more
restrictive social world of Saudi Arabia.
Abu Dhabi's scheme would further its already intense rivalry with Dubai by
vying with its neighbour for such custom.
Touche Ross, which is advising Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, estimates that the
park could attract 2m visitors a year, both from the Middle East and those
who use Abu Dhabi as a transit point between Europe and Asia.
What the mullahs of Iran, a short hop across the Gulf, will think is another
matter, let alone puritanical Islamic leaders in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.
But given the UAE's more laid-back attitude to most things, Minnie Mouse
would be unlikely to have to wear a veil.
