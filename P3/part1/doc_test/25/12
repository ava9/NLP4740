FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (2): New strategy for a different era - The
economy

AS reflected in trade statistics, Dubai's economy has rarely been so
buoyant. The timing could not be better to implement, through the
recently-created Economic Department, a strategy to take the emirate into
the era - still a long way off - when a self-sustaining economic base will
mean Dubai is no longer dependent on oil revenues.
If government aspirations are met, the self-sustaining economic base will
rest on three factors: traditional trade; the leisure and business tourist
industry; and the continuing growth in the number of companies choosing
Dubai as a regional services and light industries centre.
But four essentials must be met if these ambitions are to be realised.
First, there has to be regional political stability; secondly, there must
exist a coherent and effective legal framework within which all kinds of
business can flourish; thirdly, Dubai must have abundant energy supplies at
affordable rates; and lastly it must rest comfortably within the federation
even if it retains degrees of autonomy on different issues.
For the past five years, Dubai's non-oil trade - the traditional core of its
economy - has been growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent,
official statistics show. Dubai caters for 70 per cent of the UAE's total
trade. Just over half is with Asian countries; almost 30 per cent with
Europe. For 1992 alone, imports totalled almost Dh60bn and re-exports almost
Dh9bn.
The main entry and re-export points are Port Rashid, a large and extremely
efficient container port with an average re-export turnaround time of 24
hours; Jebel Ali, the largest man-made container harbour in the world; the
dhow traffic on Dubai's creek, the waterway on which it built its reputation
as an entrepot; and the air-cargo terminal which has a capacity at present
of 250,000 tonnes a year. Greatly expanded over the years and always being
improved, they allow Dubai's life-blood to flow.
The funds generated by this trade are several times greater - Dh70bn
compared with some Dh10bn - than revenue from crude oil and gas. 'The funds
for all this activity are entirely generated in the market,' says Mr Bill
Duff, chief financial expert at Dubai's Central Accounts Office. 'They are
not subsidised by the government whose oil revenues have to be concentrated
on improving the infrastructure to cope with the increase in load.'
Dubai's re-exports are greatly helped by periodic problems in Iran such as
the imposition of quotas which limit imports. These may make it more
difficult for other traders, but Dubai is near enough and with sufficient
experience to give its Iranian community the necessary flexibility to take
advantage of them. The Iranians themselves realise Dubai's special role, for
when they stipulated that all imports to Tehran and Bandar Abbas should go
direct rather than through middle men, Dubai was exempted.
But all this trade, as Mr Duff points out, is in cash investments 'which you
have to try to stabilise'. So to a very large extent is tourism and the
investments made by foreign companies which choose Dubai as the preferred
centre from which to service the wider Middle East and West Asia, the Indian
sub-continent.
Continuing political stability in the region, of the kind that has existed
since the end of the Gulf war, is therefore vital while Dubai finds ways to
attract more - and more valuable - investments.
The advent into Dubai of so many companies, particularly in the past 2 1/2
years, has in turn unleashed a property boom in both house construction and
rentals. Rentals, some businessmen insist, have risen more sharply than the
actual increase in business turnover and, more importantly, profits.
These, however, are cyclical factors. Of greater concern in the longer term
is that these markets - houses, service offices, commerce - could decline as
rapidly as they came if the right conditions are not established within
Dubai to tempt more fixed investment.
The government needs time to expand the infrastructure and the private
sector needs time to consolidate the commercial gains of the past few years.
Both of these factors are in play partly because the prolonged recession in
the west has encouraged more and more companies to venture into the
expanding Gulf market. Hence the phenomenal interest in regional
exhibitions, including the forthcoming Air Exhibition.
One answer to Dubai's (and the UAE's) need for more fixed investment in
non-oil industries is to acquire the high technology industries that come
with offset programmes. But as one visiting representative, in Dubai to
discuss offset proposals, said: 'High technology industries are not like an
invention. You cannot create one and then leave it. You need the talent
on-the-spot to run it and develop it further'.
A source close to the government added: 'Technology transfer and
diversification are all fashionable to talk about, but they have to be
viable before they set up here because they cannot rely on government
subsidies. Common sense and business acumen are Dubai's greatest assets, and
these are what we should build on.'
Overall strategy for Dubai's economic development for the next decade is
with the recently-formed Dubai Government Economic Department and Mr Mohamed
Alabbar, its director-general. Although best known to Dubai's business
community as the man expected to streamline the process of issuing business
and office licences (and the principal target of their complaints when
expectations are not immediately met), Mr Alabbar has an awesome task
dealing with many other issues, for which he has earned the title of 'the
government's economic troubleshooter.'
He is credited with having turned round the government's property and other
investments in Singapore which it inherited from the Dubai entrepreneur Mr
Abdul Wahab Galadari; and more recently with having rationalised the
structure at Dubai Aluminium Company, which he continues to direct. But the
Economic Department under his direction also has to oversee other government
onshore investments; and represent Dubai at meetings of federal committees
where all types of draft legislation are discussed, including the extent to
which individual emirates retain degrees of autonomy.
However the core of his responsibilities lies with trying to streamline the
licensing process for companies wanting to register or to renew
registration. His goal, he says, is to provide companies with their
registration certificates within 48 hours of application and requests for
information by fax on demand. This is ambitious to say the least given the
amount and complexity of forms required, and the need for his staff to
undergo 'customer service training.' But by and large the business community
acknowledges that progress has been made.
Mr Alabbar says that a lot of the work that is done is not visible to the
business community. His department is involved in continuous federal
committee sessions and it is in these where Dubai's voice is heard.
He is quick to point out that many of those who sit on federal committees
have been at school together, and that Dubai's relations with other emirates
at federal level are fundamental to its economic future.
