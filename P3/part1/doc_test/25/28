  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The United Arab Emirates 
has formally lifted a long-standing boycott of South Africa, 
opening the door for Pretoria to grab a bigger share of the 
Middle East market, UAE officials said Sunday. 
  The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and 
has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no 
longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d. 
  Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would 
pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the 
UAE and South Africa. 
  The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision 
cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with 
South Africa because of its former system of apartheid. 
  The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the 
Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and 
other industrial powers. 
  South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade 
with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million 
dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million 
dollars) in 1992. 
  Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in 
coming years given their large business potential. 
  "South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials," 
the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a 
business trip to Johannesburg. 
  He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition 
in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East 
fair in 1992. 
  Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a 
commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost 
exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, 
Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE. 
  South Africa is also aiming at the region's growing arms 
market and has participated in two international defence shows 
in the UAE.
