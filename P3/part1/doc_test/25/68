<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, </F>
president of the United Arab Emirates, by unidentified 
correspondent in al-Jarf [as transliterated], between Abu Dhabi 
and Dubai, "yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] The United Arab Emirates [UAE] is 
the only continuing and prosperous Arab unity. In your view, 
what are the reasons for its success, and how do you view the 
UAE's future? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE union will remain eternal, especially 
after the success of its experiment and the continued efforts to 
safeguard it. Nothing fragments and destroys a building except 
failure to look after it and failure to continue to give and 
build. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Your Highness Mr. President, do you believe that 
the time has come to end the serious Arab split caused by the 
Gulf crisis and achieve Arab reconciliation, and what do you 
believe is the means to achieve that, given that you have 
frequently called for Arab solidarity and supported the Arab 
League secretary general's initiative in this connection? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Arab nation's split and fragmentation 
existed before the Gulf war, but this war has aggravated and 
deepened this split. However, if there is now an inclination 
and a change of ideas for the sake of correcting the Arab march, 
eliminating disputes, and seriously and sincerely bolstering the 
unity of Arab ranks and linking the brothers' destiny, it will 
be a good thing. 
  As for the union some people believe should be established 
from the east to the west of the Arab world and which should 
have one leader, that is unacceptable, impossible, and never 
happened anywhere in the world before, neither in the East nor 
in the West. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you agree with the view that reconciliation is 
unlikely as long as President Saddam Husayn is still in power, 
as the wounds of the Gulf crisis in the Arab body still have not 
healed? Saddam is still in power, and the international embargo 
is inflicting a great deal of suffering on the Iraqis. How do 
you see a way out of this suffering? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Iraqi people's suffering is not caused by 
us; Saddam Husayn is responsible for it. We pray to God to show 
Saddam Husayn the right way one day. If the Arabs agree with 
one another, he might change his opinion and follow the right 
path that pleases him, the Iraqi people, and the Arab nation. 
Maybe that will be achieved. We should not give up hope. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] What stage has been reached in the problem of the 
UAE islands (Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa) 
occupied by Iran, and are you contemplating a new step that may 
restore the claimants' rights? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] We want something new. But when we hear 
Iran's statements, we find them remote from what we are 
contemplating. How can we negotiate with or get anything from 
someone who seizes a right and alleges it was his in the past? 
But if someone says this is mine and I have the evidence, 
others can provide their own evidence too. If their evidence is 
stronger, the right is theirs. If our evidence is stronger, the 
right is ours. If Iran's statements are made in such a manner, 
we would say: Yes, that is good and correct. But if we are 
told, we have our evidence and do not know whether our brothers 
and neighbors have any, the truth of this evidence can only be 
established through arbitration. 
  If we submit our evidence and they submit theirs to 
arbitration, it is arbitration which will decide which is 
correct and which is wrong. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean turning to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] Yes. 
  [AL-HAYAH] The U.S. Administration accuses Iran of 
supporting terrorism and stresses its concerns over Iran's 
endeavors to possess a huge military arsenal. Do you share these 
concerns with the Americans? What is your opinion of the "dual 
containment" pursued by President Bill Clinton's administration 
toward Iraq and Iran? How do you see the future of relations 
with Iran? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The United States knows the truth about Iran 
just as it knows the truth about Iraq. And Iran too knows the 
truth about the United States. Each knows the other. Every 
state wants equality, justice, and reconciliation with its 
neighbors and friends, and it has its own methods. But if a 
state wants to achieve something for itself and deny it to 
others, it is pursuing methods that moves it away from its 
neighbors, especially the states with which it has issues. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] How would you assess the peace process between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis, and what are the requirements 
for ending the Middle East problem? It has been reported that 
Abu-'Ammar will visit the UAE soon. Did he request a visit or 
did you invite him? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] We did not invite him. He wants to come, but 
we postponed his visit. We told him: You have something more 
important to do now. Your visit to us is not the important one. 
What is important is for you to correct yourself, your people, 
and homeland, then visiting us is open to you. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is there a specific date for the visit? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] No. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In view of the Gulf war experience, some Gulf 
states decided to sign security agreements with major states. 
Are you thinking of concluding a similar agreement, especially 
after the ruling out of the formation of a unified 
100,000-strong Gulf army? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] That depends on the situation and the need. 
If someone needs to build a home to protect him from rain, he 
begins to build it. If he needs an airconditioned house, he 
begins to build it. The UAE acts according to its needs, and 
nothing at all can stop us from doing what we believe achieves 
our security, existence on the ground, and respect. [passage 
omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Oil prices have slumped -- which affects the 
income of the producing states, including the UAE. At the 
recent meeting the UAE proposed a production ceiling. Is that 
still your position, given that you have always urged 
cooperation between producers and consumers so that everyone can 
get his rights? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE is one of several fraternal states, 
and it will support what makes its sisters happy. It will not 
move in front of them or stay behind them. This is the UAE's 
position. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that the UAE is coordinating with the 
fraternal states? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] Yes. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is there a possibility of a cabinet reshuffle 
soon? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] Yes. 
  [AL-HAYAH] You criticized the position of both East and 
West. Do you believe the Arabs and Muslims have in one way or 
another disappointed the Bosnian Muslims, and what are the means 
of building new Arab and Islamic support for these people? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Arabs cannot be blamed in any way. The 
blame should be pinned on the major states talking about justice 
and human rights. You heard a great deal about these states' 
talk about human rights. They are interested in the human 
rights of people who are far from them, not those of the people 
in their region. They talk about human rights, and yet the 
Bosnians are being murdered, expelled, and deprived of their 
territory and children. Human rights have not helped them at 
all. 
  There is a lot of talk and little action. Anyone who talks a 
lot does little. It is the major states' responsibility, not 
the Arab states' responsibility. Because the Arab states are 
still in the process of building themselves and have not 
achieved anything, and so are the Islamic states. May God 
enable us to achieve what we want for our Arab and Islamic 
nation. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you believe that the Gulf states can surmount 
the complications of the occupation and liberation of Kuwait, 
hence enabling the Arab states to return to unified action? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] If all the Arab states have the desire and 
seriousness, the Arab nation -- Kuwait and others -- will be 
fine. If we remember what we have lost in the past, avoid the 
methods that harmed us in the past, and think about the methods 
that benefit, strengthen, and unite us as an Arab nation, the 
Arab nation will restore its glory. Our unity is our strength 
and the Arab nation's eternal asset. If we believe in that, 
every good will be achieved.
