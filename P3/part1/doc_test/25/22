'WHAT are they doing in Dubai?', a senior official at the Gulf Co-operation
Council secretariat in Riyadh asked in October 1985, shortly after Emirates
Airline had made its maiden flight to Bombay.
The question was put with more than a hint of exasperation, and the
inference was clear; that Dubai, through its upstart airline, was in some
undefined way breaking ranks within the UAE - and by extension with its GCC
partners - by injecting an unwanted element of competition among Gulf Arab
states confronted with the Iran-Iraq war.
After all, the misconception was widespread that it was the UAE as a whole,
and not just Abu Dhabi, which was one of four shareholders in Gulf Air -
then, as now, the main regional rival to Emirates. So what business did
Dubai have in starting another airline - its own - when there were enough
airlines to go around?
Last month, the 'upstart' airline celebrated its eighth anniversary by
implementing a marketing agreement with United Airlines, one of the three
biggest US carriers, in a further move to expand its international network.
This now directly spans 30 destinations in 24 countries. And far from
undermining the GCC, Dubai's airline has brought more and new business into
the region, and competitors have been forced to improve their own services
to keep up.
The marketing alliance with United, in effect a code-sharing agreement,
means that the two airlines can use each other's flight identification code
to book passengers in computer reservations systems. The logic of the
arrangement is that Emirates' network, which has focused on the Middle East,
the Indian sub-continent and Asia, can now dovetail with United's
transatlantic and US domestic routes.
To link with United, Emirates now has two daily flights to London's
Heathrow, which replace a previous service to Gatwick.
Emirates has never received subsidies from the Dubai government, which
continues to insist on an open-skies policy and looks with equal favour on
the 61 airlines which now fly into the emirate. The government does not
regulate fares.
Emirates' start-up capital was used to buy two second-hand Boeing 727s from
Dubai's Air Wing. Emirates shares head office premises with Dubai National
Air Travel Agency to which it pays a cross-charge for rental. 'That is all
Emirates ever received in government investments or grants,' according to Mr
Dermot Mannion, the airline's corporate treasurer. And Emirates gets no
guarantees from the government when negotiating bank financing for new
aircraft leases or acquisitions.
In the western context of the distinction between the private sector and the
public-state sector, Emirates is an anomaly, for it is simultaneously in
both of these. In common with all seven emirates forming the UAE, as well as
with other member countries of the GCC, the Dubai government is 'private',
consisting of the ruling family and, lower down, its nominees and officials.
In this sense Dubai Inc is a private company. At the same time it is very
much the State.
The airline is thus the private sector commercial extension of the
government and its campaign to promote the emirate of Dubai, as part of the
UAE, as the predominant regional business centre and transit point between
Europe and Asia. Not for nothing is the airline's chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Bin
Said Al Maktoum, a member of the ruling family, also chairman of Dubai's
Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, an autonomous government agency, as
well as president of Dubai's Department of Civil Aviation.
But to finance the leasing of its fleet of 13 aircraft, the airline has had
to rely on its own resources and return on capital. The fleet consists of
eight Airbus A310-300s, and five A300-600Rs. The average age of aircraft in
the fleet, including the two original 727s, is less than 3 1/2 years.
The airline releases figures on a selective basis only to institutions
involved in loan negotiations. But according to the journal Airline Business
last April, Emirates, based on fleet size, a 1992 kilometre total of 5.52bn
and a load factor of nearly 70 per cent, had 1992 revenues of between
Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m.
The airline has been profitable for six out of its seven full financial
years, according to Mr Mannion. In the period April 1992 - April 1993
capacity increased 54 per cent and six new routes were added.
All of its fleet of 13 Airbuses have been financed by commercial bank
borrowings, including the first-ever Islamic lease - for one Airbus -
arranged by Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation. To
do this, Al Rajhi set up a special purpose company which owns the aircraft
until the expiry of the lease, at which time Emirates has an option to buy
the aircraft. Western commercial bank arrangements also allow for the banks
to own the aircraft until the revenue is generated which pays off the loan
plus the interest.
There is, says Mr Mannion, a pool of liquidity available in Islamic banks.
The only hurdle has been regional investors' reluctance to commit liquidity
for as long as 10-15 years instead of the five to seven years they prefer.
Al Rajhi is one of the institutions Emirates is approaching to finance the
purchase of seven Boeing 777s which are on order and due for delivery
starting in March 1996. The airline also has an option on a further seven
777s. Discussions have already started with Eximbank over airframe financing
and with Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department over a Dollars 400m
contract which Emirates signed last July for 35 Rolls-Royce Trent engines.
After the heady expansion of its fleet and new routes since the beginning of
last year, the airline could be looking for a period to build up its cash
reserves in advance of the delivery of the 777s, and to continue to
streamline some of its existing routes.
For example, Rome, a recent addition as a stop-over point to Zurich, is now
a stand-alone destination, drawing both tourists and businessmen to Dubai.
On existing routes, flights to Hong Kong and Singapore now leave daily,
while the frequency to Manchester has been increased.
Emirates generates 40 per cent of total traffic movement through Dubai's
international airport. Renovation and modernisation plans have been on the
books since 1988 when Bechtel prepared the first studies. The Dubai
government is considering, but has not yet decided, on the scale of the
proposed redevelopment.
