The wrong place to embark on a diet is Dubai; a weight-watcher's nightmare
and a gourmet's delight.
A taste of things to come begins on Emirates airline which serves
appetising, well-selected food and fine wines - for which its won its first
in a string of awards.
Hotels are the predominant eating places in Dubai, for the most part because
they offer such a range of quality cuisine but also restaurants outside
hotel premises are unlicensed and not permitted to sell alcohol.
International cuisine and specialty foods abound - French, Chinese, Indian,
Persian, Thai, Brazilian, Mexican, Persian, Italian and Arabic - and in
typical Dubai fashion there are 'International' menus offering a selection
from around the globe.
There is no published guide to the restaurants but a glance at the English
language newspapers - Gulf News or the Khaleej Times - and the What's On
magazine, will soon alert the hungry reader to a variety of tempting hotel
restaurants and food promotions.
The widest selection of eateries appears in the guise of 'pub' lunches and
bar snacks. Initially established to cater for the large British expatriate
contingent in Dubai, the pubs have become an almost obligatory part of every
hotel, akin to cement factories in the Arab industrial sector.
The 'traditional' English pub is carried off with varying degrees of
credibility and it is fascinating to try and fathom how this inherently
British institution has been perceived and copied, often to the horror of
purists. There is a disconcerting sense of deja vu on entering several of
the 'pubs' but this also makes them relaxing and informal - they are also
very good for meeting expatriate businessmen who gather in the dark recesses
for sandwiches and a beer.
Ignoring the fibre-glass beams, dart-boards, imitation hand pumps and other
'pub' embellishments, the food is generally value for money, served quickly
and ideal for a quick lunch or snack. The ubiquitous fish and chips is
unexpectedly good: local hammour (rock cod) served in a light batter costs
about Dh35 while 'ploughman's platters' arrive with large bowls of fresh,
crisp salad for about Dh25.
Hotel coffee shops provide a wide selection of meals at reasonable prices.
They are a better bet than more sumptuous (and expensive) formal dining
rooms if you intend to do any serious work in the afternoon. The Lou Lou
restaurant at the Sheraton, however, offers an excellent lunchtime buffet
for businessmen for about Dh100, complete with panoramic view of the Creek.
All the hotel coffee shops provide varied menus and reasonably priced
lunches. A pasta meal with seafood sauce, glass of wine and dessert costs
about Dh85 while the choice of fresh salad dishes is excellent. Vegetarian
food is easy to find and most hotels will also gladly 'adapt' dishes to
cater for particular tastes or requests.
Evenings are the time to savour and enjoy the cuisine. Arabian food makes up
an important part of most buffet spreads with Lebanese mezza - a selection
of salad, vegetable and meat dishes.
Fresh fish from the Gulf and the Indian Ocean - lobster, prawn, hammour,
tuna, kingfish, pomfret and red snapper - are resplendent on many menus.
Possibly the best sea-food restaurant is the Fish Market at the
Intercontinental Hotel. Guests select their fish - which arrive on the table
bigger than expected, even after gutting and removal of fins. The more
adventurous may sample grilled baby shark while the less daring gourmand
could do worse than indulge in Gulf king prawns fried in garlic, lemon and
butter. As with the fish, the bill also comes back larger than expected -
allow at least Dh200 per person for an indulgent evening out.
The Hyatt Regency has initiated a 'Progressive Dinner' held on a weekly
basis and enabling guests to work their way through the hotel's restaurants,
sampling a course from each for Dh100 per person. The evening ends with
dessert and coffee in the roof-top revolving restaurant.
Indian and Pakistani food is well represented in Dubai with restaurants
offering more than just a curry. There are delicately spiced dishes from the
north and fiery foods from the south, with the full range in between.
Cantonese, Szechuan and Shanghai specialties are served in separate
restaurants and there are also general Chinese restaurants with a wide
selection of each. A Chinese menu may be the only place that pork dishes are
in evidence. In accordance with the Moslem faith, food is generally prepared
by the halal method and rashers on the breakfast table will invariably turn
out to be beef. Pork dishes are, however, comparatively expensive.
Dubai imports almost 90 per cent of its food requirements - milk, yoghurts,
cheeses are locally available as are a selected few fruits and vegetables.
Dubai's open system for imports allows in virtually all foods from all
places. Despite the air freight, other transport and refrigeration costs,
stated prices are reasonable by international standards although a 15 per
cent service charge and 5 per cent municipality tax pushes up the final
bill.
Although the restaurants outside hotels are unlicensed, they are air
conditioned, clean and culinary adventures in their own right. The Iranian
restaurant opposite the World Trade Centre is highly recommended by the
locals. A meal of soup, salad buffet with a meat and rice dish costs about
Dh110 for two. The menu is mainly kebabs and rice and the food simple but
tasty.
Ravis in the Satwa district is a no-frills Indian restaurant. The kitchen
opens out onto the pavement and there are two eating areas, a cafe
frequented by Indian workers and an adjacent 'family room' where expatriate
teenagers gather for soft drinks and a chat. The menu is basic Indian fare
and very cheap. Chicken tikka, mutton and vegetables with rice and side
dishes costs Dh19 - less than the Dh20 taxi fare from the business district
hotels. The curry house was used by the Dubai rugby club for its annual
black jacket and tie bash - but anything goes in Dubai and it would take a
lot more to upset the serene waiters.
There are many other small restaurants and bistros in Deira, Bur Dubai and
Jumeirah and anyone on an extended stay should consider venturing out of the
hotels and exploring the local scene. Fast food outlets and ice-cream
parlours can be found in or near the shopping centres while stands serving
shawarma (grilled shavings of meat inside Arabic bread) and kebabs are
tucked away in the souks. It is hard to go hungry in Dubai.
