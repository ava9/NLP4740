release detainees and documents

The flagging investigations into the multi-billion dollar fraud surrounding
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International are about to get a new lease
of life.
For more than two years, a mountain of documents detailing the fraud have
remained locked away in the Gulf state of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority
shareholder.
Also out of reach have been 10 of the bank's top executives, who are being
tried on fraud charges in the emirate while eight more have had their
passports confiscated.
Under a deal struck with US investigators at the weekend, Abu Dhabi has
agreed to make the documents and the detainees available to US prosecutors.
The emirate has also agreed to extradite the bank's former number two, Mr
Swaleh Naqvi, to the US, where he faces fraud charges.
The deal is an important turning point for the US investigators, who have
led the worldwide inquiries into BCCI. Alongside Mr Robert Morgenthau, the
New York district attorney, they include the justice department and the
federal reserve, both of which were also involved in negotiating the
agreement.
While claiming success for the work so far, Mr Morgenthau admitted
investigations have been held back by lack of access to the records and
witnesses held in Abu Dhabi.
The prosecution record over recent months bears out the difficulties.
Less than six months after BCCI was closed, four BCCI entities pleaded
guilty to fraud charges and agreed to pay Dollars 550m (Pounds 368m) in
fines, costs and restitution in the US.
Then, in mid-1992, Mr Kamal Adham, a former Saudi Arabian intelligence
chief, pleaded guilty to helping BCCI illegally acquire control of First
American Bankshares in the US, along with an associate.
These successes have not been matched in recent months. Last summer, Mr
Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer and former president of First American,
was acquitted on fraud charges. Similar charges against Mr Clark Clifford, a
former US secretary of state, were dropped due to his ill health.
Other criminal cases have also been dropped. On December 23, Mr Morgenthau
gave up charges against Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former head of
National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's largest bank, in a deal under which
Sheikh Khalid has paid Dollars 225m to meet civil claims against him.
Under the terms of the latest deal, US prosecutors have also agreed not to
bring any criminal charges against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the
ruler of Abu Dhabi, or any Abu Dhabi officials.
A beneficiary of this arrangement is Mr Ghanim al Mazrui, head of Sheikh
Zayed's department of personal affairs and a man singled out by former BCCI
auditors Price Waterhouse as allegedly being fully aware of the fraud long
before it was known to regulators.
However, Abu Dhabi officials have maintained they are the biggest victims of
the fraud, rather than its perpetrators.
A case against Abu Dhabi officials could yet be mounted elsewhere. The deal
with the US authorities does not preclude prosecutors in the UK, where the
bank had its head office, or Luxembourg, where much of it was legally based,
from pursuing their own charges.
Yet if the deal closes off some avenues of investigation in the US, it will
open others. Mr Naqvi represents the biggest prize so far for US
prosecutors. He will be extradited within 120 days, which Abu Dhabi hopes
will allow time for its own criminal trial against him to be concluded.
Even if found guilty and sentenced in the Gulf state, Mr Naqvi will be
handed over to the US authorities before serving any prison sentence there.
Also, the availability of the so-called 'Naqvi files' - more than 1m pages
of documents assembled by Mr Naqvi - could provide the sort of ammunition
prosecutors need to kick-start a number of investigations.
In addition, Abu Dhabi has agreed to give US investigators access by the end
of next week to the 10 men, including Mr Naqvi, who remain in detention in
the Gulf emirate.
The new information could bring fresh criminal charges in the US. The
justice department, for one, has said it might yet reopen the case against
Mr Altman and Mr Clifford.
The Naqvi files could also provide evidence to back the allegations of
bribery of government officials in many of the countries in which BCCI
operated, including the UK.
The agreement does not prevent the US authorities from passing on evidence
to authorities in other countries.
One man notably absent in this flurry of deal-making is Mr Agha Hassan
Abedi, BCCI's chief architect.
At home in Pakistan, and reportedly a very sick man, the elderly Mr Abedi
has resisted efforts to move him to either Abu Dhabi or the US for trial.
