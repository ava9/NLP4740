IT WAS nearly 5.30pm one day last month. As we walked up the 18th fairway
the sun slid towards the horizon. The temperature was just over 70`F and a
brisk wind was blowing in over the lake, slapping my face like a slightly
damp warm flannel. I was thirsty and hungry and looking forward to a pot of
tea in the clubhouse.
Where was I? Florida? No. Spain or Portugal? No. I was concluding a round at
the Emirates golf course in Dubai with Andrew Millar, the Scot who is the
club's executive director. 'One big difference between playing golf here and
in Spain and Portugal is that we have no housing on our course,' said Millar
later as we drank our tea in the spike bar of the clubhouse. 'Down here you
get 11 1/2 hours of playing time each day at an average temperature of
70`F-75`F. We get three days of rain each year. In fact, this is probably
the sunniest golf club in the world.' He beamed as he said this, knowing it
was a sweeping statement.
Dubai may seem to be an exotic location for a golfing break but that has not
stopped them from building two championship standard courses, or from
planning a third, or from generally making a determined bid to be considered
a serious venue for a golfing break - all this in four years. Oil is Dubai's
main source of income at present but stocks will run out in 20 years and
tourism, of which golf is animportant ingredient, is being developed as fast
as possible.
Dubai is a bustling, busy place. It has a population of just over 600,000,
up from 420,000 seven years ago. Wherever you look new hotels are being
built and existing ones being enlarged. Emirates Airline, which was founded
less than a decade ago, now has nearly 20 flights a week from Britain to
Dubai.
On one such six-hour flight recently I thought about golf in the Gulf. I had
read that the sand course at the Dubai Country Club was one of the oldest in
the area and as the aircraft sped eastwards I wondered what it would be like
to hit a long iron to an oil-based green, or, as they are called down there,
a brown. Little did I know at that stage that much of Dubai was no more than
10 years old - younger than my golf clubs.
I went first to the Dubai Creek course, which is about as upmarket a
pay-as-you-play course as you could find. It cost Dollars 50m, much of which
went on a lavish 50-metre high clubhouse shaped like the sails of a dhow.
The Creek course, built on 180 acres of once-barren land, is five minutes'
drive from the airport and no further from the centre of town.
It was designed by Karl Litten, the well-known American, and opened in
February. It is the second grass course in Dubai and thus a cousin of the
Emirates course where the Desert Classic has been held these past three
years. The Creek is a resort course, aimed at itinerant businessmen who want
a game of golf and/or a course of lessons. The head professional is Peter
Downie, a Scot, and he and his six-strong team of teaching professionals
work most of the day and some of the night as well.
Floodlit facilities include a nine-hole par-three course, three practice
holes, (a par-three and two par-fours) and a driving range for up to 45
golfers. I played the front nine holes, had my swing videoed from behind, in
front and above in Downie's indoor teaching school, and left the club at
about 6.30pm. Dusk was gathering but that was no problem. The floodlights
were turned on and the bays on the driving range would remain full for
another three or four hours. It is hard to imagine better coaching and
practice facilities anywhere in the world and it was easy to understand why
Downie was anxious to try and attract teams out to the Creek course to
practice. 'I want to make this a centre of excellence for teaching and
practising,' he said.
The next day I played the Emirates course with Millar. Of the two grass
courses it is the tougher and, to my way of thinking, the more pleasing to
the eye with its imaginative use of grasses and scrub. It has three or four
outstanding holes. By the time Millar and I reached the 18th we had barely
been out three hours. Golfers know their etiquette in the Gulf. In any case,
marshals roam the course to winkle out slowcoaches.
Not that Millar needed anyone to hurry him up. A Scot who was once an
outstanding water-polo player and international swimmer, he is one of the
fastest players I have ever come across. He was out of the cart, had his
club in his hand and had hit the ball (no practice swing) and was back in
the cart and bowling merrily down the fairway long before his ball had come
to a halt - and sometimes before it had touched the ground.
Before I left the Emirates club, Millar urged me to go and look at the Dubai
Country Club. 'It is part of Dubai's golfing heritage,' he said. 'You must
not leave without seeing it.' So the next morning I took a taxi out to the
club, 15 minutes from the centre of town. A sign at the entrance said
Darjeeling Cricket Club. The taxi paused briefly and then continued up to
the low-slung buildings of the country club.
The 14th Dubai Ladies Open was being played that day and competitors had
come from Germany, Zimbabwe, Oman, India and Pakistan, as well as other
countries. I stood by the putting green, shut my eyes and realised I could
have been at Royal Mid-Surrey or The Berkshire on a summer's morning. Birds
sang overhead. There was a regular clunk and click from the practice tee
where competitors were loosening up.
English voices were coming from all directions. 'Oh, I say,' exclaimed one.
'I just chipped in. Bet I can't do that in the competition.' Each competitor
carried a  1/2 -inch thick, 12in-diameter patch of Astroturf, as if it was a
prayer mat. This was to be used on the tees and from the fairways. A ball
ending in the rough had to be played as it lay. Each brown, I noticed,
consisted of a perfectly raked circular surface. Players were expected to
rake the brown after holing out. The browns looked hard and it was difficult
to get any backspin.
I sought refuge from the heat in the office of Dave Greedy, a slim Welshman
who is the manager of the country club. I wanted to talk about golf; he was
anxious to know about the Welsh rugby team that had just unexpectedly beaten
England. We compromised. He talked rugby and I talked golf until a taxi came
to collect me and return me to my hotel.
They do things properly down in Dubai. Golf is only the half of it. Safaris
in four-wheel drive vehicles into the desert, hot air balloon rides, horse
and camel racing, rugby, squash and tennis: all these are available. But
golf was what I was most interested in. My four-day visit convinced me that
Dubai's courses equal any in the world; all they need is better marketing.
