TO all appearances, Dubai is continuing to re-inforce its position as the
mercantile capital of the Gulf. Second richest of the seven states which
form the United Arab Emirates, over the years Dubai has earned for itself
the sobriquet Dubai Inc. by virtue of its business acumen and the shrewd
instinct, not only of its former celebrated ruler, Sheikh Rashid, but also
of the merchant community as a whole.
It has also benefited - and continues to benefit - from a healthy surplus of
capital from oil revenues, which has enabled the government, the ruling Al
Maktoum family, to build the best infrastructure that money can buy.
Under Sheikh Rashid, Dubai has also equipped itself with industrial
facilities on a par with the best in the world, a tradition continued by his
sons with the creation of a Free Zone Authority and industrial area at Jebel
Ali and the establishment on a commercial basis of Dubai's own airline.
The combination of capital wealth, personal commitment, and sheer hard work
have helped to provide Dubai with a freedom to make its own decisions within
the federation in its formative years, and have subsequently enabled it to
keep going through two regional wars and the collapse of oil prices in the
mid-eighties.
These conditions, not least the availability of continuing reserves of
capital, are changing, however. To compensate, the government is trying to
enlarge and improve on developments that have already taken place. The
government's Economic Department, set up in July 1992, but only really in
operation since June this year, has the job of overseeing the management of
some of the government's onshore industries, of representing Dubai at
federal meetings where legislation is drafted, and, of most immediate
importance to the business community and potential investors, of
streamlining the trade licence registration process, a source of
considerable ambiguity and frustration in recent years.
In addition, the government has been spending a lot of money to improve the
road network and other infrastructure; and its commerce and tourism
promotion board is waging an effective campaign to attract more investors
and tourists, the overall aim being to create an economy based on
self-sustaining tourist and regional services industries, for an era when
the cushion of wealth from oil revenues is no longer there.
On the investment front, it is intended that the Economic Department should
develop into a one-stop shop where it will be possible to establish a
limited liability company. Many businessmen still complain, however, about
the amount of time-consuming paperwork, and the cost - Arabic translations
at Dh100 (Dollars 27) a page - when it comes to the enactment of a coherent
legal code.
Taken together, these measures should ensure that Dubai retains its
prominence, if not its pre-eminence, as the mercantile capital of the Gulf.
But there are several conditions to be fulfilled and a number of potential
weaknesses which may make it more difficult to keep the strategy on course.
These include:
continued regional political stability;
the Economic Department's ability to live up to the demands made on it;
the progressive implementation of a coherent and effective business legal
framework;
the peaceful development of the federation and of Dubai's role within it,
a guarantee of continuing abundant sources of energy at affordable prices.
The successful resolution of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis removed doubts in
investors' minds over whether the west would intervene in a crisis, and
instilled a degree of confidence about the Gulf which had been previously
lacking.
Iran's occupation of, and claims on, three UAE islands near the strait of
Hormuz, has not so far led to anything more than curt exchanges of
diplomatic notes, and resolutions from foreign ministers of the six-member
Gulf Co-operation Council. Iran's apparent decision to invest in expensive
weaponry at a time when it is thought least able to afford it, and for
motives which are not clear, has certainly caused concern - but so far
nothing more.
These problems are so sensitive that in Dubai senior officials refuse to
discuss them. This is partly in deference to Abu Dhabi and the federation.
Foreign affairs comes within the jurisdiction of the presidency, that is to
say, Sheikh Zayed in Abu Dhabi, where it is reported there is a real fear of
Iran trying to extend its physical control over other Arab Gulf islands.
Dubai is thought to share this apprehension, but not to the same degree. The
trading links between Dubai and Iran are historically very strong, and the
relationship deeper and more subtle than that between Abu Dhabi and Iran.
Other matters of foreign policy, including the US policy of 'dual
containment' of Iraq and Iran, are not ones which Sheikh Mohammad Bin
Rashid, the defence minister, is prepared to discuss. But it is known that
as a result of the Gulf war, he is a leading proponent of a much greater
depth of co-operation between member countries of the GCC, and continuing
links with the US and the west. The UAE and particularly its president
Sheikh Zayed, was one of the staunchest supporters of the US-led coalition.
The outline peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation falls into the same category.
Critics of the modern form of tribal leadership, of which there are a few in
Dubai, contend that the system of government by word-of-mouth and by
telephone, is inadequate for the administration of a modern state. There is
no legislative assembly or consultative council within Dubai - where the
majlis, or open session held by the sheikhs, acts as an alternative forum
for discussion, and for petitions to be presented. To be present at one such
majlis is to see tribal democracy in action at its most basic level.
On the other hand even critics acknowledge that in a state as small as
Dubai, there is enough delegation of authority to individuals and
institutions for the state to function sufficiently well. By contrast with
some of its neighbours, Dubai's public administration is smooth and
efficient, and better than some European countries.
Where tribal leadership falls short - and Dubai is only one small example in
the whole of Arabia - is in its inability to decentralise authority, and to
make the most of existing opportunities. Industries such as Dubal, a
state-owned competitor on world markets; Dubai Drydocks, a successful and
apparently profitable alternative to Singapore's ship-repair facilities; and
Emirates Air, a fast-growing airline, are all in need of capital that public
shareholders could provide, but have never even published a balance sheet.
They should have been partly privatised long ago.
The UAE as a whole does not yet have a formal stock exchange. Private
capital, and not least that belonging to the ruling families themselves,
could be harnessed to gel with Dubai's sizeable and hugely wealthy business
community to create a state of shareholders.
There is indeed scope for the for the UAE - which last year saw such an
outflow of private capital that it ran a balance of payments deficit for the
first time since federation - to work with the GCC countries as a whole, to
create a GCC-wide capital markets.
For day-to-day government, Dubai's ruling family is more than adequate. It
is respected and the rulers have their their ear to the ground. There are no
Islamic pressures of any significance, at least for the time being. And when
it comes to relations with Abu Dhabi and the federal authorities, natural
evolution suggests that Dubai's autonomy will continue to lessen by degree.
The key long-term challenge for the leadership may be to instill in today's
youth the drive and commitment that has characterised the emirate for the
past 30 years. Several statements from anxious federal officials suggest
that the next generation is not being sufficiently prepared for the day when
the Dubai government will not be able to support so many subsidies, or
create so many opportunities by a simple expenditure of capital.
