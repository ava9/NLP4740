The Emirates Golf Club is as much a source of national pride as it is a
hefty display of one-upmanship over Dubai's neighbours.
Locals delight in repeating an old joke: 'Five years ago Bahrain, Abu Dhabi
and Dubai each decided to build a golf course - Bahrain is still arguing
over its location, Abu Dhabi continues to study the plans while Dubai plays
its 100,000th round.'
Dubai has a right to gloat; the course is a masterpiece of modern
engineering and a defiant snub to the ravages of the surrounding desert.
Even the glossy brochures and superlatives showered upon the club do not
prepare the first-time visitor for the sheer impact of seeing nature turned
on its head.
Standing emerald green amid miles of yellow sand in all directions, the golf
course is tantamount to a national monument. The first grass course in the
Middle East and the first championship golf course between Rome and
Singapore, the Emirates Golf Club was designed and built to impress. The
striking architecture of the clubhouse, symbolising the traditional Bedouin
tent, the pristine fairways and imaginative landscaping are replete with
five-star service and flamingoes.
The 700,000 square metres are landscaped with thousands of cooling
Casuarinas, Royal South American Palms, Washingtonias and giant Arizona
cacti. The daily requirement of 500,000 gallons of desalinated water arrives
via a 5km pipeline across the desert from an aluminium smelter.
The irrigation system challenges belief and Middle East temperatures with
750 computer-controlled pop-up sprinklers. A triumph of brute engineering,
it also one of the best advertisements for Dubai.
Now one of the most popular and prestigious venues on the PGA (Professional
Golf Association) European Tour, it has been played by all the top
international players. Around the world, thousands of armchair golfers who
know next to nothing else about Dubai, know about the golf course - some can
even describe the lakeside green of the ninth hole in detail.
Millions of dollars spent on advertising would not have implanted such
positive connotations of Dubai nor reaped such handsome dividends.
The economic spin-offs can not be overstated - the Emirates Golf Club is a
big asset, acting as a catalyst for both tourism and business. Such is its
success that a second course, the Dubai Creek, is under construction and
nearing completion.
Almost surpassing previous engineering feats, the Creek clubhouse traces the
lines of a sailing dhow and affords a panoramic view of the city. Membership
of the Emirates Golf Club spans senior executives from multinationals,
international institutions and leading banks - and accordingly the club
provides a comprehensive range of corporate facilities.
The club management is not certain which makes up the larger proportion of
its clientele - the golfers who then find business or the businessmen who
come to play to golf. Either way, golf in Dubai is big business.
