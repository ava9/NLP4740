THE STORY two weeks ago about my magical mystery flight to Bali aboard
Garuda, the hapless Indonesian state airline - we stopped four times and
endured a door-to-door travelling time of 28 hours - has drawn a reply from
Timothy Knight, managing director of Eastravel, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel, Travel editor.
Eastravel, an air travel consultant and organiser based in Ipswich,
specialises in tailor-made holidays, especially to the Far East.
Knight writes: 'Whilst I fully agree with your philosophy of ensuring the
most direct or non-stop flight for a long-haul journey to a single
destination, those flights on quality airlines which stop en route offer the
opportunity to stop over, thus getting far better value for money and a
chance to break up the journey into smaller sectors.
'For example, the journey undertaken by yourself to Indonesia could have
been just a one-stop flight with Singapore Airlines, which Eastravel offers
as a possible choice; or up to three stops flying with Emirates (the airline
of the United Arab Emirates). The stops could be selected in either
direction and then combined with Singapore Airlines' (one-stop) flight in
the other.
'En route to Indonesia, Emirates offers Dubai and the Emirates with a choice
of adventure and superb hotels; Sri Lanka, with possibly a chauffeur-driven
tour; and then Singapore, a gateway to Malaysia. All these possibilities
could be combined with an overland tour in Java ending finally (exhausted)
in a Bali resort.
'Similar journeys can be organised to Japan and Korea, Australia and New
Zealand, via numerous Oriental countries.'
This is all quite true: the market in stop-over travel is large and growing.
You can do virtually anything you want and stop anywhere you want, though
you need a perspicacious travel agent to help you wade through the fine
print and spot the best-value deals.
As Timothy Knight acknowledges, my whinge was about the time taken on Garuda
just to get to Bali. I didn't want to stop in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Singapore
and Jakarta; but I did.
If you are planning a single-destination long-haul holiday, try and get a
non-stop flight. Failing that, insist on the most direct (fewest stops)
flight available. You may encounter trickiness. Many airline staff use the
word 'direct' to imply 'non-stop.' I have heard them do it time after time.
Keep flying hours to the minimum. Do not patronise airlines that take you
all round the houses for obscure reasons of their own.
I used to have a rule that 15 hours' flying time was the maximum I would
consider without a proper stop and rest. It sounds wimpy, but I plan to
re-adopt it. If you fly for 20 hours or more you can suffer severe
jet-smack, and that can spoil your holiday.
If you can afford the time for genuine stop-overs and mini-breaks as a way
of interrupting your journey, get some specialist brochures, including those
of the airlines. Eastravel has its own. (Eastravel: 79 Norwich Road, Ipswich

Useful for would-be holiday litigants is Successful Holidays, And What To Do
If They're Not, by Michael and Jacqui Welham, which serves three broad
purposes. It decribes the parties involved in travel, from operators and
agents to travel associations. It steers you towards holiday success with
pointers and advice. And it explains the varied options for winning
compensation if things go wrong.
It offers numerous case histories, and describes the impact of the new EC
directive on package holidays. There is a directory of addresses and
telephone numbers for government offices, tourist boards, embassies, travel
associations, airlines, vaccination centres, what have you. Available in
some bookshops and newsagents, also from: J A W Publications, Becketts
Cottage, Bungay Road, Hempnall, Norfolk NR15 2NG, England. Tel: 0508-498103.
