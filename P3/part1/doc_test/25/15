There is some good reason why expatriates should refer to this Gulf port as
'Do Buy' rather than in impeccably correct phonetic Arabic. If people here
are not selling things, they are as often as not selling the marketing to
sell them better.
Business is the very fabric of Dubai and the fabric of business itself is
sold as hard as the cotton garments which are made up locally, sewn with
designer labels and shipped off towards America, Europe, Iran, Pakistan or
anywhere else that can pay.
Believe the glossy literature, much of it pumped out with abandon by the
Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, and there is no better place in
the world to do business. No taxes, no recruitment problems, no currency
restrictions, efficient services, abundant energy, hassle-free bureaucracy
and a market of over 1bn people (if you include places within range of
Dubai's airport, that is).
Much of it is true. But - and it is a sizeable 'but' for anyone unrehearsed
in Gulf ways - there are some things the brochures do not mention about
business in Dubai which a visitor will notice well before he or she spots
the market of 1bn people.
Getting into Dubai is the first small hurdle. Only Gulf nationals and
Britons, whose privileged status is a relic of empire, require no visa.
Everyone else must apply for entry visas before arrival. Obtaining one from
a United Arab Emirates embassy is usually just a formality, but the process
can be expedited considerably by seeking a visa through either the Commerce
and Tourism Board (whose overseas offices are listed in this survey's
Business Guide) or a hotel in the emirate (also listed). Along with visas,
Dubai also requires visitors to have sponsors, which again can usually be
best arranged through either hotels, the board or, if you have one, a good
local business contact.
That leads to a second proviso. Nothing in Dubai can be accomplished with
reasonable speed without having a good local Arab or Arab-speaking contact.
Although 'who you know' matters less in Dubai than anywhere else in the Gulf
 -and arguably than anywhere in the Middle East - it still counts for a lot.
There is no shortage - rather a glut - of advice available about how to
enter Dubai's business world, mainly from the Commerce and Tourism Promotion
Board. Moreover, the emirate's way of business is so wholly western in
approach that there is very little about the place which appears foreign.
Dubai's government ensures that this so by paying some people good salaries.
That, in turn, raises the question of Dubai's government, and the issue of
bureaucracy. Some established local businessmen will tell you with a grin
that Dubai has no government. Some newer enterprises, still unravelling
residual pieces of red tape, are less positive on this score.
It is certainly true that Dubai's government - essentially the Makhtoum
brothers together with their respective offices and ministries - appears to
do everything in its power to cut to a minimum the sort of form-filling and
foot-tapping bureaucracy for which other Gulf states have become legendary.
Earlier this year, it established a ministry of the economy, headed by the
youthful Mr Mohammed al-Abbar who spent six years running a government
property company in Singapore. Its specific purpose is to eliminate
bureaucratic delay, collect and collate useful economic data and, generally,
to be a 'service-oriented company'.
More than this, Dubai also set up in the early 1980s the Jebel Ali free
trade zone, a sprawling 67-berth port 30 minutes' drive from Dubai in which
410 companies have already established themselves as 100 per cent owners.
They pay no corporate taxes for 15 years - a holiday renewable for a further
period of the same length - can repatriate all profits and benefit from
cheap power, ample land and cheap labour, and a smart resort hotel.
The whole concept was revolutionary in the Gulf. As a result of it, Dubai
won few friends in the region but many friends from elsewhere. But even
doing business in 'hassle-free' Jebel Ali can suffer from delays. For
instance, one new arrival disputes marketing claims that gaining a licence
to operate in Jebel Ali takes only 30 days.
He says that it took him three times as long and he could accomplish nothing
until he had obtained it - no telephone, and so no headed notepaper or
business cards; not even a driving licence. 'It's a shock when you come from
a European system', he observes.
Nevertheless, Jebel Ali is probably as bureaucracy-free as anywhere in the
Middle East. Indeed, the local rule of thumb in Dubai is that red tape
proliferates the further one ventures from this free port into the
surrounding Gulf.
Anyone setting up a company in Dubai proper must do so with a local partner
owning a majority share, as is the practice elsewhere in the Gulf. The forms
of ownership, agency agreements and company structures vary widely and are
negotiable up to a point and apparently binding rules can be side-stepped
but with some assistance.
A new commercial law has been expected for some time. Its aim is to codify
all forms of joint venture or corporate arrangements in the United Arab
Emirates. But its details have still to be formulated adding an element of
uncertainty to launching a new enterprise.
The effects of this uncertainty should not be overstated. Dubai is too eager
to invite new investment and fresh business to allow much to discourage
them. And whatever vestigial delaying Gulf practices remain, the emirate's
business culture is essentially western in feel.
For most practical purposes, for example, not a single Berlitz Arabic phrase
is required - nearly all transactions can be conducted in English.
While Jebel Ali is a corporate nirvana in the Gulf, Dubai is a manageable
hinterland, albeit one muddied by 'a quagmire of clerks', in the words of
one local.
The UAE federal government, the next grudgingly conceded layer of authority
and one referred to usually as Abu Dhabi, is viewed by many natives of Dubai
as a rather strange place up the coast without a golf course.
