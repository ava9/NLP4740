Medieval banquets, Venetian masked balls and Beefeaters charging among the
dunes do not raise eyebrows in Dubai. It is possible to stage the most
Disneyesque event and carry it off with the accompaniment of superb food and
five-star accommodation.
Little wonder that Dubai has captured the fertile imaginations of incentive
operators. They are always looking for different destinations, mostly for
business clients, and Dubai provides the almost perfect mix of the right
ingredients. It is off-beat enough to be exotic but in this case the
travel-speak does not mean roughing it. There is an efficient ground system
of experienced operators, in addition to a wide choice of excellent hotels.
Whacky incentives and corporate promotions could not be executed with the
same aplomb in many Arab countries. All well and good being lost in the
desert and fending off the marauding Bedouin, but the tired and thirsty
businessman will require a hotel with showers that work, and a drink. In
some other Arab countries, the paperwork required for a bash in the desert
would take until nightfall while the implications of helicopters circling
the dunes in somewhere like Syria are too awful to contemplate.
Business-based incentive travel fits the profile of Dubai's tourism
promotion drive. Business promotions, after all, are good for business -
large companies entertaining their clients who are, in turn, businessmen.
For a country which effectively has a No Backpackers sign at the airport,
this is good news. Lots of businessmen coming in, even if they do insist on
dressing up as tribesmen.
Dubai is well accustomed to the eccentricities of the English and the words
of Noel Coward have been adapted to account for the vagaries of business
promotions and incentive tours. Largely unsuitable for publication, the
refrain is: 'Mad dogs and businessmen go out in the desert sun'.
Ever vigilant on the opportunities front, Dubai's hotels have developed a
range of both tourist and business incentive programmes. The Hatta Fort and
Jebel Ali hotels produce tailored events, complete with drawbridge, longship
or any other props which may be required. They are a very good deal, with a
40 per cent discount on normal rates for groups of 15 people or more. Other
hotels are jumping on the wagon (stagecoach or canvas-covered, available on
day rates).
Ms Jill Thompson energetically operates a range of Dubai incentives in
co-operation with Gulf Ventures, part of the Gray MacKenzie travel group.
She enthusiastically reports considerable interest in Dubai incentives from
France, Germany and Spain. With wide experience of the Gulf region, Ms
Thompson was well placed to spot the advantages of the emirate and has
helped develop the promotion of Dubai incentives.
They are having the desired effect. Mr Tony McIver from Maritime &amp;
Mercantile International (MMI), enthuses over a recent desert jaunt. The
group set off for a desert outing and spent a couple of hours dune-climbing
in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
There is something exhilarating and perverse about racing up a dune and
plunging down the other side, defying both gravity and common sense.
Stranded in the desert after a breakdown, the driver set off to find help.
Several 'Bedouin' appeared over the horizon, each riding a camel decked in
the company colours and sporting the corporate logo, their riders bearing
gifts of company products. An enforced but thankfully short camel ride
later, the group were enjoying a barbecue, belly dancing and Arabian sunset
before being whisked back to their hotels by helicopter.
Mr McIver's verdict: Impeccable timing, perfectly executed, excellent fun
and jolly good for business.
