<F P=106> [Report from Dubai:"UAE to Compile a Blacklist to Combat </F>
Market Fraud"] 
  [Text] Federal and local authorities in the UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] announced plans to combat fraud and counterfeit 
now that they have promulgated several laws to safeguard the 
integrity of markets and commercial transactions. 
  At the conclusion of a seminar on commercial fraud held in 
Dubai, economic circles called for strengthening all laws and 
regulations dealing with commercial fraud and [urged] that they 
be reexamined in light of modern techniques against fraud, and 
especially those utilized for consumer protection. 
  The seminar, attended by representatives of various 
government agencies in the UAE, called for blacklisting 
merchants and producers who resort to fraud in marketing their 
products to the detriment of consumers. They advocated the 
compilation of a blacklist of unworthy products and called for 
comprehensive coordination among all concerned agencies, be they 
federal or local, in order that they may take more effective 
measures to implement the laws to suppress commercial fraud, and 
to institute penalties, or modify them, in a manner that would 
deter all marketplace cheaters. 
  They emphasized the importance of creating channels of 
communication among the various agencies concerned with 
international economic and commercial fields, the exchange of 
information, and studies. These agencies include local, foreign, 
and joint chambers of commerce, banks, and international 
organizations concerned with prosecuting marine fraud. [They 
also called for] opening channels to exchange information on 
agreements with overseas entities, and especially those with 
which the volume of trade is substantial. 
  The Ministry of the Economy, represented by Undersecretary 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Mubarak, emphasized at the seminar that 
commercial fraud is a phenomenon alien to society and runs 
counter to religious precepts that call for honesty in dealing. 
He added, however, that all commercial markets in the world 
suffer from the phenomenon of commercial fraud, which impacts 
markets negatively, causes imbalances, creates a degree of 
chaos, and denies the market its bulwark of honesty and 
confidence that deals will be fair. He called for wider 
cooperation between the ministry and chambers of commerce, 
municipalities, and customs agencies in order to blunt that 
phenomenon and protect consumers. 
  The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in a study 
presented at the seminar, attributed the phenomenon of fraud in 
UAE markets to the expansion of commercial operations in the 
state after the completion of infrastructure projects; to the 
diversity of commercial activity and market openness to various 
foreign products; to some contractor changeovers to trading in 
goods and products; to the lack of awareness among some 
consumers who rush to buy cheap products without considering the 
ramifications of using them; the lack of merchant familiarity 
with, and understanding of the need to abide by laws that 
regulate commercial activities in the state such as the Company 
Law, the Commercial Agency Law, the Law to Suppress Fraud and 
Deception, Criminal Law, and Commercial Transactions Law; and 
the fact that those merchants do not consult with the relevant 
authorities before initiating all commercial transactions. 
  The [Chamber] added that some of the reasons for the 
phenomenon are that certain merchants exaggerate the prices of 
certain brands of goods and products, the flight of consumers to 
cheaper look-alike goods in the belief that they are of equal 
quality, dealing with exporters and companies before verifying 
their validity, and opening letters of credit without adequate 
protective stipulations. 
  The Dubai Chamber of Commerce argued in another treatise 
that 
fraud extends to three areas--goods; documents such as letters 
of credit, invoices, and bills of lading; and fraud involving 
marine shipping and its regulations. It advised importers to 
avoid being victimized by fraud by securing adequate data on 
producers and exporters from chambers and centers of commerce, 
from their bankers, or from delegations that visit the Chamber 
of Commerce. It further advised importers not to rely on foreign 
company sales representatives who visit the country and not to 
be taken in by appearances put on by the exporter or its sales 
representative. The importers were further urged to ascertain 
the status of local agents, if they handle the transactions, and 
their relationships with exporters. 
  The [Dubai Chamber] said that in order to guarantee that the 
goods arrive in sound condition as specified, importers must ask 
shipping company representatives or agents at ports of loading 
or unloading to audit and scrutinize stipulations and determine 
which organizations are to carry out inspections and issue 
certificates of inspection. They were also admonished to deal 
with domestic shipping companies whenever possible or with 
regular shipping lines which, preferably, have agents in the 
region; avoid shipping on chartered vessels; insure the goods 
with domestic insurance companies; and avoid using the fleets of 
countries that allow open registry. 
  The Chamber also called upon importers when opening letters 
of credit to be sure to record the specifications of the goods 
in detail and exactly as they appear on the purchasing contract; 
not accept bills of lading issued by shipping expediters and 
insist on shipping documents issued by the original marine 
shipper on its stationery; and to tap the services offered by 
international agencies involved with fraud. 
  The Municipality of Abu Dhabi said in its study, however, 
that fraud is connected with the large-scale import of 
foodstuffs into the UAE and with the [related] laws and 
laboratories. It recommended, for the containment of that 
phenomenon, encouraging domestic food production and processing 
operations which would make it easier to thoroughly oversee all 
stages of production and therefore ensure that products are 
received by consumers in good condition; cooperation among 
relevant agencies, unification of decision and regulation 
issuing bodies, and the expediting of uniform standards and laws 
governing foodstuffs in the country; raising consumer awareness 
through information media; encouraging public service 
associations to expand their activities by supporting them 
morally and materially; and tightening oversight at gateways 
through which foodstuffs flow into the country. 
  The Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce asserted that the 
government has issued enough laws and regulations to contain the 
phenomenon of commercial fraud but that legislative containment 
is not in itself [capable of accomplishing the task] and must be 
supported by an analogous solidification of effort by all 
entities concerned with information, security, and economic 
affairs, each in its area of specialization.
