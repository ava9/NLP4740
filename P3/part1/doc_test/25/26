FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (7): New curbs concern foreign banks -
Banking

IT took just one well-intentioned directive from the UAE central bank to
change the complexion of future business opportunities for Dubai's foreign
banking community.
Until October 16, there seemed no reason why loan assets, deposits and
profits should not have increased over the next 15 months more or less as
they had since the beginning of last year - for foreign banks as well as for
the five locally-incorporated banks which originate and do most of their
business in Dubai.
But the five local banks - in common with the stronger local banks
throughout the Emirates - are not affected by the central bank directive in
anything like the same degree as their foreign counterparts.
The bombshell for foreign banks came with the announcement of new rules
setting a limit on loans to single borrowers or group of related borrowers
at 7 per cent of a bank's capital base. A key clause of the central bank's
directive identified a bank's capital base as the same as that used for
capital adequacy purposes based on the 1988 ruling of the Basel committee of
the Bank for International Settlements. This stipulated that banks worldwide
had to have an adequacy of 8 per cent capital relative to risk assets, to
ensure they had enough capital to cope with a crisis.
The calculation of total advances to customers is graded according to the
type of advance - a straightforward loan counts as a 100 per cent advance
while a letter of credit counts for less. The UAE and other Gulf states
except Saudi Arabia were listed as high risk country borrowers. And even
though the UAE is claiming average capital adequacy among its banks of 10
per cent - 2 per cent higher than that required by the Basel Committee - it
is not, yet, accepted by the Basel committee on a par with Saudi Arabia or
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
The latest UAE central bank restrictions follows a long list of regulations
issued since 1985 when UAE banks paid the price for some poor-quality loan
assets, and were either forcibly merged by emirate government decree or
bailed out with an injection of fresh capital.
In Dubai - as in Abu Dhabi - the combination of forced mergers and new
capital enabled new management, with support from the emirate government, to
start clawing back bad debts. Mr Sultan Al-Suweidi, the UAE central bank
governor, probably has more experience of this kind of exercise than all the
other UAE bank managing directors. Starting in 1982 with Abu Dhabi
Investment Company, Mr Al-Suweidi went on to manage the Bahrain-based Gulf
International Bank which had burned its fingers in Saudi Arabia; and finally
to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank which inherited the problems left over from the
three banks from which it was created. Even without the BCCI fiasco, it
would be understandable, as foreign bankers in Dubai are the first to
acknowledge, if Mr Al-Suweidi has a bee in his bonnet about the quality of
loan assets.
Ironically for Dubai, a city-state which prides itself on its laissez-faire
approach, there now remains only one commercial bank out of five
Dubai-registered banks which has no government shareholding. This is the
Bank of Oman (renamed MashreqBank on October 1 for reasons of internal
strategy.
All the others - the National Bank of Dubai, Emirates Bank International
(EBI), Middle East Bank (MEB), and Commercial Bank of Dubai - are either
owned outright by the government or majority-owned by it. EBI is 80 per cent
government-owned, and EBI in turn owns 98 per cent of Middle East Bank.
None of these banks will have any serious problem with the central bank
circular. Mr Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, MashreqBank's chief executive officer,
pointed out his bank's capital adequacy was 17 per cent. After two years of
planned restructuring leading up to the change in name, its 1992 return on
assets was 2.1 per cent and 21 per cent on shareholders funds. Its liquidity
ratio was also high at 41 per cent. Profits last year exceeded Dh200m, up
more than 40 per cent from 1991. Eighty per cent of these derived from its
home base, Dubai; the balance from its branches overseas in New York,
London, Hong Kong and four other countries.
EBI is itself the result of government intervention in three former local
banks which were bailed out between 1983 and 1985. The bank, applying
lessons learned from the past, has its own internal credit restrictions
which, according to Mr Anis Al Jallaf, managing director and chief executive
officer, confine lending to below central bank limits. However, with
shareholders' funds of Dh1.17bn, the 7 per cent limit would still amount to
Dh80m.
Mr Al Jallaf is somewhat sympathetic to the position foreign banks now find
themselves in. He says: 'UAE national banks abroad can lend according to the
capital base of their group and work according to a country limit.' He and
others interpret the central bank's directive as a warning shot across the
bows of smaller, less viable banks to find more capital and merge.
The dilemma for foreign banks is all the more acute in that much of their
sizeable exposure is to contractors and traders dealing on a large scale.
They require cash facilities, guarantees and letters of credit which can
amount to one third or more of the value of a contract. If the credit
limitation is not modified, they would have to go to a syndicate of banks
rather than to one alone - much more expensive and time-consuming.
One foreign banker's reaction to the central bank circular was blunt: 'If
the central bank wants to get rid of foreign banks, it is going about it the
right way.' Business prospects are favourable enough, however, and foreign
banks are likely to stay even if between now and January 1, when the
directive starts coming into force, they do everything they can to get the
central bank to amend its directive.
Most of the 13 larger foreign banks have branches or are based in Dubai.
Their combined balance sheets for 1992 showed net profits soaring by some 32
per cent over 1991 to almost Dh300m. Loans and deposits were up 11.5 per
cent and 12 per cent respectively.
British Bank of the Middle East reported profits up 17 per cent compared
with 1991; Standard Chartered up 26 per cent; Citibank almost double the
profits of the previous year. Official figures show that loans by foreign
banks accounted for more than half their assets; those by local banks at 40
per cent.
If the central bank would accept that foreign banks could use their head
office or parent's global capital base as a yardstick, that, said one
foreign banker, would solve their immediate problem. Another possible
solution is for the bank's head office to increase capital funds allocated
to the UAE central bank as an interest-free deposit. If neither of these two
is acceptable to the central bank then one banker suggested larger loans
would go onto the books of off-shore banks, away from UAE rules.
The deadline for reporting large exposure is March 31 next year, but
extensions can be granted until the end of 1995. If the UAE economy in
general, and Dubai's in particular, remain buoyant, it is more than likely
that foreign banks will stay for a slice of the business.
