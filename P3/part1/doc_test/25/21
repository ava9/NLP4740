THE UAE is an interesting business legal environment because of the
interface between the federal (UAE) legislation and regulations in force in
individual emirates, including, of course, Dubai.
The law is embodied in codified decrees published in either the Federal or
individual emirates' Official Gazettes, which then need application and
interpretation in the context of an active and established commercial
environment.
Businesses in Dubai are required to comply with federal legislation as well
as Dubai's own regulations, which are designed to attract responsible and
appropriate foreign businesses to Dubai, which itself has become a
significant regional centre.
In 1993, the Dubai government has established the Economic Department, which
now looks after, controls and facilitates the registration of businesses in
the Emirate of Dubai (other than in the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ). The JAFZ
has its own individual registration and licensing requirements and operates
under its own enabling legislation: an interesting recent development at
JAFZ has been the introduction in 1992 of a single-shareholder
limited-liability entity known as a Free Zone Establishment (FZE).
While there are considerable advantages and incentives in setting up in
JAFZ, many businesses still opt (or require) to establish outside JAFZ in
Dubai itself.
There are a variety of ways - many not mutually exclusive - in which a
foreign business may operate in or into Dubai under the auspices of the
Commercial Companies Law, some of whose provisions are at the moment under
review, or under the Commercial Agencies Law.
Care and advice needs to be taken over selecting how to establish. Outside
JAFZ, with very few exceptions, some local connection ( a sponsor, agent or
partner) is required. As a general rule, limited companies established with
foreign investment need 51 per cent local participation.
By far the most interesting prospective legal development in the UAE (and in
particular in Dubai as a commercial and financial centre) is the imminent
introduction of the Commercial Transaction Law, which will need to be
considered very closely in parallel with the existing civil law.
In the vibrant mercantile environment of Dubai, the introduction of
regulatory commercial legislation will be particularly relevant and, it is
expected, beneficial in terms of commercial activity. However, there is
bound to be a transitional period while the experienced business practices
will need to change to conform with the new law.
The new legislation is comprehensive and, although it is similar to
commercial legislation in other Gulf states, it has been carefully
considered in the context of local requirements. With the recent
introduction of intellectual property legislation, the UAE will, with the
new Commercial Transactions Law, have a more complete body of business law.
The development of business law and the constant inter-relation between
local and foreign interests, particularly in Dubai (as a regional centre),
will continue to provide a challenging and stimulating environment in which
there will be an increasing need for sophisticated, but nonetheless
practical, legal structuring and documentation.
