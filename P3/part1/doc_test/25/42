  [Text] South Africa, back in the Middle East after a 
boycott lasting decades, has set up its first international arms 
office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to break into the 
lucrative market in the region. 
  Office director Peter Greeling said the weapons giant 
Armscor 
[Armaments Corporation of South Africa] opened the office in Abu 
Dhabi last year and it covered the six-nation Gulf Co-operation 
Council (GCC) and other countries in the Middle East. 
  "It is South Africa's first arms office in the world," Mr. 
Greeling said. "It will co-ordinate arms sales to the region 
and identify opportunities for military co-operation." 
  The project coincides with plans by GCC states to bolster 
their armies following the Gulf War. Military experts said the 
six members were expected to spend more than five billion 
dollars annually on defence up to the year 2,000. 
  The United States, France and Britain will probably be the 
main beneficiaries of such plans, as they already dominate the 
Middle East arms market. However, South Africa participated in 
a ground arms show in Abu Dhabi early in 1993 and sent 
representatives of more than 30 companies to an international 
air show in Dubai late 1993 to exhibit helicopters and other air 
defence systems. The main feature in its pavilion was the CSH-2 
Rooivalk attack helicopter. 
  South African officials said that they were negotiating with 
some Gulf countries to sell the Rooivalk, one of the most 
advanced helicopters in the world. "We are optimistic about 
deals," Greeling said. "We are not competitive in some types of 
weapons because ours are expensive. But we are competitive in 
artillery, which is the best in the world. We also have the 
Rooivalk." 
  The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait 
and the UAE -- lifted the boycott against South Africa two years 
ago after sweeping reforms by President F.W. de Klerk to 
dismantle "apartheid."
