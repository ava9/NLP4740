Nowhere is hard to get to from Dubai - which is hardly surprising given that
Dubai's location betwixt Europe and the Far East has been one of the prime
motors of its development, writes Mark Nicholson.
Within the emirates itself, Dubai is 10 minutes' drive from Sharjah and a
series of shortish hops thereafter to Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain and Ras al
Khaimah. The Indian Ocean emirate of Fujairah is just an hour-and-a-half's
drive over the mountains, while Abu Dhabi is two hours away by road to the
south-west along what is perhaps the emirates' least impressive and most
hazardous main route. The daily Emirates Air services shuttle from Dubai
airport is less hair-raising, and would probably be even if undertaken in a
Sopwith Camel.
Muscat, the capital of Oman, is also within four hours' drive, but visitors
will be allowed entry only on production of a No Objection Certificate. It
is best sought well before leaving because obtaining one takes time to work
through the bureaucracy. The same advice holds for all other Gulf states,
all of which require visas for non-Gulf nationals.
Most other Gulf states are best reached by air. Gulf Air, in which Abu Dhabi
holds a stake, flies four times daily to Bahrain, twice a day to Doha and
once to Muscat. Emirates Air flies twice daily to Kuwait City, as does
Kuwait Airways. Saudia, the kingdom's carrier, has six flights a day to
Riyadh, four to Jeddah and three to Dhahran, the oil centre on the east
coast.
Sanaa, Yemen's capital, can be reached four times a week with Yemenia. Iran
Air flies twice weekly to Bandar Abbas and Tehran, as does Emirates, Dubai's
carrier. Both also fly to Shiraz at least once weekly.
For all trips in and around the Gulf, it is worth checking the Moslem
calendar, since flights tend to book solid in the days just before and just
after the main Eid holidays in the first half of the year.
Further-flung destinations are if anything even better served. The huge
number of Asian and Indian expatriates in Dubai, combined with its
traditional place as a fuelling stop for European-Asian flights means that
there are several daily flights to most big Indian and Pakistani cities,
Singapore, Hong Kong and, though slightly fewer, to Tokyo. Most big European
cities are similarly well served and from July Emirates is to add Paris,
Rome and Zurich to its European stops.
Dubai is replete with travel agents. The biggest is the Dubai National Air
Travel Agency, headquartered in the vast Airline Centre off the main airport
road. to the airport. DNATA is the main agent for 25 of the 55 airlines
which use Dubai International airport. House of Travel, a Kuwaiti-owned
business, also offers a 24-hour booking service and associated car hire and
hotel bookings.
