Eleven airlines yesterday announced resumed flights to India after the World
Health Organisation declared most of the country plague-free. Air India, the
international carrier, has been allowed to resume its services to Dubai and
Doha, while Emirates (Dubai's airline), Gulf Air and Kuwait Airways have
also resumed their Indian services after nearly a month. But Abu Dhabi,
Sharjah and other members of the United Arab Emirates, as well as Pakistan,
Bangladesh and some Russian and central Asian countries, have yet to lift
the ban on flights.
