PORT URGED TO FIND BERTH FOR MUSEUM SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has urged the Port of Los Angeles to find a berth 
for the merchant ship Lane Victory, but it stopped short of recommending that 
the ship be placed at Berth 87 in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles Maritime 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-0 vote represented a partial victory for the Long Beach-based U.S. 
Merchant Marine Veterans World War II, which has been trying to renovate the 
ship into a floating museum and is pressing the Harbor Department to give up 
Berth 87. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Department has repeatedly refused the group's requests, saying it 
needs Berth 87 for use as a container terminal. However, spokeswoman Julia 
Nagano said, "We are working with them to find a permanent home and we are very 
supportive of their venture." 
</P>
<P>
The council's resolution, introduced by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, asks 
the Harbor Department to find a home for the ship "in a locale with easy public 
access and adequate parking accommodations, where it will serve as a memorial 
museum and benefit the residents of Los Angeles and all of Southern 
California."
