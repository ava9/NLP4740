  [Text] The 90 tons of toxic chemical waste in the cargo of 
the ship Europetrader is a threat to the Greek sea and the 
Mediterranean. 
  According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS 
[expansion unknown], on Saturday 26 March, 90 tons of toxic 
chemical waste were loaded from the U.S. Incirlik Air Base in 
Turkey. The chemicals were loaded in five large containers and 
a smaller one and were taken to the port of Mersin escorted by 
three vehicles, two American and one of the Turkish police. 
  The travelling documents say "toxic chemical waste destined 
for Britain for processing and destruction." 
  According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS (SOS 
Akedeniz), at the Mersin port the containers were loaded aboard 
the Europetrader, flying the Bahamas flag, which sailed at 2000 
on Saturday for Izmir. The ship was expected to reach Izmir 
last night. 
  SOS Akedeniz asked to inspect the cargo before the ship 
sailed from Mersin. However, the authorities refused on the 
grounds that "Turkey did not have the necessary uniforms and 
equipment to open and check the containers," which do not have 
any information about the material inside them. 
  The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS contacted the Turkish 
chapter and was informed that "the cargo could be radioactive 
waste that will not reach Britain but will possibly be dumped 
somewhere in the Mediterranean." 
  This view is enforced by the path of Europetrader, which 
instead of sailing for Britain left for Izmir. The above was 
told to ELEVTHEROTIPIA by the Greek chapter of Mediterranean 
SOS, which asked the Ministry of Merchant Marine to continuously 
follow the ship's path to prevent it from dumping the dangerous 
waste in the sea. 
  The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS also asked the 
Ministry of Merchant Marine to be in continuous contact with 
authorities of other Mediterranean countries, as is required by 
the international accords on the transportation of dangerous 
waste. 
  Nikolaos Khrisoyelos, member of the Greek chapter of 
Mediterranean SOS, said that now that Greece is presiding over 
the European Union it should act decisively to prevent the 
transfer of dangerous waste, "especially under conditions that 
do not provide for inspection and clarity in the transportation 
of these dangerous wastes."
