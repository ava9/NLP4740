In Oxnard, hundred-year floods have been more common than museum openings, yet 
within two days next week, two new treasure troves will pass significant 
milestones toward completion. 
</P>
<P>
After a ribbon-cutting Saturday afternoon, a temporary home for the Gull Wings 
Children's Museum will formally open for business Wednesday in a 
7,400-square-foot building on West 4th Street that once was occupied by the 
USO. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, the Ventura County Parks and Harbor Foundation will break 
ground Thursday on a 5,000-square-foot building for the Ventura County Maritime 
Museum at Channel Islands Harbor. The museum is expected to open in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
More than two decades (and two hundred-year floods) have come and gone since 
the conversion of the Carnegie Library to Oxnard's only museum, the Carnegie 
Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of both new museums say Oxnard is the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Dockside Space 
</P>
<P>
For Frank Crane, executive director of the maritime museum, it was where he was 
able to find rare dockside space and a developer, Martin V. Smith, willing to 
foot the bill for the $500,000 structure. Smith plans to build a commercial 
complex, including a restaurant, next to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat James, director of the children's museum, Oxnard was the place where 
the City Council not only agreed to fund a feasibility study and promotional 
campaign but also rent her the building at well below the market rate. 
</P>
<P>
A retired teacher, she is hoping that the public will prove as easy a sell. 
There are about 400 children's museums in the United States, but some 350 have 
been built in the last three years, James said. 
</P>
<P>
James figures that most people will draw a blank when it comes to the 
relatively new phenomenon that allows children to learn concepts in science, 
history and social studies by playing with exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people hear the word museum and think of glass-enclosed boxes," said the 
35-year classroom veteran. "But children's museums are based on the hands-on 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Facility 
</P>
<P>
Museum directors had originally hoped to hold out for a facility at least twice 
as large, but decided that opening temporarily on 4th Street would give them an 
opportunity to get the concept across. They hope to win support for a larger, 
permanent facility. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the approach has been working, James said. Adults who visited the 
museum in the past month as the final exhibits were being constructed murmured, 
"Oh, that's what it's all about,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Children, meanwhile, seemed to understand immediately. 
</P>
<P>
They dug enthusiastically for petrified wood and fossils in "Discovery," a 
sandbox designed to simulate an archeological dig. They took glee in walking 
with crutches and walkers in "Just Suppose," an exhibit designed to encourage 
understanding of the disabled. And they frolicked among the museum's collection 
of costumes and hats, posing before brightly lit mirrors and on a stage where 
they were allowed to flaunt their new identities. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Bohan, a Port Hueneme surgical technologist whose 7-year-old twin sons 
visited the museum Saturday, said it fills a long-overlooked void. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much for Children 
</P>
<P>
"There's the beach and a museum at the Ventura Harbor, but there isn't much to 
do with kids around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a permanent home, museum directors hope to devote an entire wing to the 
heritage of the county's ethnic groups. Another wing, which would house an 
aircraft fuselage, would be devoted to flight. 
</P>
<P>
But the temporary museum, which will be open Wednesdays through Sundays, is by 
no means sparse. For $1 admission, children can tinker with a model railroad 
scene complete with a circus train; a scaled-down version of a nipa hut, a 
Filipino hut made of palm trees, and an exhibition of magnets. "Granny's 
Attic," a collection of old photographs and mementos, lines the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of Saturday's ribbon-cutting, organizers hope to have completed a 
makeup table in the costume area and "Colors," an exhibition that teaches the 
principles of blending colors by allowing children to overlay differently 
colored glass squares. 
</P>
<P>
For crafts projects, they plan to have such industrial castoffs as hose 
fittings, wood chips and Styrofoam packing material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stretch Their Imagination' 
</P>
<P>
"We want children to stretch their imagination," said James, who at 76 still 
has the verve of a favorite kindergarten teacher. "We want them to use their 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the maritime museum's Crane hopes to stretch imaginations in a 
different direction. 
</P>
<P>
The institution will focus on the rich and largely overlooked history of the 
coastal region from Point Mugu to Point Conception, said Crane, 73, a retired 
computer executive who has been a sailboat enthusiast since his teens. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in mid-1990, rotating exhibitions of ship models, ship relics and 
nautical art will draw attention to the glory days of sailing -- the period 
before the introduction of steam engines in the 1800s, he said. The museum's 
waterfront location will also allow it to occasionally exhibit an entire 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The coast was visited by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, Sir Frances Drake and 
possibly 12th-Century Chinese explorers, he said. There also is evidence that 
the first ship built on the California coast was assembled by missionaries near 
what is Goleta near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maritime History Ignored 
</P>
<P>
For all the color, however, much of Ventura County's early maritime history has 
gone largely ignored, Crane said. His group, which is dedicated solely to 
founding the museum, has worked since 1986 to change that. Officials at other 
museums applaud the efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to preserve this history," said Frances Johnson Pietro, curator 
of exhibits at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. "Our museum has 
really not addressed the maritime involvement in Ventura. We only touch upon 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the maritime museum are reluctant to discuss their funding needs, 
pending a study by a consultant. But they are expected to raise money for the 
nonprofit museum through individual and corporate donations and other 
fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, directors are preparing to assemble a collection. 
</P>
<P>
They have traveled to maritime museums on the East Coast and in Europe, and 
negotiated with owners of art collections. They have consulted with maritime 
historians and curators of important maritime collections. 
</P>
<P>
And in a business park on Oxnard's eastern end, master ship modeler Harry 
Arrington unpacks crate after crate of tub-sized replicas of the Mayflower, the 
USS Constitution and the HMS Bounty. He will later advise directors whether to 
acquire any of the models, which have been sent by dealers selling them for as 
much as $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of details to be put together," Crane said. "It's a very 
complex project."
