CATALINA'S FLOATING LIFELINE; 
</P>
<P>
ALMOST EVERYTHING ISLANDERS EAT, BUILD OR SELL COMES FROM THE MAINLAND ON 
BARGES

It's a thought that may not cross the mind of the average tourist to Santa 
Catalina Island this weekend, but almost everything he buys or eats was sent 
over from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
And more than likely, that souvenir T-shirt or those fresh salad vegetables 
made the 22-mile crossing to the island by barge. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's most vital links to the mainland are based at Berth 184 in Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Islander and Islander II, the two 128-foot-long barges transport food, 
fuel, clothing, cars, construction materials and just about everything else it 
takes to live in Avalon or Two Harbors, the even more isolated community on the 
other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15,000 Visitors a Day 
</P>
<P>
Their task is awesome: to supply the necessities of life to Catalina's more 
than 3,000 year-round residents and as many as 15,000 visitors a day during the 
peak summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
Making more than 200 round trips annually from their Wilmington berth to their 
island landing near Pebbly Beach Road, about a mile east of Avalon, the 
flat-bottomed boats are Catalina's umbilical tie to "overtown." 
</P>
<P>
The barges, pulled by tugboats across the channel, make round-trip crossings at 
least five times a week in summer and three times a week in winter, depending 
on the tides and the whims of the weather, said Jim Radcliffe, vice president 
of Catalina Freight Lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Necessity' 
</P>
<P>
"The barge is definitely the one and only major necessity on the island," said 
Sally Freeman. She and her husband own a wholesale food supply company as well 
as Fred and Sally's, one of Avalon's two supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's remoteness is one of its greatest attractions, but it also means 
that residents and merchants must rely heavily on sea transport, particularly 
for items like fresh fruit, vegetables and other perishables. Mail and some 
small packages are delivered by air. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Santa Catalina Island Co. announced a sweeping, 15-year 
development plan that will overhaul much of Avalon. The plan includes the 
construction of new hotels, a new fire station and, eventually, a new City Hall 
and civic complex. Once development begins, the barges' importance to the 
island's existence will increase, since developers rely on them to transport 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the challenges of building over here is our geographic isolation, and 
the need to plan out exactly how the construction process is going to work, 
because it's totally different from the mainland," said Ron Doutt, vice 
president of the Santa Catalina Island Co. "You can figure anything built on 
Catalina is going to cost at least 50% more (than on the mainland)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priority Items 
</P>
<P>
The logistics include coordinating the arrival of the right kinds of 
construction workers with the right goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you forget an order of 4-by-4s or you forget some bolt, you can't go down 
and just pick up what you've forgotten," Doutt said. "You've got to wait for 
the next barge, and hope that is a priority item and will get on." 
</P>
<P>
Whether a last-minute order makes it onto the barge depends on the item -- food 
and fuel take priority -- its size, and whether the barge is full, said Leo 
Hernandez, who manages freight company operations in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The barge is a "roll-on, roll-off" operation, meaning that already loaded truck 
trailers are driven over a ramp directly onto the barge, where the trailers are 
disconnected from the truck and parked for the cross-channel ride to Avalon. 
There, the trailers are either unloaded at the company's warehouse or 
reconnected to a truck and hauled to their island destination. 
</P>
<P>
"In those trailers, we put all of the island's building products, all of the 
food services, all of the clothing -- everything," said Ed Fine, manager of 
barge operations at Pebbly Beach Road in Avalon. "Everything that it takes for 
a community to live." 
</P>
<P>
The barge also carries nearly 3 million gallons of fuel per year, including 
diesel fuel to operate Southern California Edison's power plant on the island, 
Radcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operated Since 1958 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Freight Lines, which employs about 18 people in Avalon and Wilmington 
during the peak summer season, has operated the barges since 1958, Radcliffe 
said. Before that, the Santa Catalina Island Co. transported goods by steamer. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Freight, whose rates and operation are regulated by the state Public 
Utilities Commission, charges $6.77 per 100 pounds of freight, with higher 
rates for furniture, vehicles and other bulky items. The barges' sheer weight 
-- 326 tons unloaded -- makes crossing possible in all but the most stormy 
seas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say barge service is reliable -- except when nature does not 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
During particularly bad weather, such as a series of storms during January, 
1988, the barges may be out of commission for two or three days, freight 
company officials said. Or, if the tide is not high enough, tug operators are 
unable to bring a barge close enough to shore to extend the loading ramp. 
</P>
<P>
At such times, island residents and merchants either cope with shortages or 
find ways around them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems getting goods once in a while when the weather is scuzzy or 
the tides aren't right," Freeman said. "We've had occasions where a barge can't 
come over for three days, and that's very hard. The store panics when they see 
the weather is getting a little scuzzy because the local people start hoarding 
milk and bread." 
</P>
<P>
If their store runs out of such perishable items, Freeman said, her husband 
flies the couple's plane to the mainland to pick up more. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents who can't get what they need at Avalon's stores find their own 
alternative sources. 
</P>
<P>
Like John W. R. Windle, whose wife, Jean, ran out of a preserving solution when 
she was canning fresh peaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my kids to send it over for me," Windle said.
