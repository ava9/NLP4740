  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The United Nations 
informed Honduras that ships bearing the Honduran flag are 
violating the embargo against Haiti, an official Honduran 
Government source confirmed today, Saturday. 
  The Honduran Foreign Ministry received a note from this 
international organization regarding the presence of at least 
five Honduran-flagged ships off the Haitian coasts that are 
supplying that country with fuel and other materials. 
  Merchant Marine Superintendent Reynaldo Flores said the 
ships 
were identified as "Erma," "Sea Wind II," "Aida Luz," "Lady 
Sandra III," and "Rooster." 
  Flores said "we cannot impede" the presence of ships 
registered under the Honduran flag because they are flagged for 
legal activities, and "we have no way of knowing if they commit 
illegal activities." 
  One of the ships, the "Rooster," had previously been 
detained 
for drug trafficking, the Honduran Merchant Marine Office 
confirmed. 
  Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello of the Innovation and Unity Party 
warned that the United Nations could penalize Honduras for this 
event.
