A sportfishing boat and a tanker hauling jet fuel collided in the darkness just 
outside Los Angeles Harbor shortly before midnight Thursday, tossing the small 
ship like a toy and injuring seven people, none seriously. One passenger jumped 
overboard in fright. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 passengers and seven crew members of the 80-foot fishing boat Shogun 
were hurled to the deck when the bow smashed into the Sealift Antarctic, a 
564-foot tanker on its way to San Francisco, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty barrels of jet fuel spilled into the sea. Some cleanup effort was made, 
but officials said the fuel evaporated rapidly and posed little threat to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators were investigating the collision, which occurred in 
calm, one-foot seas with six miles of visibility, Chief Petty Officer Mark 
Kennedy said. Both vessels were fully lighted and no others were nearby, 
Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
Drug tests were scheduled to be given to those at the helm and in command, 
investigators said, but results were not expected for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Terry Slechta was unreeling his line on the stern of the sportfishing 
boat and deckhand Vince Jenkins was 10 minutes from going to bed when they 
looked up and saw the huge tanker. It was as though a four-story building had 
risen up from the waters. 
</P>
<P>
"A big building, that's what it looked like. Just like that thing they brought 
King Kong home in," Slechta said later. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins bolted for the front of the boat, which was two miles outside the 
harbor's breakwater. The next thing he heard was "one big thud" as the Shogun 
plowed into the port side of the tanker six times its size. 
</P>
<P>
Sausages and lentil soup splattered over the galley. Passengers sleeping below 
were heaved from their bunks as the bow of the boat crunched into the tanker. 
Nearly 2,000 gallons of jet fuel spit from the tanker through a hole no bigger 
than a half-dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had been hit in the midship, we would have all been dead," Shogun 
passenger and part-time crew member Gary Hull said, still shaking. "We were 
such a little vessel at the mercy of such a big ship." 
</P>
<P>
When the sun rose Friday, the Shogun was sitting at Ports O'Call Village in San 
Pedro, its bow badly damaged. Its captain, 25-year-old Timothy Filson, was 
hospitalized with head injuries, but his condition was listed as good. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was anchored inside the breakwater with the hole in its midsection, 
a five-inch crack and a dented hull. None of its estimated 24 crew members was 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, a civilian ship chartered by the Navy and operated by Coast 
Guard-licensed merchant mariners, had loaded its cargo in the Port of Long 
Beach. It was heading toward San Francisco with 7.8 million gallons of jet 
fuel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said it was difficult to say whether the fishing boat would have 
shown up on the tanker's radar because of its size and low profile. "That's one 
thing the Coast Guard will be looking at -- should they have seen it, or could 
they have seen it," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials identified the tanker's skipper only as Capt. Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun, a 6-month-old charter sportfishing boat based in Ports O'Call, was 
bound for Catalina to catch squid for bait and then sail on to San Clemente for 
sea bass fishing. There were 35 passengers, four deck hands, two licensed 
skippers and one cook aboard, deckhand Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard was investigating whether radar aboard the vessel was operating 
at the time of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Shogun's passengers, including one woman and a boy celebrating his 
10th birthday, were asleep below when the vessels crossed paths about two miles 
south of Angel's Gate, a main entrance to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The few people who were on deck called out when they saw the ship, but it was 
too late, witnesses said. The boat began to pitch, and one frightened man 
leaped overboard, perilously close to the Shogun's propellers. Crewmen tossed 
plastic bottles, empty jugs, trash, anything they could find to mark his 
position in the darkness, Slechta said, then returned to pick him up when the 
vessels unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to keep yelling, 'Where are you?' It was so dark we couldn't see 
anything. He would yell back, 'I'm over here!' Finally we got to him and it 
took five of us to get him out of the water," Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Shogun passengers were taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital. Mark 
Capanni, 42; Ishihara Takaji, 43, and Andrew Lynch, 27, were released after 
treatment for cuts, bruises and a possible broken arm, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only the skipper was admitted. He declined to be interviewed Friday.
