<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee has tentatively approved a new lease with 
Terminal Island's largest commercial shipyard, but not without some harsh words 
for the Harbor Department's handling of the company and the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 10-year lease with Southwest Marine Inc. drew criticism Tuesday 
from the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee because the 
agreement has been in negotiations since 1986 and falls short of the 20-year 
lease sought by the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the committee, said she 
was particularly sensitive to Southwest Marine's position, because it is the 
last large shipyard in Los Angeles Harbor. "They're so vital to the community. 
If we lose that shipyard, it's almost over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The lease with Southwest Marine to operate at berths 240Z-241 was scheduled for 
action in early 1986, according to a report to the committee. But the 
negotiations dragged. During the talks, Southwest Marine has been paying rent 
on a month-to-month basis for use of the 18-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the port's staff agreed to the shipyard's request for a 20-year 
lease and the port commission said it would consider such a lease if Southwest 
Marine made significant capital improvements to the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But the port's staff later recommended a 10-year lease, arguing that a new dry 
dock purchased by Southwest Marine, at a reported cost of $24 million, was a 
moveable asset that could be taken away if the company relocated its shipyard. 
They also recommended that the rent be renegotiated after five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the lease, which is retroactive to 1986, the shipyard would 
pay $74,000 a month during the first five years. The rate for the last five 
years would be set next year. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the council committee, Mark Richter, the port's assistant 
property manager, acknowledged that negotiating the lease had taken more time 
than port officials had expected. He also said the proposed agreement offered 
the shipyard less than it wanted. "They're not delighted, but they're certainly 
satisfied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council committee members were not. "So the lease is only good for six 
years?" a surprised Council President John Ferraro asked port officials. 
</P>
<P>
Added Flores: "I think it's ridiculous that you have to renegotiate for the 
other five years" on the proposed lease. 
</P>
<P>
Although it tentatively approved the lease, the committee, at Flores' urging, 
did not schedule the agreement for final approval before the full council. That 
action would be taken, she said, only after the committee hears from the 
shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Shipyard officials declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine, which employs 870 workers, opened its Terminal Island 
facility in 1981, taking over the site vacated by Bethlehem shipyards.
