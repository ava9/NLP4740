  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The northern sea routes 
between South Korea and China as well as South Korea and Russia 
will be opened to all shipping companies next year, the Maritime 
and Port Administration (MAPA) said on Tuesday. At present, the 
route between Korea and Russia is open only to Far Eastern 
Shipping Corp. (FESCO) of Russia and Hyundai Merchant Marine 
Corp. of Korea. FESCO operates one ship on the route and 
Hyundai runs two vessels. The route between Korea and China is 
open only to joint-venture shipping companies between the two 
countries. 
  MAPA has barred other shipping companies from using the 
routes because Russian and Chinese shipping companies collect 
far lower charges than Korean lines. With the decision, 
shipping companies from any country that meet certain 
qualifications will be permitted to operate between Korea and 
China and between Korea and Russia next year. They will also be 
allowed to transport cargo or containers from Russia or China to 
the United States or Europe via Korea. 
  Charges are expected to drop considerably as many shipping 
companies start plying the routes, and transportation of cargo 
will become easier. The move is aimed at activating sea 
transportation in Northeast Asia, a MAPA official said.
