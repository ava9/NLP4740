Expiration of existing merchant mariner's documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The expiration year of a merchant mariner's document issued without an expiration date is calculated by adding 5-year
increments to the issuance date of the document, up to the first applicable year falling between 1995 and 1999, inclusive.
The day and month of expiration are the same as that of issuance. Table 12.02&hyph;29 is provided as an aid for calculating
the expiration date of a document issued without an expiration date. A merchant mariner's document is not valid for
use after the expiration date calculated under this section, but may be renewed in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;12.02&hyph;27.
