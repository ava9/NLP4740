in Britain's cities - New horizons on old waste sites

Marina developments. Two boring words that strike pleasure into the heart of
any UK property developer.
In truth, these areas are often relics of the Industrial Revolution - old
ports well suited to conversion. They can give new life to their cities,
providing space and visual pleasure. And, usually, they are next to city
centres - often because they were the reason the city was founded.
Now that the Department of the Environment is tilting against edge-of-town
greenfield sites for development, these brownfield/grey-water sites are an
alternative to regenerate Britain's great cities and clean up industrial
wasteland.
In its heyday, around 1913, Cardiff, the Welsh capital, supplied coal from
the south Wales valleys for the world's steamships. But this rich commerce
had to take into account the extraordinary tides in the Bristol Channel.
For 14 hours a day Cardiff Bay is mudflats. Boats laden with coal could
leave only at high tide. The Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square (the
pre-first world war equivalent of OPEC headquarters) had clocks flanking the
entrance to the trading floor to indicate tidal times.
Today the tides, which can rise and fall more than 30 feet, are the reason
for the largest scheme in the regeneration of waterfront Cardiff  - the
building of a barrage across the bay to pen in a 500-acre freshwater lake
with a stable water level that will be a haven for watersport enthusiasts.
After many delays, work has started and the barrage should be completed in
1998.
This huge space of water will lie between Penarth on the west and the inner
harbour of Cardiff to the east, which is the centre of the Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation's schemes for new housing, jobs, facilities and
shops around the old coal port. (The working port is the adjacent Queen
Alexandra Dock, which dates to Cardiff's prosperous years.)
The port at Penarth is already the Portway Village marina and is set, like
town squares, around two dock basins under the dominating presence of the
old customs house on the cliff above. Camper and Nicholsons runs the marina,
a development by Crest Nicholson (its joint company with Crest), which has
about 230 boats permanently. Two housing units are still available, and some
are for resale. With visiting boats, 18 per cent up on last year, it always
has something to watch. 'I'd like the activity - and the barbecue parties
here,' says Pat Lewis, who moved from the Midlands to be housing strategy
manager for CBDC.
The tides make for exciting trips on a Bristol Channel cruising route that
stretches from Padstow, in Cornwall, to Gloucester, says marina manager
Charles Bush. Once it has a stable water level, Cardiff Bay will become a
major venue for boating, he says.
In Cardiff, access to the port has been improved. The new peripheral
distributor road, which links Cardiff Bay with the M4, has been put in a
tunnel and a boulevard, to be called Bute Avenue, will lead from the city
centre to the waterfront. A new opera house for the Welsh National Opera,
and a 'virtual reality' cinema will join the Welsh Industrial and Maritime
Museum, Techniquest (a hands-on science museum) and a Harry Ramsden's for
fish and chips.
Job opportunities are rising with several new offices - including NatWest's
resuscitation of its grandiose bank of 1916 in West Bute Street, another
symbol of Cardiff's wealth. Nippon Electric Glass and Schott of Germany have
recently invested Pounds 200m in a new factory.
Cardiff is different from ports such as Manchester and Liverpool. Its
history as a coaling port means that it needed only large flat areas to dump
its product. There are no warehouses to turn into flats, except for the
isolated conversion by Lovell, a few years ago, of a Spillers' flour
warehouse. Instead, it gives a rare chance to use lots of space to build a
high-quality townscape from scratch, which is CBDC's aim. People may enjoy
living and working around the inner harbour - and praying; they will have an
Anglo-Catholic church, a Greek Orthodox church and a mosque within 100 yards
of each other.
The new housing schemes have a target of 6,000 units, with 1,700 built or
being built. Barratt, Beaser, Tarmac, Westbury and Windsor Quay are the
developers for a variety of housing, of which 25 per cent will be social.
The whole is an exciting plan to reunite a city with its roots in the water.
Swansea's wealth was in metalworking, but only two chimney stacks are left
of the 300 that were there at the turn of the century. Two years ago it
opened its barrage at the mouth of the river Tawe, creating a lake with
excellent moorings and eliminating the mudflats problem. A licence for the
lock costs Pounds 80 a year.
Inside the barrage is the water entrance to the marina at the south dock. It
closed in 1969, but the decision in the 1970s to make a maritime quarter
created the country's first marina on old industrial land.
The scheme finished in the mid-1980s - although one housing site and two
leisure sites await development. Grosvenor Waterside, the development arm of
ABP, has plans for the less used part of the eastern commercial docks, using
public and private money and providing everything from sheltered housing to
Pounds 200,000 homes.
Westrec of the US, a Marina management company, took Swansea marina on as
its first in Europe, and aims to raise the 66 per cent occupancy of berths
by providing better facilities and, probably, a club for owners (most of
whom live within 25 miles of Swansea).
In London the Chelsea Harbour development by P &amp; O sits on an old coal dock
and goods yard. Residents value its security and quiet, the harbour club and
restaurants, a nearby supermarket, and stunning views.
(For the best view of it take a helicopter from the Battersea heliport
across the river.) A car is necessary since it is a long walk to the London
Underground.
The marina has 55 berths (at Pounds 160 a year per metre) and can be left or
entered 90 minutes either side of high tide. Yachts may repair to the
Harbour's five-star Conrad hotel.
The 310 units in the eight blocks are all sold, bar a house or flat or two.
But about 10 per cent are for resale at any time, at prices from Pounds
325,000 to Pounds 1.3m.
Rentals are also available. Harbour Estates is the agent on the spot. Beaney
Pearce, Parkway, and Strutt &amp; Parker also offer flats for sale.
In Edinburgh the decision to move the Scottish Office with 1,600 staff to
the port of Leith has given an impetus to plans there. Known for its
restaurants and wine bar, Leith now boasts an hotel converted from an 1883
sailors' home. (a joint project by Forth Ports and Ken Mculloch of One
Devonshire Gardens hotel in Glasgow). Forth Ports has shops, offices and
housing in train.
