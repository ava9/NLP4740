BIDS for the Queen Mary, the 81,237-ton former flagship of the Cunard
shipping line moored as a tourist attraction at Long Beach, California,
close on Monday.
The ship's owner, the City of Long Beach, put her up for sale after the Walt
Disney entertainment group decided not to renew its lease on the site near
Los Angeles. Disney is thought to have lost Dollars 5m a year since it
leased the vessel in 1988 as a floating hotel and museum.
Long Beach Harbour Commission, which is handling the sale, expects most
potential buyers to delay bids until close to Monday afternoon's deadline -
4.30pm Pacific Standard Time.
Officials expect up to 50 firm proposals. If they fail to find a buyer the
Queen Mary's last voyage could be to the scrap-yard.
The potential schemes include a Japanese plan to convert the vessel into an
office block and several casino projects, although this would require a
change in California gambling laws.
One of the most ambitious plans is to return the Queen Mary to Southampton,
her home port, from where she sailed on her last journey to Long Beach on
October 31 1967.
Long Beach has set stringent terms for the sale. Each bid must be
accompanied by a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 51,600) deposit, with audited
financial statements, marketing strategies and a date for removal. The
successful purchaser, who will be named in mid-September, is also required
to make a Dollars 5m down-payment.
Conservation groups in Liverpool and Glasgow have dropped out of the
bidding. Merseyside Development Corporation said Liverpool could not raise
the Dollars 100,000 deposit. The Clyde Port Authority said the river where
she was built was too silted to make the project worthwhile.
The business-backed Queen Mary Project UK, based in Southampton, hopes to
refurbish the huge ship - eight times the size of HMS Belfast, moored on the
Thames in London - as a business park, hotel and casino.
Mr David Abraham, chairman of the project and leader of the Conservative
group on Southampton City Council, said: 'We've come across nothing yet to
say it's impossible to bring her back.'
Rotterdam-based Smitwis Towage has estimated that returning the vessel to
the UK would take about 200 days - as long as the ship was seaworthy. She is
too big for the Panama Canal, so would have to be towed round Cape Horn. In
her prime the vessel crossed the Atlantic in four days.
British maritime experts say the Southampton project would be costly and
unlikely to make money. Ms Janet Hales, secretary of the Maritime Trust,
said: 'The maintenance costs of such a huge vessel would be tremendous.
'If Disney cannot operate it successfully the chances of doing so in the UK
are very remote.'
Rados International, a US naval engineering company, has estimated total
repair costs at Dollars 27m, including Dollars 2m to replace watertight
bulkheads.
The costs, which persuaded Disney to terminate its lease, could force Long
Beach to scrap the ship if it fails to find a buyer with considerable
financial muscle. Shipping enthusiasts fear that the authorities may have to
break up the liner or tow her into the Pacific, where she could be sunk.
