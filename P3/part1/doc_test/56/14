Vice Adm. Gordon McLintock, who headed the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy on New 
York's Long Island for 22 years, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
McLintock died Monday of bone cancer at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a British seagoing family, McLintock first went to sea when he was 3 
aboard a ship on which his father served as an officer. One of his grandfathers 
was head of a major shipyard and the other owned a Mediterranean fleet of 
sailing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
From 1918 to 1920, McLintock was a cadet in the British merchant navy. Moving 
his home base to New York when his family moved there in 1920, the young sailor 
became quartermaster on the Lewis Luckenbach, at the time the world's largest 
cargo vessel. 
</P>
<P>
When he was only 24, McLintock became master of a Pan American Petroleum &amp; 
Transport Co. tanker, the youngest merchant mariner in command of an 
ocean-going vessel. 
</P>
<P>
He became a naturalized American citizen in 1921, and from 1930 on spent his 
career in federal service. He first worked as a Department of Commerce 
steamship inspector and during World War II was chief inspection officer for 
the War Shipping Administration and the U.S. Maritime Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, five years after the Merchant Marine Academy was created at King's 
Point on Long Island, he became its fourth superintendent. During his 22-year 
tenure, the academy became an accredited four-year institution offering college 
degrees to the officers it trained for the U.S. merchant marine. 
</P>
<P>
President of the American Institute of Navigation for two years, McLintock 
represented the United States at several international conferences. He was 
promoted to vice admiral on his retirement from the academy in 1970, and later 
served on a congressional panel to evaluate U.S. service academies. 
</P>
<P>
McLintock is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Thoms Bristow.
