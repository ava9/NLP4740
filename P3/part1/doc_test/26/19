</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cold, dreary Sunday, the leader of the Soviet Union flew to the Great 
Plains for the sort of warm, hearty welcome that he no longer gets at home. 
</P>
<P>
Greeted by the orchestral music of Shostakovich at the airport, the sound of 
ringing bells at the governor's mansion and chants of "Gorby! Gorby!" at nearly 
all points in between, Mikhail S. Gorbachev proved that while he may be a bust 
in St. Petersburg, he's still boffo in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to have you here, and the whole state is excited," Gov. Rudy 
Perpich told Gorbachev as he stepped down the stairs from his airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Gorbachev's customized Ilyushin jet with the hammer and sickle flag 
painted high on its tail had left Washington's Andrews Air Force Base, "Gorby 
fever" had seized the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Moscow or Leningrad -- which was known as St. Petersburg in the 
pre-revolutionary days when it served as the czarist capital -- Gorbachev's 
political stock has been dropping in tandem with the production figures for the 
Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
But it was different here. "You're a great man! You're a great man!" two young 
college students shouted to Gorbachev as he did one of his by-now signature 
impromptu walks outside his motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev left Minnesotans with only one disappointment. At his request, he 
originally had been scheduled to make a visit to a true bit of Midwestern 
Americana: a tour of the Brand family dairy farm 20 miles south of St. Paul. 
But the Soviet leader fell so far behind on his schedule that he had to cancel 
the visit. 
</P>
<P>
But this could not rob the day of its demonstration of unabashed enthusiasm for 
Gorbachev. Even the dissenters -- Baltic nationalists, Eritrean separatists, 
Vietnamese patriots -- seemed good-natured in their dissent. 
</P>
<P>
As he left a luncheon at the governor's mansion, Gorbachev, wearing a black 
raincoat and a gray fedora to guard him from the drizzle and temperatures 
hovering below 50, stopped to talk to an 11-year-old boy, Brandon Peterson. 
Speaking through a translator, he asked, "What grade are you in?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sixth," the boy replied. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as old as my granddaughter," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He then stepped into his long black Zil limousine and proceeded on a motorcade 
through the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis. The Soviet leader twice 
stopped the motorcade so he could clamber out of the Zil and shake hands with 
eager, cheering Minnesotans. 
</P>
<P>
At one stop, as Gorbachev held his hands out to a throng of approximately 80 
onlookers, a U.S. official murmured: "He ought to run for office here." 
</P>
<P>
Two admirers handed Raisa Gorbachev a sign that featured a heart and the 
message: "We love Mikhail (and) Raisa Gorbachev." The Soviet first lady waved 
the sign at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesotans offered other encouraging words on the placards they held along the 
motorcade route: "Go Glasnost," "President Gorbachev, Keep Hope Alive" and 
"We're With You, Gorby." One that may have defied translation was the sign 
lauding "Mr. Gorbachev: A Cool Dude." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev found the largest crowd, several thousand Minnesotans, waiting along 
the driveway to the state Capitol in St. Paul. A large minority were 
Baltic-American nationalists waving Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian flags. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting, the Baltic-Americans tried to inspire the crowd with a chant, 
"Negotiations. No occupations." 
</P>
<P>
But a group of young university students drowned out the chant with a 
well-known chant from a beer commercial, "Tastes great. Less filling." Even the 
Baltic-Americans laughed. 
</P>
<P>
One Minnesotan in the crowd told his wife: "He's an amazing charmer. Not 
folksy, but you respect him. He's quite a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, residents planned their day around the Gorbachev visit. 
Road crews rose early Sunday morning, braving a chill and driving rain to line 
15 miles of Interstate 35 from the airport through downtown with shining new 
bright orange plastic highway cones to mark off Gorbachev's motorcade route. 
</P>
<P>
Portable highway signs that normally flash messages like "Traffic Delay" and 
"Construction Next 10 Miles" were reprogrammed to display "Welcome President 
Gorbachev" in English and Russian. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious purpose of the Soviet leader's visit here, as well as his next stop 
in San Francisco, where Gorbachev was to arrive about 10:30 p.m. PDT, was a 
combination of trade and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for him to get out and see the United States," said 
Jack F. Matlock, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow. He noted that during 
Gorbachev's previous two summit trips to the United States, the Soviet leader 
saw only Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The visit also gave Gorbachev an opportunity to meet with Midwestern business 
leaders, from both agribusiness and high technology, in an afternoon conference 
in Minneapolis. Calling for investment, Gorbachev assured his listeners: "You 
will not lose your money in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev underscored that point at his final stop here, a visit to the Control 
Data Corp. plant, where he tried out a computer terminal. Control Data has been 
exporting mainframe computers to the Soviets since 1968. It was one of the 
first U.S. firms to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the visit to the Brand farm did not surprise American 
officials. For days, they had been saying that his schedule was too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't visit a man's farm in a few minutes. A farmer wants to show you his 
pigs, his chickens and so forth, and rightfully so," said U.S. Assistant Chief 
of Protocol William F. Black. 
</P>
<P>
As a consolation, officials announced that Richard and Cecilia Brand, who own 
the farm, would be at the airport to shake hands with Gorbachev before he left 
town for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Brands and about two dozen of their relatives showed up at the airport to 
say goodby to the Gorbachavs. As Richard and Cecilia chatted with the 
Gorbachevs, some of the relatives kept taking photos of the scene at the side 
of the departing plane. A few minutes later, Brand told a reporter, "I can't 
begin to tell you how disappointed I am." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that the trip had another special dividend for Gorbachev 
beyond trade and tourism: It gave a politician who has been through a rough 
period a chance to renew himself in the unaccustomed warmth of friendly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, before Gorbachev arrived, security was tight, with U.S. Marine 
guards sternly warning reporters against venturing outside the designated press 
area. "If you stray, you will be shot. They will take you out," a security 
agent, who declined to identify himself, announced at one point. 
</P>
<P>
But such excessive precautions relaxed within minutes of Gorbachev's arrival, 
as he stopped his 42-car motorcade and took a 10- to 15-minute stroll down a 
street in downtown Minneapolis before walking up a red-carpeted path into the 
governor's mansion complex. 
</P>
<P>
Arm-in-arm with his wife, Raisa, Gorbachev looked like an American political 
candidate in his blue pinstripe suit and red tie. The Soviet leader left aside 
an overcoat as he crossed repeatedly from one side of the street to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd included a group of about 40 demonstrators who were protesting Soviet 
policy in Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. Some who identified themselves as 
Minnesota Muslims for Peace and Justice in the World, passed out green leaflets 
charging: "Soviet genocide against Muslims continues." 
</P>
<P>
At the airport in Minneapolis, Gorbachev was met by a series of Minnesota 
leaders. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale approached the U.S. 
ambassador, Matlock, and quietly asked him what to make of the recent election 
of Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic. "They (Gorbachev and 
Yeltsin) are going to have to work together," Matlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Raisa Gorbachev joined her husband for most of the day's activities, 
she left the conference with business leaders to follow a brief program of her 
own at the end of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
En route to the south Minneapolis home of what had been billed as a typical 
American family, the Soviet first lady decided to stop at two typical American 
stores -- Pepito's Mexican delicatessen and the Snyder drug store. At the drug 
store, the Soviet leader's wife questioned Carey Kilbo, the merchandise 
manager, about pay, working conditions and the ingredients in some of the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
She asked, for example, why one nail polish cost more than another. Kilbo 
explained that the expensive nail polish stays on longer. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Jim Mann and Michael Ross contributed to this story.
