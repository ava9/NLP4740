ICAHN PICKS PANEL TO KEEP AN EYE ON USX BOARD; 
</P>

<P>
Investor Carl C. Icahn unveiled a "shareholder enhancement committee" for USX 
Corp. on Wednesday and said its five members would seek election to the board 
next year unless the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate restructures itself along 
lines he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who owns 13.3% of the steel and energy firm once known as U.S. Steel 
Corp., portrayed the committee as a "liaison" between USX and shareholders. It 
is headed up by well-known shareholder-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to USX Chairman Charles Corry spelling out plans for the committee, 
Icahn -- himself the chairman of Trans World Airlines, which he took over in 
1985 -- said the group wouldn't seek board seats if USX enacts "a meaningful 
restructuring plan and corporate governance changes." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring refers to Icahn's longstanding effort to get USX to spin off 
its steel division, which he says has depressed the price of USX stock. About 
70% of USX sales and 80% of profits this year have come from its Texas Oil 
&amp; Gas Co. and Marathon Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn lost a proxy fight on the issue last May, when shareholders defeated a 
proposal requiring the board to split the steel and energy divisions into two 
corporations to be owned by existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
However, USX has since taken steps toward selling at least part of its steel 
operations. Last month, its board approved the transfer of USX's steel division 
to a wholly owned subsidiary in what is viewed as a precursor to the sale of 
those assets, either to the public or various steel companies that have shown 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
As to Icahn's latest thrust, USX said it "will review (his) demands in due 
course." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Corry, Icahn applauded his "apparent change of heart" and 
urged that any proceeds from the sale of steel assets go directly to 
shareholders as a special dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Just how the special shareholder committee fits into Icahn's strategy wasn't 
immediately clear. But one of its directors, Harvard University Prof. John 
Pound, said it "absolutely isn't" a prelude to a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the hostile takeover efforts of the 1980s, it is "a less 
confrontational mechanism" for making publicly held corporations more 
accountable to shareholders, said Pound, who heads a corporate voting research 
project at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
Pound and Stanford University law professor Ronald Gilson are co-chairmen of 
the group, which also includes Darius Gaskins, former Burlington Northern 
Railroad chief executive who now is a Harvard economist; Paul Quirk, head of 
the Massachusetts state pension fund board, and Katherine Schipper, professor 
at the University of Chicago business school. 
</P>
<P>
According to Icahn's letter, they will consult with shareholders on various 
issues, including the steel spinoff. Icahn is paying the members $15,000 each 
and giving them 300 shares of USX stock, which was worth $32.125 a share at the 
close of trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Pound and Gilson 
will get an extra $7,500 as co-chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said he was paying them in advance "to ensure the independence" of their 
findings. However, he said they all agree with him that "U.S. corporations in 
general have lost their competitive edge in world markets because managements 
are not held truly accountable to shareholders, the real owners of our public 
corporations."
