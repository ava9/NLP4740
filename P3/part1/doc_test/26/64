UCLA PLAN CLOUDS FUTURE OF 107-YEAR-OLD LAB SCHOOL 
</P>

In post-World War II Los Angeles, with a Japanese-American mother and a white 
father, Heidi Brandt grew up with prejudice and cultural conflict. Deed 
restrictions kept her family from living north of Santa Monica Boulevard. There 
were the emotional scars of her mother's internment and constant reminders that 
the girl was "not accepted in either community." 
</P>
<P>
All that faded when Brandt stepped onto the UCLA campus grounds of the Corinne 
A. Seeds University Elementary School. With its emphasis on respecting 
individual differences, the experimental research school for the Graduate 
School of Education "made me feel safe and cherished," Brandt recalled. "I 
truly believe I had the perfect education . . . in a tremendously rich, 
positive environment." 
</P>
<P>
Today Brandt, who sends her 8-year-old daughter to Seeds, belongs to a group of 
parents, alumni and school officials who are fighting UCLA over a plan that 
they say will destroy California's only remaining "laboratory" school. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly pressed for space, UCLA officials are considering giving the 
internationally renowned facility, now spread over nine idyllic acres, to the 
Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, where it would be staffed and run 
by the university under a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA proposal comes at a time when many around the country -- from 
President Bush and corporate leaders to parents and educators -- are trying to 
find ways to get better results from America's schools. The debate over the 
107-year-old school's future raises the issue of whether the best way to train 
teachers and conduct educational research is in the rarefied atmosphere of a 
university campus, or in the "real world" of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Some take the Santa Monica proposal as a signal that UCLA cares more about 
other disciplines than it does about improving the education of the nation's 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were connected with the medical school or law school instead of the 
school of education, they would not dream of moving it off campus," said UC 
Berkeley education professor James W. Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, do not see the need for lab schools. Stanford University, for 
example, works closely with Bay Area schools to come up with ways to improve 
education. "The university is not the fount of all knowledge," said Beverly 
Carter, director of the Stanford/Schools Collaborative. "What we're doing is 
being fashioned with a lot more input from the teachers and administrators in 
the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
Lab schools, founded at the turn of the century by followers of philosopher 
John Dewey, flourished for years -- conducting research, training teachers and 
experimenting with new teaching techniques and curricula. 
</P>
<P>
Most were gone by the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't doing their job, and the benefit (of having a lab school) was not 
outweighing the financial burden," said George Barker, an associate professor 
of elementary education at Cal State Northridge and a former member of the 
Seeds faculty. Unlike the Seeds school, most "stopped taking on roles of 
innovation and research and became country clubs for professors' children," 
Barker added. 
</P>
<P>
Now lab schools are enjoying a resurgence. Across the country, there are about 
100 institutions that consider themselves laboratory schools, according to Mina 
Bayne, professor of education at the University of Wyoming and president-elect 
of the National Assn. of Laboratory Schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing that linkage with the university is very important, in part 
because it protects us from having to please school boards and parents," said 
Wendall McConnaha, principal of the University High School, associated with the 
University of Chicago and considered the granddaddy of laboratory schools. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from its beginning, UCLA's Seeds school, which takes its name from a 
noted education reform pioneer, has enjoyed the freedom to experiment with 
teaching techniques and philosophies. Unfettered by state education 
requirements and sheltered from the political vagaries of a local school board, 
it attracts innovative teachers who have been designing programs copied widely. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a neat little school that has influence far beyond its 450 kids," said 
Adrianne Bank, associate director of the Seeds school. 
</P>
<P>
Students, chosen to reflect the racial and socioeconomic makeup of the U.S. 
school-age population, get state-of-the-art educations in exchange for becoming 
guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens here affects children everywhere," Brandt, a lawyer and president 
of the Family School Alliance -- Seeds' version of the PTA -- told a school 
gathering one evening. "As lab school parents you have given the gift of your 
child to children everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
After announcing plans more than a year ago to build a new graduate school of 
management on part of Seeds' tree-dotted grounds, university officials began 
talks with the Santa Monica district. The preliminary proposal calls for UCLA 
to build a campus on parkland in the ethnically and economically diverse Ocean 
Park section of the city. The university, which hopes to draw most of the new 
school's students from the surrounding neighborhood, would have authority to 
staff and run the school and conduct research programs. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the talks drew immediate anger and skepticism from Seeds parents and 
alumni, some of whom are veterans of other crises that have periodically dogged 
the sometimes-controversial school. The parents' group began pushing university 
officials to consider other options, especially leaving the school on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically speaking, it just couldn't be the same," said Seeds parent Kathy 
Seal, who lives near the site proposed for the move but would gladly give up 
convenience to keep the school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"A school like this has got to be free of all outside influences. UCLA has not 
been able to guarantee to us that the new school would not fall prey to the 
political pressures that are a fact of life in a public school system," Seal 
said, adding it infuriates her that the university is tampering with "a school 
that works." 
</P>
<P>
The school was founded in 1882 for teacher training, affiliated with the 
university in 1919 and moved onto campus in 1947. Its low-slung, wide-windowed 
buildings include several by architect Richard Neutra (three of which will be 
torn down for the management school building). 
</P>
<P>
Grounded in the methods of the progressive movement, the school disdains tests 
and traditional textbooks. Report cards are eschewed in favor of detailed 
evaluations and frequent parent conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The school's 4- through 12-year-old students are not grouped by traditional 
grade levels. Classes are team-taught by faculty members who are given generous 
blocks of time to write their own curriculum. University students and visitors 
are often on campus conducting studies, trying out new ideas or merely 
observing. For their young subjects there are concerts at Royce Hall, visits to 
laboratories and scores of other advantages that come with being part of a 
major university campus. 
</P>
<P>
The roughly $1 million the University of California pays to run the school is 
supplemented with tuition of $1,700 a year (although about one-third of the 
students are on full or partial scholarships). The school strives for a mix of 
ability levels, ethnicity and income levels, but there are not enough places 
for all applicants. Siblings of current students get preference, and the 
chancellor gets a number of slots to designate as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the children of movie stars, politicians and other prominent 
people can often be found on the school's roster. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose two daughters 
spent all their elementary school years at Seeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they both got a great background and education and a love for learning 
there," said Edelman, who wrote to Chancellor Charles E. Young because he fears 
Seeds would lose "a lot of its uniqueness and sensitivity" if it becomes part 
of a public school system. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis C. Solmon, dean of the Graduate School of Education, believes the 
"rarefied atmosphere" at the Seeds school may inhibit, rather than help, its 
research and demonstration function. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it is representative of the nation's (population distribution), it is 
not a public school, and it is not a community school," Solmon said. "It is in 
many ways atypical of the circumstances found in most public schools today, and 
therefore its student population is of limited interest to most of those doing 
research today." 
</P>
<P>
Solmon acknowledges that Seeds is indeed "a wonderful school . . . but that is 
not the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the business of running schools. This is a laboratory school; 
its purpose is to conduct research, develop educational policy . . . and it 
doesn't do a good job of that now." 
</P>
<P>
Solmon said he finds the Santa Monica move "an interesting possibility" -- if 
ways can be found to guarantee the school's autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
His faculty, however, was asked its opinion on six options, including a move to 
Santa Monica, and keeping Seeds on campus but adding research or other Graduate 
School of Education facilities to the site. A majority of faculty members chose 
the latter; the Santa Monica proposal came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Young will make the decision on the move, probably early next year. 
He has made it clear he believes the move to Santa Monica may be the best way 
of ensuring the school's future. 
</P>
<P>
Although he acknowledged Seeds facilities can be redesigned and even expanded 
-- for about $3 million to $4 million -- to allow it to share the site with the 
new management school, "the likelihood of its being there by the year 2000 is 
minimal," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I make a decision to move the school or not, one of my successors is 
going to be put in the position where he will find it no longer possible to 
maintain that much land on this land-short campus," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young added that the elementary school might "better serve its function by 
having an intimate relationship with a school system (that operates in) the 
real world rather than in an academic setting." The chancellor sent his 
children to Seeds, and three of his granddaughters are students there now, 
while his daughter is active in the parents' group that is trying to keep the 
school on campus. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that entering into such a relationship with a public school system 
would require the state's blessing, a willingness on the part of the Santa 
Monica school board to give up control over one of its schools for at least two 
decades and a contract that would ensure the laboratory school has the autonomy 
it needs to try new methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether all that is possible. I'd say the chances are probably 
about 50-50 now in either direction," 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has hired an attorney to help determine whether "to really take a shot at" 
moving the school to Santa Monica, Young said. It has also begun making plans 
to keep the school on campus and add at least research facilities if the public 
school plans don't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica district Supt. Eugene Tucker, whose three grown children are Seeds 
alumni, said his school board is excited about the "opportunities that would be 
available to our youngsters and teachers" under a partnership with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The district is waiting for UCLA's decision before holding formal hearings and 
a school board vote. "First the university needs to decide whether it is in its 
best interest to move the school, then we decide whether it is in our best 
interest to take it," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he sees "no significant issues" that could not be resolved and 
added he wants to work together with the present Seeds parents "to make it the 
best school we can." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents of Seeds students draw inspiration from the school's 
longtime pattern of beating adversity. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Brandt has been digging in the UCLA archives, trying to glean guidance 
for the present battle from records of past skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the school weathered criticism when its students sent 
materials to Japanese-American children interned in relocation camps. A few 
years later it beat back attempts to change its progressive program. And in 
1969 and 1970, when the state tried to eliminate funding for the school, 
parents and alumni inundated legislators with telephone calls, telegrams and 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt recently found a 1970 letter that read in part: 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, let us preserve the treasure we now have, which is unique. It 
has been called the finest school in the United States. It must be allowed to 
remain. Without experimentation there can be no change."
