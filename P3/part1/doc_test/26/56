USC film professor Michael Renov and his family were tired of renting but 
couldn't afford to buy a house in many Los Angeles neighborhoods. And they had 
neither the inclination to buy a fixer-upper nor the time to brave the commutes 
from exurbias with more reasonably priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USC was concerned that the high cost of Los Angeles-area real estate 
made it difficult to keep and attract top-flight professors. In addition, the 
school had embarked on an ambitious plan to improve the residential 
neighborhood north of campus and to attract more teachers to live there. 
</P>
<P>
So, a match was made. And another step was taken in the national trend for 
universities, particularly in California, to help their faculty and staff 
obtain affordable and attractive housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Renovs soon will be among the first tenants in a 27-unit townhouse 
condominium project that USC is building at Hoover and 30th streets, just two 
blocks from school. 
</P>
<P>
The neo-Craftsman-style development is for USC teachers and staff willing to be 
pioneers both in a neighborhood that many faculty flee after classes and in a 
new financial relationship with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked around and we really felt that for the price the faculty housing 
ended up being, we would either be a great distance from campus or find 
something very small or in need of repair," said Renov, who is chairman of the 
critical studies department at the USC School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Cathy Friedman, an official of a nonprofit organization that 
aids female survivors of crime and domestic violence, bought the largest of the 
USC floor plans: 1,950 square feet, with three bedrooms, three baths, family 
room, study and a two-car underground garage with an internal staircase to 
living quarters. The price: $285,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prices (which start at $140,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath unit) are kept 
relatively low because USC, unlike commercial developers, is not seeking 
profits. In addition, the university is keeping ownership of the land, leasing 
it to the homeowner association. 
</P>
<P>
For the Renovs, other attractions included the prospect of walking to school 
(and thus making a small contribution to lessening auto emissions), proximity 
to the child-care center near campus where their 3-year-old daughter is 
enrolled (their second child is due in a few months) and increased 
opportunities to take advantage of USC cultural and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
All that overcame jitters about crime, isolation and a lack of some 
neighborhood amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are attaching ourselves in some ways to the university," said 
Renov, who has been renting a house in the Carthay Circle area of Los Angeles. 
"We are committing ourselves because we are fairly convinced that this is part 
of a real long-term, broad-based effort to improve the environment of the USC 
community." 
</P>
<P>
That commitment from USC is real, according to Gerald M. Trimble, president of 
the USC Real Estate Development Corp., the university-funded organization that 
is building the $5.6-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 27 units are reserved, and Trimble is so confident of eventual 
sellout that he is planning another 126 units (114 for sale, and 12 for rent) 
on what is now a parking lot across 30th Street, in conjunction with 
neighboring Hebrew Union College. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are supposed to deliver what Trimble described as a "double 
whammy": providing housing as a lure for scholars and creating a university 
community outside USC's gates. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to move into this area and add purchasing power to the 
neighborhood. It's important for the university and we are committed to doing 
that," said Trimble, a former official in the redevelopment agency of downtown 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The USC group also plans a large hotel and office complex on Figueroa Street 
across from campus and has worked on restoration of Victorian homes in the 
North University Park neighborhood, which is a National Register Historic 
District. In the past, USC has been accused of being a land grabber, seeking to 
impose its will on the mainly Latino and black residents in neighborhoods 
surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
With the condos, the school clearly wanted to avoid such a perception. The 
first 27 units are on land donated by the late marine biology professor Irene 
McCulloch, after whom the project is named, and was the site of a small 
apartment house occupied mainly by students, officials said. The next phase 
requires no demolition. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of any possible gentrification are professors wary of the 
neighborhood because of crime, even though USC insists crime statistics in 
North University Park are below the citywide average. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the units and like the project," said one USC teacher who came close 
to buying one of the townhouses but backed off. "While I don't mind renting and 
living in the area, I'm not too thrilled about owning there because of the 
gangs and graffiti. I don't think the value will appreciate enough." 
</P>
<P>
To overcome such resistance, Trimble's firm paid particular attention to 
attractive design and good security at the townhouses, which will be surrounded 
by an ornamental wrought-iron fence and be patrolled by USC campus police. All 
units have studies where an academic can retreat among his books and possibly 
meet with students and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
All that, plus the collegiality of living in an academic community, attracted 
USC neurology professor Richard Thompson and his wife, Judith, a USC 
researcher, to buy one of the three-bedroom units on 30th Street. 
</P>
<P>
They had lived in Stanford University's faculty housing before moving to USC 
and a small condominium in Culver City three years ago. Now they are optimistic 
about North University Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be blunt. Even at Stanford's campus housing there were robberies and 
occasional rapes and assaults, and that's a wonderfully safe place," Richard 
Thompson said. "In the long term, this is going to be a very nice neighborhood 
as USC moves toward the city and the city moves toward USC." 
</P>
<P>
As added bait, USC is putting no limits on resale prices and is not demanding a 
share of profits. (Most schools, such as the UC branches, tie resale prices of 
their university-built housing to various indexes and take a portion of 
profits.) Some buyers can even get favorable mortgage deals from the university 
credit union and grants for closing costs from the university. 
</P>
<P>
However, like many other universities, USC has placed some restrictions on 
resale to ensure the future buyers are on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
USC is a relative latecomer to the faculty housing field in California. For 
example, UCLA, Stanford and UC Irvine long have been involved in the field. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has the opposite problem of USC: The Westwood campus is surrounded by some 
of the priciest real estate in the nation and little is available. 
</P>
<P>
Through purchases or its own construction, UCLA has 144 apartments and 52 
condos in Westwood for teachers to rent or buy at favorable rates. In addition, 
in 1986 UCLA built 58 faculty townhouses north of campus in the Beverly Glen 
area, which sold at the time for between $155,000 and $255,000. 
</P>
<P>
The school is expected to break ground this autumn for 86 large single-family 
faculty houses in the Bluffs area of Westchester. Those are expected to sell 
for about $500,000, a price that is startling to most non-Angelenos but well 
below what a commercial developer would charge, officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has stories of faculty who come here from out of state and 
everything looks fine until they start looking for housing. Then you get 
various adjectives they use to describe their state of shock," said Harold W. 
Horowitz, executive assistant to UCLA's chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has lost both potential hires as well as professors who were already on 
the staff because of housing costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
UC schools also offer below-market-rate mortgages for both university-built and 
private housing. Decisions on who should get those loans and homes can be 
difficult, with department chairmen evaluating how important a particular 
professor is to the school and how badly that faculty member needs housing 
help. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine has 388 faculty housing units on campus and 44 more are being 
planned. The existing homes range from one-bedroom condominiums that sold for 
about $100,000 to three bedroom detached houses that sold for $300,000, all 
well below the prices in the Orange County market off-campus. And, faculty can 
walk or ride bicycles to class, avoiding the freeway snarls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear this housing is part of the inducement to recruit faculty to 
Orange County," said Leon Schwartz, UC Irvine's vice chancellor for 
administrative and business services. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, a majority of teachers live in Pasadena, Culver City and the South Bay 
cities but only about 20 in neighborhoods adjacent to campus, according to 
Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
The university could have reinforced that pattern by building condominiums in 
suburban communities and developing a shuttle van system to school, but that 
would have done nothing for the campus neighborhood, not to mention the freeway 
traffic situation and parking crunch, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next eight years, Trimble wants to build as many as 300 faculty 
housing units in the USC area. "If it's going to work anywhere," he declared, 
"it's going to work two blocks from campus."
