<P>
Carolyn Husbands was never keen on LBJ. But then she spent one sweltering 
afternoon here visiting the Lyndon Baines Johnson presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment she crossed the threshold of the gleaming white building 
perched on a grassy knoll at the edge of the University of Texas campus, 
Husbands sensed her old impressions beginning to erode. 
</P>
<P>
First there was the short biographical film on the late President's life, a 
heart-tugging presentation that had Husbands dabbing at tears. Then the 
resident of Jackson, Miss., strolled the museum corridors and gazed at the 
carefully preserved documents and artifacts chronicling Johnson's rise from 
poverty in the Texas Hill Country to the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she mounted a wide marble staircase to the "Great Hall," a lofty 
atrium featuring a glass wall exposing floor upon floor of bookshelves, each 
holding scarlet boxes with gold presidential seals packed with more than 35 
million letters, memos and other weighty documents of the Johnson 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bit overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better about him after seeing all this," Husbands confided as she 
wandered through the library, soaking in the artfully crafted story of the 
nation's 36th President. "I know this accentuated the positive, but it changed 
my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Accentuating the positive, it seems, is something presidential libraries do 
rather well. And now another is joining the fold. Along with the fanfare of the 
Richard M. Nixon presidential library grand opening comes criticism that the 
privately operated, $21-million complex in Yorba Linda will present a one-sided 
glorification of a President best known for his resignation in the midst of the 
Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's is not the first presidential library to suffer such barbs. From the 
Eastern Seaboard to the cornfields of Iowa, presidential libraries have long 
been under attack by those who see them as little more than shrines to the 
select few who have held the reins of power in America. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library has been dubbed a "Pharaoh's monument," while John F. 
Kennedy's library overlooking Dorchester Bay has been criticized for providing 
too much Camelot and not enough substance about that Administration's darker 
days. Some wags, meanwhile, note that Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower 
were so smitten by their respective libraries that both chose to be buried on 
the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
To fans, presidential libraries represent a fitting tribute to America's 
leaders, a lasting record of their lives and their administrations. 
</P>
<P>
But critics -- among them politicians and scholars of all stripes -- argue that 
the museum displays contained in the eight presidential libraries run by the 
the National Archives offer a glorified picture of their namesakes, a portrayal 
that robs visitors of a balanced perspective on history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always true that there's a certain amount of distortion in the museums," 
said Stephen E. Ambrose, a political historian from the University of New 
Orleans and author of two volumes of biography on Nixon. "They always glorify 
the President. I'm sure (the Nixon library) won't be any exception." 
</P>
<P>
Even some partisans agree that a presidential library would be hard pressed to 
offer a portrait that is anything but celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an obvious tendency to think in shrinelike terms when you begin one of 
these," said Harry Middleton, director of the Johnson library and a former 
speech writer for Nixon's predecessor. "But that kind of thinking flattens 
after a while, and very likely the death of the President whose name adorns the 
building has something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
From the day in 1939 that Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for his 
library in the Upstate New York community of Hyde Park, presidential libraries 
have been at the center of a tussle over their role as emblems of power in a 
democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
Before Roosevelt, Presidents routinely removed their papers upon leaving 
office, and their preservation was largely a matter of luck. The bulk of George 
Washington's papers, for instance, were recovered by the government only after 
a relative sold them to the State Department between 1834 and 1849 for a 
then-lordly sum of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
History suffered as the papers were cut up by autograph collectors, mutilated 
by rats, scattered about the countryside, burned in barns or carted off by 
marauding troops. The single exception was Rutherford B. Hayes, for whom a 
museum and archives were established in Ohio to preserve his presidential 
papers and celebrate his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
After the turn of the century, several Presidents began depositing their papers 
in the Library of Congress. But it was not until Roosevelt that the concept of 
a presidential library run by the National Archives sprang to life. In 1955, 
Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act to allow other Presidents to 
follow Roosevelt's example. 
</P>
<P>
Each one did just that, but not without difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy library was originally planned for a parcel in Cambridge beside 
Harvard University, but opposition from nearby homeowners resulted in the 
complex being delayed for more than a decade. It was ultimately built up the 
road at a shoreline site on the University of Massachusetts campus. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter's library was beset with complaints from homeowners over an 
expressway that would have cut through a leafy, well-to-do section of Atlanta. 
A proposal for a Ronald Reagan library at Stanford University was scuttled 
chiefly by student and faculty opposition, and the complex now is being built 
in a rural tract in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction in West Branch, Iowa, to plans for the Hoover library was 
that the institution would be an intrusion on the community, recalled John 
Fawcett, the National Archive's assistant archivist for presidential libraries 
and a native of the tiny farm community. Residents were concerned the library 
would remove valuable land from the tax base and prompt authorities to plow a 
four-lane road through town, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly enough, now the Hoover library is seen as the greatest asset in 
West Branch," Fawcett said. "There's been a total turnaround in how the 
community feels. They're even trying to resurrect the old four-lane road plans 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the libraries are often seen as an economic and cultural boon by many 
townsfolk. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library, for instance, is second only to the Alamo as a Texas 
tourist attraction, its operators boast. Similar benefits are also reaped in 
Independence, Mo., site of the Truman presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real important aspect of Independence life over the last 25 or 30 
years," said Barbara J. Potts, the city's longtime former mayor. "Independence 
is proud of the Truman legacy. He put us on the map." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the libraries have warred with supporters over a broad slate of issues, 
from how much space should be allowed for the museums to whether it would be 
better to gather all the presidential papers in one place, such as Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Such gripes prompted Congress in 1986 to adopt legislation that provides 
incentives to limit the size of future libraries to 70,000 square feet (the 
Johnson library sprawls over about 100,000 square feet) and ensures that each 
opens only after a hefty private endowment is established to defray operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson library, for instance, has an endowment of $20 million, and the 
promoters of the Nixon complex want to raise at least $10 million. Both 
Presidents helped out by donating money collected from sales of books they 
published. 
</P>
<P>
Others have sought money from friends and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Truman raised revenue by hitting "the rubber chicken circuit," speaking before 
countless fund-raisers, said George H. Curtis, assistant library director in 
Independence. (Truman was also noted for spending more time at his library than 
any other President. He kept regular office hours and even took to leading 
packs of schoolchildren on tours.) 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, criticism has even mounted against some of the museum 
displays. Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a prominent anti-war 
activist during the Vietnam era, has blasted the Johnson library's exhibit on 
the war, charging that it stretches the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Sidey, a Time magazine correspondent who has covered every President since 
Eisenhower, noted that the 20-minute biographical film at the Johnson library 
lavishes attention on "Great Society" programs, but spends only two minutes on 
Vietnam, which he calls "the single most dominant event in the Johnson 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Sidey also suggested that Kennedy's museum falls short of conveying the "grim 
moments" of 1961, when the Administration suffered "a bunch of hammer blows all 
year long" with events such as the Bay of Pigs, the orbital flight of Soviet 
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and the rise of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Kennedy) museum is much more glamorized than 1961 really was," Sidey 
said. "It was really kind of grim. These were young guys not sure what they 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticisms, Sidey sees an important role for presidential 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an element of enshrining, but that's not so bad really," said Sidey, 
who counts himself a supporter of the presidential library system. "Maybe it's 
a President's rebuttal. Maybe these guys who take the slings and arrows, who 
are so pummeled in public, should have their chance." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it is the presidential archives, the vast repositories of 
correspondence, memos and other documents, that are the soul of the 
presidential library system, argues Fawcett of the National Archives. While a 
presidential museum may offer one perspective of an administration, the 
archival records gleaned by a scholar may yield a decidedly different picture. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson dedicated his library by declaring that he wanted it to present 
"the story of our time -- with the bark off." While some critics may question 
how well the museum has fulfilled that mission, the archives seem almost beyond 
reproach. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vivid proof is the publication of Robert A. Caro's 
controversial volumes of biography on Johnson, works that were drawn in part 
from documents culled from the dimly lit stacks of the Johnson library in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Nixon library, it will largely be the public that decides its 
success or failure, Fawcett said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nixon presidency is a particularly difficult one to portray," he said. 
"There were significant foreign policy advancements, major domestic triumphs, 
yet through Watergate some of the most tragic developments of any presidential 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It has the potential of being a very good exhibit on a very important part of 
history. But that is not for me to judge. It's for the people who visit -- the 
people of hometown U.S.A., the architecture critics, the political critics, the 
newspaper columnists. That's how a museum is judged."
