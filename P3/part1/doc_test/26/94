About 80,000 condoms will be distributed free at five San Francisco Bay Area 
colleges and universities this week as part of an annual rating contest 
scheduled to start today on Valentine's Day. The contest, now in its third 
year, began on the Stanford University campus and has since grown to include 
the UC campuses at Berkeley and Santa Cruz, as well as San Jose State 
University and Santa Rosa Community College. Students who agree to take part in 
the survey are given a packet containing eight brands of condoms, an 
information sheet and a ballot, said Daniel Bao, director of the Stanford AIDS 
Education Project. The packets will be handed out from today through Thursday, 
and the ratings are due back on Feb. 28, Bao said. The results should be 
available in early April. The contest is designed to increase awareness about 
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, Bao said.
