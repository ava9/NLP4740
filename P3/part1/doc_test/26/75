ENDOWED CHAIR IN RESEARCH INSTITUTE'S NEW CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT.

Moving aggressively to buttress a chemistry department that is just a year old, 
the Scripps Research Institute has hired a world-renowned chemist for an 
endowed research chair. 
</P>
<P>
K. Barry Sharpless, 49, will be trading an endowed professorship at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the position in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major achievement for us," said an exultant department chairman, 
K.C. Nicolaou. "He is a genius at discovering new reagents and reaction 
processes useful to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as well as to 
other researchers in chemistry and biology." 
</P>
<P>
Scripps received a $2.9-million grant in December to establish the chair that 
Sharpless will hold, the W. M. Keck Foundation Chair in Chemistry. The Keck 
foundation, funded with the bequest of the late oilman William Myron Keck, is 
based in Los Angeles. One of its best-known recent gifts was a $70-million 
donation for a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless will not move to San Diego until next spring, when Scripps can locate 
him in temporary quarters while a new chemistry building is being constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment brings to four the number of professors in the new department 
and is being portrayed by Scripps as a crucial step toward gaining the new 
department a reputation as a leading center for bio-organic chemistry, just a 
year after being established, Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement is impressive, said Mark Wrighton, chairman of the MIT 
chemistry department that Sharpless will be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a remarkable achievement in a short period of time," Wrighton said. "I 
think Dr. (Richard) Lerner, (president of the institute), is to be 
congratulated upon assembling this group. It's really remarkable progress." 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that Scripps clearly is taking a very narrow field within 
chemistry in which to specialize -- the field that is developing new techniques 
to build the "designer drugs" that scientists are dreaming up on 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
"The breadth of activities is still modest in comparison to the leading 
departments. So I regard it as a collection of truly super people, but in only 
one part of chemistry," Wrighton said. 
</P>
<P>
More than two years ago, Scripps embarked on a program to add chemists to its 
research staff. Although officials emphasize that Scripps still will do basic 
research, the new chemists will also make the institute more likely to develop 
new drugs or other products to which Scripps would have lucrative patent 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
One more professor remains to be hired before all five professorships in the 
department will be filled, Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless is widely regarded for his work in finding new ways to synthesize 
organic molecules using metallic compounds, said department chairman K. C. 
Nicolaou. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Sharpless invented a process for using asymmetric metallic molecules 
to force oxygen atoms to bind to organic molecules in a particular 
three-dimensional orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the oxygen atoms can bind to a pair of carbon atoms in two different 
ways, known as "right-handed" or "left-handed" isomers. 
</P>
<P>
(In the drug or nutritional store, consumers see examples of this in amino acid 
supplements such as lysine, often seen labeled as L-lysine. The right-handed 
form would be R-lysine.) 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless's method assures that all the molecules in a chemical batch will be 
purely of the same handedness. The handedness of organic molecules is 
significant because the human body generally uses only one isomer of a 
compound, so pharmaceuticals must be given only in that form. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, pharmaceuticals are first synthesized and then purified, but 
Sharpless's method eventually could eliminate the need for a purification step, 
Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is fundamental to much of the synthetic organic chemistry being 
done in research laboratories today, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Elected in 1985 to the National Academy of Sciences, Sharpless did his graduate 
work at Stanford University, and postdoctoral work at Stanford and at Harvard 
University. He has been at MIT since 1970, except for 1977-80 when he was a 
chemistry professor at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he spent three months at California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, which offered him a permanent post that he turned down, said his 
wife, Jan Sharpless.
