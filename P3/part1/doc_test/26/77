   CRYSTAL CLEAR DATA STORAGE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holographic crystals have the potential to store large amounts of
information more efficiently than any existing information storage system.
Scientists at Stanford University report in this week's issue of Science, a
US journal, that they have developed a fully automated digital holographic
data storage system with a total useful data capacity of 163,000 bytes.
The technique involves converting data to an optical signal which is then
recorded in a holographic crystal. The information can be retrieved by
illuminating the crystal and converting the optical signal back into an
electronic signal. Potentially, this technique could be used to store
trillions of bytes of information.
