UCI ARCHITECT TO LEAVE FOR POST AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Neuman, the architect who presided over UC Irvine's shift from a uniform 
building style to diverse and sometimes controversial designs by 
internationally known architects, will leave UCI for a new post at Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Neuman, 42, has coordinated UCI's $350-million expansion, a project expected to 
add more than 20 major complexes to the campus by 1992. The new buildings, 
which contrast with the modernistic concrete boxes that formed the early 
nucleus of the campus, include the Italianate-style Alumni House, the Cubist 
Student Services Building and the Pop-Modernist Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
As university architect at Stanford, Neuman will oversee design of campus 
buildings, including a plan to add more than 2 million square feet of space 
over the next decade.
