Yale University and Swarthmore College were named America's best undergraduate 
schools for the second straight year, according to U.S. News and World Report 
rankings released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Yale was tabbed as best national university in the third annual assessment by 
the magazine, followed by Princeton, Harvard, Caltech, Duke and Stanford. 
Swarthmore won honors as best national liberal arts college, ahead of Amherst, 
Williams, Pomona, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the top schools were the alma maters of the 1988 presidential 
candidates -- George Bush graduated from Yale and Michael Dukakis received his 
undergraduate degree from Swarthmore. 
</P>
<P>
In new categories, Harvey Mudd College, which along with Pomona College is part 
of the Claremont Colleges, was tabbed as the best school specializing in 
engineering and Babson College in Massachusetts won honors as the best business 
speciality school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC System 
</P>
<P>
In the national university category, the UC system did well. UC Berkeley was 
ranked 13th and UCLA 16th. Plus, UC San Diego was included in a list of 
"up-and-coming" schools selected by college presidents and administrators, 
along with Arizona State, Carnegie-Mellon, Emory, Rutgers and the University of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State was named as one of the rising regional colleges and 
universities in the West, as were University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Western 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
The schools were ranked on the basis of five categories: quality of student 
body -- based on SAT scores and the ratio of students accepted to total 
applicants, faculty quality, academic reputation, financial resources and 
ability to retain and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said it used statistical measures for each category except 
academic reputation, which was determined by polling college presidents, deans 
of academic affairs and deans of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Colleges 
</P>
<P>
The best regional university or college in the West was Trinity in Texas, the 
poll said, followed by University of Redlands, Santa Clara University, Loyola 
Marymount University in Los Angeles, University of San Diego, San Francisco 
State, Whittier College, University of Puget Sound, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
University of the Pacific in Stockton, University of Portland, Humboldt State, 
Cal State Fresno, Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., and Cal State 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list for best regional liberal arts colleges were Southwestern 
University in Texas, Evergreen State College in Washington, Pacific University 
in Oregon, Mt. St. Mary's College in Los Angeles and Texas Lutheran College. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 204 national universities, Yale won top honors even though it did not 
finish first in any of the five specific categories. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard came in first for academic reputation and student selectivity, while 
Brown won top honors for student retention, Caltech for faculty quality and 
Princeton for financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TOP 25 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the schools based on quality of student 
body and faculty, financial resources, ability to retain and to graduate 
students and reputation for academic excellence. Statistical measures and a 
survey of college leaders were used in determining the rankings.
