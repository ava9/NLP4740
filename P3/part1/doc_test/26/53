Carol Watson's otherwise excellent story (Part I, Sept. 27) on Stanford 
freshman Lupe Vasquez, who came from an Oxnard shelter for the homeless, gives 
life to the fading myth that California private education is primarily for the 
wealthy and privileged. 
</P>
<P>
By treating Vasquez as an exception to Stanford's "country-club image," and 
claiming that "freshmen are as likely to have $2,000 computers as they are to 
have notebooks," Watson overlooks a reality of education in California, and at 
Stanford in particular: that the best and the brightest of our college students 
come from increasingly diverse backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Stanford's entering freshmen need and receive financial aid, 
and approximately 100 have parents who are unable to make any contribution 
toward the cost of their education. Stanford remains committed to a "needs 
blind" admission policy and guarantees that the demonstrated financial need of 
all accepted applicants will be met.
