NATIONAL PHYSICIANS' GROUP URGES BROAD FEDERAL HEALTH PLAN 
</P>

Declaring "our health-care system is failing," a national physicians' group 
Wednesday proposed a comprehensive federal health plan that would abolish 
private insurance but still guarantee medical care for every American. 
</P>
<P>
In news conferences around the country and in an article published today in the 
New England Journal of Medicine, doctors from Physicians for a National Health 
Program, a 1,200-member physicians' group, made their case for a fundamental 
change in the way medical bills are paid. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Dr. Howard Waitzkin, an internist and a 
founding member of the group, cited recent national surveys showing that there 
are now 35 million Americans with no insurance and another 20 million who are 
"under-insured," with coverage that does not pay for all their medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rekindles Debate 
</P>
<P>
Though the plan currently lacks congressional sponsorship, its publication in 
the prestigious journal rekindles the debate about publicly financed health 
insurance within the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"As practicing doctors, teachers and researchers, we're deeply troubled that 
many people can't get the most basic health services," Waitzkin said. "That has 
got to change." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerome Tobis, a UC Irvine professor who chairs the medical center's ethics 
committee, agreed, saying, "The health-care system today in America is a 
jungle, and correction is urgently needed." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for a National Health Program's solution is a plan, patterned after 
Canada's 20-year-old national health insurance program, that proponents say 
would cut bureaucracy, do away with the "often unjust dictates of insurance 
companies," save up to $50 billion annually but still allow patients to choose 
doctors, clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying premiums to insurance companies, individuals under the plan 
would be taxed, paying an amount roughly equivalent to their premium into a new 
national health program. Most employers could expect to pay slightly less than 
they are now paying for health insurance benefits, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
As Waitzkin and the medical journal article described it, patients would not be 
billed for any medical service. Rather, all medical costs would be paid 
directly to providers through the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, regional or statewide payment boards would negotiate fees 
with doctors. Also, the boards would set budgets for hospitals, group practices 
and health maintenance organizations, a practice that would "eliminate 
billing," according to the Physicians for a National Health Program article. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, regional planning boards composed of "expert and community 
representatives" would decided whether a hospital or clinic could make capital 
outlays for new diagnostic equipment. That decision would be based on need and 
quality," and "for-profit investment would be barred," the journal article 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Waitzkin and other Physicians for a National Health Program doctors said they 
would like to see demonstration projects in several states, including 
California, before the plan is enacted across the country. But they also hoped 
that their proposal, which currently has no congressional sponsor, would add 
new life to the controversy over national health insurance that has raged on 
and off again since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the California Medical Assn., 22% of all Californians 
have no medical insurance. In the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, 27% of residents 
are uninsured; 26% of San Diego County's residents have no insurance, and 23% 
of Orange County residents have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope is to spark debate," said Dr. Isaac Taylor, retired dean of the 
University of North Carolina Medical School, who kicked off the group's press 
conference in Boston on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That was the hope too of Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor in chief of the New 
England Journal of Medicine, who published the Physicians for a National Health 
Program article, as well as another plan for national health insurance in 
today's issue. 
</P>
<P>
The second paper in the journal, written by Alain Enthoven and Richard Kronick 
of Stanford University Business School, proposed a less radical plan for 
universal health insurance. Their program would retain private insurance but 
require employers to provide coverage for their workers. Those not covered at 
work would contribute through taxes, and poor people's coverage would be 
totally subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The authors argued that a complete government takeover of health-care 
financing, such as the other group suggested, "would represent far too radical 
a change to be politically feasible in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Relman did not endorse either plan. But in what amounted to a call to arms to 
doctors, his editorial in the same edition referred to "our disastrously 
inadequate health-care financing system. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for our profession to make common cause with the government 
and with the major private payers in seeking solutions to a pressing social 
problem that is not going to solve itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Early reaction to the Physicians for a National Health Program plan ranged from 
quiet interest to flat rejection. Officials representing the 
multibillion-dollar insurance industry suggested that such a plan was absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the American public wants a monolithic health-care system," 
said Pat Schoeni, director of public affairs for Health Insurance Assn. of 
America, a Washington lobby that represents 350 national health insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's certainly problems with the (health) system. . . . Certainly 
people are not covered," Schoeni continued. "But the vast majority of people 
have health care, and everybody has access to emergency care. You may be able 
to fix the pieces that are wrong without having to redo the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William G. Plested III, a Santa Monica thoracic surgeon who is 
president-elect of the California Medical Assn., agreed that there is a 
"crisis" in health care because of the large number of Americans who are 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
However, Plested also questioned whether U.S. consumers would accept a 
Canadian-style health plan in which high-tech medical supplies are rationed, 
with some clinics getting scanning machines but others only allowed to have 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the American consumer will stand for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Schoeni, Plested argued against "dismantling" the whole medical system. 
</P>
<P>
But one consumer advocate, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen 
Health Research Group in Washington, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who say, 'It ain't broke; don't fix it,' are wrong," Wolfe said. "Our 
country is in a worldwide scandal with its failure to act. It's the only 
industrialized country outside South Africa that does not have national health 
insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said he agrees with "many elements" of the Physicians for a National 
Health Program plan, but "the point is we have to get a national health plan. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who says we don't need national health insurance is just off the wall," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Physicians for a National Health Program has no congressional sponsor 
for its national health plan, Waitzkin said, some elements of the plan are 
contained in pending national and California legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) will continue to push legislation 
that would require all employers to provide health insurance for their workers, 
Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan said. But unlike the Physicians for a National 
Health Program proposal, the federal government would play no role in the 
Kennedy plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no political support" for national health insurance, Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the House, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) plans to reintroduce 
legislation to establish a national health service, Dellums' aide Max Miller 
said. Under the bill, which has been pending in revised form since 1977, health 
care would be funded out of general revenues, progressive taxation of 
individuals and employer contributions. Under the plan community boards would 
select area health-care providers, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the House, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) plans to reintroduce a 
measure, similar to the Kennedy bill in the Senate, that would require all 
employers, regardless of size, to enroll their workers in a health-care plan. 
It would also prescribe minimum health benefits for all employees. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) plans to reintroduce a bill he 
first proposed in 1987 that would set up a California health insurance plan. 
The proposal, which died in committee last year, would not eliminate private 
insurance, Hauser said, but would require all employers to pay at least 50% of 
a worker's health insurance costs.
