THE CAMPUS AND PUBLIC SERVICE

Increasing numbers of college students want to serve their communities. Some 
help homeless people find shelter and services. Others tutor children or teach 
the illiterate how to read. Now a coalition of more than 40 California colleges 
and universities, public and private, has agreed to help these students to help 
others. The California Compact, as it is called, plans to work with communities 
to identify the problems on which students could work, try to win foundation 
support for these volunteer programs, and get faculty members as well as 
students involved. It's a gift of commitment that should not go unnoticed.

The California Compact has just been launched as part of a national effort 
called Campus Compact, which is sponsored by the Education Commission of the 
States and has been in existence for several years. The California group is 
co-chaired by Stanford University President Don Kennedy and UCLA Chancellor 
Charles E. Young, and includes among others the University of Southern 
California, Occidental College, Claremont McKenna College, Los Angeles City 
College, the California State University system and the University of 
California campuses. The James Irvine Foundation has just announced a $120,000 
donation over the next three years to enable private universities to 
participate in the compact.

It's just this kind of program that California legislators sought to foster 
when they passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara). That measure encouraged students to work 30 hours a year in their 
communities and urged their colleges to help them, in part by providing 
academic credit for some of their work. The efforts have gotten under way 
despite the governor's unwillingness to spend the $240,000 needed to help 
organize the program.

In announcing the organization of the compact, UCLA's Chancellor Young said 
recently that government resources may continue to be scarce, "but our human 
resources are potentially unlimited." He said that the colleges want to help 
build a "citizenry of problem solvers."

People who have studied college life have said for years that higher education 
could be made more meaningful if it inculcated in young Americans the value of 
public service. The California Compact aims to make that recommendation a 
reality.
