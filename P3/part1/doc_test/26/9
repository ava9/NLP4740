PAUL ROBERTS AND STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take serious objection to the Op-Ed article by Paul Craig Roberts (Aug. 15) 
which attacks Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
I am a graduate of Stanford (undergraduate economics), and a member of the 
Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution. I am a life-long Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Having served as a Hoover overseer for four years, I would characterize the 
mood of our board as extremely hopeful and positive, looking forward while 
acknowledging that serious errors of tact and judgment have been committed by 
both Hoover and Stanford in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
(Hoover Director) Glenn Campbell will always be a hero at Hoover. It is also in 
keeping with the philosophy of those other great members of the Stanford 
family, John Gardner and Ernie Arbuckle, to acknowledge that periodic change is 
healthy, both institutionally and individually. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Reagan Library, it was accepted unanimously by the Stanford 
trustees. While there was considerable debate, the faculty senate did not turn 
down the Reagan Library. I would suggest that Glenn Campbell's heroic 
impatience had as much to do with its demise at Stanford as any other single 
entity. 
</P>
<P>
Labeling the Stanford faculty leftist -- "there was no place for moderates or 
reason . . . . either you hated America or were a war criminal" -- is more 
revealing of the character of Paul Craig Roberts than of the Stanford faculty. 
Michael Boskin, Hoover Fellow, senior faculty in economics and currently 
chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisors, as well as David 
Brady, Hoover Fellow, senior faculty in political science and Stanford Business 
School, are but two examples of the caliber of faculty slurred by Roberts' 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts goes on to criticize Stanford's budgeting process. Deficits are planned 
for in the current university budget in order to absorb the extraordinary 
expense of raising $1.1 billion in the Centennial Campaign without curtailing 
the ongoing educational and research programs. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Centennial Campaign, Roberts asserts, "Stanford's fund-raising 
efforts were running behind the weak performance of last year." Last year's 
"weak performance," $181.9 million, was No. 1 among private universities in the 
United States and well ahead of Harvard for first place nationally. It was the 
first billion-dollar campaign ever announced by a university. It has survived 
the stock market crash, higher capital gains rates and even Paul Craig Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover and Stanford are two institutions which have contributed greatly to the 
West and to the world at large. They will each contribute greatly in the 
future, and they are worthy of our support. What such worthy institutions need 
and deserve are individuals who are willing to live with their imperfections 
and work to make them better. Roberts' laundry list of hackneyed, provocative 
and unproven charges represents hide-bound negative conservatism at its worst.
