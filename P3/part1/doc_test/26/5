Stanford University on Friday reported at least $160 million in earthquake 
damage as college campuses in the Bay Area attempted to find places for 
hundreds of students evacuated from unsafe dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 26 of the 240 buildings on the Palo Alto campus, including 11 
small dormitories that house about 420 students, are closed and access to 36 
more is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford President Donald Kennedy estimated that the school sustained at least 
$160 million in structural damage. Damage to contents in the school buildings 
is also expected to be heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"Various academic buildings are closed and cannot be safely reoccupied until 
structural repairs are made," Kennedy said. "Others will need to be replaced 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
At the San Francisco State and San Jose State campuses, the damage from 
Tuesday's earthquake was more extensive than first reported, officials said. In 
addition, the California State University system's $8-million marine research 
laboratory at Moss Landing, north of Monterey, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The two campuses and the lab will require about $45 million in repairs, 
according to Cal State spokesman Stephen MacCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
The library at San Francisco State appears to have significant damage, and 
inspectors are trying to determine the safety of a 700-bed dormitory and a 
parking garage. At San Jose State, the library and a large classroom building, 
among other structures, were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The two campuses originally planned to reopen Monday but that may be delayed, 
MacCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Santa Cruz, classes will resume Monday. Campus spokeswoman Stephanie Hauk 
said only a science building will remain closed for further damage inspection. 
However, she said the school sustained a "tremendous amount of content damage 
-- books, shelving, chemical spills, water lines." The losses in laboratory 
equipment probably total more than $1 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students whose off-campus residences were badly damaged are being 
sheltered on campus in dormitory lounges. "The students are just fine. We have 
plenty of water and food for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, about half the scheduled classes were held Thursday and Friday, 
and the university is planning to return to a full teaching load as alternative 
classroom sites are found, spokeswoman Kathy O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Stanford buildings heavily damaged and closed are the landmark 
Memorial Church and Leland Stanford Jr. Museum, both 100 years old and 
survivors of the great quake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
"They are original campus buildings," said spokeswoman Eileen Walsh. "The 
church is the centerpiece of the campus. The steeple was knocked off in the 
1906 quake, but it was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
Although the chapel's expensive stained-glass windows -- which were being 
restored -- escaped damage, chunks of mosaic tile crashed from walls and the 
ceiling, splintering pews below. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has been self-insured against earthquakes since 1985, when the 
school's insurance carriers canceled its policy, according to Robert Beth, 
director of risk management. Since then the school has accrued only $3.4 
million in its earthquake reserve and $3.6 million in a property reserve to 
respond to such events as fires or floods, Beth said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, insurance companies offered to provide the university with 
earthquake coverage for $5 million a year and later reduced that figure to $3 
million. But because of a $100-million deductible and a $125-million maximum 
payment above that figure, the university declined the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
University Provost James Rosse said the school may seek loans or federal funds 
or use part of its endowment, estimated at $2 billion, to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We never used our borrowing capacity up to the limit because we knew there was 
a high probability that we would have to rebuild dorms, laboratories and 
classrooms after an earthquake," he said.
