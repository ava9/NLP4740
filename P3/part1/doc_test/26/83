EARNING a management degree at the JL Kellogg Graduate School of Management
is an experience as much as an education, say present students and recent
graduates.
Co-operative learning, total quality management, and putting the customer
first are principles pervading the curriculum.
Unlike many top-ranked B-schools, the emphasis is on co-operation, rather
than competition - and the administration practises what the curriculum
preaches.
'You really get the feeling that they're marketing to the students, that
they're really responsive to our needs,' says one first-year student.
Situated on a curve of Lake Michigan at Northwestern University in the
Chicago suburb of Evanston, the Kellogg School has been ranked first for
three years running in Business Week magazine's survey of top US graduate
business schools. (It held the top rank for four of the five years the
magazine has conducted the poll.)
Grander schools such as Harvard, Stanford, and even Kellogg's prestigious
neighbour to the south, the University of Chicago, grouse that these
rankings, based on votes by recruiters and recent graduates, do not measure
a school's real mettle.
'Their next Nobel will be their first,' snipes a student at Chicago (ranked
number two), (Since 1988 Chicago has had three faculty members named as
Nobel laureates.) Mr Donald Jacobs, Kellogg's long-time dean, agrees.
'We don't put a lot of emphasis on the rankings,' he says, adding that if
they have any impact, the widely distributed polls force every school to be
more attentive to the needs of their students; to be better marketeers.
Mr Jacobs was appointed dean of Kellogg's in 1975. The school's move from
obscurity to become an internationally-recognised name, carries his imprint.
Long before it was fashionable, Jacobs created a special graduate programme
for business executives, and built a lovely lakeside hostel, the Allen
Center, to house his corporate students.
The Allen Center developed out of Mr Jacobs's conviction that a top-notch
business school should have professors with training in disciplines such as
economics and psychology, not business, and be at the cutting edge of
research in their field.
'We came up with the idea of building an executive centre on the campus and
having executives here all the time. That way we would not only train the
faculty (in business), but we would also earn money to finance research,'
Jacobs recalls.
Nearly every other business school in the US has imitated the concept, and
the Allen Center itself continues to grow and to turn out corporate
graduates. The executives form a loyal cult of business leaders who are
enthusiastic Kellogg supporters. They donate time and money; hire Kellogg
graduates; and provide real-world sounding boards for Kellogg's faculty.
Mr Jacobs has been careful to cultivate that goodwill. His 150-person
advisory board reads like a Who's Who of American business. He can assemble
on short notice a round table of corporate titans such as George Fisher of
Motorola.
'Don has a real knack for reaching out into the community,' says Mr William
Brodsky, president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a Kellogg advisory
board member. He says the continuity of Kellogg's relationships is unique.
'It is a very pro-active relationship. They call on us on a regular basis.'
Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Mr Brodsky personally spends three or
four days a year at Kellogg, and says the CME and the school have discovered
many synergies.
When Mr Jacobs was appointed as dean, Kellogg had a respected undergraduate
business programme and a second-rate graduate school. It had no general
endowment and only two endowed chairs. Jacobs' mix of marketing savvy and
academic quality has built an endowment of Dollars 120m - second only to
Harvard's. Kellogg now has 57 endowed professorships. During Mr Jacob's
tenure, between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m in new facilities has been built
and paid for by the school.
This year Kellogg has about 1,100 full-time day students and 1,300 part-time
evening masters candidates. The school no longer has an undergraduate
programme - it was a casualty of the graduate school expansion. Business
Week pegged the average pay of a new Kellogg graduate last year at Dollars
70,200 - 'value' recruiters say, when compared to the Harvard Business
School's average Dollars 84,960. The schools' annual tuition charges are
similar, at just over Dollars 18,500.
Students say that one of the distinctive aspects of Kellogg is its pervasive
use of group learning. Students are encouraged to engage in group
problem-solving from the day they arrive. Recruiters find that the approach
produces managers who can successfully navigate the politics of corporate
life.
At a time when other top-notch business schools are undergoing rigorous
self-scrutiny to make sure that their curriculums are suitable for the
1990s, Dean Jacobs says that Kellogg is not going to change course.
'In a rapidly changing world, you can't wait 20 years and then change the
curriculum,' he says. 'You have to change constantly. We change ours an
average of ten to fifteen times a year.'
