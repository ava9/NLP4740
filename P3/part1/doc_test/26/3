Stanford President Donald Kennedy, faced with increasingly strident student 
demonstrations, announced Thursday that he will attempt to hire 30 minority 
faculty members within the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of endorsing key demands of students, and recommendations 
of a 240-page report he commissioned, including a proposal that an ethnic 
studies course be made a graduation requirement and that financial aid programs 
be increased. He said he is studying all proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, speaking to the faculty in an annual report to the Academic Council, 
also said the university will attempt to increase minority enrollment in 
graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We confirm that many minority issues and concerns are not the special 
pleadings of interest groups but are Stanford issues -- ones that should engage 
all of us," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was released in April by a committee of 20 teachers, administrators 
and students who spent 18 months studying minority issues at Stanford. Kennedy 
asked for the study after complaints about the treatment of minorities on the 
13,000-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
The report made 120 recommendations, among them calls for the addition of 30 
minority faculty members to be hired in the next decade, a doubling of the 
number of minorities enrolled in doctoral studies, and the addition of an 
ethnic studies course to the graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's speech followed a week of demonstrations by students who are 
demanding additional ethnic studies courses and minority teachers. In an action 
more characteristic of its cross-bay rival, UC Berkeley, students took over 
Kennedy's office on Monday. More than 50 were arrested. Stanford had not 
witnessed a take-over of the president's office since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear that events of this week have wrought heavy damage and may have 
rekindled doubts among our friends as to whether we are a community dedicated 
to rational process and deserving of their respect," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he will meet with students on Monday to discuss the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said his speech was prepared before the student demonstrations and that 
he was not pressured by the actions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the faculty is debating whether to make more explicit 
prohibitions against racial and sexual slurs by amending Stanford's so-called 
Fundamental Standard. The two-sentence standard says students can be expelled 
for failing to show "such respect for order, morality, personal honor and the 
rights of others as is demanded of good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that any expansion of the standard would infringe on freedom 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Racial incidents in the past year fueled the debate. In one, someone scrawled a 
racial epithet on a poster announcing a party at a black fraternity. In 
another, masked students held a vigil outside a predominantly minority 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
For all the negative attention that Stanford has gotten lately, the university 
in some ways has taken a lead in reaching out to minorities. Over criticism 
from such persons as former Education Secretary William Bennett, the university 
two years ago expanded its mandatory Western Culture course to include writings 
by women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
And although other universities have looked at campus race relations, 
Stanford's undertaking is unusually complete. A month after its release, the 
university continues to field an average of 35 requests a day for copies and 
may require a second printing. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than a third of the students are minorities, the report said that 
20 years after Stanford began targeting minorities for recruitment, its record 
is mediocre compared to other research universities, and fewer blacks and 
Latinos are enrolled now than in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points to Areas of Ignorance 
</P>
<P>
The report also cited students' "widespread ignorance about the history and 
culture of American racial minorities." Most incoming white students, the 
products of upper-class rearing, have had little contact with minority or poor 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The report chided the university for not having Asian-American or American 
Indian courses, and for making "frustratingly slow" progress in the hiring of 
minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Camarillo, a history professor who chaired the group that prepared the 
report, said that while many departments have made concerted efforts to recruit 
minority faculty, others have not. And of 66 minority faculty members who were 
on the tenure track between 1978 and 1987, 25 resigned and another 16 were not 
promoted.
