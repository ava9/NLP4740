</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the high-society block where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his 
wife, Raisa, will sleep tonight, the neighbors and their help know all about 
the demands of security. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford University, where Gorbachev will speak Monday, students are taking 
the metal detectors and other precautions in stride, so anxious are they to get 
a glimpse of the Soviet leader and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
With Gorbachev's 8:45 p.m. arrival drawing near, hammer-and- sickle flags flap 
in the San Francisco Bay breeze. Vendors peddle T-shirts. And U.S. law 
enforcement authorities are polishing up their plans to encase the Soviet 
leader in the tightest security possible. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 days, U.S. Secret Service agents have been walking the routes 
the Gorbachevs will travel and have told residents in the Pacific Heights 
neighborhood where the couple will be staying to keep away from their windows 
and off their roofs, lest they be mistaken for snipers. 
</P>
<P>
During the next two days, the Secret Service will be responsible for ensuring 
the safety of 10 "protectees," all of them past or present leaders of nations 
and high government officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gorbachev, the Secret Service must protect former President 
Ronald Reagan, for instance, who will have breakfast with the Soviet leader at 
the consul general's home, and South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, who is 
scheduled to meet Gorbachev on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Logistically, it is a little bit more work," Richard McDrew, special agent in 
charge of the Secret Service in San Francisco, said of Roh's visit, announced 
last week. Then he amended the comment. The visit by the South Korean leader 
means "a lot more work." 
</P>
<P>
McDrew is a veteran of visits by presidents, Pope John Paul II in 1987 and 
Queen Elizabeth II in 1983. "I don't want to say it is routine, but it is 
standard," he said, noting that he simply requested extra armored limousines 
and agents from other offices to help with such functions as communications and 
bomb sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service is the U.S. agency responsible for protecting foreign 
leaders. On this occasion, the Secret Service will share the task with agents 
of the Soviet KGB and South Korean security agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody identifies themselves as KGB," said Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice 
president for public affairs. "They just say they're Soviet security. They 
strike me as typical policemen who are interested in things they should be 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service and KGB will be assisted by agencies ranging from the FBI to 
the California Highway Patrol as well as by police in San Francisco, Palo Alto 
and Stanford, and security officers at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Law 
enforcement officials would not say how much the policing would cost or how 
many would be involved. 
</P>
<P>
No one involved in the security planning seemed especially worried as they 
explained how traffic will be slowed whenever Gorbachev's 30-car motorcade 
travels down normally clogged freeways, or how demonstrators will be kept at 
bay, or how hundreds of people will be herded through metal detectors before 
hearing the Soviet leader speak. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of celebrities and ex-presidents before," said Jim McCarthy, 
head of security at the Fairmont Hotel, where Gorbachev will speak on Monday 
and meet privately with Roh. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachevs will stay at Soviet Consul General Valentin Kamenev's home, a 
Pacific Heights mansion monitored by a video camera and ringed by a 
wrought-iron fence on what may be San Francisco's toniest block -- the 2800 
block of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors away lives a member of the family that owns Levi Strauss. A Getty 
lives a few doors down in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric workers checked for leaking gas lines in front of 
the home late last week. Pacific Bell worker Paul Bowman, asked Saturday what 
he was doing with phone lines outside the consul general's home, replied, "It's 
secret." 
</P>
<P>
The street will be barricaded during the visit. Residents will have to park on 
nearby streets and walk home. Guards will check residents' identification 
before letting them pass. 
</P>
<P>
Security precautions are nothing new on the block. Hilda Gotcher, secretary to 
Dodie Rosekrans, a next-door neighbor of Kamenev, noted that not long ago, the 
family hosted a fund-raiser attended by former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
Any inconvenience will be of little bother to Rosekrans. She is co-chairwoman 
of Friends of Raisa Gorbachev, and one of four people from the group scheduled 
to meet with Mrs. Gorbachev at the Kamenev residence Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast with the Reagans, the Gorbachevs will head to Stanford, 35 
miles south. The trip will give the Soviets a chance to visit the Silicon 
Valley, an area few of their fellow citizens have seen, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
The university does no classified work. But the U.S. government has declared 
much of the Silicon Valley off-limits to Soviets because of the many defense 
contractors and companies there that develop technology coveted by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Counterintelligence experts assume that during state visits most spying ceases. 
Soviet agents will be busy protecting their leader and probably won't have time 
to gather intelligence, noted David W. Szady, head of the FBI's unit 
responsible for combatting Soviet spying in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they wouldn't want something to happen that would be an 
embarrassment," Szady said. ". . . Embarrassments -- that's what everybody 
protects against." 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, officials issued tickets Friday to several thousand students and 
staff members to see Gorbachev arrive in the quadrangle Monday morning. The 
quad will be closed in the hours before the arrival. The business school, where 
Gorbachev will meet with selected students and faculty, also will be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,700 people who will attend Gorbachev's speech at Stanford's Memorial 
Auditorium will have to pass through metal detectors. No briefcases or cameras 
will be allowed. Hoover Tower will be closed during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers will ensure that the 30-car motorcade travels Bay Area freeways 
swiftly between San Francisco, Stanford and San Francisco airport. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators are planning to mass outside the Fairmont when the Soviet leader 
speaks at the Nob Hill hotel. But San Francisco police doubt that he will draw 
anywhere near the thousands who protested against the Pope in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
