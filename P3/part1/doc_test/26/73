JFK. LIFE AND DEATH OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT
Volume One: Reckless Youth
By Nigel Hamilton
Century, Pounds 20. 898 pages
Jack Kennedy would never have become president without his father, Joe.
The bootlegger, stock market swindler and ambassador to the Court of St
James under Franklin Roosevelt was relentless in his pursuit of power,
whether in bed or the boardroom. But aside from a brief flirtation with the
idea of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1940, Joe
Kennedy steered clear of a career in national politics, preferring instead
to fulfil his own ambitions through his nine children.
Kennedy senior once remarked of his daughter Eunice that if she had 'been
born with balls she would have been a hell of a politician'. In the event,
it was Jack who made the grade, an outcome which was by no means a foregone
conclusion, as Nigel Hamilton suggests in the first volume of this
affectionate biography.
For much of his early life, Jack Kennedy was racked by back pain and
Addison's disease; his academic achievements were nothing out of the
ordinary; and he laboured long in the shadow of the family favourite and
eldest son, Joe Jr, who later disappeared on a suicidal bombing mission en
route to northern France, long after his normal tour of duty was over.
Hamilton's thesis is that Kennedy's youth provides most of the clues for
understanding the future president. Behind the playboy facade, a serious
person was struggling to emerge, according to this biographer, who produces
interesting examples of Kennedy's early work as a journalist and student.
But the impression remains of a certain recklessness, a desire to live
dangerously.
Sex is a leitmotiv in JFK's life, as this biography sets out in detail,
thanks to dozens of private letters obtained from Lem Billings, a boyhood
friend of the future president.
Jack Kennedy loved dangerous liaisons. In war-time Washington, he found Inga
Arvad, whom the FBI falsely suspected as a Nazi spy. Twenty-five years
later, J Edgar Hoover was preoccupied with Kennedy's friendship with Judith
Campbell, paramour of Sam Giancana, the Mafia boss.
All rollicking stuff, but Hamilton's preoccupation with JFK's health (75
references) and sexual encounters and attitudes (31 references) leaves him
prone to psycho-babble. At one point, he compares Jack's tyrannous father to
Joseph Stalin, asking improbably: 'Moreover, was there not a complete
black-out of news of his father's true behaviour, from assaulting woman
guests to lobotomising his daughter? Kennedy and Stalin even shared the same
name.'
Hamilton's focus on character has merit, if only because he brings out the
mixture of diffidence, charm and wit which made Jack such an irresistible
political commodity. He also traces Kennedy's progress to political
maturity, where, thankfully, the young student and journalist ditched his
father's isolationism and craven appeasement of Hitler.
The weakness in this approach is that he tends to skirt over more important
lessons about Kennedy and his extraordinary family. By far the most telling
is the power of money and privilege in America. Thanks to his father's
wealth, Jack Kennedy attended the finest universities (Princeton, Harvard
and Stanford); he had tea with Princess Elizabeth; he visited France,
Germany, Poland, and Russia on the eve of the second world war; and he
attended the Potsdam conference in 1945, coming into contact in a matter of
weeks with virtually all the players on the international stage including
Truman, Eisenhower, Molotov, Harriman, Gromyko, Eden, Churchill, Attlee and
Bevin. Not even 30 years of age, Jack had a singular opportunity for a man
obviously being groomed for the highest office.
To some extent, Jack Kennedy made his own luck. He became a war hero after
his PT-boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer in the Pacific. Hamilton's
account of this episode is probably the fullest and most dramatic to date,
capturing the mixture of recklessness and personal courage which made him
front-page news.
Behind the glory, however, there were worrisome tendencies. Like his father,
young Kennedy suffered from an inclination to look for short-cuts. For
example, he was late in filing to run for the 11th congressional district in
Massachusetts, the race which launched his career in national politics. 'A
series of frantic phone calls was made,' writes Hamilton. 'In the end, money
and influence prevailed.'
At the end of this volume, Hamilton claims that Jack had reinvented the
Kennedys. He had 'escaped from his father's and his elder brother's
Boston-Irish bigotry and found a pluralist, idealistic and internationally
defined liberalism that would, one day, define a generation of Americans.'
But in the light of what we now know about the misjudgments and brinkmanship
of JFK's presidency, Hamilton, in his next volume, will have a hard job
revising contemporary judgment among American scholars that as a character
Kennedy was flawed, and as a president overrated.
