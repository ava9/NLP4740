PEOPLE: HARVARD DEAN TAKES STANFORD BUSINESS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Harvard University dean has been selected as dean of Stanford University's 
Graduate School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
A. Michael Spence, 46, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, was 
picked to be the seventh dean of the prestigious graduate school, which ranked 
No. 1 in a recent published report. 
</P>
<P>
In his Harvard post, Spence, a former Rhodes Scholar, led 700 faculty members 
and 9,000 students enrolled in undergraduate programs, master's and doctoral 
programs for all departments, excluding the professional schools. Spence's 
Harvard post, comparable to the role of provost at other universities, is 
considered the second most powerful at the Ivy League institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Spence is an extremely able academic administrator," said Stanford 
Provost James N. Rosse. "The selection committee developed a clear idea of the 
kind of leadership it wanted. There is no doubt we found the person who could 
carry that role." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, an economist who held joint appointments in the economics department 
and at the Harvard Business School before becoming dean, replaces Robert K. 
Jaedicke, who's stepping down after six years to return to teaching and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Spence said the Stanford business school is "a wonderful school with 
outstanding faculty and terrific students. This is a major opportunity to be 
involved with people I respect and to do something important." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, who taught at Stanford from 1973 to 1975, takes over a Stanford 
business school comprised of 660 students in the two-year MBA program, 42 Sloan 
Fellows and 84 doctoral students. The faculty numbers 120.
