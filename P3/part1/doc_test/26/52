ACADEMICS DEBATE THE DECLINE OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE. HAS 
SOCIALISM BEEN DEFEATED OR REINVIGORATED?

<P>
Economics professor Richard Wolff expected 150 academics to attend a scholarly 
conference entitled "Rethinking Marxism." Instead, about 1,500 showed up at the 
meeting at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, straining hotels, 
restaurants and auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
When Wolff began planning the event in the fall of 1988, Stalinist regimes 
controlled Eastern Europe and perestroika was in its early stages in the Soviet 
Union. But by the time the meeting took place several months ago, the world had 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wolff and other leftist scholars, the huge turnout proves that 
there is more interest than ever in Marxism among U.S. academics -- despite 
claims to the contrary by their conservative counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval in the communist world "has made many more Americans who are 
interested in Marxism feel much more comfortable about saying so," said Wolff, 
who conceded that some people may find that ironic. "When this Cold War stuff 
ebbs and cracks and breaks down, we can openly debate and explain without a 
shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond any political debate, the events in Eastern Europe have sparked 
intellectual turmoil on American college campuses. There is a nervous rush to 
update textbooks made obsolete by daily headlines. Yet there is excitement 
about new research opportunities, and there is professorial pleasure that 
students are becoming more passionate about history, economics and human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative scholars are gloating over the West's supposed victory in the Cold 
War and predict a steep decline in the study of Marxism. And socialist 
professors are saying the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have 
freed them from perceived ties with the abuses of Stalinism while depriving 
conservatives of their anti-Soviet intellectual anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff and other like-minded professors maintain that the overthrown leaders in 
Eastern Europe enforced repressive policies that perverted true socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"The slogan I came up with is: 'Socialism is dead. Long live Socialism,' " said 
Anatole Anton, a professor at San Francisco State University who teaches 
Marxist philosophy and describes himself as a democratic socialist. "The old 
model of statist, authoritarian socialism really has been dealt a death blow. 
That sweeps the slate clean and asks intellectuals to think about the meaning 
of democratic socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Anton and others say, few on the left had kept faith with the 
pre-glasnost communist systems. 
</P>
<P>
It is wrong, Anton said, for conservatives to assume that American-style 
capitalism will suddenly blossom in places such as Romania and Bulgaria. 
Rather, he predicted, nations whose governments have been overthrown will look 
to such countries as Sweden -- with its mixture of state planning, private 
enterprise and social welfare benefits -- as models. 
</P>
<P>
At Columbia University, undergraduates are asking history professor Martha 
Howell about whether socialism is indeed in its death throes. But Howell, who 
is chairwoman of the Radical History Review, a publication that often 
interprets history from a Marxist point of view, tells them that the toppled 
Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe gave socialism a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
"What you want to do is get students in the class to think about how socialist 
states, as they existed post-war, failed to deliver the democracy as promised 
by the theorists. I think anybody who has worked in the history naturally makes 
those distinctions. But the average student doesn't," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the political spectrum in academia, conservative scholars 
insist that their long-held beliefs have proven true: that now-toppled Eastern 
European governments never had popular support and that the American military 
buildup under the Reagan Administration encouraged the changes. Marxism, they 
say, is challenged in each day's headlines, and teaching about it faces a grim 
future in American higher education. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that we hard-liners have been right all along," said Richard 
Pipes, history professor at Harvard University and former director of East 
European and Soviet affairs for the National Security Council in the Reagan 
Administration. "I think we have been completely vindicated." Only the speed of 
the changes in Eastern Europe surprised him, Pipes said. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes and others predict a resulting decline in student interest in Marxism in 
the United States, although they believe that interest in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe will continue to mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen H. Balch -- president of the National Association of Scholars, an 
organization with conservative ties -- believes that a new generation of 
scholars will shun socialism. "They will start to learn the lessons of the 
world and will show more of an unwillingness to naively imbibe all that stuff," 
said Balch, an associate professor of government at John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Students, he said, will become more interested in the nuts and bolts of making 
economies and governments work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they are going to cope," Pipes said of the intellectual left, 
dismissing its claims of rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
But their opponents argue that it will be the conservatives who have trouble 
coping. They say the self-congratulation among conservative scholars masks a 
deeper insecurity. The theory that the Soviet system was inflexible -- as made 
famous by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick -- 
has proven false, the liberal scholars insist. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of the Soviet Union has been the basis of conservative power and thought 
in America since about 1948. Or I should say manipulation of fear of 
communism," said Jon Wiener, history professor at UC Irvine. "What will hold 
conservatism together now that conservatives have really lost the bedrock of 
their interpretation?" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their political persuasion, however, scholars in Soviet and Eastern 
European studies are tossing old assumptions into the dustbin of academia. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous upheaval," said Richard Lyman, former president of Stanford 
University, who is now director of its Institute for International Studies. "A 
whole lot of stuff written even recently has to be read with a red pencil on 
every page. I think it's a very big problem for everybody teaching in relevant 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a rush to update textbooks to reflect the revolutions in 
the Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"Textbooks are very far behind," said Christopher S. Allen, assistant professor 
of political science at the University of Georgia at Athens. He and his 
co-authors are updating a book on European politics but worry that the 
revisions will be out of date by publication. Allen and several professors 
across the country report that they have stopped using certain texts and are 
requiring students to read foreign-affairs coverage in daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Much past scholarship concentrated on power struggles within communist parties 
and on centralized economic planning within the communist system. Now, scholars 
say, there is a flurry of interest in the lesser-known aspects of Soviet and 
Eastern European life -- churches, unions, underground economies, pre-World War 
II political parties and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost will help, everyone agrees, by opening to Western researchers an 
enormous amount of previously suppressed information about the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
"The material coming out now is very exciting indeed," said Robert Conquest, a 
senior research fellow in Soviet history and international affairs at the 
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford. He likened some 
past scholarship about the Soviet Union to writing about ancient Roman history 
by contemplating ruins and reading a few memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation so much in flux, many scholars are reluctant to predict what 
might happen in Eastern Europe, said Conquest, who is working on a new edition 
of his book about Stalinist terrors. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me: 'Will Gorbachev win the political struggle?' And I said, 
'Look, at 10 o'clock in the morning on the day of the battle you couldn't 
predict the outcome of . . . Waterloo.' " Gorbachev's policies, according to 
Conquest, are "that of a guy going down the Grand Canyon in a canoe. He doesn't 
want to sink." 
</P>
<P>
William Tabb, economics and sociology professor at Queens College in New York, 
said one of the hardest tasks will be deciding what is worthwhile to save from 
past research. On the right, the idea is discredited that the Soviet system is 
incapable of change, he said. But so is leftist ideology that the now-toppled 
communist governments in Eastern Europe were evolving toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of what was written was so off base," Tabb said. "The presumptions, 
the assumptions were so far off the mark." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the turmoil, there is exhilaration that students want to delve more 
deeply into the dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"This provides a wonderful opportunity in the classroom to examine 20th-Century 
history and the complexity of politics," said Howell of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Professors across the nation report significant increases in student enrollment 
in classes dealing with the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've suddenly improved as a teacher," Andrei S. Markovits, 
political science professor at Boston University, remarked about the more 
crowded classrooms. "There is just an awareness that this is a momentous time." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Caldwell, a Soviet affairs expert who teaches political science at 
Occidental College, described his students as "irrepressible" in their urge to 
discuss current events, even when the day's lecture is about medieval Russian 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge for me is how to get students to look at the longer-term trends 
and the broader picture when their interest is so consumed by the headlines," 
Caldwell said. "And I don't mean that critically because the headlines are so 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, international relations professor Steven Lamy also said that student 
excitement must be channeled into more than celebration about the end of the 
Cold War. "Most students are running around like we just won the Rose Bowl," 
Lamy said, referring to campus reaction to the toppling of the Berlin Wall. He 
said he now wants students to focus on the many economic and environmental 
problems that remain worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Albright, international relations professor at Georgetown University, 
said she is urging students to "free themselves from old thinking" -- to be 
wary of scholars with vested interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard even for students between 18 and 22 to take a leap and think about 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe being different. They are nervous about 
treading new ground," she said. "So I tell them I don't have the answers and 
that I am exploring new ground with them."
