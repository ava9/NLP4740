are wielding the axe

YALE UNIVERSITY, for 292 years a breeding ground of America's ruling elite,
has seen better days.
Entire academic disciplines are on the cutting block. Many faculty positions
and sports teams are already gone. Even Commons, the Greek revival hall
where undergraduates have taken meals throughout this century, has been
closed for dinner.
An Dollars 18.5m budget shortfall, the second in as many years, has forced
the country's third-oldest establishment of higher education down this path
of contraction. And Yale is not alone.
It is a debt struggle that is going on everywhere, says Acting President
Howard Lamar, an avuncular historian brought in to calm waters when the
previous president, Mr Benno Schmidt Jr, resigned after trying
unsuccessfully to make drastic cuts last year.
Mr Lamar, who has tapped Professor William Nordhaus, the Keynesian
economist, to help put the fiscal house in order, quickly adds that Yale,
with a Dollars 2.6bn endowment, is 'far less desperate' than other
universities.
New York's Columbia University, another bastion of the east coast Ivy
League, plans a Dollars 30m deficit over the next two years on its annual
Dollars 1bn budget. In California, Stanford University has begun efforts to
eradicate a Dollars 125m deficit over the next three years. Less well known
schools like the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut have even
threatened bankruptcy.
The reasons are clear. Rising faculty salaries and health care costs which
have grown by 360 per cent in the past eight years, have strained budgets.
Potentially lucrative research in fields such as particle physics and
molecular biology is capital intensive and the federal government, with its
own budget pressures, does not want to continue footing most of the bill.
State schools face additional pressure from fidgety legislatures. For the
first time in 33 years, state support for higher education went down last
year.
In California, the state legislature, struggling with a Dollars 10.7bn
deficit, cut the education budget by Dollars 2.2bn, roughly 12 per cent. The
allocation to nine-campus University of California system, which includes
Berkeley, was cut by 11 per cent. The university, once a model for other
state systems, has frozen pay, cut 5,000 jobs and doubled student fees over
the past two years. A proposal to reduce salaries by 5 per cent across the
board is on the table.
'A great university is a fairly fragile body,' laments Mr William Baker,
University of California vice-president for finance and administration. 'It
can be destroyed in a short time, but it takes years and years to build up
excellence.'
The universities, meanwhile, are getting less sympathy than they used to.
This reflects a popular sense, frequently evident in local newspapers, that
academia has become bloated, combined with a number of embarrassing
disclosures that some universities, notably Stanford, have misused federal
funds.
Officials at Stanford and other universities say the government has
harnessed an anti-intellectual populist sentiment to shrink support for the
sciences. But Mr Erich Bloch, who ran the National Science Foundation in
1984-91, points out that after 30 years of steady growth the government must
level support.
Tuition has also done little to endear universities to the middle-classes,
too rich to qualify for financial aid but too poor to afford large term
bills. Just last week, Yale became the first US university to break the
Dollars 25,000 a year fee threshold. The 5.9 per cent increase was the
school's lowest in 20 years but still far outpaced inflation.
More troubling is the sense that the money is wasted. American faculties,
faculty members, notorious for spending little time in the class, have
developed a taste for lucrative research or writing books. After all, those
are the criteria for achieving academic tenure.
Congress, which called academics to account on science funding, has
responded to the public unease. Ms Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat,
last autumn held a well publicised select hearing under the loaded title,
'College Education: Paying More and Getting Less'.
Academics feel a bit indignant. A lot of good research, particularly in the
emerging biotechnology field, is done at universities. The misuse of funds
at most universities was scant in relation to the volume of research, it is
frequently argued. 'It's plain to everybody that it was blown out of
proportion,' says Professor Donald Kennedy, former Stanford president.
What is not clear is whether the squeeze is a cyclical readjustment or a
permanent shift. Faculties were reduced in the 1970s. And the bureaucratic
cuts are probably long overdue.
But, this time, universities have been forced to rethink their long-term
priorities and, quite without precedent, to pick and choose their strengths.
This idea of 'selective excellence' - often associated with Mr Robert
Zemsky, who runs the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the
University of Pennsylvania - works on the assumption that schools got too
big for their own good during 1980s.
Yale followed this creed last year by trying to trim the applied sciences,
such as engineering, sociology, applied physics and operations research,
along with 10.7 per cent of the faculty. The faculty rebuffed the measure,
and along with it the president, provost and dean. But some departments may
still go.
In any case, universities seem ready for a fresh start after a tumultuous
year. Duke, Columbia and the University of Chicago have named new
presidents. Mr Gerhard Casper, the German-born scholar who took over at
Stanford last autumn, has worked quietly to restore the university's
tarnished reputation.
Yale has yet to name a chief executive. Not surprisingly, the leading
candidates are good administrators - often with a background in economics.
