SHUT DOWN THE DIPLOMA MILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

California has an unfortunate reputation as a haven for diploma mills, which 
are schools that award degrees for little or no work. They cheapen the value of 
legitimate degrees, prey on the gullible and defraud employers who fall for the 
phony credentials. Legislation in Sacramento that would help curb these diploma 
mills deserves support. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills) is sponsoring SB 190, which would 
overhaul the licensing procedures for unaccredited universities and independent 
trade schools. One of these schools, for example, offers advanced degrees in 
the martial arts through correspondence courses and grants as many as 60 
credits for past "life experiences." Another offers degrees in business 
administration, computer science, engineering, health services, public 
administration and psychology, yet has only one full-time faculty member. For 
their independent course work, says Morgan, students pay $3,600 a year in 
tuition.

A 1986 directory published in Sacramento lists 177 unaccredited degree-granting 
programs in California, issuing among them about 1,200 doctorates each year, 
compared with 2,000 from accredited private institutions such as Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's bill, which may come up today on the Senate floor, doesn't affect 
schools like Stanford that have their programs evaluated by the Western Assn. 
of Schools and Colleges. It would affect the nonaccredited universities that 
are now overseen by a division of the state Department of Education or the 
trade schools supervised by the Department of Consumer Affairs, neither of 
which has expertise in higher education. The bill would create a California 
Council for Private Postsecondary Education expressly to check such schools. It 
would be financed by increasing license fees for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Unaccredited trade schools enroll about one-third of the people who have 
defaulted on their student loans since 1979. Their courses fail to equip 
students for the job market and leave them with debts they cannot pay; at a 
minimum, closer supervision might help reduce loan defaults. Many unaccredited 
schools make their principal income from students in foreign countries, who 
cannot be expected to know much about American accrediting systems and degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some diploma mills grant degrees in pharmacology or counseling but 
require little legitimate course work. SB 190 would help protect the health of 
employers and consumers who may be unaware that some diplomas come with little 
to go with them except a frame. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's bill deserves passage.
