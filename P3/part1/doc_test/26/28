Stanford University will pay a steep price for keeping its football field and 
campus green after mandatory water rationing was imposed during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The university has been fined $209,000 by the San Francisco Water Department, 
its largest supplier of water, since August. 
</P>
<P>
Its bill for October alone ran an extra $127,237 because Stanford used 25.9 
million gallons beyond its limit, about a third more than its allotment. 
</P>
<P>
The state's water crisis, brought on by four consecutive years of below-average 
rainfall, has forced most water customers in the area to endure short showers 
and brown lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 80% of customers have managed to stay within their allotments, 
according to Cheryl Davis, manager of the water department's customer service 
division. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford utilities manager David Kaye said the school had to water the 
campus extensively in October because it was such a dry month. 
</P>
<P>
Since August the university has used 54 million gallons of excess water. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Stanford had been watering its football field, lawns and golf 
course with water from supplies at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir near Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the athletic fields are also classrooms, if you want to stretch the 
meaning of classrooms," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
But a long-term water conservation plan is needed, university officials 
concede. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has installed meters on buildings that didn't have them, including 800 
faculty homes, and it turned off its seven decorative fountains and stopped 
washing university cars. 
</P>
<P>
The 25.9 million extra gallons Stanford used in October was enough to supply 
more than 14,000 people for a month, based on figures from the water 
department.
