A CURE FOR THE BAY AREA BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider these issues now being faced by the sprawling, growing California 
metropolitan region: The economy is healthy, but its traditional base is 
eroding and changing in ways that are not well understood; there is concern 
about the quality of public education; housing and transportation problems are 
undercutting the area's competitiveness; growth and slow-growth forces are 
clashing, and the high quality of life is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
This litany should be familiar to Southern California officials who have 
expressed identical concerns but have found no effective, unified method of 
combatting the problems. This particular list of challenges, however, has been 
compiled by government, business and education leaders in the San Francisco Bay 
Area through a new entity known as the Bay Area Economic Forum. The forum is a 
public-private partnership formed late last year under the auspices of the Bay 
Area Council and the Assn. of Bay Area Governments.

In a 24-page publication, the forum addresses itself to critical questions that 
are strikingly similar to problems in the Los Angeles region. The approach is 
much like that taken by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's LA 2000 committee, 
which urged a regional attack on regional problems. In its concluding section, 
the Bay Area report says: "Parochial thinking is one of the Bay Area's chief 
handicaps in dealing with the complex issues and difficult choices of the 
1990s. A shared and realistic vision of the region's problems, needs and 
potentials must become one of our chief goals."

Significantly, members of the forum under the chairmanship of Robert T. Perry, 
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, represent the cream of 
leadership in the nine-county region, including the mayors of San Francisco, 
San Jose and Oakland; the president of Stanford University and the chancellors 
of UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, and top executives of industries including 
the Chevron Corp., National Semiconductor Corp. and Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The forum is not just another discussion committee, Parry said in the forward 
to the booklet, but is a group designed to provide real leadership that crosses 
city lines and county boundaries. Considering traditional trans-bay rivalies, 
this will not be an easy task. But if the area's leaders insist on success, 
they will succeed. Southern California should watch with interest.
