ECONOMIST LOSES A POST AFTER TV COMMENTS

An economist well known for his pessimistic warnings about the financial health 
of the banking industry said Friday that he has been ousted from a non-paying 
position at a Stanford research center because of controversial comments he 
made on ABC's "Nightline" program. 
</P>
<P>
R. Dan Brumbaugh said the decision by administrators at Stanford's Center for 
Economics Policy Research stemmed from comments he made on a July 31 appearance 
on the program with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William 
Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
In that appearance, Brumbaugh said that the banking deposit insurance fund is 
weak, and that taxpayers are at risk to pay for bank failures. His most 
controversial remark, which received the most attention, was that several of 
the nation's largest banks are actually insolvent. Seidman, on the program, 
called Brumbaugh's remarks "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Brumbaugh said that after the appearance, officials with the Stanford center 
canceled a banking project he was to head and cut off his affiliation. 
Brumbaugh said he believes that the center was under pressure from banking 
executives who contribute to Stanford, and Bush Administration officials, 
several of whom used to be affiliated with the center. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Steinmueller, deputy director of the center, denied Brumbaugh's 
allegations. He said the idea of the banking project was not pursued because 
members of Stanford's faculty were not interested in it, and that the center's 
role is to aid their research. 
</P>
<P>
Brumbaugh, one of the first to warn about the saving and loan mess, is 
frequently quoted in the news media. Even though he had no official job with 
Stanford, he is frequently identified incorrectly as an economist or professor 
with the university. 
</P>
<P>
Steinmueller described Brumbaugh's title of senior research scholar as a 
"courtesy title" given to him. He said that Brumbaugh's main task at the center 
was to organize a banking conference earlier this year.
