LEUKEMIA VICTIM BEATS ODDS TO FIND DONOR

Tarzana attorney Marc Smith, suffering from a deadly form of leukemia, searched 
across the country, hoping to beat odds of 15,000-to-1 against finding a donor 
with compatible bone marrow for a transplant that doctors said could be all 
that might save him. 
</P>
<P>
But no donor had been found by the end of January, when doctors feared he might 
have less than a month to live. So Smith agreed to undergo a riskier procedure, 
known as an autologous transplant, using his own marrow. 
</P>
<P>
But just hours before he was scheduled to begin preparatory chemotherapy 
treatment, Smith said, his doctors informed him that a potential donor had been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle were reluctant 
to postpone the scheduled transplant. It would take weeks to complete the tests 
to confirm that the donor was a perfect match. By that time, it might be too 
late to perform the autologous transplant if the donor's marrow was 
incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith opted to take the risk. Wednesday, he learned the gamble had paid 
off: the potential donor is indeed a match and Smith is scheduled to have a 
transplant next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked them into it," Smith said by phone from a sterile, enclosed hospital 
room where he awaits the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt I didn't have the time to wait, but I thought that if there is a 
donor out there, after all we have done to find one, I wanted to have the 
transplant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After learning in November that Smith needed a bone marrow transplant, his 
relatives in Los Angeles and New York launched major drives to find a donor. He 
said they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for more than 2,000 
people to be tested, and held more than a dozen testing sessions on both 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 18, Smith appeared on a nationally televised talk show and appealed to 
viewers to take the test to become bone marrow donors. Thousands responded, and 
matches were found for several other leukemia patients. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's family members said they were thrilled Sunday, but Smith said he still 
has a hard battle ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
The donor -- who remains unknown to Smith and his family -- cannot undergo the 
30-minute marrow extraction procedure until next week. Smith said that he does 
not know the reason for the delay -- and under the rules of the medical 
exchange, he is not allowed to contact the donor -- but his condition is 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said his doctors estimate he has about a 75% chance of recovery if he 
survives the transplant. The odds of that, he said, are about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he has beaten the odds once -- finding a donor -- and he is 
determined to prevail over the cancer threatening him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three little boys and I want to make it," he said. The last-minute 
match, he said, has bolstered his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"My chances have been increased tremendously by really what is a miracle," he 
said. "If I had come here one day earlier, I would have already started the 
chemotherapy for the autologous transplant and that would have been it." 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost like it is meant to be that I pull this one out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am scared to death, but the bottom line is that I am still here and still 
fighting."
