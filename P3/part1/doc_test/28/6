Doctors for 12-year-old Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a 
heart-liver transplant, spent much of Wednesday trying to stop internal 
bleeding that began shortly after her second liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital suspected internal bleeding when the girl's 
blood pressure began dropping Tuesday night, seven hours after her transplant 
surgery ended. She had regained consciousness and was listed in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors decided Feb. 13 that Stormie, who lives in the Ft. Worth suburb of 
White Settlement, needed a new liver. The liver she received in 1984 had been 
damaged by hepatitis.
