Transgenic pigs, bred for use in organ transplants, could prove profitable
for the daring investor. British expertise and US finance have brought the
futuristic scheme to the point of patent application.
According to David White, a lecturer in transplantation immunology at
Cambridge University, pigs hold the key to future organ supply. While
transplantation skills race ahead, human supply lags behind, depriving
thousands of patients each year of a lifesaving operation.
Eric Rose, of Columbia Medical School in New York, has estimated that in the
US a potential 20,000 heart transplant could be performed annually, yet
fewer than 2,000 transplants are carried out each year. Discrepancies in
supply and demand also exist in kidney, liver and pancreas transplantation.
Anatomically and physiologically, pigs have many similarities to humans.
They grow to a size comparable with even the biggest man. And since they
frequently give birth to 12 or 13 piglets at a time, they can easily satisfy
current demand.
However, the big drawback between discordant species is immunological. The
host rejects the organ graft within 10-15 minutes of transplantation. Every
human has antibodies in the blood against every other distantly-related
species, including the pig. In addition to natural antibodies, a further
body defence system is activated, known as complement. 'Complement acts as
the bomb of the immune system,' says White.
Working with transplant pioneer Sir Roy Calne at Cambridge, White has used
genetic manipulation to slow down the human complement response to the
transplant. White has inserted into mouse cells a human gene - known as
Decay Accelerating Factor (Daf) - which regulates complement activity. This
protects the mouse from being destroyed by human complement.
By transferring this technology to a clinically useful animal, White hopes
to produce a transgenic pig. Its organs could be more successfully
transplanted since rejection is less likely to occur. Once the graft is in
place, animal models have demonstrated that it stands an increased chance of
success.
'If you consider that in markets such as India where kidneys are bought and
sold (the recipient pays more than Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 10,000) of which
the middleman gets about Dollars 10,000 and the donor between Dollars
5,000-Dollars 7,000), this puts pigs into a very high-value bracket indeed,'
says White.
Some Dollars 1.5m has already been spent on White's research, with finance
raised by the American concern Warburg Pincus. A patent is now pending for
the transgenic technique developed at Cambridge. 'We're just beginning on
the pig, but we have high hopes of success,' White said.
In the US, transgenic pigs are already a reality. Since 1987, a Princeton,
New Jersey company called DNX has been studying the potential of transgenic
pigs as a source of universally compatible organs - specifically kidneys and
hearts.
Some 30 transgenic pigs have so far been produced by DNX, according to Paul
Schmitt, president and chief executive officer. The pigs are able to produce
human haemoglobin, for use in the race for universally compatible,
easily-stored blood substitutes.
However, John Logan, the company's vice president of research, believes that
within 18 months the same patented technology will produce pigs whose organs
will be transplanted into non-human primates. 'We don't want to mislead
people at this stage,' Logan said. 'The days of using pig organs in human
transplantation operations are way off - but I believe they will come.'
DNX has currently raised Dollars 49m through a private placement and an
initial public stock offering. Schmitt believes current market opportunities
includes blood substitutes, drug testing and the donor organ market.
'Transgenic animal technology which is both technically innovative and
cost-effective is the way forward,' he said.
