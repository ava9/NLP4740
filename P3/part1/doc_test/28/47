Call it physiological perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
For Yelena Faynegold, the Soviet Union's policy of political restructuring and 
its easing of emigration restrictions has literally meant a new chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent move to United States enabled her to undergo a kidney transplant 
last week, with the help of her identical twin sister, Dina Vaisberg, who 
donated one of her kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeries were performed by Drs. Rafael and Robert Mendez, who are also 
identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pair Leave Hospital 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the 34-year-old sisters were discharged from St. Vincent Medical 
Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the operations went smoothly and, because of the close 
organ-match between the two, Faynegold's outlook for a normal life is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the sisters credit the changes brought about in the Soviet Union 
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to immigrate now," said Dina's husband, Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Having relatives in the United States and being Jewish also helped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Here for Nine Years 
</P>
<P>
Dina Vaisberg, who now lives in West Hollywood, emigrated nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After a year's wait, Faynegold was allowed to move here five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
If immigration had not been possible, the sisters said, Faynegold's prognosis 
would be much bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in her hometown of Odessa, on the Black Sea, did not diagnose her 
kidney disease, Faynegold said in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
It was an American doctor, based on information she provided her relatives in 
letters, who pinpointed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialist Left Town 
</P>
<P>
When, after much waiting and cajoling, she finally was admitted to a hospital 
in Moscow, the specialist Faynegold saw left the city the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, she recalled, a parade of doctors came by her bed in a crowded 
and dirty ward -- each telling her something different. The hospital's kidney 
dialysis machine was 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet hospitals also held other privations. 
</P>
<P>
"No TV," Faynegold said in English. "No bathrooms."
