The proposed recalibrated DRG relative weights are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed from FY 1993 MedPAR data, received by HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through December 1993, from all hospitals subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective payment system and short-term acute care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals in waiver States. The FY 1993 MedPAR file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes data for approximately 10.5 million Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology used to calculate the proposed DRG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative weights from the FY 1993 MedPAR file is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To the extent possible, all the claims were regrouped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the proposed DRG classification revisions discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above in section II.B of this preamble. As noted in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II.B.4, due to the unavailability of revised GROUPER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software, we simulate most major classification changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximate the placement of cases under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassification. However, there are some changes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be modeled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Charges were standardized to remove the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences in area wage levels, indirect medical education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs, disproportionate share payments, and, for hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Alaska and Hawaii, the applicable cost-of-living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The average standardized charge per DRG was calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by summing the standardized charges for all cases in the DRG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dividing that amount by the number of cases classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the DRG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We then eliminated statistical outliers using the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion as was used in computing the current weights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That is, all cases outside of 3.0 standard deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mean of the log distribution of charges per case for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each DRG were eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The average charge for each DRG was then recomputed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(excluding the statistical outliers) and divided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average standardized charge per case to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relative weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We established the relative weight for heart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transplants (DRG 103) in a manner consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for all other DRGs except that the heart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transplant cases that were used to establish the weight were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those Medicare-approved heart transplant centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have cases in the FY 1993 MedPAR file. Similarly, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited the liver transplant cases that were used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the weight for DRG 480 (Liver Transplant) to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals that are Medicare-approved liver transplant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Acquisition costs for kidney, heart, and liver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transplants continue to be paid on a reasonable cost basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike other excluded costs, the acquisition costs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrated in specific DRGs (DRG 302 (Kidney Transplant); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DRG 103 (Heart Transplant); and DRG 480 (Liver Transplant)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these costs are paid separately from the prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment rate, it is necessary to make an adjustment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the relative weights for these DRGs from including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect of the acquisition costs. Therefore, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracted the acquisition charges from the total charges on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each transplant bill that showed acquisition charges before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing the average charge for the DRG and before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating statistical outliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When we recalibrated the DRG weights for previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cases required to compute a reasonable weight. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to use that same case threshold in recalibrating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DRG weights for FY 1995. Using the FY 1993 MedPAR data set, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are 35 DRGs that contain fewer than 10 cases. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computed the weight for the 35 low-volume DRGs by adjusting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original weights of these DRGs by the percentage change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the average weight of the cases in the remaining DRGs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weights developed according to the methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above, using the proposed DRG classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes, result in an average case weight that is different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the average case weight before recalibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the new weights are normalized by an adjustment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor, so that the average case weight after recalibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is equal to the average case weight before recalibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself neither increases nor decreases total payments under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prospective payment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning with FY 1991, reclassification and recalibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments are neither greater than nor less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate payments that would have been made without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. Although normalization is intended to achieve this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect, equating the average case weight after recalibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the average case weight before recalibration does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily achieve budget neutrality with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate payments to hospitals because payment to hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is affected by factors other than average case weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as discussed in section II.A.4.b. of the Addendum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this proposed rule, we are proposing to make a budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutrality adjustment to assure the requirement of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act is met.
