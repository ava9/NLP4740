In September, when her husband learned that he would probably lose his job as a 
VCR repairman, Kathy Macias thought that her family's incredible string of bad 
luck had run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing else can happen to us this year, because everything bad had 
already happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy, her husband, Juan, and the couple's six young children were looking 
forward to 1991. The new year, they hoped, was sure to bring them better times. 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 was not through with the Macias family. 
</P>
<P>
Just when the family learned about the impending layoff, just when Kathy Macias 
thought that nothing else could go wrong for her family, doctors told Juan that 
he was suffering from a potentially fatal kidney disease, focal 
glomerulosclerosis, that also afflicts his brother. 
</P>
<P>
His employer "told me that I was probably going to lose my job. Then the doctor 
told me that, if I hadn't come in when I did, the disease would have probably 
killed me in six weeks," said Juan. 
</P>
<P>
The disease struck Juan's older brother, Henry, eight years ago. The brothers 
both fell victim to the mysterious illness when they were 32 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Although they both suffered from kidney failure at the same age, Juan said 
doctors are not sure if the disease is hereditary or what its cause is. But 
doctors suspect the disease is inherited from a faulty gene passed on to them 
by their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Juan's illness confirmed their worst fears, said Kathy. He had been having up 
to 30 cramps daily, for several weeks, and complained of chronic fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went to the hospital for tests, I prayed to God that it wasn't kidney 
disease," said Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
The news was especially devastating for Juan because he has only one 
functioning kidney. Two years ago, he donated his right kidney to Henry, who 
lost both kidneys to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his predicament, Juan finds humor in his situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a very exclusive category," he said. "It's really rare for someone to 
donate a kidney and then have a kidney transplant. I'm one of a small number of 
people who can say he's been at both ends. It's an easier operation for the 
recipient." 
</P>
<P>
Juan's illness was only the latest blow to befall the Macias family this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the couple lost their video business and were left with a debt that 
will probably take 20 years to pay. In addition, 4-year-old Brian, who suffers 
from spina bifida and is paralyzed from the chest down, required hip surgery 
this year and was in a body cast for four months. The youngster has a twin 
brother, Paul, who is perfectly healthy. 
</P>
<P>
And, recently, the family's van required some expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"This had already been a tough year for us," said Kathy. "It seems like 
everything has happened to us in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Others might say that her family is facing a bleak Christmas. But Kathy thinks 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably going to be our best Christmas ever," she said. "True, things 
are awfully tough for us. But a lot of people who have heard about our 
situation have been so kind to us. Our Christmas tree was donated to us. The 
staff at Children's Hospital has helped us out with gifts for the kids. A 
teacher helped us out with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Everywhere we 
turned, somebody was helping us. I consider ourselves very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Macias, 32, seemingly unflappable, juggles Brian's thrice-weekly therapy 
sessions at Children's Hospital and Juan's dialysis treatments, also three 
times a week. Each treatment takes three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Their 10-year marriage has been solidified by the crises they have faced, the 
couple said. They met at the old Doctors Hospital, where Kathy worked as a 
nurse's aide. Juan, who was a baseball standout in high school and college, had 
gone to the hospital for an operation on his throwing arm. He said the 
California Angels were going to draft him, until they found out about his 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy conceded that the strength she found to face the challenges confronting 
her family was not always there. A combination of her Catholic faith and family 
support has led her through every crisis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Money remains a problem. The family is living on Juan's disability payments 
from the state, but most of that is eaten up by the $334 health insurance 
payments they have to make every month. They were forced to give up their Mira 
Mesa apartment and move in with Juan's parents in Clairemont, where Juan, his 
brother and two sisters were raised. 
</P>
<P>
"When all of this crashed down on us, I couldn't get a grip. I was feeling 
depressed, because everything was caving in on us," said Kathy. "I don't know 
the reason for all this. We're part of a bigger and grander plan. Everything is 
wrapped around God's purpose." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Juan never lost his optimism. At the beginning of his illness, 
Juan's outlook clashed with Kathy's depression. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few arguments about this," Juan said. "Money was tight. We have six 
children who still depend very much on us. I've always been a very positive 
person. I kept telling Kathy things would work out." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the young couple, the Macias family pulls together in time of 
crisis. Juan's parents, brother and sisters are very close. His parents 
mortgaged their home to help Juan and Kathy start up the video business that 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
When the kidney that Juan donated to Henry failed, a younger sister, Maria, 
promptly donated her kidney to Henry. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry is walking around with three kidneys, and only one is functioning," 
laughed Juan. 
</P>
<P>
When Juan fell victim to the disease, an older sister, Linda Sturtevant, 
offered him one of her kidneys. In a telephone interview from her Moreno Valley 
home, Sturtevant said she has already passed the first battery of tests for a 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never given it a second thought. Doubt never crossed my mind. If I can 
help my brother, I will," said Sturtevant. "I have a great deal of faith. I 
pray every night for guidance and strength." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Macias, an electrical engineer for Bonneville Power in Wennatchee, Wash., 
expressed admiration for his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother has fought an uphill battle. When I became ill, he stepped forward 
without hesitation," said Henry. "When you come close to your losing your life, 
you learn to appreciate life more. My brother gave me a second chance at life, 
and I got a third chance from my sister." 
</P>
<P>
If Sturtevant goes through with the operation, every one of Juan's siblings 
will be left with one functioning kidney. Donors and recipients have become so 
commonplace in the Macias family, that the procedure has led to a family 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family thing," Kathy said. "If you donate a kidney, you get taken 
out for a dinner of steak and lobster. It's not a bad deal, a kidney for steak 
and lobster."
