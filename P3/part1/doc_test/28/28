A 4-year-old Buenaventura, Mexico, boy who was minutes away from a liver 
transplant died before surgeons in Dallas could begin the operation.

<P>
Parents and physicians at Children's Medical Center had been elated but anxious 
when they learned Friday that a liver had been found for Sammy Aguirre, but 
doctors said the boy's condition had seriously deteriorated. The donated liver 
came from a Florida child who was slightly larger than Sammy, said Sammy's 
doctor, Dr. Troy Reyna. The organ was sent to another liver transplant patient, 
hospital spokeswoman Sylvia Bodell said.
