Vicki Lamberton doesn't need prompting to remember the date on which a Denver 
doctor diagnosed a rare medical condition that eventually placed her fate in 
the hands of UC San Diego Medical Center, and a team of specialists that hopes 
to save her life with a heart-lung transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"Feb. 20, 1986. Two, 20, 86," said Lamberton, a 35-year-old Denver resident who 
since has entered the date on countless hospital forms. But Lamberton, the 
mother of two young boys, is awaiting an even more important date: the day when 
a heart-lung donor makes her transplant -- the first such operation in San 
Diego County -- possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting has always been the problem," said Dr. Stuart Jamieson, who heads the 
UCSD transplant team that will perform Lamberton's operation. Waiting is "a 
very risky thing to do, but in these cases there is no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Lamberton, her husband, Vincent, and their two sons are now living at a 
relative's house in Moorpark. "We had a choice of moving straight to San Diego 
or coming here to live with my sister and arrange for air transportation," 
Lamberton said. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of a growing number of people awaiting transplants in San Diego. But 
the lengthening list is not the result of more people getting sick. Rather, San 
Diego is undergoing a boom in the number of transplant programs at area 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, Sharp Memorial Hospital and Scripps Clinic have recently announced or 
opened new transplant programs or expanded services provided by existing 
programs. Those hospitals plan to eventually add new heart, heart-lung, kidney, 
liver and pancreas transplant programs. Mercy Hospital has placed a proposed 
heart transplant program on hold until a chief surgeon is located. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp and UCSD now have a total of nine patients on their heart transplant 
lists. They have three patients awaiting heart-lung transplants and three 
awaiting single lung transplants. UCSD also has 120 patients awaiting kidney 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
There are no liver transplant programs in San Diego, although several hospitals 
are now contemplating them. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have argued that the highly specialized and expensive transplant 
units -- a relatively straightforward heart transplant can cost $100,000 or 
more -- will needlessly boost local health care costs by duplicating services 
available elsewhere. The critics maintain that San Diego's hospitals, in an era 
marked by skyrocketing health costs, should dedicate scarce capital to other, 
more pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Questions have also been raised about whether the new programs can match the 
success rates of the more established surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators in the past have given a variety of reasons for the 
addition of expensive transplant programs. Most claim the programs allow them 
to better serve their patients' overall health needs. Others have acknowledged 
that the programs give hospitals a certain status and greater ability to 
attract top-notch doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Competition among local hospitals that perform major organ transplants moved 
into a new phase last weekend when UCSD became the second local hospital to 
perform a heart transplant. Sharp has been transplanting hearts since 1985. 
UCSD surgeons previously did the transplants through a program based at Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson said that at UCSD, the expanding transplant program plays an integral 
part in the hospital's role as a teaching institution. The program "fits in 
with our reputation for handling difficult cases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the heart transplants are a small part of the total work 
performed by him and other members of the team. During the past week, for 
example, Jamieson performed the heart transplant as well as several open-heart 
surgeries that included a major operation on Roger Revelle, the noted scientist 
and co-founder of UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ron Adamson, co-director of Sharp's transplant program, suggested that 
patients will be better served as the number of transplant centers increases, 
because physicians must spend a hefty amount of time with patients who need 
time-consuming postoperative care. 
</P>
<P>
Health care officials defend the increase in transplant programs by saying that 
San Diego is merely catching up with the growth of such programs elsewhere in 
the country. "San Diego is the sixth-biggest city in the U.S., and most cities 
of its size already have two heart transplant programs," Jamieson said. "Boston 
and Kansas City each have four." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is actually one of the last major metropolitan areas to undergo this 
kind of growth," said James A. Cutler, recently named executive director of the 
Organ and Tissue Acquisition Center in San Diego, which is charged with 
locating and transporting donated organs and tissue in San Diego and Imperial 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Local transplant programs may make the expensive operations available to "the 
majority of people who probably can't afford to manage moving out of town to be 
near a hospital," Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, health insurance rules and a patient's doctor determine where 
transplants are done. Local hospitals accept patients from around the country, 
and San Diegans are not restricted to programs at local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's first heart transplant represented a major step in its planned expansion 
of its existing program, which had been limited to kidneys. Like many 
hospitals, UCSD also transplants corneas, bone and skin tissue. It also 
conducts skin grafts and, several years ago, made an ill-fated attempt to 
perform liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's heart transplant patient, Gary Troxel, a 25-year-old construction worker 
from Riverside County, is "well ahead of schedule" in his recovery, Jamieson 
said late last week. Jamieson moved his transplant team "lock, stock and 
barrel" from the University of Minnesota. In that program, 93% of the patients 
have lived at least three years after their transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, who completed his first heart transplant on July 4, 1979, described 
the operation as "pretty routine . . . but it was strange to be doing this 
operation in an environment (UCSD) where one had not been done before." 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of media activity that accompanied the UCSD transplant contrasts 
with the scene at Sharp, where doctors last week completed their 70th heart 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer hear from the press each time we do an operation," said Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp's heart transplant program has a survival rate beyond the national 
averages, he said. No one has died on the operating table, he said, and 'we 
have . . . a 97% one-year survival rate and an 80% survival rate 4 1/2 years 
later." 
</P>
<P>
While heart transplants today are viewed as a relatively common form of 
therapy, Jamieson and Adamson noted that the next frontier in San Diego -- the 
heart-lung combination -- is a more difficult procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very specialized operation," said Jamieson, who performed his 
first heart-lung transplant in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Survival rates are not as good as heart (transplants), but we're getting 
better all the time," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a strategic move last fall designed to bolster its transplant prowess, Sharp 
announced a joint venture with Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation. The 
two hospitals have agreed to work together to improve Sharp's heart-lung and 
lung transplant capability. In December, Sharp identified its first candidate 
for a heart-lung transplant, Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is in "final negotiations" with a surgeon who will conduct kidney 
transplants, he said. That would place Sharp in competition with UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp's agreement with Scripps also calls for the development of a liver 
transplant program at Scripps' Green Hospital. Both Sharp and UCSD abandoned 
liver transplant programs several years ago after running into difficulties. 
The UCSD liver program is "on hold," according to a UCSD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from experience, getting a new program on track in San Diego can be 
difficult. Mercy, for example, recently put its heart transplant program on 
hold after its newly hired director encountered contractual problems with his 
previous employer. Last year, a proposed heart and lung transplant program at 
Scripps Clinic suffered a setback when federal administrators determined that 
the surgeon hired to do the operations lacked the proper credentials. 
</P>
<P>
It can also take time for a program to mature. Sharp initially announced its 
intention to create a heart-lung transplant program in 1988, but is still 
awaiting an appropriate donor to make the first operation a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 223 kidney transplant programs, 147 heart programs, 79 
liver programs, 74 pancreas programs, 70 heart-lung programs and 55 lung 
programs. A year ago, there were 199 kidney programs, 112 heart, 49 liver, 23 
pancreas, 35 heart-lung and 12 lung. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, nearly 250 people nationwide were awaiting heart-lung 
transplants; about 1,400 needed heart transplants; 844 were awaiting liver 
donations; 101 required new lungs; 320 required pancreas transplants, and 
16,315 needed kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, transplant teams with patients who need immediate care are 
frustrated by a lack of donors. Last year, for the first time, the number of 
heart transplants performed in the United States fell from the previous year's 
total, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is not because the number of centers is down -- the total continues 
to grow -- but (donations) have plateaued out at about 2,000 in the U.S," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that you've got to get the organs or the programs can't 
grow," said Doug Heiney, membership affairs manager for the United Network for 
Organ Sharing, a Washington-based company that oversees nationwide distribution 
of donated organs. "It's a 'chicken-and-egg' situation. If there are no organs 
to supply to the transplant center, you're doomed to failure right from the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, donation rates historically have been below the national average, 
in part because local hospitals were not emphasizing donor recruitment. But 
during 1989, when the county's hospitals placed a renewed emphasis on organ 
recovery, donation rates rose to meet the national average, Cutler said. San 
Diego's transplant community believes that, with additional education programs, 
the local donation rate could exceed the national donation rate during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast organ procurement officials credit Cutler with playing an integral 
role in building an efficient organ procurement program for the Washington 
Regional Transplant Consortium, which distributes organs to six kidney and five 
heart transplant programs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to strengthening San Diego's procurement efforts, OTAC will begin 
crafting the rules that will govern the local transplant community. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, national regulations determine how donated organs are distributed. 
But the local OTAC organization can help tailor rules that are more in keeping 
with San Diego's special needs, Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
He intends to bolster San Diego's procurement effort by making better use of a 
California law that requires hospital personnel to seek donated organs from the 
relatives of someone who dies. Cutler believes that many doctors and nurses 
have not been properly trained to undertake that delicate duty. 
</P>
<P>
"The law shouldn't force you to do something you're uncomfortable with," Cutler 
said. "That's what we're here for. We'll do the asking." 
</P>
<P>
However, OTAC's six staff members are ill-prepared to "go out and educate San 
Diego County's 2.5 million residents" about the need for organ donations, 
Cutler said. For the moment, OTAC is focusing on training the doctors and 
nurses who typically are on duty when donors are near death. 
</P>
<P>
Even transplant teams recognize that organ procurement "is a tough job," 
Adamson said. "Even knowing what I know, it would be a tragic (decision to 
make). . . . I'm certain I would give permission, and I have a donor card 
myself, but it still would not be very easy." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people simply don't understand how much good organ recovery does," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of recipients generated by one donor can be staggering: According to 
OTAC, the donor who contributed the heart to UCSD's first such transplant 
patient also contributed organs that eventually will end up in as many as 35 
different people. 
</P>
<P>
The donors' two corneas went to individual patients, as did the two kidneys. 
Skin was donated to five burn victims, and bone and tissue that is being stored 
will eventually be used to treat as many as 25 other people. 
</P>
<P>
As difficult as it to find suitable hearts for transplants, it is even more 
difficult to find hearts and lungs that can be used in combination, Adamson 
said. Those transplants are doubly difficult because "there are two clocks 
ticking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our recipients can get real sick, and they face a high mortality rate without 
transplants . . . but we also have the problem of donors . . . because there 
are only so many hours between the (donor's death) and the time when lungs will 
go bad." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get many heart-lung" donations, Adamson said. "Because there are so 
many heart recipients waiting, it's just become very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that severe shortage, UCSD's transplant team is also considering a 
single lung transplant for Lamberton, an operation that would relieve some of 
the stress on her heart. "You have to take what you can get," Jamieson said. 
"We can't always wait for a perfect situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lamberton, the mother of boys ages 5 and 8, is aware that heart-lung donors are 
hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that a person has to die for me to get a transplant," she said. "The 
more people I can come in contact with, or who read a story about me, helps. It 
helps other people, too."
