Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was 
discharged from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh 17 days after undergoing a 
second liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old girl from White Settlement, Tex., will remain in the city for 
about two weeks for outpatient treatment, hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon 
said. Stormie received her second liver transplant in a 10-hour operation Feb. 
20. She had undergone a heart-and-liver transplant in 1984. The heart has not 
caused any problems, but she needed a new liver because the first was damaged 
by hepatitis.
