<TEXT>

Abdul Hai, a stocky 34-year-old now in police detention, sells human kidneys 
for a living. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't jailed for dealing in kidneys; the sale of body organs is legal in 
India. Hai was arrested when a kidney donor complained of being mugged after 
refusing to pay Hai a commission. 
</P>
<P>
Hai says he is one of about 100 middlemen who procure kidneys for the ailing 
rich from Bombay's willing poor. 
</P>
<P>
Hai, who worked as a doctor's chauffeur before becoming a kidney broker, said 
he has arranged the sale of 20 kidneys since a surgeon suggested the business 
to him a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People queue up, ready to give away a kidney. You can find such donors 
everywhere," he said in a cellblock interview. 
</P>
<P>
Hai was arrested May 12 after Dhanraj Agarwal, a street vendor, told police 
that two people attacked him and stole almost $2,000 he had been paid for a 
kidney. Agarwal said the attack came minutes after he refused to give Hai a 
commission, according to Police Inspector Appa Sahib Shinde. 
</P>
<P>
"We have detained him only on suspicion of robbery, and it doesn't matter to me 
if he sells 
</P>
<P>
kidneys for a living or not," Shinde said. Hai has denied involvement in the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Hai told a reporter that he charged roughly $95 to $190 for matching donors and 
patients. India requires a kidney donor to officially affirm his desire to 
voluntarily give up a kidney, but before that moment the donor could already 
have collected $1,875 to $3,125 from the recipient, Hai said.

<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Divided 
</P>
<P>
The flourishing kidney trade has sharply divided Indian doctors along ethical 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The world knows that Bombay is a center for buying kidneys. I think it is a 
shame for us to be so notoriously known," said Kisan Mehta, head of the Life 
Foundation, a private group that advocates kidney transplants from cadavers. 
Indian laws prohibit transplants from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"But what is ethics to a man who is dying?" asked Dr. Keshava Chandra Reddy, a 
kidney transplant specialist in Madras. The urologist said he and other 
surgeons from the Pandalai Cardiothoracic Foundation have transplanted 485 
kidneys in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Renal transplants became common in India about seven years ago when the 
anti-rejection drug cyclosporine became available locally. There are no 
official figures on the number of transplants performed in India. But since 
cyclosporine's introduction, at least $7.8 million has changed hands in 
connection with the estimated 4,000 kidney transplants performed in Bombay, 
according to Dr. B. N. Colabawalla, chief of the National Kidney Foundation.
