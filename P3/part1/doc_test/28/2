<P>
Dr. Thomas Starzl was expected to be back seeing patients this week after 
undergoing coronary surgery in the hospital he helped make famous for 
innovative transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old surgeon was released today from Presbyterian-University 
Hospital, where doctors removed a blockage from his right coronary artery. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant at the 
University of Colorado in 1967, was admitted to the hospital Sunday with chest 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl's physician, Dr. Bruce Wilson, ordered an angioplasty, in which a 
catheter was put into the artery and used to inflate a tiny balloon to clear a 
blockage. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing quite well," Wilson, director of the University of Pittsburgh's 
Heart Institute, said at a news conference. "We expect a speedy recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Starzl has worked since 1981 at the University of Pittsburgh hospital, which 
last year performed 463 liver transplants and 210 kidney transplants.
