DOCTOR Muhammed Saeed, 64, stands in the dock of Leeds Crown Court accused
of working illegally as a general practitioner for the past 30 years. The
prosecution alleges that the man had assumed the identity and qualifications
of a 73-year-old Doctor Muhammed Saeed, who qualified with a Batchelor of
Medicine and Surgery degree from the University of Punjab, Lahore, in 1949.
The younger Muhammed Saeed is alleged to have used a duplicate of this
certificate to register with the British General Medical Council in 1961.
Since then, young Saeed has run a surgery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with
3,000 patients. The prosecution alleges that the man was 'bogus' and 'was
running a sub-standard surgery with sub-standard facilities with a low
regard for cleanliness . . . this man is ignorant of medicine and ignorant
of the breadth of medicine available and is capable of many prescribing
errors.'
Only time, and the jury at Leeds Crown Court, will tell whether young Saeed
is guilty or innocent of the charge of deception. It brings to my mind an
earlier and quite different case in which a man far younger even than young
Saeed successfully masqueraded as a surgeon in a National Health Service
hospital. He performed a number of minor operations successfully before he
was detected as a fantasist who had always dreamt of being a surgeon, a
dream nourished by a collection of Emergency Ward 10 videos.
The poor man was defrocked of his white coat, to end up at an institution in
the care of other men in white coats. Were they real doctors? - The coat is
essential to the trick.
On a more mundane level, I recall the antics of a parsimonious friend with a
large appetite who, living near a large hospital, would at lunchtime don a
white coat and walk into the hospital canteen. Naturally, the more often he
went, the less likely it was that he would be challenged.
But Mr Doctor Saeed has been practising 'real' medicine for over 30 years,
without raising suspicion. If, as the prosecution allege, he was not
genuine, then it is the greatest example of a successful placebo test in the
history of medicine, showing that it is not just fake pills that can cure or
treat a patient, but even a fake doctor and a fake surgery.
Nor would this be very surprising. All we require from a GP is a sense of
authority and the hope that he or she will send us to hospital if we are ill
and he has no idea why or with what. The sense of authority comes simply
from the fact that we believe the man actually is a doctor, and if young
Saeed happened to send rather more of his patients to hospital than is
normal, that would be no bad thing. The worst doctors are those who are not
aware of the limits to their own knowledge. The prosecution would claim that
young Saeed was only too well aware.
Paradoxically, the greater the position of authority, the more likely people
are to be fooled or convinced.
I recall a conversation with a political observer of some note in the early
days of the recent General Election campaign - when it was fashionable,
indeed obligatory, to rubbish the Prime Minister.
Major, said this disenchanted observer to me, was a Walter Mitty figure who
had, by some bizarre twist of fate, been propelled from obscurity into the
job of Prime Minister.
The pundit explained it was actually very easy to persuade people that one
really was the Prime Minister, prime ministerial even. One lives at the
right address, and was driven around in the right sort of car, with the
right sort of bodyguards. And one had all the resources of the Civil Service
at one's disposal, to give one a plausible prepared answer to any tricky
questions that might be put. Then the pundit tapped his nose. 'But now Mr
Major must do without his civil servants' - the equivalent of Dr Saeed's
nurse, perhaps 'and once he is all alone on the hustings, the electorate
will suddenly realise that he is not really the Prime Minister after all,
but just Walter Mitty.' Well, they didn't. Which, I suppose the
Labour-voting pundit would argue, shows that you can fool 41 per cent of the
people all the time.
