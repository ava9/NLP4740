<P>
Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was in 
serious condition Wednesday as she battled hepatitis infecting her second 
transplanted liver. 
</P>
<P>
Stormie, 13, of White Settlement, Tex., had been listed in fair condition when 
she was admitted Saturday to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for testing. Her 
condition was downgraded when doctors said the tests confirmed that she had 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
Infectious hepatitis, a viral infection that inflames the liver, had damaged 
her first transplanted liver. It was replaced in February.
