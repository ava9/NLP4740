Navy doctors are performing hundreds of free cosmetic surgeries at taxpayer 
expense on Navy personnel and their families -- a benefit rarely provided by 
private health insurance and specifically prohibited by Veterans Administration 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego alone, 544 free cosmetic operations were performed during the past 
two years. From 1986 to 1989, Navy doctors nationwide performed more than 1,800 
breast augmentations, face lifts, nose jobs, liposuctions and hair transplants 
-- operations that usually cost thousands of dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials say these surgical procedures allow doctors to hone their skills 
and practice their craft in readiness for wartime. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that taxpayers should not foot the bill for military 
personnel to fine-tune their faces and physiques, especially when the 
government is trying to reduce military spending. If the doctors need practice, 
they say, they could help out the many indigent people who need but cannot 
afford reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inappropriate to spend taxpayers' dollars on medical operations that 
essentially are designed to allow people to be more stylish rather than to 
provide real substantive medical benefits," said Rep. Duncan Hunter 
(R-Coronado). "The ability to do a tummy tuck or nose bob is of relatively 
little medical benefit to a surgeon who really does intend to spend time 
working on military-related cases and combat-related cases." 
</P>
<P>
If Navy doctors need practice, Hunter said, they should operate on wounded 
refugees from countries such as Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery has been available to active-duty personnel, their spouses and 
children as well as retired members of the military at San Diego's Naval 
Hospital and three other facilities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Baden, a San Diego Navy dental assistant, had her jaw surgically moved 
forward 6.5 millimeters. Still unhappy with her face, she underwent two nose 
jobs. Finally, in February, 39-year-old Baden, who joined the Navy five years 
ago, had her breasts enlarged. Soon after the last operation, Baden left the 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
All of Baden's operations were performed at the Naval Hospital in Balboa Park 
free of charge, except for the breast implants Baden had to provide for the 
last surgery. Those cost $565, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The nominal price was the main reason she had the work done, Baden said. "I'm 
really pleased with the results. This just did something for my self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"These doctors in the Navy need experience like any other doctor," she added. 
"They appreciate the experience of having people to work on." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, cosmetic surgeries represent 12% of all plastic surgeries 
performed; they also represent almost 6% of all surgeries performed by the 
hospital's ophthalmologists and ear, nose and throat doctors, according to 
statistics obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't whether or not we should be doing cosmetic surgery; my 
position is how much is reasonable. I suggest that 6% is reasonable and 12% is 
appropriate," said Rear Adm. Robert Halder, the commanding officer of the Navy 
Hospital, which has no plastic surgery residency program but does have three 
plastic surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's eight and the Army's 22 plastic surgeons also do "aesthetic 
operations." Air Force doctors performed more than 540 such operations in 1988 
and more than 640 in 1989. Army doctors conducted more than 3,500 cosmetic 
surgeries at about 50 Army hospitals around the world in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Why in the world is an Army doctor doing a nose job? Because it's really 
critical for skills -- an Army doctor can't just sit there and do nothing for 
two years," said Virginia Stephanakis, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army surgeon 
general. "They really have to keep their skills up." 
</P>
<P>
In the civilian world, face lifts can cost as much as $6,000; hair replacements 
and tummy tucks usually go for no more than $5,000, breast augmentation for 
$2,500, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say taxpayers should not have to pay for these surgeries, performed 
solely for vanity. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the hospital and residents' programs want to give young 
doctors experience, but it's absolutely unconscionable that I am paying for 
it," said Dr. Merrel Olesen, a plastic surgeon with the La Jolla Cosmetic 
Surgery Center. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven plastic surgeons are assigned to Navy hospitals in Bethesda, Md., 
Portsmouth, Va., Oakland and San Diego. Three work in San Diego. In 1989, the 
most recent year for which national figures are available, doctors at the four 
facilities performed 173 breast augmentations, 217 face lifts, 187 liposuctions 
and one hair transplant. 
</P>
<P>
To help facilitate the Navy Hospital's fat-removing surgeries, the hospital 
bought two liposuction machines, which cost $3,200 each. One was purchased in 
1988, the other in 1986, said Halder, who added that the hospital would have 
purchased the machines even if doctors did not perform cosmetic surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
In about 98% of the operations, the liposuction machine is used for cosmetic 
procedures, said Cmdr. Scott Barttelbort, chief of the plastic surgery division 
at the Navy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the plastic surgeons are deluged by about 100 requests monthly, 
mostly from women who desire bigger breasts, wrinkle-free faces and smaller 
noses -- in that order, Barttelbort said. About 12% of the 1,138 plastic 
surgery procedures performed in two years beginning March, 1988, were performed 
for aesthetic reasons, said Halder. 
</P>
<P>
Two other departments at the Navy Hospital -- ophthalmology and the ear, nose, 
throat -- also conduct some cosmetic surgeries. During the two years beginning 
in March, 1988, ophthalmologists performed 189 operations to reduce wrinkles 
around the eyes. In the same period, ear, nose and throat physicians performed 
217 cosmetic surgeries, which make up about 5% of their total number of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Veterans Affairs has issued regulations prohibiting such 
surgeries, which are considered elective and non-essential, spokesman Bob 
Stevens said.
