A gravely ill, 22-year-old woman received a liver transplant in San Francisco 
after a frantic search for a donor organ that included the efforts of Olympic 
gold medalist Carl Lewis. Officials feared that they would not find a 
replacement organ in time to save Wendy Marx, who suffers from hepatitis B. But 
with the aid of a public plea from Lewis, the new liver was obtained from an 
accident victim in the East. Lewis, who won six gold medals and a silver medal 
during the last two Olympics, is writing his autobiography with the aid of 
Marx's brother, Jeffrey Marx. The woman was listed in stable condition after 
the transplant operation.
