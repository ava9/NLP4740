Sudden heart rejection caused the death this week of 13-year-old Stormie Jones 
six years after she became the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy results surprised Stormie's doctors at Children's Hospital in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., who said that heart rejection was rare so many years after a 
transplant. The girl needed the transplant because a rare genetic disorder 
prevented her body from processing cholesterol. She is to be buried today in 
her hometown in White Settlement, Tex.
