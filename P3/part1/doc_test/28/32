Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation did its third liver transplant 
overnight Tuesday, on a 49-year-old San Diego man. 
</P>
<P>
The six-hour surgery on the man, who declined to be identified, began about 6 
p.m. Tuesday, a Scripps spokeswoman said. He needed a new liver because of a 
condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening and inflammation 
of the bile ducts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Whittier woman who underwent a liver transplant at Scripps last 
Friday was upgraded earlier this week to serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Those two transplants followed the July death of the first person to undergo 
the operation in Scripps' new program.
