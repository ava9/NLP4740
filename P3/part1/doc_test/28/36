A desperately ill nurse from Laguna Hills was reported in critical but stable 
condition on Wednesday after surgeons at UC San Diego Medical Center completed 
the first combination heart-lung transplant ever attempted in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Renee Williams, 34, a registered nurse at Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center in Laguna Hills, "should be able to lead a normal life" if her recovery 
continues smoothly, Dr. Paul Jagger, a medical center spokesman, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was hospitalized in January for treatment of a relatively rare, 
congenital heart defect that had caused severe and irreversible damage to her 
lungs. "It's safe to say that she had less than a year to live," Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with her progress," Jagger said. "Things went very smoothly 
for the first procedure (of this type) here. . . . Oxygenation (of the lungs) 
is excellent as . . . (are) cardiac functions." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors began the complex, five-hour operation late Tuesday night and completed 
it early Wednesday morning, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams on Wednesday "regained consciousness for a time and she was aware that 
she'd had the operation," according to a family friend. "Her doctors were 
ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was scheduled to remain in the recovery room for about 24 hours, 
will stay in an intensive care ward for at least a week, and be hospitalized 
for several more weeks, Jagger said. She will remain on a "continuous 
medication program" that is designed to keep her body's immune system from 
rejecting the transplanted organs, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 31 hospitals are conducting heart-lung transplants. More than 800 
of the operations have been conducted worldwide. Medical centers at UCSD, 
Stanford and UCLA are the only California institutions to have completed 
heart-lung transplants. Cedar-Sinai Hospital and St. Vincent Medical Center in 
Los Angeles area have completed lung transplants but have not done combination 
heart-lung transplants. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's surgery team was led by Dr. Stuart W. Jamieson, who has directed or 
performed more than 50 heart-lung transplants while working at other 
facilities, Jagger said. Jamieson and his transplant team moved to UCSD last 
July from the Minnesota Heart and Lung Institute. The transplant team includes 
Drs. Michael P. Kaye, Jolene M. Kriett and Riyad Y. Tarazi, and clinical nurse 
specialists Ann Hayden and Rebecca Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, survival rates for patients who have undergone heart-lung 
transplants average about 60%, Jagger said. Jamieson's patients at the 
Minnesota facility have a 75% survival rate, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was one of three patients awaiting heart-lung transplants at San Diego 
hospitals. Both UCSD and Sharp Hospital recently created teams capable of 
performing heart-lung and lung transplants. UCSD also has several patients 
awaiting lung transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was placed on the heart-lung transplant list in January. Last October 
she was diagnosed as having Eisenmenger's syndrome, a rare, congenital heart 
defect that ruins the lungs. A hole between the two chambers of her heart 
caused it to pump harder than usual, creating pressure that was gradually 
destroying her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Jagger said Eisenmenger's syndrome is "almost always" diagnosed in infancy or 
early childhood. At that point it is possible to repair the heart and avoid 
irreversible damage to the patient's lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Because combination heart-lung donors are extremely rare, Williams' physicians 
were ready to perform a complex operation involving the repair of Williams' 
heart and the transplantation of a single lung, which is easier to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping that we could get (at least) one lung, (but) we had the 
opportunity to get two lungs and a heart to go with it," Jagger said. "If only 
one lung had become available we would have tried to repair the congenital 
defect in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials on Wednesday declined to divulge any details about the donor. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, which cost about $150,000, was not covered by Williams' medical 
insurance policy, according to Michael Stringer, director of UCSD's hospitals 
and clinics. However, Williams' family, friends and co-workers are sponsoring a 
fund-raising campaign that, with matching funds from Saddleback Memorial, has 
collected $118,000. The medical center is "committed to cover any difference 
that remains," Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Gary Troxel, who just weeks earlier became UCSD's first heart 
transplant patient, was released on Wednesday morning. Troxel, a 25-year-old 
construction worker from Riverside County, is in good condition following the 
Feb. 26 operation, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an important day for San Diego and the region," Stringer said. "It 
represents the availability of an important new medical program for critically 
ill patients." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's transplant program now includes hearts, heart-lung combinations, lungs, 
corneas and bone marrow, Stringer said.
