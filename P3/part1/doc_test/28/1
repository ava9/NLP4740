In the nation's first liver transplant from a living donor, surgeons at the 
University of Chicago Medical Center on Monday removed a section of the organ 
from an elementary school teacher from Texas and transplanted it into her 
21-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter F. Whitington, director of the university's pediatric liver 
transplant program, said physicians would not know until today if the tissue 
taken from Teresa A. Smith's liver was "functioning" in the body of her 
daughter, Alyssa. The child was in "critical but stable" condition at the 
conclusion of about eight hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's spleen, an important circulatory and immune system organ, ruptured 
while liver tissue was being taken and had to be removed. She was also in 
"critical, but stable" condition. Without a spleen, she will be at increased 
risk of suffering serious bacterial infections for the rest of her life, but 
she is expected to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The liver is a complex organ that performs dozens of vital functions such as 
detoxifying potentially harmful substances and processing sugar, proteins, fats 
and bile. 
</P>
<P>
Transplanting livers from live donors, which has been performed several times 
in other countries, is likely to spark controversy in the United States because 
it requires that the potential risks to a parent or other family member, 
including major complications or death, be balanced against the potential 
benefits to a young child, who might die if a dead liver donor could not be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons and medical ethicists emphasized that the risks to the donor from the 
experimental surgery were substantially greater than those of donating a kidney 
or bone marrow, which are common medical procedures. "There is a quantum 
difference (in difficulty)," said Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil, the chief liver 
transplant surgeon at the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, unlike kidney and bone marrow transplants, there is a dearth of 
medical evidence that liver tissue from a related donor is more likely to 
function in the long term than tissue harvested from a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
The potential risks of the surgery were underscored by the rupture of the 
mother's spleen. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't expect a problem with the spleen," Whitington told 
reporters " . . . I don't believe this was a matter of nerves or jitters. This 
sometimes happens." The fragile organ is next to the left lobe of the liver, 
which was the section of liver removed from the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, who live in Schertz, Tex., near San Antonio, were not available 
for comment. But the mother said in an interview Oct. 25, made available by 
medical center officials, that she and her husband "both felt comfortable with 
the idea of donating. It was an obvious decision for me. Once you've given 
someone a big piece of your heart, it's easy to throw in a little bit of 
liver." 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for the pioneering surgery was established through a series of 
recent articles in medical journals and widespread discussions at the medical 
center. University surgeons and ethicists have argued that the shortage of 
organs from cadavers justifies offering the option of liver donation to 
parents. To safeguard prospective donors, they established a detailed medical, 
ethical and psychiatric review process. 
</P>
<P>
Similar surgery has been performed in Brazil in December, 1988, in Australia in 
August and in Japan earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
While some liver transplants physicians and ethicists gave the University of 
Chicago program a cautious endorsement, others questioned whether it was 
possible to obtain "informed consent" for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"The major ethical dilemma is whether the critical organ shortage justifies the 
risk to the mother," said Dr. John Lake, the medical director of the liver 
transplant program at UC San Francisco. This "is a true ethical dilemma that is 
unresolved in most people's minds.. . . Most programs are going to see what the 
experience is at the University of Chicago before embarking on this procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christoph Broelsch, chief of the liver surgery service at the University of 
Chicago, has pioneered techniques for using segments of livers from dead 
donors. This allows the liver to be used for two recipients, such as a child 
and an adult, or two infants, or to be cut down to fit a smaller recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Broelsch's teams also removes part of the liver from patients to treat liver 
tumors. In the last 35 such cases at the university, there have been "no major 
complications," such as serious bleeding or infections, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After a portion of the liver is removed, the remaining tissue can regenerate. 
But it is more difficult to remove a segment of the liver from a live donor 
than from either a tumor patient or a cadaver. This is because the function of 
the liver that is removed and the part that remains must be carefully 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa Smith was born with biliary atresia, a lack of development of the bile 
ducts, which is the most common cause of liver failure in children. Her parents 
first brought her to the University of Chicago in November, 1988, according to 
medical center officials. 
</P>
<P>
After a medical evaluation, Alyssa's name was entered on the national waiting 
list for liver transplants and the family returned to Texas. A potential liver 
became available in July but it was damaged and could not be used. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Whitington contacted the family to see if they were interested in 
the living donor program, medical center officials said. The parents, after 
learning that their insurance company would cover the experimental procedure, 
agreed to go forward. Both parents were evaluated, but the mother was selected 
based on "size" considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed while the child was "pretty healthy," Whitington 
said. This was to maximize the chances that the surgery would succeed and to 
minimize the pressure on the parents to donate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are very strong people and I admire them for their willingness to 
step forward first," Whitington said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
From 25% and 50% of infants needing liver transplants die while awaiting the 
procedure, according to some estimates. But other medical experts said these 
figures were overstated. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Busuttil said the comparable figure at UCLA, one of the busiest 
pediatric liver transplant centers in the world, was about 10%. "If I had a 
small child that needed a liver desperately, I would be able to find a (larger) 
donor and would cut down that liver before I would consider taking a segment of 
a relative's liver and putting it into the child." 
</P>
<P>
The policy at the University of Pittsburgh, the busiest pediatric liver 
transplant center, is not to perform liver transplants using live donors 
because of concerns about the risks to the donors, said Dr. Joel Frader, a 
pediatrician and medical ethicist at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 727 Americans were on waiting lists for liver transplants, 
including 138 children age 5 or younger, according to the United Network for 
Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va. In 1988, 1,680 liver transplants were performed 
in the United States. The average wait for the transplant was about two months.

LIVER TRANSPLANT FROM A LIVING DONOR 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at the University of Chicago on Monday removed the left lobe of the 
liver from Teresa Smith, 29, of Schertz, Tex., so that it could be transplanted 
into her 19-month-old daughter, Alyssa. Alyssa has biliary atresia, a severe 
and usually fatal childhood liver disease. The surgeons also had to remove the 
mother's spleen, which ruptured during the surgery.
