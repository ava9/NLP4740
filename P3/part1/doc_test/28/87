Neuro-: Life on the Frontlines of Brain Surgery and Neurological Medicine by 
David Noonan (Simon and Schuster: $19.95; 233 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The human brain is the most distinguishing part of our body, the most 
fascinating, and probably the least understood. Unlike the other organs, the 
brain's product -- mind -- cannot be directly observed. The pancreas secretes 
insulin; does the brain secrete thoughts? If so, where are they? 
</P>
<P>
The link between brain and mind is very poorly understood. Yet doctors who 
treat the brain organically -- neurologists and neurosurgeons -- are frequently 
able to help their patients. "Neuro-" by David Noonan is the story of who they 
are and how they do it. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan, a Los Angeles writer, approaches his subject from the doctors' point of 
view and from the patients'. The chapters on brain surgery and brain surgeons 
are the best. To do research for them, he interviewed the surgeons and observed 
them at work. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The brain exposed. Light falls on its gleaming surface for the first time. It 
beats lightly, steadily. It is pink and gray, the brain, and covered with tiny 
blood vessels, in a web. In some openings you can see the curve of the brain, 
its roundness. It does not look strong, it looks very soft, soft enough for you 
to push your finger through. When you see it for the first time, you almost 
expect sparks arcing across the surface of the cortex, blinking lights, the 
crackle of an idea. You stare down at it, and it gives nothing back, reveals 
nothing, gives no hint of how it works." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident Practitioners 
</P>
<P>
The reader learns that practitioners in this field are supremely confident of 
their knowledge and their skills and their ability to make the right decisions 
in difficult situations. "Brain surgeons cut people's heads open," Noonan 
writes. A simple but startling statement. 
</P>
<P>
He has great affection and admiration for these doctors who do this work, and 
that comes through loud and clear. He is also aware of the difficult and 
unusual position that doctors -- particularly surgeons -- are in. Noonan is 
very perceptive about this. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons must care about their patients, but they cannot become emotionally 
involved with them. The patient's condition is part of the job, and it must 
always remain part of the job: 
</P>
<P>
"What is all new and strange to the patients and his family is old and familiar 
to the surgeon," Noonan writes. "The patient rightly considers his brain tumor 
to be the most important brain tumor that ever existed, while the doctor knows 
that the patient's brain tumor is one of many a doctor will have to confront 
over the course of his career." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neurological Problems 
</P>
<P>
While the first half of the book deals with doctors and patients and the 
relationship between the two, the second half deals in detail with three 
serious neurological problems: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's 
disease), which affects movement; aphasia, which affects speech, and 
schizophrenia, which affects thought. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the book is less successful than the first. It has a padded 
feeling. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, contains an extended 
discussion of Lou Gehrig's baseball career. The chapter on schizophrenia 
includes a seemingly endless diatribe against frontal lobotomies, which were 
extensively performed in this country from 1935 to 1960 as a treatment for 
mental illness. These chapters are more descriptions of diseases than "life on 
the frontlines of brain surgery and neurological medicine," which, after all, 
is the subtitle of the book. 
</P>
<P>
But they do have some value. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease includes a 
profile of Lance Meagher, a physician who has lived with ALS for 13 years and, 
though virtually paralyzed, continues in limited practice and is making plans 
to fly solo around the world. Meagher is probably the most interesting person 
Noonan presents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing the Soul 
</P>
<P>
At the very end of the book, in a short chapter appropriately titled 
"Conclusion," Noonan voices his only reservations about the doctors who work on 
the brain. By restricting their activity to the flesh, he says, they are 
missing the soul. Doctors treat the body but not the mind. Emotions are more 
than the sum total of complicated electrochemical firings in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Noonan says, "love is a chemical reaction, but there is more to it than 
that. There is, I believe, something beyond biology, and it is a factor, 
somehow, in the function of every living human cell and in every human thought 
and deed. In a sense, the human nervous system is a complex set of conditions 
necessary for the existence of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
This assertion, on the book's penultimate page, comes out of the blue. It does 
not follow from what has come before, and Noonan has hardly raised the 
question, much less prepared the reader for his conclusion.
