SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: FALLBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kim Hughes, the Fallbrook woman who waited more than five months on a donor 
organ list for a new liver, was listed in critical but stable condition at UCLA 
Medical Center Friday after transplant surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated, 11 1/2-hour liver transplant concluded about 5 a.m. and seemed 
to go well, hospital spokesman Mike Byrne said. Ronald W. Busuttil, director of 
the UCLA liver transplant program, performed the operation that involved 
removing Hughes' liver, pancreas and part of her stomach before putting in the 
new liver. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 21, was diagnosed with cancer in 1986. A rare, slow-growing tumor in 
her pancreas invaded the liver, and in February she was placed on a donor 
waiting list for a liver. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons did not replace Hughes' pancreas, Byrne said. Unless it is replaced 
later, Hughes will be dependent on medication for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are closely monitoring Hughes for signs of rejection and infection, 
Byrne said. Hughes could be out of the hospital in six weeks.
