  [Editorial Report] A Russian academician has publicly 
denied a Canadian film's charges that he offered human organs 
for sale. A Russian press report gives detailed explanations 
why the accusations are medically and logistically improbable. 
  In a KOMMERSANT-DAILY article (23 Nov 93), Academician 
Valeriy Shumakov, the director of the Public Health Ministry's 
Scientific Research Institute for Transplantology and Artificial 
Organs, denies a Canadian film's claims that he offered human 
body parts for export. Shumakov calls the allegations an attempt 
to discredit Russian transplant specialists, who are beginning 
to attract patients from Europe. 
  The film "Body Parts Business," which was broadcast on 
British and Canadian television in November 1993, urges 
international organizations to stop an alleged international 
black market in human body parts. According to a 25 November 
1993 TRUD article, which takes its information from a report in 
the Belgian newspaper LE SOIR, the film alleges that organs 
procured from Russian kidnap victims, corpses in Moscow morgues, 
missing Honduran children, and Argentinian psychiatric patients 
and accident victims are being sold for transplantation or 
cosmetology research. 
  TRUD, seconded by the Moscow newspaper KOMMERSANT-DAILY (23 
November 93), says that the Canadian film describes large-volume 
sales of body parts for hard currency in Russia. Allegedly one 
firm sold 600 kidneys at 20,000 rubles apiece, and a second 
company sold 700 kidneys, hearts, and lungs; 2,000 eyes and 
3,000 pairs of testicles. The film reportedly asserts that most 
of these organs are taken from unclaimed corpses in morgues, but 
some are removed from kidnapped Russians by rings of doctors 
working in well-guarded, secret locations. The contraband 
organs are reportedly shipped out of Sheremetyevo airport under 
forged documents. As reported in the KOMMERSANT-DAILY article, 
the BBC broadcast of the film included allegations by Bernard 
Cohen, director of Eurotransplant, a Netherlands-based 
organization that distributes organs to European transplant 
clinics, that Shumakov offered to sell him Russian organs. 
  Shumakov, an eminent transplant surgeon, USSR State Prize 
laureate, hero of socialist labor, and academician of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, says that the rumor is an 
attempt by "certain forces in the West ... to compromise Russian 
transplantology because the entry of Russian surgeons into the 
international market would inflict significant injury on their 
Western colleagues" (KOMMERSANT-DAILY 23 Nov 93). Shumakov says 
that his institute collaborated for one year with Eurotransplant 
at Cohen's initiative. According to Shumakov, "relations became 
complicated" when the German physicians' association protested 
the possibility of a group of German patients undergoing 
transplant surgery in the Russian Federation (KOMMERSANT-DAILY). 
DER SPIEGEL and other Western publications had previously 
created a "similar scandal," according to Shumakov, who says the 
negative press reports caused a decline in Russian organ 
donations. 
  In KOMMERSANT-DAILY Shumakov denies charges that he 
participated in kidnappings for the purpose of obtaining organs 
from the victims. He admits that he shipped human body parts 
abroad but not vital organs, not for compensation, and only 
after failing to find a suitable Russian recipient. He 
expresses great doubt that such a black market could exist, 
because vital organs taken from morgues are unsuitable for 
transplantation. Organs must be delivered rapidly after 
removal, and "it would practically be necessary to corrupt an 
entire hospital" to conduct the illegal trade. Shumakov says 
his institute's only commercial venture is surgery on foreign 
patients which generates hard currency to finance 
surgery for Russian patients. 
  While the TRUD article relates the film's contents without 
analysis, KOMMERSANT-DAILY accompanies its report with a pair of 
side bars that reinforce Shumakov's denials. In one, Anatoliy 
Sutyko, director of the All-Russian Center for Kidney 
Transplantation states that he has not encountered any 
violations of the law in decades of work in this field and notes 
that the issue of body part thefts did not arise at the Sixth 
European Congress of the Society of Transplantologists, held in 
October in Greece. Sutyko says that donors are selected in 
accordance with Russian Federation Health Ministry instructions, 
which require the formation of a special committee and prohibit 
removal of organs before the heart stops. According to Sutyko, 
creation of a criminal ring would require enlisting some 25 
physicians from a very small group of qualified specialists. He 
further asserts that tissue compatibility testing, which 
involves taking lymphocytes from the spleen, essentially 
eliminates the possibility of anonymous organ donations. A 
second sidebar quotes a Moscow official's assertion that the 
Moscow police have discovered no corpses of missing persons with 
organs removed. It also summarizes the recently enacted Russian 
Federation Law on Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues, 
which prohibits their purchase and sale and requires donor 
consent. 
  Illegal exports of human body parts from former Soviet 
republics have been reported previously in the Russian media. 
According to Shumakov, the accusations against him were 
previously raised on the television program "Black Box" and 
circulated in the press for two or three years. A 27 April 1993 
TRUD article reported that the Kherson Center for Scientific and 
Technical Services in Ukraine sent 655 kilograms of human bones 
and muscles to Flark Medical, Inc. in Miami Beach during a 
two-month period in 1992. The exports came to light when 
Ukrainian customs officials inspected one of the enterprise's 
shipments and found the export license suspicious. Issued by 
Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister L. Steshenko in 1991 
for 1000 transplants worth $600,000, the license not only lacked 
the required signatures, originator's name, and specific 
consignee address but also listed a Russian customs office, 
Sheremetyevo. Legal specialists say the license is invalid 
because human transplants are not subject to licensing under 
Ukrainian law. In the judgement of an oblast public 
prosecutor's office representative, who is quoted in the 
article, the export scheme was apparently developed to take 
advantage of the lack of a Ukrainian law on transplants. 
  Other reports of organ exports from former Soviet republics 
have appeared in the foreign press. The HONG KONG CHRONICLE 
alleged that Armenians have been smuggling kidneys to Hong Kong 
(Baku TURAN 25 Nov 93). The Poznan newspaper WPROST (23 August 
92) claims that the Ukrainian "mafia" smuggles transplants to 
the West via Poland.
