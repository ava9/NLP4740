Oksana Hural had never been to the United States before, but since arriving in 
Orange County this week, the 19-year-old Argentinian's view of America has been 
limited to hospital rooms, examination tables and laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hural is set to undergo a bone marrow transplant at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Orange on Tuesday. Her doctors have said that the transplant is the only cure 
for her three-year bout with leukemia. After the operation, Hural will spend 
three to six weeks in the hospital and another month here as an outpatient, 
said her doctor, Winston Ho. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she wants to go to Disneyland when this is all over with, but until 
then, she has to take it very easy," said Maria Perez, a fellow Argentinian who 
is caring for Hural at her San Clemente home. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a member of the San Clemente Sister City Assn., has led a countywide 
fund-raising drive for Hural's hospitalization and medical expenses. Ho is 
performing the transplant for free. 
</P>
<P>
So far, $50,000 in donations has been received, including a $10,000 grant from 
the Buena Park Firefighters' Assn. The money came from a trust fund for an 
18-year-old Buena Park girl, Noemi Serrano, who died before receiving a heart 
and lung transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Perez started the drive in April after residents of San Clemente's sister city 
in Argentina, San Clemente del Tuyu, wrote asking for help for Hural. The 
letter explained that Hural's mother was dead, her father was ill and the tiny 
village had exhausted all of its charitable resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Argentina is very poor. They're in need of everything," Perez said. "The 
doctors there just can't do this kind of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Hural will undergo an "auto-transplant," an operation using her own bone marrow 
rather than that of a donor. On Friday, doctors removed a bone marrow specimen, 
leaving small lesions on Hural's collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared at all," said Hural, who speaks only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The thin, pale teen-ager was once given one month to live by her Argentinian 
doctors, but chemotherapy treatments and medicine have since put her disease 
into remission. 
</P>
<P>
But Hural credits her family for seeing her through her illness. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister came to give me strength," Hural explained, holding tightly to the 
hand of her 23-year-old sister, Maria, who accompanied her on the long plane 
ride from Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
If the transplant is successful, Hural said she hopes to return to Argentina, 
finish her remaining three years of high school and attend college. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very grateful to everyone here who has helped me," she said. "But I am 
very homesick." CHERYLANNE BEALER
