Rayola Petersen's life hung in the balance. Comatose and suffering from 
multiple organ failure when she was admitted to Irvine Medical Center, doctors 
said that she needed a liver transplant to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But Petersen, 57, had no private health insurance, and though she was covered 
for a variety of illnesses under the county's Indigent Medical Services plan, 
that program does not pay for liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Dr. Jahangir Ahdout, an internist at Irvine Medical Center, 
intervened on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the liver, she was dead," he said Monday. "She wouldn't have had any 
chance of survival." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks mainly to his efforts and persistence, medical center officials say, the 
story has a happy ending. After three days of telephoning physicians, hospitals 
and state health insurance officials around the state pleading his patient's 
case, Ahdout obtained a Medi-Cal identification number for Petersen, enabling 
her to qualify for state health insurance and consequently gain admittance to 
Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is now awaiting surgery at one of the few facilities in the state with 
an open bed for a liver-transplant patient. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of this to happen in three days is amazing with all of the 
bureaucratic stuff they had to go through," said Stacey Griffin, a medical 
center public relations spokesperson. "There was a 99% chance she would die the 
next day when she was first brought into Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
When Petersen was admitted to the hospital Oct. 1, she was eligible for 
Medi-Cal, a state insurance plan that serves the poor and elderly. But the 
process of obtaining an identification number can take several months through 
normal channels. In the meantime, her doctor feared, Petersen could die. 
</P>
<P>
Ahdout personally telephoned physicians, hospitals and state health insurance 
officials, pleading the urgency of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"They (hospitals) said, 'There is no way we're going to take this patient 
without a medical (ID) number,' " Ahdout said. "I was spending 10 to 15 hours a 
day on this patient, nights and days. I was coming home and getting on the 
phone to different medical offices and physicians to make them accept the 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 4 p.m. Thursday, Petersen received her Medi-Cal identification 
number and within 20 minutes was on her way to San Francisco.
