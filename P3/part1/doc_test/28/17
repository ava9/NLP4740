<TEXT>
<P>
Stormie Jones, who made medical history in 1984 when she became the world's 
first heart-liver transplant recipient, was in fair condition today at a 
hospital where she is undergoing tests. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh have been evaluating the girl for 
several days. Stormie flew to Pittsburgh from the Ft. Worth suburb of White 
Settlement, Tex., on Saturday night. Doctors were concerned that she might be 
rejecting a second liver she received earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old reportedly has been experiencing fatigue and a change in her 
liver enzyme levels. She suffered a mild episode of liver rejection last month 
and went to Pittsburgh for tests. Doctors adjusted her anti-rejection 
medication.
