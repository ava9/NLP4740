</HEADLINE>

A jetliner carrying fans and parents of players from Eastview Little League of 
San Pedro to the Little League World Series made an emergency landing in 
Cleveland on Tuesday afternoon because of a pressurization problem in the cargo 
hold.

<P>
Continental Flight 254, which originated in Los Angeles as Flight 1272, had 
stopped in Cleveland and was en route to Philadelphia when the pilot told 
passengers that he was returning to Cleveland. According to Kris Lusic, wife of 
San Pedro Coach Nick Lusic, about 17 people headed to Williamsport, Pa., to see 
the team's first-round game were aboard.

"Nobody panicked," Kris Lusic said, although emergency vehicles on the ground 
met the plane upon its return with lights flashing.
