ARTS ADMINISTRATORS: THE COST OF CALLING THE TUNES 
</P>

Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and 
his wife, Judith O'Dea Morr, the center's general manager, are among the 
highest-paid administrators of multipurpose arts facilities in the nation, with 
combined compensation and benefits of more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Individually as well as collectively, Kendrick and Morr's paychecks and other 
compensations rank just behind those of the two highest-paid administrators at 
New York's Lincoln Center and ahead of those at the Music Center of Los Angeles 
County and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, 
according to a survey by the Times' Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
This is despite the fact that of the seven facilities surveyed, the Orange 
County center has the fewest stages and ranks near the bottom of the list in 
the number of paid, ticketed performances per season and the number of 
full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
Francis L. Dale, who served until June of 1988 as president of the Los Angeles 
Music Center, was listed as earning $175,000 a year with no benefits package, 
according to the most recent information filed with the California Registry of 
Charitable Trusts in Sacramento. Esther Wachtell, who served as executive vice 
president until she succeeded Dale, was listed at $75,000 a year. She has been 
replaced in that position by James Black, whose salary is not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr say they are fairly compensated, and center board members say 
that at the amount Kendrick and Morr are paid, they are a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Information filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the California Registry 
of Charitable Trusts, required for all tax-exempt organizations, indicates that 
Kendrick was paid $184,246 in 1988 and received a benefits package worth an 
additional $6,543, primarily for an annuity plan. Morr, who came to Orange 
County with Kendrick from Washington, where both worked as top administrators 
at the Kennedy Center for nearly a decade, is the second-highest-paid staff 
member at the Orange County center, reporting earnings of $108,678 and a 
benefits package of $3,749 for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the centers surveyed, none of the job descriptions for the top two 
administrative slots precisely mirrored Kendrick and Morr's. In principle, all 
chief executives are responsible for everything that goes on in their 
institutions. But according to Kendrick, this is almost literally true for 
himself and Morr in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the other executives surveyed, Kendrick said, the couple is 
responsible for day-to-day programming, administration, coordination with such 
regional groups as the Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific, finance and budget 
controls, construction planning and supervision, marketing and media relations. 
(This despite their staff that includes a director of marketing, a director of 
development and a controller.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on the couple's list of responsibilities is fund raising, which now means 
presiding over a greatly expanded development department and an ambitious 
capital campaign to construct new theaters. 
</P>
<P>
At Lincoln Center, although the operating budget is more than twice that of the 
Orange County center, president Nathan Leventhal is primarily responsible for 
day-to-day operations of the six-theater complex. Leventhal earned $205,865 and 
received a benefits package of $20,785 in 1988 for a total of $226,650, 
according to documents filed with the State of New York. Financing is handled 
by Donald Warner, one of the center's six vice presidents and the 
second-highest paid administrator, who earned $108,765 and received benefits 
worth $14,750, totaling $123,515. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Davidson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, oversees programming, 
fund-raising and administration. He is paid $125,000 per year and provided with 
a car, according to Laura Longley, the center's director of public affairs. He 
succeeded Roger Stevens, who took no salary. Much of the actual programming is 
done by Marta Istomin, the center's artistic director, whose 1988 salary has 
not yet been filed with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The two administrators who come closest to Kendrick and Morr in the range of 
day-to-day responsibilities are Lawrence J. Wilker and Art Falco at Playhouse 
Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their combined compensation for 1988 was 
$213,230 -- $89,986 less than Kendrick and Morr's combined total. 
</P>
<P>
But the size of the compensation packages is misleading, Kendrick and Morr said 
in separate interviews, because the figures encompass such things as pro-rated 
moving and housing compensation and "significant" out-of-pocket contributions 
to disability, health and retirement plans to maintain the generous level of 
coverage they were provided at the Kennedy Center (but which is no longer 
provided to administrators there). 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're fairly paid," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morr said that she, too, is "quite comfortable with my level of compensation." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't move here for pay," but for the challenge of building and shaping a 
new institution, Kendrick added. He also said he prefers to be judged "on the 
basis of the jobs we were brought here to do, and the jobs we have done." 
</P>
<P>
On that basis, Center board members agree that the couple's compensation is not 
out of line. 
</P>
<P>
By many standards used to judge such facilities, center officials and board 
members said, the center is a success: it has reached what they consider to be 
"full bookings" three years ahead of schedule (center officials say that 
virtually every day not taken up by one of 266 events this year is needed for 
load-in/load-out time); more than 640,000 people attended performances in 1988, 
compared to 607,000 in 1987; paid attendance for events programmed by Kendrick 
and Morr (as opposed to booked into the center by others) was 85%, 20 points 
above the national average; and paid attendance for all performances since the 
center's opening has been 80%, also well above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
"At almost any price, they're a bargain," agreed Roger Johnson, head of Western 
Digital Co. of Irvine and the Center's vice chairman for the corporate 
campaign. "They came to a brand-new area with a brand-new facility. I don't 
think anything speaks better than the end result," in terms of paid attendance 
and the quality of the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Center chairman Henry Segerstrom, whose fortune was based in part on 
agriculture, said that comparing Kendrick and Morr's compensation to those of 
other arts center heads is like comparing "apples to apricots." For one thing, 
lower salaries in Cleveland may go a lot further than higher ones in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Differences are especially pronounced, Segerstrom said, between a facility such 
as the Orange County center, which depends entirely on private funding, and 
those that receive a large segment of financial support from government. 
</P>
<P>
In order to judge the cost effectiveness of Kendrick and Morr's compensation, 
"you have to look at the total executive payroll," Johnson agreed. "We are not 
terribly heavy on staff at the center." 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to Kendrick and Morr, the Orange County center reported 
that 27 other employees earned more than $30,000 in 1988. The Los Angeles Music 
Center listed only 11 in that pay range. The corresponding figures at other 
centers ranged from 2 at the Wortham Center in Houston to 106 at Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find an exact comparison for the $73-million Orange County 
center, which has one stage -- Segerstrom Hall -- and 65 full-time employees. 
The current annual budget is $15.4 million. Apart from its tax-exempt status, 
the center has no governmental support. There were 266 paid, ticketed 
performances in 1988 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
A county facility with three halls, the Los Angeles Music Center has 400 
employees and operates on $75 million a year. There were 976 paid, ticketed 
performances at the Music Center during the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr also are, by far, the highest-paid arts administrators in 
Orange County, according to information provided to the IRS. David Emmes and 
Martin Benson, the founders and artistic directors of the South Coast Repertory 
Theatre, earn $65,000 each; Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific 
Symphony, earns $67,000, and Kevin Consey of Newport Harbor Art Museum earns 
$85,000.
