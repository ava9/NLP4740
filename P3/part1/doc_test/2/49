Singer-author Barry Sadler, who wrote the No. 1 hit "Ballad of the Green 
Berets," left a hospital where he was being treated for brain damage and is 
believed to be staying with friends, a lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and mother claim he is incompetent and 
should be place under guardianship. His 24-year-old son on Tuesday was named 
temporary guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler, 48, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at his home in 
Guatemala City in September and lost 30% of his brain, said Hal Hardin, an 
attorney for Sadler's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he's lucid, sometimes he's not. Sometimes he's conversant, sometimes 
he's no," Hardin said, adding that Sadler is partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler was discharged Sunday night from a Veterans Administration Hospital in 
Cleveland and was reported missing by his family.
