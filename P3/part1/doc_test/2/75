  [Excerpt] In the conflict over President Klestil's private 
life, the fronts were clear on Tuesday [25 January]. According 
to a statement issued by the President's Office, Klestil will 
remain separated from his wife Edith and will carry out his 
official duties without her. 
  Envoy Margot Loeffler, who holds a leading position in the 
Office of the President -- she is involved in the president's 
private problems because of her close relationship with the 
president -- has submitted a request to Foreign Minister Alois 
Mock for a transfer abroad at the earliest opportunity. 
  According to the President's Office, the president's 
decision 
to remain separated from his wife was preceded by efforts to 
clarify the situation with his wife in the presence of his 
children living in Austria. Much to his regret, Klestil had 
reached the conclusion that the couple will remain separated, he 
announced. 
  Klestil regretted Loeffler's plan to leave the President's 
Office, referring to her achievements in reorganizing it.
