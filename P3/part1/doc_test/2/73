FAYETTE, Iowa

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a Bolger Drive in town. A smiling Bolger portrait in City Hall. And, 
unlikely as it seems, a Bolger beach amid the cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
But the name doesn't belong to a founding father or local hero. Bolger wasn't 
born here. He has never even lived here. 
</P>
<P>
So who is he? 
</P>
<P>
In Wall Street circles, David Bolger is a wealthy investment banker. In 
Fayette, Iowa, he's a guardian angel. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of feels we're his adopted community. And we've adopted him," says 
former Mayor Roy Karlson. 
</P>
<P>
Bolger and some friends and clients have donated to Fayette the ownership of 
part or virtually all of some 20 properties, ranging from a can factory to a 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has brought Fayette hundreds of thousands of dollars that have 
helped build a new city hall, expand utilities and buy a street sweeper, 
lights, two ambulances and two police cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cares for Them 
</P>
<P>
"He really understands a small town in the middle of nowhere has needs," 
Karlson says. 
</P>
<P>
"Fayette exemplifies the best of middle America," the New Jersey financier 
says, by way of explanation. "People are hard-working, relatively quiet and 
reserved. The city is of people and by people. . . . They care for each other." 
</P>
<P>
And he cares for them, through a friendship that belongs in a Frank Capra 
movie: big-time businessman embraces speck-on-the-map town, spreads greenbacks 
and good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
No strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
When Fayette got new Main Street lights, thanks to Bolger, flip-of-the-switch 
honors went to his wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
A sandy fun-in-the-sun spot in corn country? Bolger paid to bulldoze a 
riverbank area, and Bernard "Scorch" Pattison, the grain and feed mill owner, 
hauled white silica sand from his company's underground mine to create a beach 
named after -- guess who? 
</P>
<P>
"He gets a kick out of seeing many things happen because of what he's 
contributed," says Mayor Denny Dumermuth, noting that taxes would have to be 
raised or services cut without Bolger. 
</P>
<P>
Fayette needs help: many streets have potholes, houses are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
To Bolger, good deeds are "what my parents taught me to do -- put back in the 
community what you take out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted Home 
</P>
<P>
Bolger, whose Fayette link goes back 25 years, visits occasionally -- sometimes 
by private jet. He eats at Lucy's Garden of Eatin' cafe, chats with Kenny, the 
hardware store owner, and is on a first-name basis with other shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
No corporate pinstripes, no stuffy meetings. Bolger goes fishing or antique 
hunting and sometimes brings back his wife's favorite -- Iowa smoked pork 
chops. 
</P>
<P>
"He works with Wall Street people 350 days a year," explains city attorney 
Charles Hurley. "It's a cutthroat world. He loves to come out here where the 
pace is slower. I think he's doing some good things with his generosity, not 
squandering it on wine, women and song." 
</P>
<P>
Fayette, population 1,500, has made Bolger honorary mayor. His wife is honorary 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Bolger received an award from Upper Iowa University. In the early 
1960s when Bolger worked at a Wall Street securities firm, he arranged 
financing for a dormitory-food service center there. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, the school's lenders called on him when the university was $3 
million in debt. Bolger arranged a refinancing plan, secured loans and canceled 
$1.8 million in long-term mortgages he held on the school. 
</P>
<P>
Starting then, and continuing through the '70s and '80s, Bolger, business 
partners and some clients arranged to donate some 20 commercial properties 
they'd owned and leased to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the offer created "a lot of suspicion" and liability concerns, 
Karlson says. "Small town, big millionaire. Is this real or not?" 
</P>
<P>
But manna from heaven it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was looking for someone to give a charitable gift to," Karlson 
adds. "Thank God it was us." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Fayette received checks including $247,500 for the sale of a 
Michigan retail store and $30,000 for its share in an Ohio shopping center that 
was sold. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Fayette owns the land, in others, the building, too. Bolger 
maintains some ownership of all properties, which include an Illinois can 
factory, a Texas cold storage house and several Cleveland supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say giving property to a municipality is a tax savings -- the donor 
deducts the entire fair market value when the gift is given. But the money 
saved is less than if the property is sold and taxes are paid. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how much money Fayette has received, though Karlson 
estimates that it's more than half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
A committee determines how to spend the "Bolger fund," which in mid-June 
totaled $366,000. The council recently approved a committee recommendation to 
use most of the cash for street renovation, for razing an old sewer plant, for 
an ambulance and for a loan to the local development group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of responsibility," Hurley says. "We want to put it to good 
use. We want to have a nice town in 50 to 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Bolger doesn't participate, saying: "I think it's appropriate the community 
decides what they want. Once I get something together, I pull back." 
</P>
<P>
Bolger, however, did provide $140,000 in long-term financing for Blessing 
Industries, a fast-growing metal fabricating firm. 
</P>
<P>
"What he leaves behind to Fayette is something he's been a part of," says 
Blaine Blessing, the firm's owner. "He wants to . . . make it better for the 
people who are here."
