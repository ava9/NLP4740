  [Text] Washington, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Funeral services 
for former U.S. President Richard Nixon were held at 04:00 p.m. 
local time (23:00 GMT) today at the Nixon Library and birthplace 
in Yorba Linda, Orange County, California. 
  Nixon died in a New York hospital last Friday [22 April] 
night at the age of 81 after suffering a major stroke last 
Friday night. [sentence as received] 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton and four former U.S. presidents, 
Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, along 
with U.S. congressional leaders and senior government officials 
were among the more than 2,000 guests at the service presided 
over by Nixon's life-long friend the Rev. Billy Graham. 
  Among foreign guests from some 88 countries were Chinese 
Vice- Premier Zou Jiahua, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu 
Huaqiu and Chinese ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu 
representing the Chinese Government. They paid tribute to the 
late U.S. statesman, who opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations 
and made important contributions to the improvement and 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  As the service began under cloudy skies, Nixon's mahogany 
casket, draped with two U.S. national flags, was moved to the 
front of the library by ten U.S. soldiers in dress uniforms, 
while the mourners stood to pay tribute. 
  The mourners were then addressed by Nixon's secretary of 
state Henry Kissinger, U.S. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, 
California Governor Pete Wilson and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  In their eulogies, they all recollected Nixon's triumphs and 
crises, and hailed him as a great leader. 
  Dole said that Nixon will be remembered as a great statesman 
of the second half of the 20th century. 
  President Clinton praised Nixon as a leader with a sharp and 
vigilant mind and expressed his gratitude once again for Nixon's 
special counsel on Russia. 
  Following the eulogies, four jet planes flew over the 
library 
where the service was being held. 
  At the end of the 85-minute service, which was the first 
funeral of a former president since Lyndon Johnson in January 
1973, Nixon was laid to rest beside his wife pat, who died of 
lung cancer last June. They are buried in a rose garden a few 
steps from the black tile and whitewall house where Nixon was 
born 81 years ago. 
  The garden was fashioned after the White House Rose Garden 
and his wife of 53 years held it dear; it has more than 100 
varieties of flowers -- pink, red and white. Fittingly, 
burgundy roses named for the former first lady are now in full 
bloom. And one of the roses came from China. 
  Finally, a 21-gun salute was fired to pay tribute to the 
37th 
president, and the two U.S. national flags that had draped the 
casket were folded into triangles and presented to Nixon's two 
daughters. 
  Earlier, funeral service officials said, about 42,000 people 
filed past Nixon's casket in 21 hours as it lay in the Nixon 
Library yesterday afternoon. 
  Mourners waited in a line three miles long and some waited 
for as long as eight hours in chilly and damp weather to glimpse 
the flag- draped casket in the library lobby. 
  In the lobby, mourners were greeted by a large color photo 
of 
a grinning Nixon giving a thumbs-up gesture. There was also a 
picture taken by Nixon and his wife on China's Great Wall during 
one of their visits to China. 
  Wreaths from China, Russia and Poland, and many more 
flowers, 
adorned the casket, which stood on a pedestal under the gaze of 
a military honor guard. 
  Clinton declared today as a mourning day throughout the 
United States and federal government offices closed out of 
respect for the late U.S. president. 
  The U.S. Postal Service suspended regular mail delivery and 
offices were closed for the day. The U.S. Congress, the Supreme 
Court, and all U.S. stock, bond and commodities markets also 
closed today.
