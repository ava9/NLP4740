A review has concluded that the couple who worked as managers of the Santa Ana 
YMCA violated no ethical standards by accepting money from mentally disabled 
clients, YMCA officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee that reviewed allegations of impropriety has recommended the YMCA 
adopt several policies to avoid "future such occurrences," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
William Orrick, manager of the Santa Ana YMCA branch, and his wife, Irene, 
director of the YMCA hotel, will be allowed to resume duties immediately, said 
Allan Shaffer, president of the YMCA of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been suspended with pay from their jobs last Thursday pending 
the outcome of the review. 
</P>
<P>
The Orricks were out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Bill and Irene Orrick acted out of compassion toward their 
clients," Shaffer said. "However, we must avoid even a hint of (impropriety) 
regarding our private contributions which support our various youth and 
handicapped programs." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the Orricks centered on whether they acted improperly by 
accepting thousands of dollars in donations from four mentally disabled men 
referred to their care by county mental health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the donations were raised by YMCA officials and county 
authorities several weeks ago when it was learned that Irene Orrick managed the 
financial affairs of one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
YMCA officials were also probing whether it was a conflict of interest for the 
Orricks to refer YMCA hotel clients to two Santa Ana rooming houses they own. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said the review committee interviewed the Orricks, residents of the 
Santa Ana rooming houses and representatives of the Mental Health Assn., a 
private group that runs a program for homeless mentally ill in the Santa Ana 
YMCA, and concluded the couple engaged in no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to many tenants at the rooming houses and they indicated they were 
very grateful for the opportunity to stay there and for the kindnesses extended 
by Mrs. Orrick," Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said donations given by hotel clients to the YMCA through the Orricks 
will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
One of the donations was a $5,000 disability check given by Walter Titch, whose 
financial affairs were managed by Irene Orrick. The other large donation was 
from George Cleveland Jr., who had given the YMCA about $9,000 over a 2-year 
period, Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Titch, a convicted burglar, is undergoing psychiatric evaluation at the 
California Institution for Men at Chino. Cleveland is in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said the two men were not interviewed by the committee because of their 
declining physical health. But the men have stated publicly that they willingly 
donated the money and were not coerced, Shaffer said.
