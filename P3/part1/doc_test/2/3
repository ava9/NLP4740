A father and son facing murder and kidnaping charges in the ritualistic slaying 
of a five-member Ohio family refused Thursday to comply with a governor's 
warrant authorizing their return to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a reputed cult leader, and his 
19-year-old son, Damon, now have 10 days to file a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus challenging the order. 
</P>
<P>
But that deadline can be extended should the defense need more time to review 
the information in the case, said John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The Lundgrens, who have been jailed in San Diego since their arrest last month 
in National City, were dressed in blue prison uniforms and remained silent 
throughout the 15-minute hearing before Municipal Judge William Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
Hewicker said the case will now go to Superior Court, where a judge will decide 
either to deny the petition or grant the writ. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court denies the petition, we could have agents out here to pick them 
up within three weeks," Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that if the Superior Court grants a hearing on the writ, it 
could take up to six weeks before the two could be forced to return to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But Hewicker said that even if the writ if denied, the case can still be 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hewicker said he does not foresee any problem in eventually returning 
the pair to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, his wife, Alice, 38, and their son were arrested on fugitive 
allegations outside a National City motel following a nationwide manhunt for 13 
members of a cult indicted in the Ohio slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Lundgren waived extradition and was returned to Ohio, where she has 
pleaded innocent to charges of complicity to aggravated murder, conspiracy and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren and his son are charged with aggravated murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Lundgren faces the death sentence if convicted of charges stemming 
from the slayings of Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl and their three daughters, 
Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's bodies were found in early January buried under a barn on a farm 
in Kirtland, Ohio. Lundgren and his followers had lived on the rented farm 
until leaving last April, when authorities believe the family was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Reputed cult members Kathryn Johnson, 36, and Daniel David Kraft, 25, who were 
arrested in eastern San Diego County, are scheduled to be in court today for a 
hearing regarding the status of their extradition proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
They are also fighting extradition and remain jailed without bail in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other cult members face charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Lundgren formerly was a lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints before being defrocked in January, 1988, for 
radical teachings, according to church officials. 
</P>
<P>
He later formed the sect, persuading some former church members to follow him.
