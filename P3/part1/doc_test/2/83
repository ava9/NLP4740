I dropped by Harbor Municipal Court this week to check out F. Lee Bailey. In 
case you don't follow such things, Bailey is certainly one of a handful of 
famous criminal attorneys -- if not the most famous -- in the country. He was 
flown out here over last weekend to defend Pomona orthopedic surgeon Thomas A. 
Gionis, who was accused of ordering the Oct. 3 assault on his ex-wife, Aissa 
Wayne, and her then-companion, Roger W. Luby, in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the spectator area on the first 2 days of Gionis' preliminary 
hearing was well-populated but never full, and about half the audience appeared 
to be working press and lawyers looking for a short course in 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
When I arrived Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans had just 
finished questioning an employee of Pacific Bell about phone records apparently 
showing a number of calls between Gionis and private investigator O. Daniel 
Gal, who was observed at the scene of the attack and employed the two men 
allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey is a portly, ruddy-faced, avuncular man who approached his 
cross-examination with almost cherubic bonhomie. Toying with his glasses, he 
spoke extemporaneously, quite remarkable in view of the fact that he had 
arrived on the scene less than 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had crossed my life once before, rather obliquely, when I did a magazine 
piece about a medical doctor who specialized in hypnosis and told me that he 
had worked for Bailey for some years. One of his jobs, he said, was to sit in 
the spectator area of the courtroom and listen carefully to the questioning of 
prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
He said jurors always offered telltale signs that would enable him to flash 
signals to Bailey to indicate whether Bailey should accept them. The doctor had 
also hypnotized two of Bailey's most famous clients: "Boston Strangler" Albert 
DeSalvo and Dr. Sam Sheppard, for whom Bailey won a retrial and freedom after 
Sheppard was convicted of killing his wife in Cleveland. (There have been some 
spectacular failures too -- the best-known was his unsuccessful defense of 
Patty Hearst.) 
</P>
<P>
Stars of Bailey's stature don't often appear in a municipal court, and his 
presence had an electric quality, dominating even the imposing Gionis, a 
stocky, curly-haired, rather swarthy man in a dark suit who followed even the 
most technical questioning intently. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that struck me most about the early part of the proceedings was the 
good ol' boy camaraderie of the participants -- rather like an advanced law 
seminar. Amid the one-liners, the inside jokes between Judge Susanne S. Shaw 
and the attorneys and witnesses, and the general aura of good fellowship, it 
was sometimes hard to remember that the man at the defense table was accused of 
hiring thugs to assault his ex-wife. I had a feeling that everyone involved 
wanted to show Bailey that they could match his sophistication and this was no 
backwoods operation. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Evans -- a tall, rail-thin man with a high-domed forehead and 
well-trimmed mustache -- told me before the Tuesday-morning session: "I heard 
rumors, but I didn't know until I came to court and saw him that Bailey would 
be involved. I wasn't surprised, though, because the Gionis family has lots of 
money, and I thought they would come up with a name lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bailey is) very smooth and competent in every facet of the job -- and he also 
seems to be a pleasant guy. I don't have any special strategy to deal with him. 
We have some pretty competent defense attorneys in Orange County too -- 
including the people who represented Gionis before Bailey took over. Let's say 
I was whelmed when I saw him, but not overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
The good fellowship struck a discordant note with me because I've always found 
a courtroom threatening, stirring in me a deep sense of jeopardy that I feel in 
few other places. That feeling didn't coalesce with the atmosphere in Judge 
Shaw's courtroom until late Tuesday morning when Jeffrey Kendall Bouey -- a 
Simi Valley pool cleaner wearing an Orange County jail jump suit -- took the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey has confessed to being one of the two assailants, and he described the 
attack on Wayne and Luby in some detail. Evans' last question was: "Why are you 
telling this story here today?" And Bouey -- a remarkably handsome young man 
who looks more like an All-American wide receiver than a hired thug -- answered 
softly, his voice breaking, that being deprived of seeing his children since he 
has been in jail has given him insight into what Aissa Wayne had been going 
through in her custody battle with Gionis over their 2-year-old daughter, 
Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
Then Bailey took over to cross-examine, and the whole tone of the proceedings 
changed dramatically and drastically. Bailey cut up Bouey with surgical 
precision, leading him down paths and then pulling the path from under him, 
deriding Bouey's "new-found sensitivity" and challenging his motives for 
cooperating with the prosecution. Exchanges between counsel turned rancorous, 
and comments from the bench -- still delivered with a kind of fixed smile -- 
became testy. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Bailey I'd come to see, and he put on a terrific show. Although he 
is a consummate performer, he long ago learned the value of understatement and 
doesn't use histrionics at all. Whenever he makes a point, he says, "Oh," in a 
kind of throwaway signature that says quite eloquently, "Well, now we've taken 
care of that matter." He is confident without being arrogant, and knowledgeable 
without being supercilious. Everybody's favorite uncle -- with a stiletto in 
his shoe. 
</P>
<P>
If Judge Shaw decides there is enough evidence to send Gionis to trial, Bailey 
will apparently defend him. If he gets Gionis off the hook at his preliminary 
hearing, Bailey can go home in triumph to await the next call. 
</P>
<P>
Have law books, will travel. For lots of money.
