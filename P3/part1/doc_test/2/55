tendered for filing an application for an Order from the Commission authorizing the merger of Toledo Edison into Cleveland

The Applicants are public utilities organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio, and both Applicants

Cleveland Electric generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy to approximately 748,000 customers
in Northern Ohio. Toledo Edison generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy to approximately 285,000
customers in Northwestern Ohio. Cleveland Electric's and Toledo Edison's operations are subject to regulation

Under the terms and conditions of a definitive Agreement of Merger entered into by Cleveland Electric and Toledo Edison,
100% of the common shares of Toledo Edison will be converted into newly-issued common shares of Cleveland Electric,
the Toledo Edison preferred shares will be exchanged for newly-issued preferred shares of Cleveland Electric, and
any dissenting preferred shareholders of Toledo Edison will be paid cash for their shares upon exercise of applicable
dissenters' rights. Upon the occurrence of these events, Toledo Edison will be merged into Cleveland Electric and
the separate corporate existence of Toledo Edison will cease. Cleveland Electric will, by operation of law, acquire
title to and interest in all facilities of Toledo Edison that are currently under the jurisdiction of the Commission,
and Cleveland Electric will operate such facilities without change.
