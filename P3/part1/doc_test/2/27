<TEXT>
<P>
In Tower City, the centerpiece of this city's downtown renaissance, visitors 
pass by fountains and boutiques to consider an exhibit made of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
They're looking at a model of downtown Cleveland in the year 2000, a remarkable 
tangle of hotels, parks, public works and stunning architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the vision could prove to be fantasy. But judging from the cranes 
towering over the United States' 12th-largest metropolitan area, much of the 
construction is already under way. From the shores of Lake Erie to the city's 
Public Square, Cleveland is welding and riveting its way into the next century. 
As the United States slips toward recession, this gritty Rust Belt survivor 
actually suffers from a shortage of construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the activity is Clevelanders' willingness to spend money, bury their 
differences and unite around common goals. The city's experience provides a 
good lesson for other major cities facing hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the results more evident than downtown, where builders are trying 
to catch up on decades of pent-up demand. Until recently, Cleveland was a time 
capsule that preserved old structures because nothing was built to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's problems were numerous, including a crisis of confidence caused by 
burning ghettos, bumbling mayors, a river that caught fire and the collapse of 
its steel, automobile and machine-tool industries. When Cleveland defaulted on 
its bond obligations in 1978, it looked as if the city might never recover. 
</P>
<P>
But it fought back. Mayor George Voinovich, now governor-elect of Ohio, helped 
reverse the decline by getting business, political and community leaders to 
agree on what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"When you had the economic problems we had in the early 1980s, you really 
didn't have much choice," said Richard Shatten, executive vice president of 
Cleveland Tomorrow, an economic development group made up of chief executives 
from Cleveland's 50 largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a combination of private and public efforts that reshaped the 
skyline and fostered employment. One example: A tax abatement to get LTV Steel 
to invest an additional $1 billion in the area. The effort preserved 6,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Albert Ratner, a Clevelander whose projects include the 16-acre 
MetroTech development in Brooklyn, N.Y., chipped in by taking on the Terminal 
Tower, the Depression-era skyscraper that dominates the skyline. He converted 
the old railroad station at the base of the tower into a splashy development 
with a Ritz-Carlton hotel and three levels of shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Tower City is only the latest in a series of projects. On the opposite side of 
Public Square, an office tower being built has surpassed the Terminal Tower as 
the city's tallest structure. When completed next fall, the 948-foot bank 
headquarters will be the tallest building between New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the $344 million Gateway sports complex, a massive project that is 
getting started on the edge of downtown. In an age of public financing of 
sports facilities, the project -- which includes a stadium for the Indians 
baseball team and an arena for the Cavaliers basketball team -- stands out 
because of the role played by private investors. 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved a tax on liquor and tobacco to pay half the cost and private 
investors agreed to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fantastic what they've done to this city in recent years," said Bill 
Carroll, a public affairs manager of Ford Motor Co., the city's largest private 
employer, with 17,000 workers. Ford is investing $2 billion in its 
Cleveland-area factories. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland still has serious problems. The city's schools are considered 
weak, and old-line manufacturers routinely close plants. Cleveland's growth 
still lags behind its rivals, Columbus and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a city where one can buy a four-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of 
Shaker Heights for $129,900, Cleveland has an appeal that should help it over 
the humps.
