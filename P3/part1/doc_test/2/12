Cleveland High baseball Coach Ray Todd is expected to be released from Westlake 
Medical Center today after suffering heart palpitations after Wednesday's 12-12 
North Valley League tie with San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Todd, 55, who underwent bypass surgery three years ago, was taken to the 
hospital late Wednesday evening by his wife Janet. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland assistant Marty Siegel said that Todd complained of a rapid heartbeat 
minutes after the game was called because of darkness at approximately 6:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Todd spent two days in intensive care and was listed in stable condition 
Thursday night, Janet Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been fine all day," she said Thursday night. "We expect him home (today), 
maybe by noon." 
</P>
<P>
With Todd sidelined, Cleveland lost its first game of the season, 9-7, in a 
rematch at San Fernando on Thursday. STEVE ELLING
