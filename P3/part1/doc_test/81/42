  [Text] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, Kuwait's 
deputy premier and foreign minister, and Ahmad Bin-Jasim Al 
Thani, Qatar's foreign minister, arrived in Damascus today. 
They were received at Damascus International Airport by Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar', a number of top Foreign Ministry 
officials, the Kuwaiti ambassador in Damascus, and the Qatari 
charge d'affaires in Damascus. 
  Shaykh Sabah made a statement to a SANA correspondent. He 
said: We are here to attend the meeting of the eight countries 
that signed the Damascus Declaration and believe in the 
declaration's principles. These principles have three focal 
points: cooperation in the political, economic, and military 
fields. 
  He added: We hope that cooperation among us in the political 
field will increase. As for economic cooperation, we will 
continue discussing the agreements reached in the recent meeting 
held by the finance ministers. Concerning military cooperation, 
it is carried out on a bilateral level among the eight 
countries. He said: We are happy to meet in Damascus in order 
to renew the principles of the Damascus Declaration that were 
announced in Damascus. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Thani said: We, in Qatar, are concerned to have 
the Damascus Declaration as a nucleus for understanding and a 
new Arab order. During this meeting, we will hold discussions 
with the rest of the ministers on certain developments in the 
Arab arena as well as other developments to serve the Damascus 
Declaration countries and the Arab nation. He hope that the 
summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President 
Clinton will result in progress on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks.
