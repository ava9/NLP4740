  [Text] Amman -- AL-RA'Y -- His Majesty King Husayn will 
leave for Oman tomorrow, Monday, on the first leg of a tour that 
will take him also to the sisterly State of Qatar. During the 
visit, the king will meet with His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id. On Wednesday [23 March], the king will head for Doha 
on a visit to Qatar to meet with His Highness Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Khalifah Al Thani. 
  King Husayn will be accompanied, during this tour, by an 
official delegation including Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and a 
number of advisers and ministers. 
  Yesterday, the king met with Nasir Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
ambassador of the State of Qatar in Amman, and reviewed with him 
the fraternal ties and the current Arab situation. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said that King Husayn's 
visit to Oman and Qatar comes within the framework of the 
fraternal ties between Jordanian and these two countries. In a 
statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-'Anani said: Jordan has called for 
a review of the nature of inter-Arab relations, which must be 
based on mutual respect, and for restoring these relations apart 
from the impact of the oil era and the misinterpretation of the 
Jordanian stand during the Gulf war. He added that Jordan has 
explained its position many times. 
  Dr. al-'Anani noted that Jordanian-Qatari relations have 
witnessed significant improvement since the Gulf war, adding 
that the joint economic agreement has been renewed and many 
agreements in the fields of education, trade exchange, and 
information have been revived. 
  Regarding relations with Oman, Dr. al-'Anani said that our 
bilateral relations are cordial and fraternal, noting that 
coordination between the two countries has never stopped. 
  The information minister spoke about Jordan's international 
role with regard to its forces taking part in UN peacekeeping 
missions. He said that this role will develop with time due to 
increasing respect for the reputation of these forces because of 
their high efficiency, capability, and discipline. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the decision to suspend the peace talks 
was made after coordination among the Arab delegations following 
the massacre of the Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the massacre 
has spoiled the general atmosphere of the talks and underscored 
basic issues that must be raised before continuing the talks, 
the most important of which is the security of the Palestinians. 
He said that the decision to return to the negotiating table 
will be made after coordination with these states. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has always called for an end 
to the human rights violations perpetrated by Israel against the 
Palestinians, noting that these practices contradict the peace 
process. 
  The information minister reiterated the need for continuous 
consultation between Jordan and the PLO, noting that His Majesty 
King Husayn has always stressed this. He added that the king 
also stressed that consultation and coordination should be held 
within the framework of the peace process itself, not the 
post-peace stages.
