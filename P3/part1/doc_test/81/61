<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad </F>
Bin-Jasim Al Thani, in Damascus, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Jundi] Reports from 
Damascus say the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration 
states will discuss Arab reconciliation. 
  [Al Thani] The agenda is open for discussion. We hope this 
subject will be discussed. Qatar's view on it is known. 
  [Al-Jundi] What is Qatar's position? 
  [Al Thani] Qatar unreservedly favors any Arab reconciliation 
and closing Arab ranks. 
  [Al-Jundi] Does this meeting of the Damascus Declaration 
foreign ministers have particular significance in light of the 
recent Middle East developments? 
  [Al Thani] Perhaps the discussion of peace developments is 
one of the most important topics at the meeting. But there are 
other important issues to be discussed. We hope we can achieve 
positive results. 
  [Al-Jundi] Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, is 
the Gulf Cooperation Council now inclined to lift the Arab 
boycott against Israel? 
  [Al Thani] The Arab boycott was introduced by an Arab League 
decision. I believe the Arab League is the right venue at which 
a decision on removing the boycott should be made. I am 
discussing the primary boycott, the first-degree boycott. As 
regards other degrees of boycott, Qatar will do what is 
necessary when the other negotiating tracks, notably the Syrian 
and Lebanese, are advanced. 
  [Al-Jundi] But Qatar was the first Gulf state to begin 
telephone contacts with Israel. Is this an action distinct from 
any by the Gulf Cooperation Council states? 
  [Al Thani] I cannot discuss distinction. We assumed this 
position and others can judge it. But we made the decision for 
humanitarian reasons. We opened telephone links with the West 
Bank and Gaza for humanitarian reasons. There are many 
Palestinians in Qatar who want to contact their families 
directly. It is a humanitarian issue. 
  [Al-Jundi] What can the Gulf Cooperation Council offer to 
support the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? 
  [Al Thani] As you know, the Gulf Cooperation Council has 
helped the Palestinian cause a great deal. I believe that if 
the Council helped in the days of war and estrangement, it will 
spare no effort to help during the peace process. 
  [Al-Jundi] Have you in the Gulf agreed to provide specific 
amounts of money to support the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Al Thani] No, we have agreed on no such thing. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Al Thani] Thank you.
