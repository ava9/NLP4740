  [Excerpt] Bonn, 13 Apr (MENA)--Qatari Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani has stated that his country is 
not trying to undermine the importance of the Suez Canal as a 
vital artery for world trade. In a statement to the MENA 
correspondent in Bonn, he said no agreement has been concluded 
with Israel on transporting gas through al-'Aqabah Port [name of 
port as transmitted], as German media have reported. 
  Shaykh Hamad said the press has inflated this issue, which 
does not exist, indicating that any dealings between Qatar and 
Israel hinge on the termination of its occupation of all Arab 
territories occupied in 1967. He explained that the gas export 
agreement was concluded with an Italian firm, which then delayed 
its implementation. 
  On Qatar's relations with Iraq, Shaykh Hamad said his 
country 
deals with peoples and not with regimes. He indicated that 
contacts between Doha and Baghdad depend on Iraq's 
implementation of the UN resolutions. He spoke about the 
importance of cooperation and resolving differences among the 
Arab states, indicating that the Arab world cannot bear any new 
differences at present. 
  Shaykh Hamad said that in the event a Gulf state is 
threatened, help should come from the friendly Arab states 
before it comes from foreign countries. [passage omitted]
