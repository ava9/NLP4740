  [Text] Doha, 8 Jun (QNA-Pool) -- Qatari Health Minister 
Sheik Hamad bin Suhaym al Thani received Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina during his visit to Qatar. 
  They discussed several issues in the health and medical 
sectors that will strengthen cooperation between the two 
countries, including the possibility of hiring Cuban physicians 
and nurses to work in Qatari hospitals and Cuba's willingness to 
cooperate in the training of physicians at the School of 
Medicine, which the local university will establish. 
  During their meeting, the two ministers also discussed the 
possibility of specialized personnel in both countries sharing 
information in the pharmacological, technical, and biological 
fields as well as in advanced medicine and vaccine industries. 
  Cuba, with a population of 11 million people, has 21 schools 
of medicine, four schools of dentistry, and 51,000 physicians 
and 76,500 nurses as of 1990. Official information also reveals 
that between 4,500 and 5,000 physicians graduate every year and 
that the country has 270 hospitals and 423 health centers.
