  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, returned to Sanaa in God's 
protection at 1330 today after paying official visits to the

  He led a high-level delegation to the two countries, and 
held 
talks with his brothers His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of 
Oman and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir 
of Qatar. His talks dealt with the fraternal relations between 
our country and both sisterly countries, the current

political crisis and safeguard the national unity march, in 
addition to the regional, Arab, and international issues and 
developments of interest to our country, to fraternal Oman and 
Qatar, to the region, and to our Arab nation. 
  On his arrival at Sanaa International Airport, the brother 
Presidential Council chairman made a statement. He said: We 
are satisfied with the outcome of our visits to Oman and Qatar 
and with the talks we held with my brothers His Majesty Sultan 
Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of Qatar. These talks were positive 
and fruitful. We sensed a sincere fraternal understanding of 
the overall issues discussed, whether regarding the ongoing 
developments in our country, the regional issues, or the Arab 
developments of interest to our country, to both sisterly 
countries, and to our Arab nation. 
  He added: The talks particularly dealt with developments in 
our country and the exertion of efforts to contain the political 
crisis and its negative repercussions on the national situation 
as well as its threats posed to stability in our country and the 
region. 
  Chairman Salih concluded: We were pleased with the 
understanding and care shown by our brothers in Oman and Qatar 
who emphasized backing for our people and their unlimited 
support for Yemeni unity and democracy as a national gain for 
our people and as a pan-Arab gain for the sons of our Arab 
nation. 
  A session of official talks between our country and Qatar 
was 
held at the Amiri Court in Doha at 0930, Sanaa time, today. 
The session was led by brothers Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,

  Talks dealt with Yemeni developments. The brother chairman 
briefed his brother His Highness the amir of Qatar on the 
outcome of the efforts and mediations being made to achieve 
national accord in our country, contain the political crisis, 
end all its negative repercussions, and implement the document 
of pledge and accord. The latest of these efforts was the 
meeting held between brothers Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, and his deputy, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, in Salalah in the presence of His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id of fraternal Oman. 
  Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani reaffirmed Qatar's care 
for Yemen's unity and its support for all efforts and good 
offices designed to end the crisis between the brothers in Yemen 
and to spread security and stability throughout Yemen in order 
to preserve the gains of the fraternal Yemeni people. The amir 
of Qatar also expressed his great confidence in the wisdom of 
both the leadership and the various national and political 
forces and in their ability to circumvent this crisis and 
respond to the Yemeni people's aspirations. 
  Talks also reviewed the recent developments in the Middle 
East peace process and regional developments. The two leaders 
also exchanged views on all that would enhance Arab and Islamic 
solidarity. Moreover, the talks dealt with ways to consolidate 
and promote fraternal relations in various fields in a way that 
will benefit both sisterly countries and peoples.
