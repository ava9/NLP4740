  [Excerpt] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim 
yesterday told DAVAR that his country would not sign a natural 
gas supply deal with Israel as long as comprehensive peace is 
not established in the region. He added, however, that his 
government would pursue contacts with the Israeli Government to 
discuss the terms of the deal that would be implemented after 
peace is established. He asserted that his country would 
continue welcoming Israeli delegates attending peace process 
conferences that may be held in Qatar in the future. 
  In reply to a question on whether the Qatari Government 
would 
send military representatives to a joint naval rescue exercise 
with Israel and take part in a joint regional communications 
center on military issues, the Qatari foreign minister said his 
government would soon decide whether to participate in these 
projects and on what conditions. He said time was not ripe for 
Qatar to send representatives to visit IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] training installations, and he refused to say whether 
this may happen in the future. [passage omitted]
