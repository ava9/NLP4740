  [Text] The governments of Brazil and Qatar have decided to 
open embassies in Doha and Brasilia one year from now. This 
will be one more effort by the two countries to intensify 
bilateral trade relations. 
  Last year Brazilian imports from Qatar totalled $112 
million, 
basically in oil, while exports to that country amounted to only 
$29 million in chicken and iron ore. 
  The decision was made during the visit to Brazil by Qatar's 
Foreign Affairs Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al 
Thani.
