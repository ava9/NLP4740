<F P=106> ["Text" of joint statement on the visit to Jordan by Qatar's </F>
foreign minister issued in Amman on 2 Jan -- recorded] 
  [Text] Inspired by His Majesty King Husayn's and his 
brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani's wish 
to see a reinforcement of bilateral relations, based on complete 
confidence and brotherly joint cooperation between the two 
brotherly states, a high-level Qatari delegation led by Shaykh 
Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani, the foreign minister of 
Qatar, paid a visit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan at the 
invitation of Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordan's minister of state 
for foreign affairs, from 1 to 2 January, 1994. 
  The esteemed Qatari guest called on His Majesty King Husayn 
and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan and held talks with the 
prime minister. During these meetings, views were exchanged on 
the close relations between the two brotherly states and how to 
reinforce them in the best interests of the two brotherly 
peoples. 
  The two sides also reviewed the progress made in the Middle 
East peace process and Arab and international developments. 
  His Excellency Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani and 
His Excellency Talal Sat'an al-Hasan and their delegations held 
talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on bilateral ties and 
cooperation, as well as agreements reached between the two 
countries. Agreement was reached to create a joint committee 
cochaired by the two countries' foreign ministers to oversee the 
implementation of the agreements signed between them and to 
enhance bilateral relations. The two sides agreed that the 
committee is to meet once annually in either of the two 
countries, with the first meeting set for the first quarter of 
1994 in Doha. 
  The two sides surveyed developments in the Gulf region, 
stressing the importance for security and stability there to be 
consolidated and kept free of any threats, taking into 
consideration the principles of international legitimacy and the 
need for the states of the region to respect each other's 
sovereignty and to be bound by the principle of the peaceful 
resolution of any disputes. 
  The two sides reviewed the peace process and the efforts 
exerted to reach a just, comprehensive, and durable peace that 
guarantees the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the 
occupied Arab territories, the head of which is holy Jerusalem. 
They expressed their commitment to the continuation of efforts 
to reach a peaceful solution based on implementing Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle 
and securing the Palestinians' legitimate rights on their 
national soil until the Arab rights to territories and water are 
achieved and the problem of the refugees and displaced is solved 
in compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  The two sides exchanged viewpoints on the situation in the 
Arab arena. They expressed the great importance of restoring 
Arab solidarity and the unity of Arab ranks and of adopting the 
principle of frank dialogue and mediation or resorting to 
international law as a better policy to resolve disputes in the 
Arab arena in order to maintain the interests of the Arab nation 
and reinforce and deepen trust among all Arab parties. 
  During their review of developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the two sides condemned the inhuman massacres and acts of mass 
killing and ethnic cleansing against the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They called for an end to these massacres 
and urged the international community to shoulder their 
responsibility. They also called for a fair implementation of 
the resolutions of international legitimacy in order to serve 
the issues of peace in the world. 
  The guest minister expressed his admiration and appreciation 
for the awakening, development, and accomplishments in Jordan in 
all fields thanks to the wise policy adopted by His Majesty King 
Husayn. 
  At the end of the visit, Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani, 
the 
Qatari foreign minister, expressed his deep thanks for the warm 
reception he and his accompanying delegation received. He hoped 
for progress and prosperity in the brotherly bilateral relations. 
  The Qatari foreign minister also extended an invitation to 
Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordan's minister of state for foreign 
affairs, to visit Qatar. Al-Hasan thankfully accepted the 
invitation and promised to respond to it soon.
