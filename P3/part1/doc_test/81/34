  [Text] Tomorrow, His Majesty King Husayn will begin a visit 
to the fraternal State of Qatar, during which he will hold talks 
with his brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, amir of the State of Qatar, on the regional state of 
affairs, means of promoting Arab solidarity, and the latest 
developments in the peace process in the aftermath of the recent 
passage of UN Security Council Resolution 904. 
  His Majesty King Husayn today continued his talks with his 
brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman. The talks 
addressed bilateral ties and the Arab state of affairs. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, 
has stated that His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Oman marks a 
significant historical juncture and a qualitative leap in 
inter-Arab ties. On his talks today with the Omani minister of 
state for foreign affairs, al-Hasan said in a telephone 
interview: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Samawi] Sir, what are the 
most important results of the talks held between His Majesty 
King Husayn and His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, if you 
please? 
  [Al-Hasan] On this good occasion, I would like to reiterate 
the deep and distinguished Jordanian-Omani relations, which have 
been reinforced by His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His 
Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id. As you know, these relations 
are becoming stronger with time. These relations, which are 
fraternal in terms of dealing and frank in terms of coordination 
and consultation, have become an example for other countries. 
King Husayn's visit to his brother Sultan Qabus falls within 
this framework. These relations are based on the existing 
fraternal relations between the two leaders and two peoples. I 
can say that these relations are strong, firm, and continuous. 
  [Samawi] Sir, his majesty the king will tomorrow begin an 
official visit to the fraternal State of Qatar. In your view, 
how important is this visit? What are the implications of this 
visit at this point in time? 
  [Al-Hasan] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the State of 
Qatar will add a new dimension to the good and special bilateral 
ties. God be praised, Jordanian-Qatari ties have continued to 
be promoted. The good ties binding his majesty the king to his 
brother Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the amir of the 
State of Qatar, constitute the basis and the foundation 
nurturing these fraternal ties. The visit by his majesty the 
king to the State of Qatar is part of the continuous 
consultations and coordination under way between the two leaders 
and officials of the two countries on various bilateral, Arab, 
regional, and international issues. The visit is also aimed at 
examining the prospects of enhancing and promoting these ties in 
all spheres. His majesty the king's visit will undoubtedly mark 
a true and qualitative leap in bilateral ties. Moreover, it will 
add an additional brick to the edifice of the bilateral ties. 
It will also contribute to promoting and enhancing Arab 
solidarity. His majesty the king has always shown an eagerness 
to reinforce Arab solidarity. His majesty the king has urged 
continuous efforts to safeguard and protect Arab solidarity, and 
to restore inter-Arab cohesion so that Arabs may be able to meet 
challenges in these difficult and critical times. [end
