  [Excerpts] Refugee Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt, 
speaking to the QATARI NEWS AGENCY after a meeting with Qatari 
Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, announced that he is 
committed to the al-Ta'if Accord, wants to see it improved, and 
does not want a return to the pre-accord situation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Asked to comment on a connection between the Syrian presence 
in Lebanon and the situation in the south, he said there is no 
such connection. He added: Since there is a clear 
international decision to implement UN Security Council 
Resolution 425, let the major powers pressure Israel to 
implement it. 
  He said the Syrian presence in Lebanon is an issue that 
concerns only the Lebanese and Syrian Governments. 
  Commenting on the peace process, Junblatt asserted that 
there 
can be no peace between the strong and the weak. He asked: 
Could 'Arafat regain Jerusalem, get rid of the settlements, and 
establish a state on his own? 
  Junblatt said there are ambiguous points in Oslo's secret 
agreement and Washington's public agreement. [passage omitted]
