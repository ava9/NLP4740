  [Text] Ismailia, 20 Apr (MENA) -- Qatari Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani stressed that his country favors 
the Suez Canal as an Arab and international maritime route and 
supports the efforts to increase Egypt's revenue from it. 
  In a telephone call he made today to the Suez Canal 
Authority 
[SCA] chairman, Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil, the Qatari 
minister said that Qatar has postponed discussion of a project 
to build a pipeline to carry Qatar's natural gas to Italy 
following a recent offer from the SCA giving a 30.5 percent 
reduction to Qatari gas tankers using the Suez Canal. 
  Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim added that the project to build a 
pipeline to carry Qatari gas to Europe through Israel is merely 
a project, the implementation of which is linked with Israel's 
withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and 
does not aim to damage the Suez Canal, because the latter "is 
all the Arabs' canal." 
  The Qatari foreign minister stressed that his country will 
take no step on this project without considering the interests 
of the Arab countries, especially Egypt. He added that Arab and 
foreign media have exaggerated this issue. 
  The Qatari foreign minister's telephone call was made 
following press statements by Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil in 
which he expressed his concern about the negative consequences 
of building a pipeline to carry Qatari natural gas to Europe 
through Israel.
