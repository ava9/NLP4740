  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' opened the meetings of the

reviewed the Declaration's march. He also reviewed the scopes 
of cooperation and coordination among the Declaration states and 
the difficulties facing this Declaration. He focused on 
studying the practical steps that will activate the 
Declaration's principles and working out a plan for the coming 
phase to circumvent the obstacles preventing the implementation 
of the Declaration's articles. 
  Al-Shar' also stressed the need to enhance the economic and 
political cooperation among the Declaration states. He also 
pointed to political, regional, and international issues, 
particularly developments of the peace process in light of the 
anticipated Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Damascus Declaration foreign 
ministers expressed profound interest in both this summit and 
its results which will definitely be reflected on the overall 
situation in the region. 
  Following the first session of the meetings of the Damascus

reporters. He said that the meetings' atmosphere was extremely 
good. Emphasis was laid on implementing this Declaration and 
continuing the consultations and joint action, he said.

added.
