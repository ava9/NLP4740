  [Text] Brother Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received at his place of residence 
at the Guest House in Doha this evening representatives of the 
Yemeni Community Council in the fraternal State of Qatar. 
  The representatives of the Yemeni community expressed their 
happiness over this meeting with the brother president in their 
second home, Qatar. They briefed him on the situation of the 
Yemeni community in Qatar, and also on the care and hospitality 
accorded to them by the Qatari Government under His Highness 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of Qatar. They praised 
the fraternal ties that bind them to the fraternal Qataris -- 
officials and people. They expressed their confidence that this 
visit will contribute toward promoting and enhancing the ties 
between the two fraternal countries and peoples. 
  The representatives of the Yemeni community in Qatar also 
expressed concern over the current political situation in the 
homeland. They reiterated their adherence to our people's 
national constants, foremost among which are unity, democracy, 
and stability. 
  Brother Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih spoke to them. He expressed his great happiness over his 
meeting with his compatriots in their second home, Qatar. He 
appreciated the strong patriotic sentiments they expressed 
toward their homeland, toward its unity, and toward the problems 
plaguing the country due to the ongoing crisis. 
  The brother president paid tribute to the positive stands of 
the Yemeni expatriates in general, and the expatriates in Qatar 
in particular, especially since their conduct reflects the 
Yemenis' nobility, as well as their cultural and humane values. 
He urged them to make greater efforts to promote and enhance 
their ties with their Qatari brothers, and to do their best to 
reinforce these fraternal ties to epitomize the ties of kinship 
between them and their Qatari brothers, given the fact that they 
are representatives of their people and homeland. 
  The brother president also addressed the current 
developments 
in the homeland, and the challenges posed to Yemeni unity and 
the Yemeni people. He reaffirmed his confidence that our people 
are, God willing, capable of coping with these challenges, 
thanks to their cohesion, solidarity, and unshakable faith in 
Yemeni unity, which is the people's destiny and fate. 
  The brother president added: I am confident that our people, 
who have managed to cope with the challenges that faced the 
Yemeni revolution [words indistinct], are capable of coping with 
the current challenges posed to unity in the same spirit, and 
with the same zeal and (?faith). 
  The meeting was attended by the members of the delegation 
accompanying the brother Presidential Council chairman on his 
current visit to the State of Qatar.
