  [Text] Doha, 18 May (WAKH) -- Qatari Amir His Highness 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani has expressed his country's 
extreme regret over the human and material losses resulting from 
the current situation in Yemen. He said that considering Yemeni 
events an internal affair, the State of Qatar hopes that the 
current situation will end as soon as possible in a manner that 
preserves Yemen's unity and historic achievements and restores 
security and stability. 
  The amir made these remarks when he received Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salih Basindwah, who conveyed to him an oral 
message from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.
