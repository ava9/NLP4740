<F P=106> [Video report by Washington correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At the Washington talks, the 
major development so far has been the positive atmosphere and 
the initial, albeit hesitant, discussion of substantive issues. 
Thus, for example, Itamar Rabinovich and Muwaffaq al-'Allaf 
briefly touched on the issue of principles of security on the 
Golan Heights. Rabinovich suggested that the two men discuss the 
issue as though an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights had 
already been decided upon. The Syrian negotiator did not rule 
out the proposal but has so far refused to hold an open and 
detailed debate on the issue. 
  Meanwhile, the talks on the Syrian, Lebanese, and 
Palestinian 
tracks are being conducted between the heads of the delegations. 
It remains unclear whether the expanded delegations will meet 
next week. 
  In the meantime, not only King Husayn but also Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim, the Qatari foreign minister, took some brave steps 
toward reconciliation with Israel. He admitted tonight that 
Qatar was holding trade negotiations with Israel on a large gas 
deal; however, the foreign minister clearly explained to us this 
evening that a signed agreement was still a long way off. 
  [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] When we see some 
advance in the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, we will take 
our own action with the second and the third boycott. And about 
the first boycott, it will have to be taken through the Arab 
league. [end recording] 
  The minister promised that the Israelis arriving in Qatar 
for 
the multilateral talks in April would receive a warm welcome. 
  [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] And I think our 
people will accept our move and they will even defend the case 
by themselves. [end recording] 
  The heads of the Syrian and Israeli delegations have also 
agreed about the definition of the proposed demilitarization of 
the Golan Heights. This will be a balanced demilitarization 
that will not obligate Israel to demilitarize large areas of the 
Galilee in exchange for the demilitarization of the Golan 
Heights.
