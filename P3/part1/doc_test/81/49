  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, the minister of state for 
foreign affairs, and Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani, the Qatari 
foreign minister, today held a news conference at al-Hashimiyah 
Palace. During the news conference, the two sides spoke about 
the issues they discussed during their meetings and the results 
of the Qatari minister's talks in Amman. Details are in the 
following report: 
  At the outset of the news conference, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
the minister of state for foreign affairs, welcomed the Qatari 
minister, stressing the similarity in the viewpoints of the two 
fraternal countries on various issues discussed during the 
visit. The Qatari foreign minister thanked His Majesty King 
Husayn and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan for the warm 
reception he received during his visit. He said: 
  "I would like to express my deep thanks to His Majesty King 
Husayn and his highness the crown prince for the warm reception 
my accompanying delegation and I have received. Moreover, I 
thank his majesty for the medal he has awarded me. This is a 
great honor for me and for the brothers accompanying me during 
this visit. 
  "As for the nature of the talks, of course, there were 
special talks between Qatar and Jordan and there were special 
talks about Arab cooperation and reunification. Moreover, there 
were talks that dealt with some international issues, especially 
the peace process and what is taking place on this course. We 
discussed these issues with total frankness and a logic that 
should prevail in our inter-Arab relations. 
  "Of course, I conveyed a message from his highness the Amir 
[of Qatar] and received a reply from His Majesty King Husayn 
that falls within the context of the cooperation and ancient 
brotherly relations between the two. 
  "The current higher joint committee will organize all the 
actions to be taken with respect to previous agreements. There 
is no reason why a visit by Qatar's heir apparent to Jordan 
should not take place in return for His Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan's visit. We are with Jordan whether his highness the 
crown prince visits Qatar or the Qatari heir apparent visits 
Jordan, as it is his second country." 
  Asked about the role that Qatar could play to clear the 
Arab atmosphere, the Qatari foreign minister said: 
  "In fact, the relations should be clear from the beginning 
and all Arab countries should be frank with each other, not in 
order to defame one another but to overcome any crisis and 
misunderstanding and to surpass difficulties and the crises the 
Arab world faced recently. 
  "There is no doubt that Qatar is a small country. However, 
we hope that we will play a role that is not aimed at achieving 
any kind of victory but at clearing the Arab atmosphere. This 
is because we, the people and government of Qatar, believe that 
there can be no victory for the Arabs except through their 
unity. If we wanted to look back on the past, we would recall 
that Arab unanimity during the 1973 war was achieved because of 
frank Arab solidarity. All our victories were achieved through 
our solidarity, while all our problems and tragedies have been 
due to division and to the method of dealing which, we believe, 
should not prevail among Arab countries." 
  Asked about Jordanian-Qatari relations, in general, the 
Qatari foreign minister said: 
  "These relations, as I said earlier, are ancient relations. 
Our relations with Jordan were not affected at any time. There 
is no doubt that a misunderstanding took place during the recent 
Gulf crisis and the occupation of Kuwait. We believe that we 
should overcome this misunderstanding despite how it took place. 
This misunderstanding should be overcome and taken as a lesson 
for our future as an Arab nation. We should stand alongside 
right under any circumstances. This is what Qatar is hoping 
for." 
  For his part, Talal al-Hasan, the minister of state for 
foreign affairs, summed up the results of the visit by saying: 
  "At the end of this positive visit, which I hope will be 
repeated and will lead to more visits between the two countries, 
I would like to say that it was a successful and fruitful one. 
During this visit, we reached constructive agreements which, 
without a doubt, will have a positive reflection on relations 
between the two countries and will yield good results that will 
push the course of bilateral relations forward. I can very 
clearly tell you that understanding was very evident during all 
our meetings and that the identity in views was tangible in all 
the meetings that were held during this visit by his excellency 
the minister and his accompanying delegation. 
  "This visit gains its uniqueness not only from the fact that 
it comes at this particular time, but also from the nature of 
the issues that were discussed during this visit and the great 
similarity in the views the two countries' leaderships hold on 
these issues. This is in addition to the two leadership's joint 
understanding of the need for serious and continuous action to 
correct the Arab situation in order to maintain Arab rights and 
protect this nation's higher joint interests. 
  "It was natural for us to take this opportunity to discuss 
the various circumstances that face our nation, including Arab 
relations, the peace process, and the changes which regional and 
international developments impose on all of us. 
  "Bilateral relations occupied an important part of our talks 
as we proceeded from a determination by His Majesty King Husayn 
and brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the 
amir of Qatar, to strengthen these relations and develop them in 
various fields until they reach the required level of strength 
and firmness. This determination was expressed during His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Doha last August and 
during this visit. 
  "I am pleased to note that we reached an agreement on a 
practical formula that represents a mechanism to follow up the 
growth and development of bilateral relations in various fields 
by forming a joint committee at the foreign ministerial level. 
This joint committee will meet periodically in the capitals of 
both countries for this purpose. The committee's first meeting 
will be held during the first quarter of this year in Doha, God 
willing. 
  "Moreover, we reviewed in detail the various agreements that 
organize bilateral relations."
