  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on 
Tuesday [12 April] received Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabuur 
al Thani, foreign minister of Qatar, for talks. Shaykh Hamad, 
who has been in Bonn since Monday, is discussing possibilities 
to increase cooperation between Germany and the Arabic Gulf 
emirate with the Federal Government and Bundestag deputies. The 
two countries are negotiating an agreement in the spheres of 
economic cooperation, investment protection, double taxation, 
aviation, and cultural exchange. 
  According to statements from the Foreign Ministry, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel and Shaykh Hamad in a meeting last night 
agreed to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible. 
Bonn would also try to further extend relations between the 
European Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the 
community of the six Arabic Gulf monarchies -- during the German 
EU presidency (second half of 1994). 
  Before his meeting with Kohl, the Qatari foreign minister 
held talks with Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag's 
Foreign Committee; Reinhard Goehner, parliamentary secretary in 
the Economics Ministry; and Friedrich Bohl, head of the 
Chancellor's Office. Tonight, the foreign minister is scheduled 
to meet Joerg Schoenbohm, state secretary in the Defense 
Ministry, for talks. 
  With exports worth 192 million German marks [DM] in 1993, 
Germany was one of the most important supply countries for Qatar 
(after Japan, the United States, and Britain). Qatar's exports 
to the FRG, mainly crude oil, only amounted to DM8 million.
