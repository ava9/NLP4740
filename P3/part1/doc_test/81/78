  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn today received Qatari 
Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani at 
his place of residence in Washington. 
  During the meeting, his majesty stressed to the minister the 
need for Arab coordination, as well as the need to revive 
solidarity and unify the stands and views of the Arab brothers, 
particularly at this critical phase in the life of the Arab 
nation. He said the challenges facing the nation dictate that 
efforts and energies should be pooled together to ensure the 
minimum level of Arab solidarity and coordination that would 
benefit all peoples of the nation, strengthen the ties existing 
among them, and protect the interests of the nation and its 
future generations. [passage omitted]
