  [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina met today with Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, 
Qatar's crown prince and defense minister, to whom he delivered 
a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  Cuban delegation sources said that Robaina and Al Thani 
talked about the current state of bilateral relations and shared 
the two governments' interest in finding ways to expand and 
develop them in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Robaina 
expressed his country's willingness to promote cooperation with 
Qatar in areas already identified, such as health, medical 
products, tourism, and sports. 
  Meanwhile, Prince Al Thani reiterated his government's 
willingness to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based 
on respect for the sovereignty and free choice of social 
development systems, regardless of pressures from third 
countries. He added that he was aware of the situation in Cuba 
and made a pledge to promote the visit of a delegation of 
businessmen to Havana in the coming weeks. Al Thani accepted 
Robaina's invitation to visit Cuba and learn firsthand about the 
Cuban situation. 
  In addition, Robaina held a working meeting with Public 
Health Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Suhaym Al Thani and the health 
delegation that visited Cuba recently. Bin-Suhaym conveyed his 
willingness to hire health personnel and buy pharmaceutical 
products to be registered and sold in Qatar. The Qatari 
official conveyed his admiration for the Cuban public health 
system, particularly, the results obtained with the concept of 
the family doctor (basic attention for the population). 
  During this second visit to this Arab-Persian Gulf emirate, 
Robaina also met with the minister of finance, economy, and 
trade, to whom he explained the characteristics of foreign 
capital investment in Cuba. The Qatari minister confirmed that 
in July, he will submit various proposals to his government 
regarding areas in which it is feasible to begin immediate 
commercial exchanges. 
  Today, Robaina officially inaugurated the headquarters of 
the 
Cuban Embassy in Qatar. Relations with Oman, a Persian Gulf 
country with which Cuba established diplomatic relations in May, 
will also be handled from the embassy in Qatar.
