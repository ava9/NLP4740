  [Text] The efforts to solve Yemen's political crisis have 
suffered a serious setback. Oman has announced that the talks 
that Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id sponsored between Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
have failed to end their differences. As a result, Oman 
threatened to withdraw from the multinational disengagement 
committee that is supposed to oversee the disengagement of the 
opposing Yemeni military units. 
  The failure of the talks in Salalah raised immediate fears 
in 
Sanaa that a Yemeni civil war might erupt. 
  Both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id, who saw him off, looked somber when he departed 
Salalah Airport at noon today. 
  Sources of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, said that when President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih left his meeting with al-Bid today, he 
threatened to use force against the leaders of south Yemen, whom 
he accused of dragging the country toward partition. 
  YSP sources denied this accusation and declared that Sanaa's 
policy of oppression and its attempt to exercise hegemony over 
the south, as the sources put it, is the real threat to the 
country's unity. 
  Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 
Bin- 'Abdallah stated that President Salih and Vice President 
al-Bid failed to solve their differences during a second meeting 
in Salalah today. He explained that they could not agree on the 
wording of a statement calling for calm in the country, 
particularly where military matters are concerned. The Omani 
minister announced that his country will consult with Jordan 
over its wish to end its participation in the joint military 
committee charged with the task of disengaging hostile Yemeni 
forces unless there is political progress among Yemen's major 
political parties. 
  Following the meeting in Salalah, al-Bid returned to Aden. 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih made a brief visit to Qatar, 
during which he met with the amir, Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, and senior Qatari officials. 
  Meanwhile, about 40 Yemeni deputies began a sit-in at the 
House of Representatives in Sanaa' to protest the country's 
7-month political crisis and the failure of the Oman-sponsored 
talks.
