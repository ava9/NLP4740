Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano upstaged Lenin on Wednesday, drawing 
hundreds of Soviets out of the line to the communist leader's tomb as Tony and 
his family unfurled a 1,000-foot friendship scroll in the middle of Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
The event represented a dramatic climax to a day in which the 11-year-old 
aviator and his family met with top Soviet officials in the Kremlin, though not 
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They presented the scroll and a 
sackful of 75,000 pen-pal letters as good-will gestures from children in the 
United States to their counterparts in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The boy pilot left John Wayne Airport on June 5, beginning a 17,000-mile 
around-the-world journey that is scheduled to bring him back to Orange County 
on July 21. After leaving Moscow, he will fly across the Soviet Union through 
Siberia and on to Alaska, where he will then head south over Canada and along 
the U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
The scroll, signed by more than 250,000 U.S. schoolchildren, originally was to 
be unfurled Thursday but, buoyed by the praise heaped upon them by Soviet 
officials in the Kremlin meeting, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, suggested that 
the scroll be unveiled immediately. 
</P>
<P>
So the Aliengena delegation, dressed in their Sunday best and flanked by an 
entourage of a dozen people, marched directly out into Red Square, set up the 
scroll on a stand and began unfolding it slowly as bystanders gazed in 
puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people standing in line to view Lenin's tomb, one of the more 
popular attractions in Moscow, directed their attention toward the Americans 
who were stretching the scroll across the square under a Wednesday afternoon 
canopy of threatening clouds. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while struggling to hold the scroll still against gusts of winds, 
Gary Aliengena frantically called out to bystanders to help. 
</P>
<P>
"You Soviets, please help us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First a few bystanders knelt to help hold the scroll and then dozens more 
pitched in, forming the leading edge of a line that in some places was 10 
people deep. 
</P>
<P>
Striding the length of the scroll after it had been unfurled, Aliengena 
recounted the names and places on the scroll, which was signed by 
schoolchildren when Tony flew across the United States on the first leg of his 
around-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best one. . . . Look, thumbprints," Aliengena said to Gennady 
Alferenko, director of the Soviet agency sponsoring Tony's trip through that 
country, as he pointed proudly to where Indiana elementary school students had 
drawn faces on their thumbprints. 
</P>
<P>
"And look at this one," he added, gesturing at where seven smiling students 
from Montana were shown on a photograph. "This is the whole school." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena seemed on the verge of tears as he recounted the cities where the 
signatures had been gathered and reminisced over the months in which he and his 
wife, Susan, had stayed up nights putting together pieces of the scroll that 
had been mailed in from schools all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alferenko, director of the Soviet Foundation for Social Inventions, a 
non-government agency, also appeared moved by the display. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet citizens who crowded around the scroll at first did not know what it 
was about, but upon seeing the thousands of signatures in awkward child-like 
scrawl, they quickly caught on. 
</P>
<P>
"By children, yes?" a grizzled old man asked Aliengena, who nodded. 
</P>
<P>
A younger man in the crowd asked a Times reporter: "You are American reporter? 
Tell the people in the United States we want peace." 
</P>
<P>
Even the threatening sky failed to dampen the spirits of Aliengena and his son. 
With raindrops falling intermittently, Aliengena ordered that the scroll be let 
out another 20 feet to its very last inch. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, dressed in a gray pinstripe suit, ran back and forth along the length of 
the scroll checking it out. 
</P>
<P>
The public display lasted only 20 minutes. Alferenko explained that Red Square 
security officials had instructed that the scroll be rolled back up within that 
time. But Alferenko added that it was highly unusual for the security officials 
to have granted permission for such a spontaneous display in Red Square where 
public events normally require lengthy advance approval. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming show of support in Red Square softened the disappointment that 
the Aliengenas experienced in not being able to meet with Gorbachev, who was 
reported to be busy elsewhere in the Kremlin presiding over the new Supreme 
Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev instead dispatched the man in charge of Soviet youth affairs and 
three other officials to formally receive Tony, his family and selected members 
of his entourage in a lavishly appointed reception room used by the Soviet 
president to meet foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Valery Tsybukh, president of Gorbachev's Parliamentary 
Committee for Youth, lasted 40 minutes and included good-will speeches by both 
the Soviets and the Americans, facing each other summit-style across a long 
conference table. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to meet the participants of such an incredible friendship flight 
and we see that Friendship Flight 89 means that all of the people of the United 
States can look forward to good understanding between our countries," Tsybukh 
said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world is looking at Tony now and we are also following the stories 
of his flight," he continued. "This meeting was organized by Soviet President 
Gorbachev. He is well informed about the idea of the flight and he appreciates 
it very much. He said it was a symbol of friendship between the children of our 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"And he also said it was an example of people diplomacy, and he appreciates 
very much your idea Tony, and he said that it was a great contribution to peace 
between our two countries. . . . In this very room there are high-ranking 
international meetings; it is also symbolic that in this room we are ready to 
accept the friendship letters." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, speaking for his son, expressed awe that a meeting in the Kremlin 
was finally taking place. 
</P>
<P>
"In our wildest dreams we never thought that we would be sitting in the Kremlin 
right now," he said. "Every one of the quarter of a million children who 
touched this scroll feel closer to the Soviet children than they felt a year 
ago. It became my family's dream that there was more to our countries than our 
leaders. So it became people-to-people diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena then presented Tsybukh a certificate from the U.S. Air Force 
auxiliary to commend the Soviet Union for its cooperation with the United 
States using satellite technology to locate lost airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Susan, also gave Tsybukh a gift package containing two model swallows 
from the family's hometown of San Juan Capistrano. And Tony's 10-year-old 
sister, Aliana, presented him with a Minnie Mouse doll. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to give this to Gorbachev's granddaughter," Aliana said. 
</P>
<P>
Tsybukh in turn presented a book each to Tony and Aliana, detailing the Soviet 
Union's achievements in space flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tony and his entourage had already learned some of that country's involvement 
in spaceflight after having toured the Exhibition of Economic and Agriculture 
Achievement, which contains a space exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
After the tour, the group went to the nearby Central Political Pavilion where a 
Soviet version of the friendship scroll was unfurled in a lobby for Soviet 
children to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the peace be all the time. All of the people of the Soviet Union are 
looking for it," 13-year-old Natasha wrote in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"No war!" another youngster wrote above a drawing of an nuclear bomb blast. 
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday morning tour of the offices of Pioneer Pravda, a children's 
newspaper with a circulation of 11 million, Tony and his family were serenaded 
by 20 members of the Young Pioneers, a Communist Party youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Strumming guitars and clapping hands, they sang rousing renditions of such 
tunes as "It's a Small World" and "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
"It is so nice to see young heroes like you," Olga Grekova, editor of Pioneer 
Pravda, said in welcoming Tony. "We want to tell you about our life by way of 
song." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, who got a chance to question the boy aviator, came away from 
their meeting impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Tony came to (the) Soviet Union not only because he (wanted) to 
fly, but because he (wanted) to learn about life in the Soviet Union and to 
make friends with some of our children," said 14-year-old Marina Grashina, an 
eighth grader who was leading the song.
