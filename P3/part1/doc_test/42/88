<P>
Is there anywhere travelers haven't gone? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the least accessible destination on this shrinking globe has been the 
mysterious realm beneath the sea, but even that is no longer forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Take a deep breath, folks, and hold it; you may be traveling underwater soon. 
</P>
<P>
New and unusual opportunities to tour -- or at least view -- the shadowy depths 
are becoming increasingly available. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, underwater sightseeing was limited mostly to scuba divers and 
snorkelers. They alone had the pleasure of exploring the world's tropical reefs 
and sea gardens -- the habitat of rare and colorful fish and strange marine 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, even the less-adventurous traveler can journey beneath the sea fairly 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
There's a fleet of six sightseeing submarines, the Atlantis I through VI, that 
carry passengers in submerged voyages from resort islands in the Pacific and 
Caribbean. All have large viewing windows on each side and in the nose. 
</P>
<P>
If this whets your appetite, consider spending a night in what may be the 
world's only underwater lodge. The hotel, with only two guest rooms, is on the 
floor of a lagoon on the Atlantic shore of Key Largo, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Although anyone can stay there, unless you're a licensed diver you will have to 
practice diving techniques for two to three hours at the front desk before 
you'll be allowed to descend to your room. 
</P>
<P>
Since underwater sightseeing is an obvious complement to a beach vacation, what 
follows is a list of half a dozen unusual possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
They include a luxury cruise for divers in Indonesia, snorkeling tours in 
public parklands in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, a visit to an 
underwater aquarium in the Caribbean and a trio of research expeditions to the 
reefs of Fiji, Bonaire and the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
To view the realm beneath the sea: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Book passage on a submarine. The Atlantis fleet has been growing rapidly. 
Vessels give passengers an eye-to-eye view of a multitude of sea creatures. 
It's the next best thing to diving, and you won't have to worry about a shark 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis submarines operate regularly from Grand Cayman Island, Barbados and 
St. Thomas in the Caribbean; Oahu and Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands, and Guam 
in the Pacific. A seventh will begin sailing from Aruba in the southern 
Caribbean next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The subs on Grand Cayman and Barbados -- named Atlantis I and II -- were built 
to hold 28 passengers each. The others are larger, each seating 46 passengers. 
All are operated by a three-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
The newest subs, which look as if they've been borrowed from a modernistic ride 
in a Walt Disney theme park, are 65 feet long. Each side sports 13 circular 
viewing windows, each two feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
An extra-large window in the bow, a giant porthole, enables passengers to see 
directly ahead. The vessels are air conditioned, and normal sea-surface 
atmospheric pressure is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
A cruise lasts about an hour. The high-tech subs can submerge to about 150 feet 
but generally do not go below 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
For safety's sake, the pilot and copilot follow a regular itinerary. Overhead, 
a surface vessel sails the same path as the sub, alerting other boats to the 
sub below. 
</P>
<P>
Some night cruises are offered. Underwater colors are brighter at night when a 
spotlight from a sub is shined on them. For information, contact the tourism 
office of the island you're interested in visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spend a night on the ocean floor. There are two rooms with undersea view, 
meals included. Your host for these unusual accommodations is Jules' Undersea 
Lodge of Key Largo, just south of Miami. The rooms have become so popular since 
they were opened three years ago that you may have to reserve months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, shaped somewhat like an oversized trailer, was built as an 
underwater research station in Puerto Rico, a function it served for several 
years. In 1986, an investor bought it, moved it to Key Largo and sunk it 30 
feet to the bottom of a two-acre, ocean-fed lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The habitat has two private bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a sitting room. 
It is equipped with telephone and television. Maximum occupancy usually is six 
guests, but eight can be accommodated. Each of the bedrooms has a large window 
looking into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, you'll see 75 to 80 species of fish during daylight hours, manager 
Nancy Fabiano says. At night, lights can be flicked on when shrimp, crab and 
lobsters are active. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner and breakfast, part of an overnight package, are prepared ahead. When 
you are hungry, you pop them into the microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Most guests are experienced divers, which is handy because you have to dive to 
get to your room. But lodge personnel will train you sufficiently to make the 
round trip accompanied by a guide each way. 
</P>
<P>
A special breathing hose and mouthpiece is used. Claustrophobic people might 
want to skip this adventure. 
</P>
<P>
For the lodge's Aquanaut Program (check in at 1 p.m., check out at 11 a.m. the 
following day), the rate is $295 per person a night, including full meals, 
snacks and unlimited diving. A less expensive version provides for 5:30 p.m. 
check-in, 9:30 a.m. check-out and light meals for $195 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge is operated jointly with Key Largo Undersea Park, which opened last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The park offers guided snorkeling tours of the lagoon and the exterior of the 
underwater lodge. Snorkelers are given a device so they can hear what the guide 
is saying. Unlike the snorkelers, the guide walks the bottom of the lagoon in 
scuba gear. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour tour is $12 for adults, $10 for children and $35 for a family of 
four. Equipment is included. 
</P>
<P>
Armchair explorers can "take a tour" seated inside the park auditorium. A guide 
moves about the lagoon while a live camera sends the image to the theater 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
A two-way communications system allows the viewers to question the guide and 
hear the response. Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for children. 
</P>
<P>
For information on all three programs, contact Jules' Undersea Lodge, P.O. Box 
3330, Key Largo, Fla. 33037, (305) 451-2353. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go snorkeling in a public park. At least two large underwater parks, one in 
Florida and the other in the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer snorkelers good 
opportunities for guided excursions. 
</P>
<P>
The most conveniently sited is Florida's John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park 
on Key Largo about half a mile from Jules' Undersea Lodge. About 21 1/2 miles 
long and 6 1/2 miles wide, the park is habitat for hundreds of species of fish. 
On the ocean floor are the wrecks of many ships. 
</P>
<P>
Snorkeling trips and glass-bottom boat cruises are provided by a park 
concessionaire, Coral Reef Park Co. 
</P>
<P>
On half-day snorkeling trips, you are ferried out to the reef about six miles 
from shore, where you will spend about 2 1/2 hours exploring the sea life. The 
trips depart daily at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and are limited to six people. The cost 
is $30 per person. Equipment is included. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is one of the 90-minute trips. It departs at 9 a.m., noon and 3 
p.m., and the limit is 60 participants. Cost is $19 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The glass-bottom boat, which carries 100 passengers, departs at 9 a.m., noon 
and 3 p.m. for a 2 1/2-hour cruise. Cost is $11. For snorkeling and cruise 
reservations, call toll-free (800) 344-8175. 
</P>
<P>
Just offshore from St. Croix in the Virgin Islands is a small, unpopulated 
island designated Buck Island Reef National Monument. The designation protects 
the island's 180 acres, plus 700 acres of surrounding Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists to St. Croix generally reach the island on half a day or one-day tours 
offered by any of seven concessionaires licensed by the U.S. Park Service. 
Ticket offices are on the wharf at Christiansted. By power boat the traveling 
time is 30 to 40 minutes -- by sail, 60 to 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Island is blessed with one of the loveliest white-sand beaches in the 
Caribbean. Beginner snorkelers generally are given a short lesson near the 
beach, and then the group (no more than six per guide) sails to a mooring on 
the southeast tip of the island. This is the beginning of the Buck Island 
Underwater Trail, which winds through a complex and colorful marine garden. 
</P>
<P>
Water along the trail is about 15 feet deep. Resting floats are provided if you 
tire of swimming. A half-day trip concludes with the tour. A full-day tour 
includes time for swimming, sunbathing and hiking on Buck Island. Rates are 
about $25 per person for half a day and $50 for a full day, which includes 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
St. Croix is still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Hugo, but tourism 
authorities expect the island to be back on its feet and in shape to welcome 
visitors by May. Special spring lodging packages are being offered to attract 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Visit an underwater aquarium. St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is home to 
Coral World, a popular attraction for cruise line passengers who want a peek at 
the sea beneath their ship. 
</P>
<P>
Coral World makes that possible with its observation tower, which descends 
rather then ascends. The circular tower is offshore about 50 feet and can be 
reached by crossing a long ramp. 
</P>
<P>
From the surface, the underwater tower drops three levels. At the bottom people 
are under 15 feet of water. Wide windows that encircle the tower look out upon 
the sea life of St. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Schools of fish swim by and then disappear into the vast expanse of the sea. 
Strange marine plants float with the gentle motion of the water. Coral World is 
open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. For information, call (809) 775-1555. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Join a research program. As a paying volunteer on a scientific research 
program, you can view marine life and perform a part in preserving it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the varied projects for 1990 sponsored by Earthwatch are at least three 
involving the study of reef areas in diverse parts of the world. All projects 
are led by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
In Fiji, teams will watch the recovery of a reef damaged by a 1985 typhoon. 
Twice daily at low tide, strong reef walkers will collect specimens of coral, 
shrimp and sponges. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging is in modern Fiji cottages, and a Fijian cook prepares dinner. The cost 
for the two-week program is $1,750. Air fare is additional. Departures are Aug. 
1 and Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
On the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the goal is to study snails, sponges and 
other creatures that inhabit mini-caves in the reef. 
</P>
<P>
The trip is open to certified scuba divers, who will make up to two dives a day 
collecting specimens. Cost for two weeks is $1,960 per person. Air fare is 
additional. Departures are May 20, June 5 and June 21. 
</P>
<P>
In the Red Sea in Israel, the mating practices of the whitebelly damselfish are 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers will snorkel on the surface to observe what's happening. The trip is 
open to both qualified scuba divers and experienced snorkelers. 
</P>
<P>
Cost for two weeks is $1,545. Air fare is additional. Departures are July 1, 
July 22 and Aug. 12. For information, contact Earthwatch, P.O. Box 403, 
Watertown, Mass. 02272, (617) 926-8200. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take a cruise for divers and snorkelers only. Each fall Quark Expeditions 
offers a variety of special adventure cruises aboard small ships for divers and 
snorkelers only. 
</P>
<P>
On this year's itinerary are a trip to the islands of eastern Indonesia 
designed for divers only, and an expedition to the Great Barrier Reef Marine 
Park of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
On the Indonesian voyage, passage is aboard the Island Explorer, which carries 
36 guests in 18 air-conditioned cabins or suites. In the kitchen, three chefs 
blend international with Oriental cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel carries five large, inflatable boats that are used for diving, 
snorkeling and landing operations. Departure for the two-week cruise is Oct. 20 
from Bali. Cost is $4,850 to $7,950 per person, plus air fare to Bali. 
</P>
<P>
On the Australian trip, passage is aboard the Elizabeth II, which carries 28 
guests in 14 air-conditioned cabins with upper and lower bunks. Departure for 
the two-week cruise is Nov. 10. The price is $3,700 to $5,500 per person, plus 
air fare to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Other diving cruises are planned to the Galapagos Islands on July 23, the Red 
Sea on May 19 and June 4 and the Solomon Islands on Aug. 11.
