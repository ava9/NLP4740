Tony Aliengena, an 11-year-old San Juan Capistrano boy with a flair for video 
games and a tendency to airsickness, will climb into the cockpit of a 
single-engine plane Monday and embark on a seven-week odyssey designed to take 
him around the world and into the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's flight across the United States and through Canada, Iceland, Scandinavia 
and the Soviet Union will not only place him in an elite fraternity of 
aviators, but will make him the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-mile journey will also be significant because the boy will become 
the first Westerner in recent memory allowed to pilot a plane across the Soviet 
Union. He will be carrying "friendship" messages to Soviet children from their 
counterparts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Takeoff is scheduled from Orange County's John Wayne Airport at 10 a.m. Monday. 
Tony is due back at the same airfield on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
While in Moscow, Tony is scheduled to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and will present him with a 1,000-foot scroll bearing American 
children's signatures. The boy will then be given a scroll signed by Soviet 
youngsters, which he hopes to present to President Bush upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was Tony's idea to fly around the world and set the record, the 
driving force behind the project has been his father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a 
south Orange County real estate investor. The senior Aliengena has assembled a 
small army of volunteers and corporate sponsors to help finance and plan 
everything from hotel arrangements in the Canadian Arctic to refueling and 
plane maintenance in Soviet Siberia. Tony will be piloting his father's 
single-engine Cessna Centurion Turbo 210, a high-performance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the trip is estimated at $142,000 and is being borne partially by 
members of an entourage of 17 people in Tony's plane and two chase planes, as 
well as by donations raised by the Children's Center for International 
Relations, a nonprofit organization in El Toro that was set up to help finance 
the event. The organization is run by volunteers and some paid employees who 
have been working to coordinate the so-called "Friendship Flight '89" project. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
He'll Have Company 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Tony in his plane will be his father, mother and 9-year-old 
sister, Alaina, as well as a Soviet pen pal and an observer from the National 
Aeronautic Assn., a private group which verifies world aviation records. 
</P>
<P>
Tony began learning to fly at age 4 on his father's lap during weekend family 
outings to the Utah Rockies and Mexico's Baja Peninsula. His first aviation 
record, set on March 13, 1988, was as the youngest person to fly solo in an 
aircraft. Unable to fly alone in a power plane because he was not yet 16, Tony 
piloted an ultralight aircraft to set that record. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a month later, Tony broke two more aviation records by becoming the 
youngest person to fly across the United States and the youngest to fly across 
and back. His achievements are noted in the National Aeronautic Assn.'s latest 
book on world and U.S. aviation and space records. 
</P>
<P>
Tony insists that it is not a love for flying that pushes him to excel in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like to sit in a car," he said matter-of-factly.
