<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation will generate potential benefits in the form of ensuring that the current acceptable level of safety
continues for U.S. commercial air carriers and other operators. The potential benefits of this action will accrue
only to those air carriers and other operators currently engaging in overflights of Yemen's territory. Since this
action is proactive rather than reactive, there are no statistics from which a quantitative estimate of benefits
can be derived.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SFAR will impose a potential incremental cost of compliance in the form of the circumnavigation (including the
additional time for preflight planning) of Yemen's territory and airspace. Based on information available to informed
FAA personnel, there are no U.S. air carriers or commercial operators currently conducting revenue flights into
Yemen. Therefore, these operators will not be affected by this action. However, there are overflights of Yemen's
territory by U.S. commercial air carriers. Thus, these operators will be the only entities affected by this action.
These operators will incur costs for additional fuel and time as the result of diverting from their normal flight routes
that cross over Yemen. Since the FAA does not know at this time to what extent the potential cost of compliance will be,
the FAA solicits comments from potentially impacted operators. Please provide detailed cost information on the
extent the action will impose costs in the form of additional preflight planning and circumnavigation of Yemen's
territory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule could have an impact on the international flights of U.S. air carriers and commercial operators because
it will restrict their ability to overfly the territory of Yemen and therefore may impose additional costs related
to the circumnavigation of Yemen's territorial airspace. This final rule will not restrict the ability of foreign
air carriers to overfly the territory of Yemen. Given the narrow scope of this rule, it will not eliminate existing
or create additional barriers to the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States or to the sale
of U.S. aviation products and services in foreign countries.

The amendment set forth herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined
that this regulation does not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set forth above, FAA has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866. This action is considered a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Because revenue flights to Yemen are not currently being conducted by U.S. air carriers
or commercial operators, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulation Flexibility Act.

1. Applicability. This rule applies to all U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, all persons exercising the
privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, and all operators using aircraft registered in the United States
