</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Aliengena reached the Soviet Far East's largest northern port Tuesday but 
braced for one of the most crucial legs on his round-the-world flight, as he 
moved closer to Alaska and U.S. re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old San Juan Capistrano boy negotiated 312 miles of Pacific 
coastline to bring his single-engine Cessna to a safe landing at the airport 
outside Magadan, a fishing port of 185,000 people normally closed to 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
After resting on a one-day stopover, Tony is scheduled to climb back into the 
cockpit Thursday for a 1,000-mile flight to Anadyr, covering some of the Soviet 
Far East's most desolate terrain. 
</P>
<P>
With just one gravel airfield between those two coastal ports, Tony will be 
relying on the 1,500-mile range of his Cessna 210 Centurion to carry him safely 
over the mountains and dense forests. 
</P>
<P>
The route has a reputation for danger -- many U.S. and Soviet military fliers 
crashed there while ferrying planes between Alaska and the Soviet Union during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with flying in the region is that fog and stormy weather can move 
in at any time, shrouding airstrips and making mountain peaks hard to see, said 
Boris Nikolaevitch, a journalist in the small Pacific village of Okhotsk, where 
Tony spent his first night in the Soviet Far East on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Far East has very, very savage weather," Nikolaevitch said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tony's 500-mile flight Monday from the eastern Siberian capital of Yakutsk 
to Okhotsk, weather was not a factor. Other than low-lying clouds over the 
ocean, weather was also not a problem for Tuesday's 312-mile leg between 
Okhotsk and Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
The weather on the remaining 1,200 miles through the Soviet Union remains a 
question mark, however. A team of Alaskan scientists visiting Magadan told 
Tony's entourage that dense fog had blanketed Providenia for the entire week 
they stayed there on a U.S.-Soviet archeological expedition. After Anadyr, Tony 
is scheduled to fly Friday to Providenia, a small fishing village at the Soviet 
Union's northeastern tip. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled Saturday to cross the Bering Strait and re-enter the United 
States at Nome, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
If Tony was feeling anxiety about the upcoming legs to Alaska, he was not 
showing it this week. "It's not dangerous," Tony said in Okhotsk, where 
hundreds of local residents applauded when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has received large, enthusiastic receptions all across the Soviet Union, 
but the one in Okhotsk was frenzied. Children thrust flowers and pens at him 
and adults burst into wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Red Army contributed. Uniformed troops used their amphibious assault 
vehicles to ferry Tony and his entourage across the mile-wide Kuhtuy River to 
Okhotsk, which can be reached only by ferry because the ever-changing river 
bottom cannot support a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The entire town seemed to turn out, as a crowd of hundreds of men, women and 
children riding bicycles, motorbikes and walking trailed Tony and his entourage 
from a cafe -- where they dined on salmon, redfish and reindeer tongue -- to 
the local museum, where they were given a look at the region's colorful 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role in Bering's Discoveries 
</P>
<P>
The museum director, Yevgeniy Morokov, said Okhotsk (which means hunting place) 
was the port from which 18th-Century explorer Vitus Bering sailed to Alaska, 
thus becoming the first European to discover the strait that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also featured wildlife specimens from the surrounding wilderness, 
where bears and wolves still prowl in such large numbers that outdoors 
enthusiasts are advised to carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the museum director to write a message in a book where the town's 
historical documents are kept, Tony's father wrote: "Your history will be in 
our hearts forever." 
</P>
<P>
Morokov then reached into his pocket and gave Tony a 3,000-year-old Indian 
arrowhead. Then he presented Tony's 10-year-old sister, Alaina, with seven 
precious stones found 200 years ago in Okhotsk. 
</P>
<P>
Morokov said the seven stones symbolized happiness, and he urged Alaina to make 
a necklace out of them. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the museum, the town's residents waited patiently for Tony to finish 
the tour. Eighth-grader Aleksie Manohin said he had been anticipating Tony's 
visit for a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Wish for Good Health 
</P>
<P>
"Very good, it's very interesting," Manohin said in awkward English. When asked 
what he had to say to Americans, the student blushed and said, "I wish them 
health, very big health." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolaevitch said Tony is a curiosity because normally the region is closed not 
only to foreigners but to outside Soviet residents as well, primarily because 
of its closeness to Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the village's streets are worn and rutted, and many of the homes are 
clapboard shacks with outhouses, the residents earn a much higher salary than 
counterparts in such big cities as Moscow and Leningrad. Nikolaevitch, for 
instance, makes 500 rubles a month, while a journalist in Moscow may earn just 
half of that. 
</P>
<P>
In Magadan, the salmon fishing is legendary. One of the first orders of 
business for Tony's party was to arrange for an early morning fishing outing 
Wednesday. The rest of the group planned a tour of Magadan, where fog rolls in 
off the Pacific virtually every afternoon, even though the city is 30 miles 
inland. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from fishing, Magadan is also well known in the Soviet Union for it 
prisons, said Aleksie Grinevich, a Moscow journalist accompanying Tony on his 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center for Stalinist Executions 
</P>
<P>
During the more restrictive Stalin era, he said, hundreds of thousands of 
Soviet dissidents were taken to Magadan for mass execution. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many, many prison songs in the Soviet Union written about Magadan," 
Grinevich said. 
</P>
<P>
Local Magadan officials greeting Tony at the airport said nothing about the 
area's notorious prison history. Instead, they scheduled a visit to a Young 
Pioneers camp and invited the Americans to stay in town until this weekend, 
when Magadan's 50th anniversary will be celebrated with music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tony politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union," he said, "we have been to so many great places that if 
we had extended our stay we would never have gotten home."
