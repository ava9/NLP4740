commercial airliner to fly nonstop from London to Sydney.

The new $150-million Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 made the 11,156-mile journey 
in 20 hours, nine minutes, also setting a speed record. The plane made the 
journey with 23 people on board, as well as strict limitations on luggage. It 
carried 56,420 gallons of fuel.

The previous long-distance record was held by South African Airways, which flew 
a specially designed Boeing jet 10,281 miles from Seattle to Cape Town.
