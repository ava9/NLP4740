Jeana Yeager, who made history in the non-stop round-the-world flight of the 
Voyager in 1986, escaped injury Sunday when an experimental plane she was 
co-piloting lost power and crashed on landing. 
</P>
<P>
Elko County Sheriff's Deputy James Neff said the 38-year-old Yeager of Nipomo, 
Calif., and the plane's pilot, Shirland K. Dickey, 48, of Chandler, Ariz., 
walked away from the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy said the pair were flying an experimental propeller-driven plane in 
the Eighth Annual International E-Z Air Show and were on the final approach of 
a 120-mile race between Jackpot and Wells, Nev., when their engine caught fire 
about four miles from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it was a dead-stick landing," the deputy said. On touching down, 
the plane left the runway and its landing gear collapsed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager and pilot Dick Rutan set aviation history in December, 1986, when they 
flew the Voyager in a nine-day unrefueled circumnavigation of the globe.
