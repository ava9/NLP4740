ONE OF the problems of predicting form in the Whitbread race is that nothing
else replicates the gruelling conditions and length of a 32,000-mile contest
around the world. Fast off the Needles may mean nothing off Cape Horn.
Nevertheless, a number of the Whitbread entries were keen to shape up
against one another in the recent UAP Round Europe race. Another clutch
leaves the US on Saturday in the New York-Southampton race. This event will
match the British youth/disabled crew of Dolphin against the wily grand
master, Dennis Conner, at the helm of his money-no-object entry Winston.
Also in that fleet will be the US Women's Challenge led by Nance Frank. She
actually turned back on the start-line of the 1989-90 Whitbread because of
lack of funds. This time, following the example of Maiden four years ago,
sponsors have been found for a women's crew. No one now doubts the ability
of the distaff side, fore or aft of the mast.
A topic of impassioned debate is whether the new Whitbread 60 class of
water-ballasted mono-hulls will prove faster than the 30 per cent larger IOR
maxis they are to race against. Although the classes are separate, skippers
who have chosen the newer boats are itching to show they can beat the
'dinosaurs' around the world.
Three maxis entered the Round Europe and three W60s. Although the data is
incomplete, both designers and sailors were agreed that the bigger yachts
should be quicker upwind and in the lighter airs. When the breeze goes aft
and freshens up a little, one maxi skipper, Lawrie Smith of Fortuna,
believes the W60s could be up to 100 miles a day (or 30 per cent) faster.
The third leg of the Round Europe from Cherbourg to Rotterdam looked set to
be a perfect test of maxis against W60s. A southerly breeze was solid from
the south-south-west, giving a high-speed reach up-Channel to the Low
Countries.
Grant Dalton, skipper of the maxi New Zealand Endeavour, said before the
start: 'If the W60s are ever going to prove they can be faster than the
maxis, today is the day.' Dalton, an experienced Kiwi who skippered Fisher &amp;
Paykel in the race four years ago, is said to have spent Dollars 50,000
(Pounds 33,333) with designer Bruce Farr simply for a detailed study on
which type of yacht would prove quicker around the global track.
Aboard the W60s off Cherbourg that sunny morning, there was a similar mood
of anticipation. Intrum Justitia crew member Gunnar Krantz said: 'For the
first time ever, we will really be able to see the potential speeds of the
W60s, which I'm sure will give the maxi class a run for its money.'
Heading east from the Cherbourg peninsula, a Spanish W60, Galicia 93
Pescanova, took an early lead but was overtaken during the first night by
Intrum Justitia. However, as the wind died away on the 250-mile leg, the
maxi yachts, with their vastly bigger sail plan, were able to take the lead.
The first three yachts into Rotterdam were the maxi-ketches NZ Endeavour,
Merit Cup and La Poste, with only 18 minutes separating first and third.
Intrum Justitia was the leading W60, just 66 minutes behind the Kiwis.
Dalton went on to win the Round Europe overall. 'It has been like a
mini-Whitbread,' he said. 'The racing between the maxis has been so close.
We are so similar that I think this Whitbread will see the closest racing
there has ever been, in both classes.'
Among the W60s, there was quiet confidence. Galicia, winner of the smaller
division of the Round Europe, was launched only two weeks before the start
and its crew had never sailed together before the delivery trip from Vigo to
La Rochelle. The yacht was far from optimised but had delivered excellent
speed 'right out of the box.' The same was true for Intrum Justitia although
the Italian W60, Brooksfield, was off the pace and is to be modified.
In the southern hemisphere, meanwhile, Chris Dickson - the young skipper who
so nearly won the America's Cup for New Zealand six years ago - has
finalised the strategy for his first Whitbread. Dickson has been running a
two-boat testing programme for the past three months.
After thousands of miles of racing between his boats, Dickson has chosen the
Farr design from his duo. Farr, an expatriate Kiwi who lives on the US east
coast, has had more victories in the 20-year history of the Whitbread than
any other designer. It will be christened Tokio in deference to the
consortium of Japanese businesses that have financed Dickson.
The second boat, developed by West Australian naval architect John
Swarbrick, was no dog; indeed, it was favoured by some Dickson crewmen and a
number of serious buyers have been looking at it. 'It was a very tough
decision,' said Dickson, from Auckland. 'Both boats had been optimised and
are close to their full potential.
'I would have been happy to do the race in either one of them. The decision
was taken with an open mind, purely on the basis of scientific performance
tests.'
Perhaps. Top sailors are instinctively a conservative bunch and have a
history of shunning radical boats in favour of one that looks like last
year's winner. The British team led by Harold Cudmore did just that in the
1986-87 America's Cup, preferring the classic (but slow) White Crusader to
David Hollom's developmental 12-metre.
Swarbrick has been the bridesmaid before. In 1987, the Kookaburra syndicate,
which defended the cup for Australia against Conner, rejected Swarbrick's
boat in favour of a more cautious approach from skipper Iain Murray. Stars &amp;
Stripes won 'four-zip' (as Conner would say) and the Auld Mug went to San
Diego.
