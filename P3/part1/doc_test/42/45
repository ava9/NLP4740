<P>
Trey Urbahn had his head in the clouds Saturday as the lifelong airplane lover 
soared through the sky in an attempt to fly around the world in three days. 
</P>
<P>
He took off Friday on an American Airlines flight from O'Hare International 
Airport for San Juan, Puerto Rico -- the first leg of a 27,808-mile trek. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to land a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. If Urbahn, 32, 
arrives home as scheduled at 10:16 a.m. Monday on United Flight 44 from 
Honolulu, he will have covered six continents and every time zone. 
</P>
<P>
Urbahn, a United Airlines employee who lives in the Chicago area, said he has 
been considering the global trip by commercial airline for three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed two or three months ago that all the schedules fit like a jigsaw 
puzzle. So I wrote to the airlines and most agreed to sponsor me to some 
extent." 
</P>
<P>
After the stop in San Juan, Urbahn was heading to Caracas, Venezuela; London; 
Cairo; Singapore; Sidney, Australia; Honolulu, and then back to Chicago. In 
all, six different airlines are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Urbahn will have to hope for the best as far as delays are concerned. His 
tightest connection will be in London, where he has 65 minutes to change 
terminals for a flight to Egypt.
