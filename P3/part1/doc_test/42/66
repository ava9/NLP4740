THERE WAS a time when only strong men ventured to Antarctica. Now, this vast
and beautiful wilderness is far more accessible. Several companies, for
example, are offering cruises on ships with ice-hardened hulls, the
amenities of four-star hotels, cabins with en suite facilities, and zodiacs
(small inflatable dinghies) for shore landings. Going to the Antarctic is
still an adventure, but one that can be enjoyed in comfort.
The only time it is possible to go, when the southern oceans are free from
ice, is between October and March, the Antarctic summer. From Britain,
passengers fly from London to Chile or Argentina with embarkation at
Montevideo, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas or Ushuaia. Landings are made,
depending on length of voyage and weather, in the Falklands, South Georgia,
South Orkneys, South Shetlands, Antarctic peninsula and, on the return
journey, Cape Horn and Puerto Williams in the Chilean fiords.
First in the field of passenger expedition ships was Clipper's World
Discoverer (3,700 tons), which has taken people to the Antarctic since 1974.
It is a small, comfortable, friendly ship, with the accent on giving
passengers (maximum 139) a learning experience rather than a cruise - films
and lectures of an evening rather than casino and cabaret.
However, it has a fitness centre, sauna, small pool, beauty salon, cinema
and library. Lecturers, who act as guides on shore, include polar
historians, geologists, ornithologists and marine biologists; 16- to 23-day
voyages cost from Pounds 4,756 to Pounds 8,466 per person depending on
accommodation and length of trip. (London tel: 071-436-2931).
Ocean Cruise Lines' (tel: 071-724-7555) Ocean Princess (12,200 tons) carries
460 people and provides more mass-appeal cruising. As well as a team of
specialist lecturers, there is nightly dancing and cabaret, a piano bar and
casino. It also has a library, gym, sauna, pool, health club and beauty
salon. Prices for 20-22 days: from Pounds 2,295.
Several tour operators use both these ships but provide their own natural
history guides. Birdquest (tel: 0254-826317) takes small groups (maximum 12)
on World Discoverer and they can act independently on board and shore
excursions. Price for 25 days: Pounds 6,680 London return, or Pounds 5,840
Santiago return.
Abercrombie &amp; Kent (tel: 071-730-9600) uses Ocean Princess and takes groups
of about 30. A&amp;K also owns Explorer (2,398 tons), the smallest
ice-strengthened passenger vessel in Antarctica, which carries the least
number of people (96) to the largest ratio of specialist lecturers (12). In
spite of its size, it has a sauna, library, gift shop and lecture
hall-cinema. Prices for 16-23 days: from Pounds 4,128 to Pounds 6,297.
To visit the far side of the Antarctic, south of New Zealand, Noble
Caledonia (071-491-4752) offers cruises aboard Frontier Spirit (5,000 tons),
an exploration vessel for 130 passengers.
Sailings are from New Zealand via Terra Nova Bay, Ross Ice Shelf, McMurdo
Sound and Ross Island. Prices, from Pounds 4,500 to Pounds 7,995 for a
verandah suite, include return flight London-New Zealand, two nights in
Auckland, two in Sydney and 22 on board.
For the longest voyage of all (31 days), Quark Expeditions' (071-490-2211)
18,000-ton Russian ice breaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov, sails from Cape Town to
Perth stopping in the Antarctic en route. The price, from Pounds 5,955 to
Pounds 8,300, includes air travel London-Cape Town-Perth-London and 22
nights on board.
Information about Antarctic cruises can be obtained from Paul Mundy
(071-734-4404), the cruise specialist.
