 -- One minute you're in Sri Lanka and the next you're in Africa. Around the 
world in 80 days? More like a leisurely three weeks in these days of supersonic 
travel, and that even allows for a safari in Africa and cruises in Tahiti, 
Mexico and New Zealand along the way. As the Concorde set out Saturday from 
London on its first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe, it wasn't the 
flying time that was to account for much of the 22 days of the trip. With a jet 
that can cover the 3,000 miles from Sri Lanka to Kenya in 2 hours, 40 minutes, 
it's more likely that the sightseeing stops will be eating up most of the 
travel time. Leading the group of 100 passengers who paid $39,000 each for the 
trip is American journalist William F. Buckley Jr., who, in another supersonic 
first, plans to broadcast his television show "Firing Line" from Cape Town, 
South Africa, and Sydney, Australia, during the journey. In addition to those 
stops and the cruises in Acapulco, Mexico; Christchurch, New Zealand, and 
Papeete, Tahiti, the jet will touch down in New York; Oakland; Honolulu; 
Colombo, Sri Lanka; Mombasa, Kenya, and Monrovia, Liberia, during the 
38,343-mile voyage.

 -- With the death of cartoonist Milton Caniff on April 3, 1988, a mighty 
pilot, Air Force Col. Steve Canyon, vanished from the skies. But the Air Force, 
loath to let one of its heroes go unrewarded, will formally retire the comic 
strip character with full military honors Monday in a ceremony at Ohio State 
University. After painstakingly going through all of the old Canyon strips, Air 
Force personnel compiled a biography and list of Canyon's exploits, which will 
be featured in an exhibit in the journalism school's library, recently 
dedicated to Caniff, a graduate of the school in Columbus, Ohio. "Through Steve 
Canyon, Milt Caniff did a lot to keep up the spirits of fliers and the Air 
Force," said 1st Lt. Lynn Ellen Bryant. Canyon's service record "includes 
decorations, citations, movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts 
of good stuff," Bryant said. But the Air Force decided that since his record 
was so varied, Canyon could only be assigned to the Office of Special 
Investigations.

 -- Enough talk about international relations. When President Bush and Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak take the helicopter from Washington to Baltimore on 
Monday the chatter will be about 7th-inning stretches and sacrifice plays. In 
an unusual windup to a day of diplomatic dialogue, Bush and Mubarak will attend 
the baseball season opener between the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red 
Sox, with Bush throwing out the first ball. ANN CONNORS
