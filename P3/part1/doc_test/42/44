On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule, ``Transponder with Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement
(Mode C)'' (Amendment No. 91&hyph;203; 53 FR 23356), which, among other amendments, revised Section 91.24 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 91). In pertinent part, that rule added Section 91.24(b)(5)(ii), effective
December 30, 1990, which required aircraft operating in the airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL within a 10-mile
radius of any airport listed in newly designated Appendix D of part 91 to be equipped with an operable transponder with
Mode C except when operating in the airspace below 1,200 feet above ground level outside of the airport traffic area.
Logan International Airport, Billings, MT, and Hector International Airport, Fargo, ND, were the only airports
listed. Aircraft which were not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical system or which had not
subsequently been certified with such a system installed, balloons, and gliders were excluded from this requirement.
The preamble to this rule indicated that an airport would be considered as a candidate for this Mode C requirement if
its annual enplaned passenger count exceeded 200,000. The preamble further stated that several airports exceeded
the 200,000 annual enplaned passenger requirement, which had not been designated as, or planned for, a Class C airspace
area (formerly ARSA) (including Billings, MT). The FAA examined the operations at this location and determined that
the Mode C requirement should be established at Billings, MT, because this airport had experienced a significantly
high number of passenger enplanements, and typically generated over 50,000 instrument operations per year.

On December 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to designate a Class C airspace area at the Billings Logan International Airport,
MT (58 FR 65950). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting comments
on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments to parts 71 and 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR parts 71 and 91) establish a Class C airspace
area at the Billings Logan International Airport and revoke the Class D airspace area at Billings, MT. This action
will remove Billings Logan International Airport as the only remaining airport under Appendix D, Section 2 of part
91, ``airports at which the requirements of section 91.215(b)(5)(ii) apply.'' This action will not remove Appendix
D, Section 2 of part 91. Billings Logan International Airport is a public airport with an operating control tower served
by a Level II TRACON, at which a TRSA is in effect. The establishment of this Class C airspace area will require pilots
to establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering
the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the Class C airspace area. Implementation
of the Class C airspace area will promote the efficient control of air traffic and reduce the risk of midair collision
in the terminal area. The Class D airspace area is being revoked because Class C airspace is more restrictive (i.e.,
carries higher operational requirements) than Class D airspace. Therefore, the FAA is revoking the Billings, MT,
Class D airspace area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action supports a goal of airspace reclassification_to simplify the airspace by eliminating overlapping airspace
designations. The coordinates in this document are based on North American Datum 83. Except for editorial changes
and the revocation of the Class D airspace area in Billings, MT, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.
Class C and Class D airspace designations are published in paragraphs 4000 and 5000, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1993). The Class C airspace area listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order and the
Class D airspace area listed in this document will be removed subsequently from the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that the final rule will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not ``a significant regulatory
action'' as defined in the Executive Order and the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
The final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not constitute
a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.

The FAA has determined that the establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area at Logan International Airport
will impose a one-time FAA administrative cost of $550 (1993 dollars). For the aviation community (aircraft operators
and fixed-based operators), the final rule will impose only negligible costs. The potential costs of the Class C airspace
area are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area, the FAA does not expect to incur any additional costs for ATC staffing,
training, or facility equipment. The FAA is confident that it can accommodate any additional traffic that will participate
in radar services at the Class C airspace area through more efficient use of personnel at current authorized staffing
levels. The FAA has trained its controller force in Class C airspace procedures during regularly scheduled briefing
sessions routinely held at Billings. Thus, no additional training costs or equipment requirements are anticipated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of Class C airspace throughout the country has made it necessary to revise sectional charts by removing
existing airspace depictions and incorporating the new Class C airspace boundaries. The FAA currently revises these
sectional charts every 6 months to reflect changes to the airspace environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes required to depict Class C airspace are made routinely during these charting cycles. The periodic changes
to these charts are considered as routine operating expenses of the FAA. Thus, the FAA does not expect to incur any additional
charting costs as a result of the establishment of the Billings Class C airspace area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA holds an informal public meeting at each proposed Class C airspace location. These meetings provide pilots
with the best opportunity to learn about Class C airspace operating procedures. The routine expenses associated
with these public meetings are incurred regardless of whether Class C airspace is ultimately established. Before
the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area becomes effective, the FAA will distribute a ``Letter To Airmen'' to all pilots
residing within 50 miles of the Class C airspace site that will explain the operation and airspace configuration of
the Class C airspace. The ``Letter to Airmen'' cost will be approximately $550. This one-time negligible cost will
be incurred upon the establishment of the Class C airspace area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA anticipates that some pilots who currently transit the terminal area without establishing radio communications
or participating in Stage III services may choose to circumnavigate the Billings Class C airspace area. However,
the FAA contends that these operators can circumnavigate the Class C airspace area without significantly deviating
from their regular flight paths. They could remain clear of the Class C airspace area by flying above the ceiling (7,700
feet mean sea level (MSL)), under the outer floor (4,900 feet MSL), or just beyond the lateral boundaries. The FAA estimates
that this final rule will have a negligible, if any, cost impact on nonparticipating GA aircraft operations because
of the small deviations from current flight paths imposed on these operators.
