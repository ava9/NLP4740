WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by
their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years
ago?
This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for
decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and
travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar
to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed
the 6,000 mile voyage to America.
The idea that the ancient Chinese exported some of their developed culture
to the Americas is strongly supported by Professor Joseph Needham, the
eminent orientalist and historian.
Modern archaeological techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, have
established that the first real 'discoverers' of the continent, were Stone
Age hunter-gatherers from Asia who crossed the Bering Strait around 12,000
to 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, when sea-levels were
much lower than today.
These then dispersed throughout North and South America. As the world's
climate warmed and sea levels rose, contact was broken. There the agreement
on the cultural evolution of the AmerIndians ends.
Academic debate now centres around two antagonistic groups. The first,
dubbed the 'transoceanic culture diffusionists', claims that the many
similarities that have been observed between Asiatic and AmerIndian cultures
are the result of subsequent maritime contact between the two continents.
The second group, which believes in 'independent development' claims that
the similarities are coincidental, and the culture, science and technology
of the Americas developed independently . These achievements include the
highly accurate Mayan calendar and their pictographic scripts, impressive
stone temples demonstrating sophisticated geometric and engineering skills,
the cultivation of maize and cotton, and ornate metalworking of gold and
silver.
Severin's 'China Voyage' as it is to be called, will challenge the
'independent developmentalists' viewpoint. His voyage across the Pacific
ocean from Hong Kong to Mexico, will be aboard a specially built 60-foot
bamboo raft which is a replica of the sailing craft used by Chinese
fishermen and mariners 2000 years ago.
Taking the east-going Kuroshio current across the north Pacific, which was
used by the Spanish galleons in the 16th century, his aim is to follow the
probable route of an expedition of 3,000 Asian mariners of the Ch'in dynasty
in 218 BC, who are recorded as having been despatched by their emperor to
find a land across the ocean. There they believed a drug which would give
long life could be found. Severin believes they may have succeeded although
they never returned.
Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a
leather-hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course
of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica
ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the
Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China
Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks - one following
a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan.
The raft for the China Voyage has been designed by Colin Mudie, who worked
on three other replica craft for Severin's previous expeditions. It is being
built at Sam S'on on the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam, the only place in the
world says Severin, where such vessels are still in use.
A precursor of the later Chinese junks, the raft consists of three layers of
bamboo lashed together with rattan string and bamboo skin. Two small cabins,
which will be 'home' to the five-man crew for the six-month voyage, are made
of plaited bamboo strips sealed with a mixture of sawdust and tree lacquer.
It is powered by three Chinese battened lugsails set on bamboo masts and
steered by an arrangement of rudders and centreboards. When fully-laden, the
deck will be only a foot above sea-level.
The crafts's seaworthiness is based on a 'wash-through' principle, allowing
it to absorb the power of heavy seas by letting waves percolate through the
fabric of the hull. Severin says that prolonged exposure to the elements
will be a major problem for the five-man crew. Other perils they may have to
face are fog and typhoons. He said 'previous attempts to reconstruct voyages
in bamboo rafts have never gone so far without sinking, breaking up or being
eaten up by shipworm'.
However, Severin is no stranger to hardship. He braved storms, killer whales
and pack ice in the north Atlantic in a small leather-hulled curragh during
the Brendan voyage. He was surrounded by sharks and becalmed in the Doldrums
on his Sinbad voyage.
The China Voyage will have the benefit of modern navigational aids,
liferafts, radio, and warm clothing unlike the ancient Chinese mariners.
'Anything that will enhance safety will be aboard, but will only be used as
backups. We shall be eating similar foods to those used then and be using
replicas of early Chinese compasses and star-angle measuring devices to
navigate'.
So what drives this slightly-built Englishman who settled happily in a small
village in the west of Ireland 20 years ago, to continue undertaking such
risky expeditions?
He says: 'I enjoy doing them. It is as simple as that. It is an intellectual
challenge rather than a physical one. I hope this voyage, like the other
ones, will demonstrate that the technology existed then to enable travel
from one side of the ocean to the other'.
As with the Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expeditions, and his own previous
adventures, Severin recognises that a successful conclusion of the China
voyage will not necessarily prove that maritime contact across the oceans
was achieved in pre-Christian times.
'What it will do is symbolise that various voyages could have taken place.
We are focussing on one that was recorded as having set off in the Annals of
China, although nothing was ever heard of them again.'
'What those mariners would have carried with them, are not so much
archaeological artefacts that would have survived through time but their
intellectual baggage - their knowledge of calendars and astronomy, their
writing and art, and their building skills. These could have been passed on
and survived if they reached their destination,' he said. Severin hopes to
make his own landfall in the New World in October.
