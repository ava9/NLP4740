Later this month, John Ridgway, who became famous for rowing the Atlantic in
1966 and has sought new adventures ever since, will lead a party on what
many think is the ultimate test of canoeing: paddling round Cape Horn.
The canoeists will face drifting pack ice, gales that can surge from calm to
Force eight in 10 minutes and 'williwaws' - squalls which can gust off
glaciers at up to 130mph. Where they canoe beneath cliffs, they may
encounter waves than can throw a canoe clean into the air.
The only reassuring fact about the expedition, which should make Ridgway's
23-year-old daughter Rebecca the first woman to canoe round Cape Horn, is
that it will be in touch to an unprecedented degree with helpers in Britain.
BT, formerly British Telecom, is using the expedition, of which it is the
main sponsor, to test satellite telecommunications equipment that will
enable the canoeists to position themselves, obtain weather forecasts, send
back news reports and allow the 53-year-old Ridgway to keep in touch with
the management of the salmon farm at his adventure school home at Ardmore,
near Cape Wrath in Scotland.
Assuming it survives this arduous test, the equipment will be installed on
yachts competing in the 1993-94 Whitbread round the world race, which also
passes Cape Horn.
The expedition consists of a five-person main team in single seat kayaks,
two double canoes (including a TV cameraman from Independent Television
News) and the 47-foot Chilean fishing boat Skyring as support boat.
The expedition, which will last about two months, will hug the coast down
the Beagle Channel, with the canoe party camping onshore at night and the
Skyring staying at sea. The party then cross the Bahia Sea to the Wollaston
islands, the archipelago which includes Cape Horn.
Having landed on Cape Horn island, the canoeists will wait for a window in
the almost permanent gales until they can circumnavigate the island. They
then return in the support boat.
On board the Skyring, Nigel Tedeschi, a BT research engineer, will operate a
miniaturised Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver which, using a small
satellite aerial the size of a motorcyclist's helmet, will calculate the
boat's position using three satellites.
The position will be transmitted using a rugged notebook-sized computer and
portable C-Sat terminal up to the Inmarsat-C satellite, and from there via
an earth station in the Netherlands to BT's research establishment at
Martlesham, Suffolk. Here it will be fed into a new computerised tracking
system being developed for the Whitbread race which will supply
laser-printed maps showing the canoeists' daily progress to ITN and Anglia
TV, also following the voyage.
Since the support boat and the canoeists will not always be together, a
second GPS receiver and aerial will be carried in one of the double canoes.
It will record a half-hourly fix which will be handed over to Tedeschi when
the canoeists liaise.
The expedition's position will also be relayed from Martlesham to the
Meteorological Office in Aberdeen. There it will be fed into a computer
model of the weather around Cape Horn composed from reports from a variety
of stations and passing ships.
Aberdeen will issue a daily weather forecast including the expected height
of waves each morning, stepping up their frequency for the crossing of the
Bahia Sea and for the circumnavigation of Cape Horn Island. 'Depressions can
come through there at the rate of three in 24 hours,' says Ridgway. 'We need
to wait for an anticyclone for the voyage round the island.'
The weather forecasts will be sent at speeds of up to 600 bits per second to
the C-Sat terminal on the Skyring, where Tedeschi will pass them to the
canoe party.
For the voyage around the Horn, the C-Sat terminal and the computer will be
installed on one of the double canoes so that stories can be written and
filed from the canoes. 'The kit all fits very snugly into the bulkhead,'
says Tedeschi. The terminal is about the size of a car radio.
All yachts in the Whitbread race will be equipped with this C-Sat system,
for which BT envisages a large market among yachtsmen. Some, however, will
also install equipment which will remedy a shortcoming of the last Whitbread
race: the lack of 'off-the-deck' TV footage.
To achieve this, BT has adapted videophone technology to the problem of
bringing pictures from remote sites with minimal power sources. It has
developed a small codec, a device which converts video signals from a camera
into compressed digital data for satellite transmission.
Signals from the codec will be transmitted over the Inmarsat-A satellite.
Without compression through the codec, such a signal would require a
satellite pathway more than 2,000 times larger than that available to a
moving source such as a racing yacht, requiring much larger equipment.
The VC-9000 codec (which weighs only 8kg, one-fifth the size of a US rival)
can handle data at 64 Kbits per second, much faster than any previous unit.
It also requires only 400 watts of power to transmit.
This will allow live TV pictures to be transmitted from yachts anywhere in
the world and interviewers in the studio can interrogate yacht skippers at
sea.
'We have taken the videophone to sea. The implications for all kinds of
remote sporting events and expeditions are enormous,' said Edward Scott of
BT. 'But so are they also for businesses that operate in remote areas.'
Oil companies exploring in remote parts of the Soviet Union are interested,
he says. 'The problems of sending back vast quantities of seismic data are
quite similar to the technical parameters of moving television pictures
about.'
