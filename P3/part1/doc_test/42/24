Highlight 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day layover, caused partly by equipment malfunction, Tony's 
entourage finally left the country Tuesday and flew through heavy clouds. The 
travelers cleared customs in Moncton, Canada, where they planned to spend the 
night. Today, they will try to make up lost time by flying about six hours 
through to Iqaluit, on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
