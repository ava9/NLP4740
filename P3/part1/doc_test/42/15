<P>
Tony Aliengena, the boy aviator from San Juan Capistrano trying to become the 
youngest person to circle the world, crossed the United States on Saturday 
afternoon but landed in Boston with equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical malfunctions plagued not only his plane, but one of his two chase 
planes as well. 
</P>
<P>
The autopilot mechanism on Tony's single-engine Cessna Centurion malfunctioned 
during his 2 1/2-hour flight between National Airport in Washington and 
Lawrence Airport, outside Boston, according to his father, Gary Aliengena. 
</P>
<P>
But the chase plane flown by California physician Lance Allyn was forced to 
make an emergency landing immediately after takeoff from National Airport when 
smoke began pouring from the instrument panel of his twin-engine King Air and 
filled the pressurized aircraft, which held five other members of Tony's 
entourage for the seven-week around-the-world Friendship Flight. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured, although Allyn and all his passengers, including 
this reporter, were treated for smoke inhalation by paramedics after the 
aircraft managed a successful landing at National. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the smoke had not been immediately determined by late Saturday, 
but mechanics who inspected the King Air said a faulty clutch gear was 
suspected. Repairs were expected to be completed by Monday, after which Allyn 
and his passengers were expected to rejoin Tony and the other chase plane in 
Boston by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Aliengena, the autopilot mechanism is needed so the 
11-year-old flier won't have to operate the plane manually during long 
stretches of the journey, such as the upcoming flight over the icy North 
Atlantic this week. Gary Aliengena said he hoped the aircraft could be repaired 
in time to resume the journey on schedule Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tony -- who set out Monday in his father's Cessna perched atop 
a car seat so he can see over the controls -- has logged more than 3,300 miles 
with stops in six U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
The boy will spend today, his first full day of rest, with a visit to his 
grandparents' home in nearby Palmer, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tony and his family are scheduled to start the day by unfurling a 
1,000-foot scroll that bears good-will messages from more than 250,000 American 
youngsters to their counterparts in the Soviet Union, where Tony is headed on 
the friendship mission. Tony plans to present the scroll to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
But the scroll ceremony, which is scheduled to be televised on NBC's "Today" 
show, depends on the timely arrival of the scroll, which was being carried in 
Allyn's plane and was to be shipped by commercial air carrier today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross North Atlantic 
</P>
<P>
The current schedule calls for Tony to leave Massachusetts at mid-morning 
Monday in his father's Cessna for the long journey north through Canada and 
across the North Atlantic to Scandinavia, where he is due to arrive Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony and the pilots of two other small planes accompanying him flew 
through some rough weather in the United States, their real concern has been in 
crossing the icy north. Tony will be flying through an area where temperatures 
hover near freezing and ocean waters are so cold that it takes only a minute 
for a person to lose consciousness after falling in. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena was so concerned with the North Atlantic crossing that he 
enlarged the plane's fuel tank to extend its flying range to 1,500 miles 
instead of 900. And he is arranging to have his wife, Sue, and their 
10-year-old daughter, Alaina, fly in a separate plane while he and Tony brave 
the crossing together. The family has been flying in the same plane with Tony. 
</P>
<P>
A jovial man by nature, Aliengena, 39, does not joke about the ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put a jinx on it," he said last week in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony's flying range is more than adequate for the crossing -- he will 
be refueling in Greenland and Iceland -- there are two potential dangers. One 
is that his tiny plane could ice over if he cannot break free of clouds. The 
other is that his high-performance turbo engine could simply stall out. 
</P>
<P>
While flying from Denver to Lincoln on Wednesday, Aliengena recalled an 
incident a few years ago in which the engine on his Cessna failed and he was 
forced to glide to the ground without power. The Cessna is capable of gliding 
as far as 14 miles, a statistic that means little over open water. At his 
longest stretch, between Reykjavik, Iceland, and Oslo, Norway, Tony will face 
more than 500 miles of iceberg-strewn ocean. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Cessna has been operating normally, except for a compass that went 
out in thunderstorms over the Rocky Mountains and the autopilot malfunction 
Saturday. Also, the engine has experienced some difficulty maintaining enough 
pressure to climb above 17,000 feet. It is designed to ascend above 20,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the worst, Tony attended a water survival course before the 
trip and is carrying wet suits and flares aboard his aircraft. The other two 
planes, carrying an entourage of journalists and film makers, are carrying 
inflatable rafts. 
</P>
<P>
Plane icing was somewhat of a problem for Tony as he winged his way across the 
United States. Between Salt Lake City and Denver, he picked up such heavy ice 
that he was forced to descend rapidly. And en route to Lincoln, ice crystals 
obstructed his view as he cruised at 17,000 feet through the tops of clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter Hagen, a National Aeronautic Assn. observer who is riding in Tony's 
plane to verify a world record, said that icing of a plane's wings increases 
the danger of a stall. He said ice can also build on a propeller, causing it to 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn, a Hanford, Calif., surgeon who is piloting the twin-engine King Air 
behind Tony, said that a friend of his got caught in an ice storm over Idaho, 
lost control and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"He put the plane and his family in the ground," Allyn said, adding that there 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid ice, Allyn said a pilot must steer clear of foul weather and detour 
around clouds at altitudes where icing is likely. A factor in Tony's favor, 
Hagen said, is that cloud cover in the northern latitudes rarely exceeds 9,000 
feet at this time of the year, enabling him to easily break free into the clear 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
The arctic cold will be coming after a week in which Tony and his entourage 
enjoyed warm, enthusiastic receptions at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
In Utah, Tony was presented with proclamations from the governor and the mayor 
of Salt Lake City. In Nebraska, he was given a key to the city of Lincoln and 
made honorary citizen of the state as well as its ambassador to the Soviet 
Union. And in Washington, Mayor Marion Barry presented Tony with a 
proclamation. Tony was also treated to a Saturday morning tour of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people across the United States have turned out to sign Tony's 
friendship scroll and get a close-up look at the fourth-grade boy who sports a 
buzz cut and loves to horseplay with other children when he is outside of the 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my grandchildren should see something really important, so I just 
brought them out here," said Nebraskan Elaine Muggy, 70, who signed the scroll 
in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Thompson, 36, a toy salesman in St. Louis, Mo., brought his children, 
Jeff, 8, and Alona, 10, to watch Tony's plane land Thursday at St. Louis' 
Lambert International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show my kids that they can realize their dreams too," Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also waiting at each stop have been knots of local media, which assaulted Tony 
with cameras and questions as he stepped from the cockpit. He patiently fielded 
the same questions with almost identical responses in every city. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln, Tony drew applause from both press and local dignitaries when he 
answered a question about his primary message to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be friends more than enemies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Always hovering beside Tony during these news conferences has been his father, 
who invariably has to elaborate on his son's comments because Tony is not 
comfortable at public speaking. Tony became so press-weary in Denver, for 
example, that he cut the questioning short and rushed inside the airport 
terminal. He also tired of the public adulation, breezing by some giggling 
girls in Lincoln who wanted to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Tony reached St. Louis, however, he was considerably more upbeat. 
Not only did he shake hands with well-wishers, but he stood by the friendship 
scroll and handed out autographed pictures of himself with his sister, Alaina. 
</P>
<P>
On the scroll, American youngsters left a wide variety of messages for the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, we can make the world a better place," wrote Angie Bunch of St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's spend more time making friends than weapons," added Rachel Tiemann of 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In Nebraska, one scroll signer wrote: "Hey Gorby, let's do lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Garnering almost as much curiosity as Tony have been the three Soviet citizens 
who have accompanied him on the trip. At news conferences, Tony and his father 
always introduce his 10-year-old Soviet pen pal, Roman Tchermenykh, as well as 
Soviet journalists Maxim Chikin, 27, and Aleksei Grinevich, also 27.
