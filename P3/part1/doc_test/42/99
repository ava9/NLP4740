new heights - Andrew Baxter charts the growth of Simon Engineering's powered
access division

FOR the superstitious, ladders are best circumnavigated. For John Barker,
head of the world's largest producer of powered access equipment, they mean
competition - along with scaffolding.
Over the past 18 years Mr Barker, managing director of Simon Access, has
built up what is now a division of Stockport-based Simon Engineering from
virtually nothing to a Pounds 150m business. But unlike his products, some
of which can soar 200ft in the air, he is keeping his feet firmly on the
ground.
In its headquarters building on the edge of a rambling Gloucester industrial
estate, Simon Access keeps a database on more than 350 competitors in the
world powered access industry, and on all its markets by geography and
product sector. 'If you asked me for a projection on the utility sector in
Peru in 1994, I could give you one,' he says.
The meticulous research allows Mr Barker to make a prediction which might
look odd to observers of an industry that has been badly hit by the
recession - especially in the US and UK construction markets.
A world market worth just Pounds 1.2bn in 1990 could grow to Pounds 1.7bn by
1995, he says, and Simon plans to raise its share from 15 per cent to
between 20 and 25 per cent.
'It's not pie in the sky,' Mr Barker insists. Instead, he says, it will
require capi-talising fully on a 15-year global acquisition and development
strategy that has turned the Access division into Simon's second largest
be-hind process engineering, and an increasingly important part of the
company as a whole.
The development of Simon Access has coincided with the growth from infancy
of an oddball industry producing hundreds of assorted pro-ducts ranging from
simple powered platforms for industrial use to self-propelled scissor units
and fire units for rescuing people trapped in blazing buildings.
Apart from Simon Access, main groups are US-based or Japanese, but can be
counted on one hand. Behind them comes a second division of strong regional
or national producers, and then hundreds of niche companies. All are serving
markets with very different characteristics and business cycles, and
customers with contrasting preferences and traditions.
In the US, for example, utilities prefer to work on live wires, whereas the
current is normally turned off in Europe, leading to totally different
design priorities.
Mr Barker has therefore had to steer a steady course between recognising the
necessity of staying close to his diverse customer base while deriving
manufacturing, product and engineering synergies from a dozen acquisitions
and internal expansion.
Simon-Dudley, the original Simon powered access company, had suffered badly
in the early 1970s with fixed-price contracts in an era of 20 per cent
inflation, but was also based exclusively on truck-mounted platforms. Mr
Barker determined to develop powered access as a global market, filling in
geographic and product gaps - preferably simultaneously, and by by buying
market leaders.
A key move came in 1978 with the purchase of a Milwaukee-based company now
called Simon Aerials, which had developed a range of self-propelled
platforms. Three years later, Mr Barker bought Gala, a Thetford-based
company with a complementary range of self-propelled machines.
As Simon acquired companies, it tended to move them up-market, so in 1987,
Barker went to Cork in Ireland to buy Eurolift, a manufacturer of smaller
self-propelled machines, to maintain its position at the lower end of the
market.
The biggest acquisition came in 1988 with the purchase of Telelect, a
leading US manufacturer of digger derricks, telescopic aerials and cranes.
Simon paid an initial Dollars 33.6m, plus at least Dollars 7.26m based on
Telelect profits over the next three years.
By this time, however, Mr Barker was thinking of two important markets he
had 'put to one side' because of earlier difficulties establishing a
presence - Germany and Japan.
In Germany, Mr Barker set up a new company in 1987 after previous
acquisition attempts failed. Reunification and the subsequent upturn in
construction activity produced 'a real success story' last year, he says.
But until 1989 the most important gap was Japan, which accounts for 25 per
cent of the world market. Ten years ago Mr Barker tried unsuccessfully to
buy Aichi Sharyo, the market leader, but now has a joint venture with Tomen,
one of the big Japanese trading houses.
While Aichi and Simon pursue a ding-dong battle in Asia, in Japan the UK
company is attacking the newer markets for scissor and self-propelled boom
units rather than Aichi's stranglehold on the truck-mounted sector.
With the Japanese joint venture, Simon Access has all but completed its
global acquisition programme. 'We've dealt ourselves a hand, now we've got
to play it skilfully,' says Mr Barker.
But can it match an internal projection which would imply lifting sales to
about Pounds 340m in 1995 - after a tough year in 1991?
In its favour is its increasing emphasis on product sectors, such as the
utilities business, which are less sensitive to recession. The business just
about broke even in the 1980-81 recession, and, says Mr Barker, 'the whole
plan nearly came unstuck.'
Mr Barker hopes Simon Access will be able to take the next downturn on the
chin, but this time round, profits are down sharply.
Mr Tim Bennett of Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham broker, forecasts profits
of Pounds 7m for 1991, down from Pounds 11.8m in 1990 - a figure which he
has recalculated to reflect property profits made by Simon as a whole.
Mr Bennett forecasts Pounds 8m for this year, which he hopes might prove
conservative. There is real recovery potential, he says, at Simon Aerials in
Milwaukee, and the possibility that some of the smaller-pocketed competitors
in the US might withdraw.
The real test for Mr Barker and Simon Access in the 1990s will be its
ability to move equipment into new markets, and make the most of synergies
that are not available to its competitors. Sourcing from the UK and US to
sell into continental Europe or Japan will keep Simon busy, says Mr Bennett.
Mr Barker believes that some of the cross-fertilisation he has developed
over the past decade is beginning to acquire its own momentum, without
smothering the small-company innovation enshrined in the division's federal
structure.
There is, though, a nagging problem for Simon Access that does not affect
niche players nearly so much - global differences in standards and
specification. Conversely, once common standards are introduced - and
progress has already been achieved - an increased emphasis on safety and
technology makes it harder for the smaller companies to compete.
On Monday, Simon Access announced an order worth more than Pounds 1m to
supply a cross-section of 23 machines built in the UK, Ireland and the US to
Hertz Equipment Rental in Spain. Mr Barker will need plenty more orders like
that to meet his targets.
