Accountants are not expected to do the circus books for a decade before
suddenly deciding to perform in the Big Top. Nigel Rowe was never, in fact,
a bean-counter. But as group corporate affairs director of BOC, he spent
more than a decade orchestrating the company's sponsorship of its solo
round-the-world yacht race.
All those years being the suit among a sea of yellow wellies obviously had
an effect on Rowe, 53, for here he is in Cape Town, competing in the race
aboard his own 50ft yacht Sky Catcher, and embarking on the 7,000-mile
second leg through the freezing, lonely Southern Ocean to Sydney.
Rowe's career is on hold while he takes a year's leave of absence from the
boardroom to scratch an itch that became a nagging compulsion. He is short
of money, sometimes short of motivation - in short, enduring all the trials
and tribulations that he had watched, as a detached observer, during the
past three BOC races. (The race has been held every four years since 1982).
Sky Catcher's skipper found that several transatlantic crossings lasting
three weeks or so had hardly prepared him for 52 days of solo racing between
the race-start off Charleston, South Carolina, and the first-leg finish in
Cape Town's Table Bay.
'It was exhausting beyond belief, with just an hour or so's sleep at a time,
and I came to hate the monotony of tinned food,' Rowe told me. After two
weeks' Cape sunshine, he is bearded and tanned.
Being intensely competitive, and having spent thousands of pounds he could
ill afford to make Sky Catcher go a little faster, Rowe also suffered
agonies through making some unfortunate routing decisions across the
Doldrums and finishing a whole 10 days behind the Class II leaders.
Some of his enforced leisure went into starting an account of his voyage for
publication next year. Most race accounts are written by professional
yachtsmen, who have little experience of life away from the sea. What
promises to make Rowe's book more absorbing is the semi-detachment of a
successful middle-aged man looking at an escapade that has more emotional
than rational underpinning.
For example, after his last business meeting in London, Rowe made the
somewhat childish gesture (his words) of ripping off his tie and stuffing it
into a Tottenham Court Road rubbish bin.
Here is his account of his first evening at sea on the first leg. 'I felt
strange and unsettled. I loaded the CD player. Paris Texas first up, then
Leonard Cohen's Songs From a Room. Then more like it that were in harmony
with the melancholy I felt. These feelings needed some freedom to express
themselves and be felt ..
'It was a new recognition of the magnitude of the undertaking ahead of me,
and the fact that despite all the time, money and effort that had gone into
the project over the past couple of years, this was still only the
beginning. It had cost a lot just to get to this point, but now the
planning, the preparations, the talking, had come to an abrupt halt and now
the job itself had to be done.
'I had put so much at risk to do it - at the very minimum an uninsured boat
that had soaked up every penny of my savings - and the anguish I was putting
others ashore through while I was at sea alone was something I could not
ignore.'
These were first-night nerves. But worse was to come. After a
week-and-a-half at sea, Rowe realised that through a combination of
inexperience and stubbornness, he had sailed into a large, windless 'hole'
just south and east of Bermuda.
Some of his rivals were clocking 300-mile days, while Sky Catcher drifted
around like the proverbial painted ship on Coleridge's painted ocean. Rowe's
account is painfully honest:
'Finally, I cracked. My diary entry for September 29: 'After another bad
night and little prospect of improvement in the next couple of days, I
realise that making up the ground I've lost is virtually impossible.' After
all the time, preparations, expense and other sacrifices, I'd managed to
blow the race in the first couple of weeks. It was no one's fault but mine.
I'd read it all wrong and taken a very bad decision on the weather - and the
price was too much to bear.
'That afternoon I stood in the cockpit, clenched fists in the air, and
screamed at the top of my voice: 'Giiiive meeeee mooooore wiiiiiind]' I
stamped my feet. I thumped the side of the cockpit with my fist until it
hurt. Then I did it all over again before slumping into the bottom of the
cockpit feeling both better and worse after my tantrum.'
Of course, things improved. The breeze arrived, the sun shone, dolphins
criss-crossed the bow-wave and Rowe found an unexpected bottle of champagne
cooling in the bilge. Life can't all be bad when you've got a year off and
your suits are locked in the wardrobe back at home.
Whether choosing to confront the competitive pressures of an event like the
BOC race is a sensible thing for a middle-aged executive to do seems
doubtful to me. Certainly the spice of competition and the locker-room
camaraderie are vivid ingredients of the experience. But it has a brutal
downside, as Rowe has discovered: winning and losing.
Perhaps spectator sports arose because so few of us are willing to tolerate
the brutal intensities between first and last place down in the arena - or
out on the ocean. I look forward to Rowe's next despatch from Sky Catcher.
