and the salary that went with it - to fulfil a dream that had become
something of an obsession, I attended a conference in London on global
excellence.
The conference, organised by the Confederation of British Industry, the
employers' organisation, had been inspired and sponsored by BOC, the
industrial gases and healthcare group. It was my last duty for the company.
John Stopford, of the London Business School, was one of the principal
speakers and, like all business school professors, he could not resist the
opportunity to coin a new phrase. What British industry needed, he said,
were Big Hairy Ambitious Goals.
I sat at the back of the hall and smiled. Yes, I thought, I knew what it was
like to have a BHAG, even if the professor and the 250 company directors
present might not too readily relate to it. For I was about to compete in
the BOC Challenge 1994-95 single-handed, round-the-world race.
As I left the conference I took off my tie and dropped it into a waste bin
in Tottenham Court Road. Perhaps it was a childish act of worthless
symbolism, but I remember doing the same when I left school.
I flew to the US two days later to ready my 48ft sailing boat Sky Catcher
for the last phase of our preparations together - two transatlantic
crossings, including a single-handed race in July, also sponsored by BOC.
We left Charleston, South Carolina, just before midnight on Thursday 12 May
 -it being a tradition born out of superstition that one should not begin a
passage on a Friday, least of all on one that carried with it the additional
stigma of being the 13th. Now, a little over a week and two gales later, we
are about a third of the way across to Falmouth, and I have had time to
reflect on what brought me here.
My guess is a combination of balance, opportunity and curiosity (it may be
some time before I can shake off the initials BOC).
Very few of us achieve a healthy balance of interests and contrast in our
lives. A successful business makes many demands on its managers. Life's
priorities are driven overwhelmingly by those at the office. Further, the
more senior one's position, the more dependant corporate man becomes on the
trappings and comforts of higher office. Less and less of this experience is
enriching in any but a material way and it is often poor preparation for the
rest of life. I know too many people who were burned out when they retired
to face a long list of things they wished they had done and now cannot. I
want to avoid that.
Opportunities must be grasped when they appear. But another lesson from
corporate life is that they can also be created, even if at some cost. I was
fortunate to be able to negotiate this opportunity and was prepared to meet
the cost in terms of loss of salary and future security.
But curiosity has been the principal motivation in this endeavour. I am
curious about what it will teach me about myself as well as other people,
places and things. I am also curious about what will be demanded of me to
meet the challenge of this undertaking.
I initiated BOC's sponsorship of the BOC Challenge more than 12 years ago
when I had been sailing for only a couple of years. Such feats as a solo
circum-
navigation were beyond my imagination then. The 1994-95 race, which starts
from Charleston on September 17th, will be its fourth edition. Now, I have
many thousands of miles of sailing experience; but I know nothing of the
windless doldrums or of the Southern Ocean with its screaming winds,
icebergs and the infamous Cape Horn. I am curious about how I shall deal
with all of that.
Knowledge gained from a long and happy life in the corporate womb may not
help me much.
