There were no final instructions from father to son Monday morning before 
11-year-old Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano nosed his family's 
single-engine plane into the gray spring sky, beginning a journey that is 
designed to make him the youngest aviator to circle the globe. 
</P>
<P>
But the fourth-grader -- who must pilot the plane unaided to land a spot in the 
record books -- had some emphatic advice to his father, who will sit beside the 
youngster in the cockpit during the entire odyssey of seven to eight weeks over 
the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Don't touch anything, Dad!' " Gary Aliengena said with a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
With those instructions -- amid speeches, hugs and clicking cameras -- the 
pint-size pilot with the buzz-cut hair climbed into a booster seat to see over 
the cockpit and took the controls of the red-white-and-blue Cessna 210 at John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's 17,000-mile trip has been dubbed the Friendship Flight because he will 
deliver more than 50,000 letters from U.S. schoolchildren to Soviet youngsters. 
He also hopes to present Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a massive 
"friendship scroll," filled with youngsters' signatures gathered along the way. 
</P>
<P>
It is a heady undertaking for any pilot, but at a press conference before his 
takeoff, Tony, in his own way, gently reminded the reporters shouting questions 
at him on the Tarmac that he is, after all, only a kid. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he envisions his meeting with Gorbachev, Tony replied: "I'll shake 
his hand. Then he'll say something. Then I'll show him my scroll." 
</P>
<P>
And he insisted that he is not nervous about flying so far and over the 
forbidding breadth of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like flying anywhere," he said, standing on a stool so he could be seen 
while speaking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waved to Crowd on Takeoff 
</P>
<P>
Then, after more interviews, autograph requests and pictures, Tony and his 
entourage were off, waving to the crowd of friends and journalists lining the 
runway. In his plane were his father and mother; his sister, Alaina, 10; a 
Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, and an observer from the National Aeronautic 
Assn., who is along to verify that Tony piloted the aircraft. Two chase planes, 
carrying luggage, letters, journalists and a film crew, are also making the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
During the flight, Tony was confidently sassy, joking over the radio with Lance 
Allyn, owner and pilot of one of the two chase planes, about the chance for 
clouds and thundershowers. And when Allyn's bigger and faster twin-engine King 
Air plane was catching up to Tony's craft, the young pilot treated it like a 
friendly race, remarking, "Get your butt in gear!" 
</P>
<P>
His landing 3 1/2 hours later in Salt Lake City was marked by another moment of 
adolescent expression: a mad dash by Tony and his sister to the vending 
machines to fill up on junk food. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, however, lagged behind. The aircraft had hit turbulent skies, which were 
cloudy up to 19,000 feet. Tony's plane flew in clouds at an altitude of 15,000 
feet, unable to ascend higher because the cabin of the six-seater is not 
pressurized. The 11-year-old pen pal was plagued by airsickness three times 
during the 650-mile first leg, his first flight in a small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, who suffered from the same malady during his record-setting flight across 
the country and back last year, made it through Monday's flight without 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday afternoon, Roman was feeling well enough to venture out with 
Tony in a small boat on a man-made lake at the Salt Lake City airport hotel. 
However, the two quickly returned to solid ground when their vessel began 
taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first air mile was even logged on the Friendship Flight, Tony 
received a hero's send-off at Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport. The site 
was marked by a giant arch of helium balloons in blue, red and yellow -- the 
mingled colors of the United States and the Soviet Union. Members of the group 
that organized the trip wore T-shirts emblazoned with the flight's logo: two 
hands -- one with stars and stripes, the other with sickle and hammer -- 
reaching across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet official at the press conference at Martin Aviation called Tony's 
trip "a historical moment." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's trip will touch "millions and millions of children and open the door for 
global communication," said Gennady P. Alferenko, chairman of the Foundation 
for Social Inventions of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet organization that sanctioned 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, he said, "is very famous in the Soviet Union" because newspapers there 
have already published many of the schoolchildren's friendship letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, my country was very closed. There was no chance to see other places," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling to other places and seeing other cultures used to be "crazy ideas," 
Alferenko said. "It's time now. Let's be crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Martin, 87, whose airfield eventually gave way to Orange County 
Airport, presented Tony with a bolo tie clasp emblazoned with the words 
Aviation Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told the crowd that he is proud of the boy. While he said Tony probably 
did not need advice, Martin warned him to be careful of ice. 
</P>
<P>
"He's flying a very cold part of the country," he said. "If he gets into ice, I 
hope he turns around" and returns to safer skies. 
</P>
<P>
There were no crowds for Tony's arrival in Salt Lake City, but more than 100 
schoolchildren later showed up at the airport to sign the scroll. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in the increased relationship between our country and 
Russia, and we just thought it was neat that this boy would do something like 
that on his own," said Diann Brown, who brought her four children to the 
airport from Kaysville, 40 miles away, to sign the scroll. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't want to do it," her 12-year-old daughter, Annamarie, added with 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Mayor Palmer A. DePaulis, presenting a proclamation to the young 
pilot, said Tony's mission represents "a hope that some of our young children 
can accomplish what the older generation has not." 
</P>
<P>
Today's flight plan calls for a two-hour, 350-mile trip to Denver. The 
entourage is planning an early departure to avert thundershowers that might 
reach the Rocky Mountains by afternoon.
