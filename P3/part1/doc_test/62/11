Paul Hemphill sets the tone of this sentimental but endearing story by having 
his foil, the 40-ish son of the book's main character, reading the familiar 
Dylan Thomas poem, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night," to a class of 
stupos in his last teaching day at an obscure junior college in the Florida 
Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
The verse, "Rage, rage against the dying of the light . . .", is, of course, 
meant to prepare the reader for what's next, which is the son's return home to 
see his aging father who is currently incarcerated in a fundamentalist 
alcoholism-rehabilitation facility after being expelled from the retirement 
center where he and his wife have been living since she came down with 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Hawkins finds his father Jake practically terrorizing the 
alcohol-treatment facility -- gambling with the patients, playing loud music, 
disrupting activities and finally making good with his threat to run away. Now, 
old Jake is a "character," as the saying goes -- profane, joke-cracking, 
cigar-smoking and bourbon-drinking, an ex-trucker who has been stewing in his 
juices since he gave up the road several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Jake does when he gets back to the old family home in a rundown 
blue-collar section of Birmingham is start drinking whiskey again and 
reminiscing with Sonny about brighter days. Sonny, a recovering alcoholic 
himself, accepts all this bluster and braggadocio as stoically as he can until 
Jake starts talking about going back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Out behind the house is Jake's old truck, the Dixie Redball IV, idle for years 
until Jake begins to tinker with it again. It isn't long before the Redball is 
spit-and-polished and ready to roll. Jake persuades an old acquaintance, a tire 
dealer he's served for years hauling retreads, to let him make one last haul. 
Sonny, naturally, is appalled at the idea of a 70-year-old drunk getting behind 
the wheel, but Jake manages to persuade his old boss to let him deliver a load 
of tires out to Nevada and then pick up another load of recaps for the trip 
home. It's not that Jake is just a simple trucker, he's also an expert in the 
bidding and buying of tires he hauls. 
</P>
<P>
Well, nothing will do except that Sonny must accompany Jake on this "last 
roundup," as it were, and the pair of them -- sad, middle age failure Sonny and 
crazy, twilight-yeared, irascible Jake -- set out on a 5,000-mile cross-country 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
You can't help but like old Jake. He might be a stubborn, opinionated racist 
but he also can be tender and understanding, and able to enjoy the company of 
blacks. He always finds ingenious ways to avoid the roadside truck scales and 
fleeces gouging motel owners who are trying to fleece him. At an age when Sonny 
ought to be "fathering" Jake, it is just the other way around. Sonny marvels at 
his father's stamina and courage at a time when his own is faltering. 
</P>
<P>
This father-and-son odyssey takes Jake and Sonny on back roads Jake never needs 
a map for, and to nostalgic old haunts decaying amid modern progress. In one 
touching episode, Jake pulls off at an ancient truck stop he always used to 
stay in, only to find it shut down and empty, victim of a new interstate 
highway nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But in a small dwelling behind the place, Jake finds Minnie, wife of the owner 
-- who has since died -- and she reopens the restaurant one last time, just for 
them, serving a dinner of "chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes and sawmill 
gravy, and biscuits." By the end of the evening, Jake and Minnie are dancing to 
Country tunes played on an old Wurlitzer. "While the fiddles played, Minnie 
took Jake by the hand and led him to the jukebox. She in her denim skirt, he in 
cowboy boots and polyester slacks of hideous green, they held each other close 
and danced. Across the road, the new moon and the stars high in the Kansas sky 
glistened on the lazy Arkansas River. On the road itself, the loneliest road in 
America, big rigs thundered into the night, rattling the windows as they 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, this novel is a labor of love, of the admiration of a son 
for his father, which is probably not such a common thing these days, if it 
ever was. Hemphill obviously knows what he's talking about when it comes to 
trucks and trucking, and the dedication for the book cites his father as "the 
last trucker." But the story also fulfills its original premise -- that of the 
Dylan Thomas poem -- and it is uplifting to see the triumph of old Jake 
Hawkins, raging successfully against "the dying of the light." 
</P>
<P>
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of 
day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
