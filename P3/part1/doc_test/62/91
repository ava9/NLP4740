If you've read most of the movie reviews, you know how vital it is to avoid -- 
at all costs -- the hopelessly dumb "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." On 
the other hand, the film's sound track is a delight, especially for hard-rock 
fans who'll appreciate such high decibel rockers as Shark Island's "Father 
Time," Extreme's "Play With Me" and Vital Signs' "The Boys and Girls Are Doing 
It." Oddly enough, the record's most infectious potential single is "In Time," 
an ear-catching ballad performed by Robbie Robb. It's especially ear-catching 
if you've just listened to U-2's "With or Without You." We couldn't help but 
notice a curious resemblance, especially in the lilting melody and ringing 
guitar-chord departments. Think Bono would agree? . . . If they gave Grammy 
nods to reggae sound tracks, the year's most adventuresome entry would be the 
music to "The Mighty Quinn," the upcoming thriller starring Denzel Washington 
and Robert Townshend. Due out from A&amp;M Records, the sound track features "I 
Gotta Keep Moving On" by UB-40, "Groove Master" by Arrow, "Giving/Sharing" by 
Half Pint and "Send Fi Spanish Fly" by Little Twitch. The title cut, performed 
by Sheryl Lee Ralph with Cedella Marley and Sharon Marley Prendergast (both Bob 
Marley daughters), has new lyrics rewritten (with Bob Dylan's permission) to 
fit the plot of the film. . . . And thanks to Rhino Records, a classic live 
double album -- "The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival 1976" -- is back 
in print. Available in all formats, it offers performances by Allen Toussaint, 
Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas and Professor Longhair.
