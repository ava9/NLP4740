Herbert Lomas believes we are born into caste not class

TO BE a poet in the land of Shakespeare can these days be rather
embarrassing.
So when he goes to parties, Herbert Lomas prefers to conceal his real
profession. He introduces himself as a critic or retired lecturer (which he
is), or as a translator of Finnish literature (for which Finland knighted
him in December).
'People think poetry has nothing to do with what life is about,' he said,
'having houses and consuming and making money and watching the television.
What they'd really like to know is how you make money out of it.'
When they learn the truth about him, they feel awkward. ''What kind of
poetry do you write,' they ask. It's an almost unanswerable question. They
hope you're going to reply 'Oh, well, I write erotic poetry. It's all about
getting into bed with people.''
In his case, some of it is. But that is not the reason he does it. He is a
poet because he cannot help it.
'One writes poetry because one writes it. It's part of one's
self-definition. I tend to believe in Sartre's view that you make a kind of
choice of yourself, you know. You make it at a very early age and having
made this choice of yourself you're stuck with it.'
Yet it is not simply a matter of choice, either. During a long, whisky-fired
conversation at his house on the seafront at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, I learned
that Lomas has a more metaphysical explanation of why he is a poet and not,
say, a merchant banker.
He is a Yorkshireman born in a pub in the Pennines, the Black Swan at
Todmorden. His stern mother was the daughter of a bankrupt mill-owner, his
gifted but uneducated father was the son of a master dyer.
'I think a lot of poets are people with very articulate parents, especially
working class people because their creativity comes out in their language
and their conversation.
'People like Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas come from those environments. I
mean, Shakespeare's father was a butcher. People tried to say he couldn't be
a butcher's son, he must be an aristocrat's son. It's much more likely he
was a butcher's son because of the way he uses words.'
But it is caste, rather than class, that Lomas thinks defined him.
He believes he was born a Brahmin. 'I don't say it with any pride. I just
think it's a fact.'
Indeed, like the Hindus, he believes that we are all type-cast: whether as
Brahmins, the intellectuals and contemplatives; as Kshatriyas, the
administrators and soldiers; as Banyas (or Vaishyas), the businessmen; or as
Shudras, the ones who do the work.
'The trouble is, they're not always in the right place. For example, I think
Mrs Thatcher is a Banya, a grocer. And when you get the grocers doing the
jobs of the Brahmins and Kshatriyas, things go wrong.' He described his
wife, Mary, as a model Kshatriya.
Poetry, then, is a typically Brahmin activity which in Britain and America
happens to have been shoved aside by our preoccupation with business and
money.
Lomas once wrote a book called Who Needs Money? in which he argued - he says
in the spirit of authentic Marxism - that with the proper use of modern
technology we could solve all our economic problems in 20 years' time. If we
really wished, we could abolish obsolescence and increase the supply of
goods to the point where prices fell to nothing and the stuff could be given
away.
It was a Utopian book, he said, but one day it would be proved correct.
And what is the poet's message to the Banyas then? I asked.
'Know your place.'
Lomas laughed. He has a repertoire of laughs and it is not always easy to
tell what they convey. They can be prompted by a happy phrase, by an awkward
admission, by modesty, and by dislike as well as by a sense of fun or the
absurd.
'You shouldn't ask doctors to behave like grocers,' Lomas added. 'Don't try
to introduce buying and selling into universities, into hospitals.'
Does the poet look down on the Banyas?
'No, the poet admires their economic skills. What he does not admire is when
they interfere in things they don't understand.'
Does he feel sorry for them that they don't have a broader aim in life?
'I'm an egalitarian. I think everybody is of equal value; but they lose
their value when they start trying to do something that doesn't belong to
their particular skills.'
Herbert Lomas has strong opinions, about God, sex and economics, but their
expression is modestly ironical rather than aggressive. He is stimulating
and sociable in his seclusion.
'I like people - and I like people more than most people like people, I
think. I need social things. But even more I need solitude. And I haven't
had enough of it in my life.'
Although he has had five volumes of poetry published and has been praised by
WH Auden, Lomas has one great regret: that he did not give up his lecturing
job in London sooner. 'I used to get drained at the end of term like an
accumulator that's spent all its energy. I used to come here, often alone,
and I would open out like one of those Japanese flowers in a shell.'
Does being here by the sea help you?
'Oh, that helps enormously. The sea gives you that cosmic feeling. You
realise you're on a planet when you look at it. And then there is just the
amazing fact of all that water - just as the eye makes you realise about
God.'
When I asked whether poetry had become irrelevant, Lomas replied that a lot
more people wrote it than read it, but would not admit to doing so. 'There's
a kind of spectrum. The poet is the man next door at one end and Lord Byron
at the other.'
In his case, the conviction that he was a poet came at about the age of
seven. He described an early classroom trial:
'We had to write a poem and were given the first line, which was pretty
boring: 'I like the trees with leaves of green.' And I thought now, if I'm a
poet, I've got to do the best of the class.
'I thought of it rather like a crossword puzzle. So I asked a little girl
what she thought the second line was and she said: 'The stately form, just
like a queen' and she posed like something between a tree and a queen. That
really inspired me. And I was away. I can still remember the poem, or bits
of it. And I was picked out as the best.'
Poetry involved two things, he said. One was expression, finding a way of
saying things about which you feel strongly and which you cannot say in
ordinary conversation. The other was craft, achieving a satisfying form like
a carpenter a cabinet.
I asked Lomas about religion, a subject he takes extremely seriously. Was it
always so?
'It was always important. But I've been an atheist - which is part of being
religious, in my opinion. I was nearly a Hindu for a long time.' (This was
the influence of Isherwood and others, not connected with his wartime
experience under fire as an army officer on India's North-West frontier).
'I lost my faith during the war because I couldn't reconcile Christianity
with war and I thought the war was necessary. It took me a long time to get
over that. Then I had a kind of crack-up or religious conversion, whichever
word you like to use.' He laughed.
How did that happen?
'I was about 30. It was a complete change of direction I just knew that I
was immortal, you know. And that was a big crisis. I had a kind of
enlightenment. It knocked me completely for six.
'If you don't have this religious dimension to your life you're living on
the surface of yourself. And I had got out of touch with my own depths and
my own depths suddenly said Wake up, Lomas.'
'I think I went through that experience that Jung talks about: when you pass
over from your ego to yourself. The ego is a kind of invention and the self
says 'I'm eternal and I am the real self: the ego is just the glitter on the
water.' Jung had the same crisis. It looks like schizophrenia.'
Lomas had a nervous breakdown and doctors tried to label him schizophrenic.
'I was sent to see this bastard and he was one of the most stupid people
I've ever met. He started talking about shock treatment. I said I'd had
enough shocks already. He told me to go and see the nurses. So I thought:
'Nurses, great] And they were these bloody great sergeant-major types, male.
I was absolutely terrified.'
At the time he was on holiday from his teaching job at the University of
Helsinki. He decided to stay in Finland, and was there another ten years.
Lomas talks about religion, economics and sex. I 'I am fascinated by sex,'
he said. 'Always have been, from the very earliest age. I'm amazed that
people can reach their teens without ever having an orgasm.'
Is it because you are highly sexed, or just extremely inquisitive?
'I don't know how one would measure it. I would think I was not particularly
highly sexed, really. But I do regard it as of supreme importance.'
You have written about sex as an expedition into the interior of another
country, trading with the hinterland. If I was a feminist critic I'd say you
had an exploitative attitude.
'I think I'm actually criticising the attitude. These words are always used
slightly ironically. No, I think I am really interested in women, and sex
for me is a form, not of exploitation but exploration.
Some feminist demands make you angry, don't they?
'That's because I love women. I think a lot of damage is being done to
relationships between men and women. To that extent they are harmful to
women. Actually, I'm an early feminist. I was one of the first readers of
The Second Sex and was convinced by it.
'Now a lot of women have had second thoughts. I'm an egalitarian where women
are concerned and any woman who has lived with me knows that: they always
get more freedom from me - perhaps more than they actually want.'
Who are you writing your poetry for, I asked. Is it yourself?
'I think most writers are writing for an ideal reader,' he said.
Who is the ideal reader?
'It's probably God. I've never thought of that before, but in fact that's
probably it . . . the perfect person to write a poem for.' Lomas gave
another great laugh. This laugh meant he really means it.
