WARTIME AND AFTERMATH: ENGLISH LITERATURE AND ITS BACKGROUND by Bernard
Bergonzi Oxford Pounds 30, 230 pages
ENGLISH literature during the second world war and its aftermath is a
fascinating topic but a tricky one because there are still a lot of people
around who lived through the period.
Previous books on literature in the OPUS series have taken a safer line. JA
Burrows's subject, for example, was Medieval Writers and their Work,
1100-1500 and the Regius Professor of English at Cambridge wrote on
Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries 1760-1830. You have got to be either
very brave or very insensitive to tackle your own period in your own
country.
Emeritus Professor Bernard Bergonzi's book is the sort of chatty account
which the late GS Fraser used to write. In fact, Bergonzi makes more of
Fraser than of many better writers - even to citing, with apparent approval,
his potty judgment on Dylan Thomas that he was 'below Thomas Gray but
perhaps on a level with William Collins'. Another favourite of Bergonzi's,
Donald Davie, is quoted as 'deploring the anachronism of Dylan Thomas
playing in 1940 the Rimbaud game' - as good an example of a molehill
criticising a mountain as one could wish to find.
What Bergonzi misses, because - as he admits in his Preface - he was 'a
schoolboy during the war years', is the excitement of those days when you
came home on leave and had the heady experience of seeing Stephen Spender in
his fireman's uniform, of hearing WS Graham reading his mesmerising poems
from Cage without Grievance, and of threading your way through the falling
bombs to the Streatham Locarno clutching a copy of Modern Reading.
Bergonzi relies too heavily on recent accounts by such American academics as
Paul Fussell, whose dubious theories bear no relation to the facts. Where
are Fred Marnau and Wrey Gardiner; where is Howard Sergeant, manfully
producing Outposts year after year; where is the infamous Caton of the
Fortune Press whose caricature appears in so many of Kingsley Amis's early
novels? Where are the anthologies of poetry from Oxford and Cambridge in
wartime, of Poems from the Forces?
While we are on the poets, Bergonzi makes no mention of some of the older
figures who were still going strong in the 1940s and '50s: Walter de la
Mare, Edmund Blunden, Basil Bunting, Roy Campbell, Vernon Watkins. There are
some even odder omissions - Gavin Ewart, for example, Kenneth Allott, Norman
McCaig, Alex Comfort, Denise Levertov, Paul Dehn, Jon Silkin, Dannie Abse,
Norman Nicholson, Vernon Scannell, James Kirkup, Christopher Logue, Laurie
Lee, WR Rodgers. Christopher Fry receives some space but there is not even a
whisper of Ronald Duncan. There is also the automatic assumption - made by
so many British academics - that TS Eliot is an English writer, despite the
fact that he was born by the banks of the Mississippi, returned to his New
England roots, read the Upanishads like Emerson and preferred the 'lucidity'
of Dante to the 'opacity' of Shakespeare.
However, the reader who has followed the story so far will be relieved to
hear that the book gets better as it goes on. This is partly because
Bergonzi gives us less potted history and more literary discussion (like the
excellent comparison between Hugh McDiarmid and David Jones) and partly
because he concentrates on the novel. Even here his judgment leaves
something to be desired: Wyndham Lewis and Anthony Powell are overrated, for
example. The coverage of Waugh, Durrell, Burgess, Wilson, Amis, Wain, etc.
is adequate but not inspiring. Bergonzi's opinions arouse contention rather
than approval, so that I cannot see this book going down well with the
British public. As an outline it might be helpful to, say, a Japanese
reader, but Bergonzi is holding up a mirror to an extraordinarily turbulent
time without synthesising what he sees.
