"Beyond Reasonable Doubt," which marked the playwrighting debut of British 
novelist Jeffrey Archer, had its U.S. premiere over the weekend in a Laguna 
Playhouse production at the Moulton Theatre. And it's a potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
Should there have been any doubt? Probably not. Archer's huge output of 
best-selling sagas -- "Kane and Abel," "The Prodigal Daughter" and the rest -- 
has never been prized for literary quality. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising, though, is that this courtroom drama turns out to be not so 
much a whodunit as a whydunit -- and a tepid one at that, climaxing with a 
sentimental flourish instead of an unexpected twist. 
</P>
<P>
The real mystery is that "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" set box-office records when 
it opened in London's West End 2 1/2 years ago and has been on the boards there 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In the first act, we get a lengthy taste of the Old Bailey, where Britain's 
most distinguished criminal lawyer, Sir David Metcalfe, is on trial for the 
murder of Lady Millicent, his terminally ill wife. Details of the case unfold 
as prosecutor Anthony Blair-Booth, Sir David's old rival, puts a parade of 
witnesses on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
The police believed that Lady Millicent had died of cancer until her 
housekeeper turned up and accused Sir David of poisoning his wife with an 
overdose of her potentially lethal medicine. According to the housekeeper's 
testimony, Sir David came home drunk, verbally threatened Lady Millicent and 
dropped the fatal pill into her tea. 
</P>
<P>
The loyal family solicitor reluctantly reveals that the estate Sir David has 
inherited is worth 1 million. And the defendant concedes that at the time of 
his wife's death, his broker was hounding him for several hundred thousand 
pounds to cover the margin on an ill-advised stock purchase. 
</P>
<P>
It gives nothing away to note that the heart of the case actually lies beyond 
the circumstantial evidence in the relationship between Sir David and Lady 
Millicent. The housekeeper claims that it was less loving than it seemed, 
largely evident in Sir David's nasty outbursts of temper. The solicitor 
testifies that it was a union of total mutual devotion. 
</P>
<P>
The second act clarifies the nature of the marriage by taking us back before 
the trial to a dinner party at the couple's home in Wimbledon, then leads us up 
to the death scene and provides a postscript to the trial. But the weak plot 
lacks suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the first act suffers from far too much procedural tedium -- court 
jargon, repetitive hand-on-Bible oaths, judicial instruction on the law -- 
while the second act strains for breeziness with clubby anecdotes, brittle 
chitchat and windy poeticizing. 
</P>
<P>
Archer tries to incorporate some entertaining characters, writing ethnic and 
class types that audiences will recognize as transparent cliches. The judge is 
a chiding curmudgeon, the housekeeper a judgmental crank, the prosecutor an 
upper-class twerp. Lady Millicent, in addition to dying like a swan, is the 
perfect hostess. And Sir David, master orator among legal eagles, has a 
fondness for things Welsh -- particularly Dylan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the Laguna production is well-dressed. It has white wigs and 
black robes in the Old Bailey and black ties and drink trays at Wimbledon. But 
the tone is bland, the players colorless. Most can't even be taken for British. 
</P>
<P>
The best performances are George Woods' as Sir David, Betsy Paul's as the 
housekeeper and David Paul's as the solicitor. 
</P>
<P>
P.S.: Would somebody please pull the plug on the hearts-and-flowers piano 
music?
