WRITERS ON WORLD WAR II: AN ANTHOLOGY edited by Mordecai Richler Chatto &amp;
Windus Pounds 18.99, 727 pages
THE ESSENTIAL experience of the first world war was epitomised in
comparatively few books, by writers who were also soldiers - prose-books by
Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, Guy Chapman, Frederic Manning, David Jones,
poetry by Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosenberg among others. A
good anthology like (say) Ian Parsons' Men Who March Away, even though
restricted to poetry, sums up what it felt like to have fought in that war.
With the second world war, the job of putting within the covers of a single
book a selection that can stand for the war-experience as a whole seems like
an impossible task. Yet this is what the Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler
has just done and he has included writing relating to the period between
1939 to 1945 by poets, novelists and journalists from anywhere and
everywhere. Some of the extracts were penned while the crucial events of the
war were actually unfolding, like the American war correspondent William L.
Shirer's account, from his Berlin Diary, of the impact in Germany of
Hitler's invasion of Poland. Other pieces, like the poet George Macbeth's
description of how as a small boy he woke up on the cellar floor with his
hair full of grit after the family home had been destroyed in 1940 by blast
from an air-raid, were set down as recently as 1989.
Richler's aim was to make a mosaic. It is in the event a wonderfully rich
mosaic but one from which no single pattern or overall impression emerges.
There is only the feeling throughout that war concentrates the mind
wonderfully and causes people to write well, that war encourages heroism and
brutality, self-sacrifice and sadism, in equal measure.
We begin on the first of September, 1939 with Auden sitting, 'in one of the
dives/ On Fifty-second Street/ Uncertain and afraid/ as the clever hopes
expire/ Of a low dishonest decade.' We conclude on the second of September
1945 with General MacArthur aboard the battleship Missouri flanked by
Admirals Nimitz and Halsey, greeting Yoshijiro Umezu, chief of Japan's
imperial general staff and his naval operations officer, as they climb
aboard to sign the document of capitulation.
William Manchester, author of that extract, served with the US Marines
during the war. Earlier in the book, in the 1942 section, he gives an
equally vivid account of his training period at the 'boot' (recruit) camp on
Parris Island, South Carolina. The process of indoctrination - he confesses
he loved it - included such joys as getting concussed on the forehead by a
rifle-butt.
This eloquent piece is mirrored on the other side of the Atlantic in J.
Maclaren-Ross's recollection of the Infantry Training Camp at Blandford,
Essex. During his time there Private Ross J observed a demonstration of the
strength of a tin-helmet. A recruit was instructed to strike the corporal
with the butt of his rifle as hard as he could on the head. Unfortunately
under the impact of the blow a loose screw inside the helmet caused the poor
corporal to slump instantly to the ground, spurting blood, followed by the
recruit fainting in horror.
The hazardous violence of training is as nothing beside the violence of the
fighting and bombing and the cruelties of captivity and conquest with which
the book is full - the fall of Singapore (JG Farrell); repercussions in
Prague after Heydrich was assassinated (Joseph Skvorecky); Southern GIs from
Kentucky taken prisoner in Manila (Studs Terkel); the Jewish Council
rounding up boys to send to the labour camps after the annihilation of the
Warsaw ghetto (Chaim Kaplan); aircrew in the New Hebrides making lethal
sorties during the battle of Guadalcanal (James Michener) - and much, much
more.
As one extract follows another the degree of suffering meted out by the war
changes in ferocity in the most arbitrary fashion. On the one hand there are
heart-rending holocaust memories by Elie Weisel and Primo Levi, on the other
the mood of irritation reflected in diary extracts by Noel Coward ('Dined at
Ivy. Conversation with Bobbie Helpmann about how difficult it is to keep the
Ballet going with people being called up all the time.')
I was disappointed not to find some of my favourite descriptions of the war
as it affected people in Britain. Plenty of Orwell and pieces from the
obvious names, Pritchett, Connolly, Woolf, Bowen, Waugh, MacNeice and Dylan
Thomas, but the fireman writers who described the blitz so well like Henry
Green and William Sansom are notable for their absence. Lots from Richard
Hillary, but nothing from Rattigan's Flare Path.
But Richler says he assembled three times as much material as he had room
for. And even when so much was discarded what remains is a big book in every
sense, global in scope, and illuminating people's ability to make a truthful
record of their experience after they have been stretched to the limits of
their endurance.
