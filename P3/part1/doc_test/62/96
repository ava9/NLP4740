UC Irvine's worst season in the school's 25-year history came to an end 
Wednesday night, with the Anteaters losing to Cal State Fullerton, 82-63, in 
the first round of the Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which broke a seven-game losing streak, advances to a quarterfinal 
game against third-ranked Nevada Las Vegas on Friday night at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Some reward: UNLV has eliminated Fullerton (13-15) each of the past five 
tournaments, and has beaten the Titans this season by 28 and 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
In their two games against Irvine during the regular season, the Titans won by 
27 points and lost the second by 18. 
</P>
<P>
This time they jumped to a 36-16 lead in the first half, and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
For the only time this season, Fullerton started a game without Cedric Ceballos 
on the court. Coach John Sneed benched him for the first four minutes for being 
late to Tuesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who wore a black armband with the name "Hank" on it, said he was late 
after attending the memorial service for Hank Gathers, who was his teammate on 
a summer league team at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill led Fullerton with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters suffered another poor shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Irvine missed all nine shots from three-point range. 
Fullerton made seven of 11, including all three attempts by Van Anderson, a 
reserve forward who averages three points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Irvine made only 41% of its shots. Discounting center Ricky Butler, 
who scored 22 points on 10-of-14 shooting, the Anteaters made only 16 of 50 
shots -- 32%. 
</P>
<P>
From the free-throw line, they made only six of 13 -- 46%. 
</P>
<P>
And Dylan Rigdon, unflappable and unstoppable in the previous game, made only 
one shot, a layup, and missed all five of his shots from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer, the only senior starter for the Anteaters, added 20 points, 
including five three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," Sneed said of the Titans' performance. "It couldn't have come 
at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
Just in time for a game against UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, pressed for a prediction on the UNLV-Fullerton 
game, tried to be diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into that," he said. "I don't know, you know, maybe they 
can hang in there and do a good job. . . . I think Vegas is a Final Four team. 
I've said that all along." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State 71, San Jose State 56 -- Tod Bernard scored Fresno State's first 
13 points of the second half as the Bulldogs ended a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (10-18) will play top-seeded New Mexico State on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard made three three-point shots during his streak as the Bulldogs 
increased a 30-27 halftime lead to 43-33. He finished with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one of our poorest games of the season," said San Jose State Coach Stan 
Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State (8-20) shot only 35% from the field and made 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who were led by Andre Brooks' 19 points, got to within 44-42, but 
Fresno quickly pulled away on a basket by Bernard and five points in a row by 
Pat Riddlesprigger. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas was chosen the Big West Conference Player of 
the Year by a coaches' vote. UNLV's Stacey Augmon, last year's Player of the 
Year, didn't make the first or second team, earning only honorable mention. . . 
. There is hope for the future for Irvine, which placed two players on the 
all-freshman team: Dylan Rigdon and Jeff Von Lutzow. Other members: Lucious 
Harris of Cal State Long Beach, Idris Jones of UC Santa Barbara and Kevin Logan 
of San Jose State.
