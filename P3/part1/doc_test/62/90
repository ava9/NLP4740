MANY OF the records I have enjoyed this year have been choral music of
various kinds. The new issue of Delius's Sea Drift (Argo 430 206-2) by the
WNO chorus and orchestra under Sir Charles Mackerras is a winner. Mackerras
gives Delius a keen edge and firm propulsion - no drowsiness. The ocean
swell is wonderfully caught and the Welsh chorus tone has the tang of salt
spray. Thomas Hanson's baritone solo is first-rate. For once the vocal line
does not sound as if it had been stuck on afterwards. Every word (Whitman in
anthropomorphic mood) tells. The fill-up is the Florida Suite.
Sir Charles Groves takes a less lean and athletic view of Delius but his
1972 Mass of Life (with the LPO and their Choir) comes up rousingly on
transfer to EMI CMS 7 64218 2 (two CDs). The companion pieces are the Songs
of sunset and Arabesque, with the Royal Liverpool PO and Choir and eminent
soloists - Harper, Baker, Watts, Tear, Luxon, Shirley-Quirk. Luxon's singing
of the important baritone solos in the Mass is notable. The way Baker
combines intensity with simplicity in the fourth of the Sunset songs is
extraordinary.
The pagan Delius might have reacted sarcastically to his music being
recommended for Christmas. If this worries you, go carolling with Richard
Hickox, the LSO and Chorus and the St Paul's Cathedral choristers, in two
seasonable works by Vaughan Williams (EMI CDC 7 54128). The Fantasia on
Christmas Carols (1912) is an interweaving of traditional tunes. The
anthology-cantata Hodie ('This Day' - 1954) is longer and stranger:
choruses, solos with beautiful word setting, gospel narrations not spoken
but sung, mostly by the boys, rich orchestration, words from many poets
including Milton, George Herbert and Hardy. Is it the inclusion, in a
central position, of Hardy's The Oxen, that introduces a gentle element of
questioning? Christmas music with a difference, well worth trying.
Or, as a perfect antidote to late-Romanticism, listen to the Pilgrim songs
and dances from the Libre vermell (Red Book) of Montserrat, persuasively
brought to life by Philip Pickett and the New London Consort (Oiseau-Lyre
433 186-2). Many travellers to Barcelona will have visited the famous
monastery up in the mountains, half-hidden in a cluster of monstrous rocks
like swollen organ pipes. The Red Book, completed in 1399, one of the
Montserrat's library treasures, contains ten pieces for voices and
instruments for use by pilgrims. They were warned to do them 'with respect
and moderation' and to avoid lewdness and lasciviousness. The Consort
players have the easy conviction which now marks the best early music
playing. Gone (almost) are the days of squeak and scratch.
A new CD which should not be overlooked is EMI's Musique vocale francaise
(CDC 7 54452 2) by the Groupe vocal de France under their its expert English
conductor John Alldis. Debussy's Three poems by Charles d'Orleans for
unaccompanied chorus are among his choicest small works. Ravel's Trois
chansons are here too, with Milhaud's outwardly simple, but deeply felt Six
sonnets on 'secret' poems written during the Occupation by Jean Cassou. A
distinguished collection, completed with works by Schmitt and Sauguet. Alas,
words not included.
A pleasant surprise during the year has been the number of recordings for
Milhaud's centenary. To those I reviewed some weeks ago can be added two
more in the series of live performances from Prague, where links with
Milhaud go back to the 1920s. One 'volume' has works connected with Provence
(PR 250 013) with the choral Cantique du Rhone, the Eighth Symphony
('Rhodanian') and the idyllic 'Chenimee du Roi Rene for wind quintet. The
other is centred on the Czech capital (PR 250 012), with the bracing,
combative Music for Prague, and the Concertino d'hiver (trombone and
strings).
Enthusiasts for the unique Spanish mezzo Conchita Supervia will fall upon
Pearl's anthology The unknown Supervia (GEMM CD 9969). They will be well
rewarded in spite of variable sound quality. Operatic arias, zarzuela
excerpts and a host of mainly Spanish and Catalan songs but including John
Alden Carpenter's 'When I bring to you coloured toys'. Best of all, Bizet's
'Les adieux de l'hotesse arabe'. With Supervia's inimitable command of vocal
colour and verbal inflection, this song is transformed into a miniature
drama.
