SPARE NO EXPENSE: The $10.98 tape is here to stay. In recent months George 
Michael, the Traveling Wilburys, Whitney Houston, Bell Biv Devoe and Jon Bon 
Jovi have put out $10.98 list-priced releases -- and you can bet there's more 
to come from major artists next year.

(Meanwhile, Madonna's "Immaculate" hits collection is going for a steep $13.98, 
despite the presence of only one new song!) . . . And we knew that Was (Not 
Was) co-leader Don Was has been producing plenty of top popsters -- from Bob 
Dylan and Iggy Pop to Bonnie Raitt and Elton John. But now he's really boxing 
the compass. Was has been in the studio with Paula Abdul, producing two songs 
(one written by the Was Bros. with Bob Dylan) while also finishing up a new 
Leonard Cohen album -- and preparing a follow-up Bonnie Raitt project. Who's 
next? We hear Was has signed on to produce the new Mick Jagger solo album.
