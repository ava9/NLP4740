Depeche Mode is a fascinating pop group, and director D. A. Pennebaker can be 
an interesting musical documentarian, but their pairing proves to be a classic 
oil-and-water mismatch in "Depeche Mode 101." 
</P>
<P>
The oil here is teen-favorite Depeche Mode, an English synthesizer group that 
combines deep and unremittingly dark themes with slick, pre-programmed, 
ominously compelling dance music. The water is unslick, spontaneity-loving 
Pennebaker and his film collaborators, David Dawkins and Chris Hegedus, who 
never once attempt to delve below the service to peek at what substance might 
lie beneath. The result makes the band and its young followers look much, much 
sillier than they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Pennebaker's documentary technique is usually to let the hand-held cameras roll 
and trust that something interesting will happen. When you're filming a roving 
Bob Dylan at the peak of his powers, as Pennebaker did in "Don't Look Back," 
catching interesting things is a given. But figuring out what makes reticent 
Depeche Mode or its rabid following tick would take a bit more work -- work 
that hasn't even been attempted in this remarkably unrevealing product. 
</P>
<P>
The grainy "101" intercuts between uneven but great-sounding concert footage, 
scenes of backstage banality with the band and its crew and scenes of an even 
more banal crop of East Coast teen-agers who have been hired to follow the tour 
out West on a bus, especially for the film. If the point was to deflate Depeche 
Mode's godlike standing among its fans, or to portray those fans as uneducated, 
trendy twerps who have no idea what the music is all about, it's been well 
accomplished here. But one suspects that there is no point, or point of view, 
to all this random cinema verite. 
</P>
<P>
 Depeche Mode is not yet a national superstar act, but in some cities, 
especially Los Angeles, where a Rose Bowl concert in June drew more than 
60,000, Mode mania resembles Beatlemania at its peak. Indeed, at a screening 
for radio contest-winners earlier this week, female screams rendered the first 
few minutes of the loudly projected film inaudible. A quick flash of singer 
David Gahan in his underwear almost brought down the house.. A few scant 
moments in "101" capture fans' sexual/philosophic mania in something close to a 
meaningful context, like one extended, telling shot of a hysterical girl 
shouting along with the bitter lyrics of "Blasphemous Rumours," which includes 
the chorus: "I think God's got a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect 
to find him laughing." (Watching Gahan exhort the crowd to sing and clap along 
with dour ditties, you may intuit that someone besides the Almighty has a sick 
sense of humor.) 
</P>
<P>
But Pennebaker, Dawkins and Hegedus query neither band nor followers about the 
content or appeal of the music. One former Pennebaker subject, Dylan, used to 
sing about a Mr. Jones who knew something was happening around him but didn't 
quite know what it was; this time, Pennebaker seems to be that Mr. Jones. What 
a waste of a phenomenon.
