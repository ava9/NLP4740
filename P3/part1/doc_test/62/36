"Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me. ..." 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman didn't catch anyone off guard 
when they began singing that Bob Dylan song during a mini-Byrds reunion 
Saturday night at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was the Byrds' first hit, and it remains the tune most 
identified with the landmark Los Angeles folk-rock group from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
But there were gasps of surprise and delight during the four-hour Roy Orbison 
tribute concert when the threesome was joined half-way through the song by a 
surprise guest . . . Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
It was, Dylan said after the concert, the first time he had appeared with the 
three Byrds since the band, then a quintet, was making rock history by forging 
its new sound 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive touring in recent years, Dylan continues to bring a sense of 
drama with him every time he walks on stage, and he did so again Saturday as he 
first shared a microphone with Crosby, then with McGuinn. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing dark glasses, a white jacket and black trousers, rock's most acclaimed 
songwriter remained on stage while McGuinn moved into "He Was a Friend of 
Mine," another Byrds favorite. McGuinn dedicated the song to Orbison, the 
classic rock singer and songwriter who died in 1988 at the height of a dramatic 
comeback that included his work with Dylan and others in the Traveling Wilburys 
supergroup. 
</P>
<P>
The four musicians were then joined by about four dozen other members of the 
evening's large cast to close the benefit concert with Orbison's signature 
song, "Only the Lonely." The organizers of the concert hope the show and an 
upcoming cable-TV special will raise about $3 million for homeless 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Dylan-Byrds appearance will likely be the most treasured moment of 
the cable special that is planned for this spring by Showtime, there were 
numerous other emotional highlights sprinkled in the program. 
</P>
<P>
They included k.d. lang's show-stopping rendition of Orbison's "Crying," Dean 
Stockwell's re-creation of his eerie, unsettling lip-syncing rendition of "In 
Dreams" from the film "Blue Velvet" and the first performance by Bonnie Raitt 
since winning four Grammys on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting first outing for Raitt because she, much like Orbison, has 
rallied against career disappointment to achieve renewed commercial and 
critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
While the 40-year-old singer didn't fall as far from the spotlight as Orbison 
did during the '70s and early '80s, there were questions about her future after 
she was dropped in 1986 by her longtime record company, Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
But Raitt bounced back last year with "Nick of Time," which earned her a Grammy 
for album of the year. Rather than sing the album's title track Saturday, Raitt 
dueted with John Lee Hooker on their Grammy-winning "I'm in the Mood," then 
sang a tune identified with Orbison, the rowdy, energetic "Candy Man." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the evening's performances captured various aspects of Orbison's 
musical spirit, including the rockabilly zest of John Fogerty's "Ooby Dooby," 
the romantic paranoia of Benny Mardones' "Running Scared" and the sweet dream 
portrait of Chris Isaak's "Leah." 
</P>
<P>
But it was perhaps Raitt who best conveyed Orbison's sense of dignity -- the 
respect he had for music that was from the heart rather than music that was 
manufactured for the charts; a respect that made him feel part of a musical 
community that could use its power to help others rather than just celebrate 
his own accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that spirit that Raitt accepted her Grammys on behalf of all the 
blues artists who had inspired her and spoke backstage Saturday about the need 
for more blues and other roots-related music on mainstream radio. 
</P>
<P>
On a purely musical level, there were problems with the Amphitheatre concert, 
many of them tied to a cast that included some singers and, especially, actors 
who are severely mismatched when trying to compete against the memory of one of 
rock's greatest singers ever. No one, for instance, is ever going to ask Gary 
Busey to play the lead in "The Roy Orbison Story." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the generous parade of performers added to the sense of community that is 
becoming an increasingly prominent and rewarding part of the pop landscape. 
Plus, the fact that artists as varied as Emmylou Harris, John Hiatt, Booker T. 
Jones, Joe Ely, Cindy Bullens, Michael McDonald and members of the Talking 
Heads can find common ground in the music of a single writer also underscores 
the richness and range of Orbison's grand musical legacy.
