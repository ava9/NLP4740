While the notion of what folk music is hasn't been quite the same since Bob 
Dylan plugged in with a band, there is still much to be said for the voice of 
the lone troubadour in that music, with a strong case being made by Dylan 
contemporary Eric Andersen's solo set Thursday at Bogart's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With songs drawn largely from his current "Ghosts Upon the Road" album, 
Andersen -- working alone with a guitar and mouth harp -- was able to evoke the 
solitary wanderer's acute vision and romanticism that had marked his best early 
work. That was no mean task, considering the "Ghosts" album comes laden with a 
Winnebago-load of overly portentous and dramatized arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
But released by Andersen's direct stage delivery and evocative voice, "Listen 
to the Rain" revealed a fragile beauty, while the down-scaled "Too Many Times 
(I Will Try)" came across as an intensely personal anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Announced as a "murder ballad" for people tired of love songs, the half-spoken 
"Trouble in Paris" favorably recalled Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" narrative 
style. In a 13-song set that also included the mid-'60s' "Close the Door 
Lightly When You Go" and "More Often Than Not" from 1972's "Blue River" album, 
the only number which didn't connect was the 10-minute autobiographical 
narrative "Ghosts on the Road." The recollection of his scuffling days lacked 
the small details and insights needed to make the story breathe. JIM WASHBURN
