ROY Kelton Orbison (1936-1988) was the unmistakable singer with the pasty
complexion, the black Raybans and the ubiquitous voice. Only The Lonely at
the Liverpool Playhouse is a tribute to Orbison, more musical than
theatrical. It is, as Rob Reiner once said, not a documentary but a
rockumentary, a welcome chance to hear the wonderful songs. It makes a
vastly enjoyable evening: capacious, lyrical and exciting.
The musical has arrived at an opportune time, with Grease bringing the 1950s
to the West End and preparing the way for this 1960s collection. Yet Only
The Lonely has no dramatic form other than a meeting between Orbison and his
son in Ohio at Orbison's last concert. Author Laurence Ross had only to link
the tunes.
As Orbison explains himself to his son, the extraordinary serendipity of his
life reveals itself. The Caruso of rock 'n' roll stumbled into his own image
as if by chance. He first wore the dark glasses because he left his own on a
plane when touring with the Beatles. He intended to give 'Only The Lonely'
to Elvis Presley, but the King was sleeping when Orbison called, and he
decided to record it himself. The habitual black clothes were almost an
afterthought: Orbison's wife says unimaginatively 'You look great in black,
Roy.'
Orbison's sombre life bears an exact relation to the songs. His estranged
and then reinstated wife Claudette died in a motorcycle crash, two of his
three sons died in a basement fire, and Orbison underwent triple bypass
surgery before his final seizure. He comes across as a passive, innocent
man, more sung against than singing. Out of this misery came the fine 'In
Dreams', 'Running Scared', 'Pretty Woman' and 'You Got It'.
It is an ambitious musical which puts the Beatles on stage in Liverpool, but
this Bill Kenright production offers Bob Dylan, kd lang and Bruce
Springsteen as well. The impersonations work well, with Karl Lornie
twitching the violin bass as he plays Paul McCartney and Martin Glyn Murray
strumming nervously as John Lennon and then posturing with it as Bruce
Springsteen.
Larry Branson as Orbison is superb, looking and sounding like him, floating
to the high notes and plummeting to the low growl. This is Branson's first
acting role, since he usually has only to sing in his career as Roy Orbison;
but luckily Orbison was undemonstrative to a fault. Even in the most
frenetic numbers, Orbison allowed himself only a flexing of the right knee.
Ian Kellgren's direction and Keith Strachan's musical direction give life
and point to Orbison's songs, which remained the same while fashions changed
around them. They are infectious and catchy here, tightly played and fully
produced. Orbison recorded nothing between 1969 and 1988, when he reemerged
with a TV special involving Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Jennifer Warnes.
This in turn led to the Travelling Wilburys (with Bob Dylan and friends) and
a revival of interest in Orbison. He died in December of that year.
The Liverpool Playhouse until August 28
