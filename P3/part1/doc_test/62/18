from middle England, especially. With a short drive, you are in a foreign
country where names are hard to pronounce and people talk and sing a
language incomprehensible to outsiders.
Far closer to England than France, Wales is just as stimulating a change,
although there is one hitch. If you are English, there is a chance that a
tiny minority of Welshmen - who do not like English people buying second
homes there - may burn your holiday cottage. Still, it happens less than it
did a few years ago.
How do you avoid such a fate? As one Welshman told me: 'Do not pay over the
odds for your house so that you are contributing to a property market that
many local people cannot afford. And do not arrive with a car load of
groceries from an English supermarket. Use the local shops.'
Occasional arson apart, the country is glorious. North Wales is like a
miniature Scotland without the midges and Anglesey flat like Ireland, with
low stone walls around white-painted cottages. There is a noble parade of
castles, ranging from the mighty creations that Edward I built at Conwy and
Caernarfon to subdue the country to oddities like the Normanesque granite
pile of Penrhyn, erected last century on the profits of a neighbouring slate
quarry.
On the the A55 north Wales highway, it takes barely 40 minutes to reach
Anglesey from Liverpool and Manchester, and the A483 connects with it to
give a fast link for drivers from Oswestry, Shrewsbury and points in England
via the A5 and M54. West of Shrewsbury, the Welshpool bypass is about to
open, while south Wales waits for the second bridge over the Severn to end
delays at the present bridge on the M4.
Cottages are the best bet in Wales. Houses of manor, rectory or large
farmhouse size are few and tend to be 19th century, while stately homes are
still scarcer. This is because, until the industrial revolution, Wales never
had the wealth that England enjoyed. Thus, grand houses were not built.
For potential buyers, where better to start than the former chapel and
chapel house at Dernol, between Llangurig and Rhayader in the Wye valley of
mid-Wales. On offer from Morris Marshall &amp; Poole for Pounds 44,000, it could
not be more Welsh. The stone chapel with slate roof has outline planning
permission for conversion with the adjoining cottage as a single house. But
use as licensed premises is forbidden.
From the same agent for Pounds 110,000 is a 1907 Arts and Crafts-style house
in the middle of Llangurig Penybont. The price includes a coach house (if
that is not sold separately for Pounds 25,000).
On the opposite (west) side of the Cambrian Mountains, Hafod Mansion Gardens
in Pontrhydygroes 14 miles from Aberystwyth, has specimen trees and two
acres of walled gardens. Price: Pounds 138,000, from Shearer and Morris. And
in Cemmaes, the Machynlleth office of the firm offers the Georgian
Aberhiriaeth Hall with five bedrooms for Pounds 220,000.
South from Aberystwyth in the Cothi valley, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a
farmhouse and two cottages at Edwinsford as three lots with fishing (two
rods per property) on the river. The Cothi is especially good for sea trout.
Prices are Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 250,000.
In west Wales, Cliff House at Laugharne was re-built in 1986 after a fire.
It has views across the Taf estuary and Carmarthen Bay to Pembrey Sands and
Worms Head on the Gower peninsula while below, on the water's edge, is the
Boathouse of poet Dylan Thomas. Agent Terry Thomas is selling it for Pounds
250,000. On the nearby Towy estuary, the same agent offers the Edwardian
brick Pilroath at Llangain for Pounds 205,000; it also has views of
Carmarthen Bay.
Inland, near Abergavenny, Elstons has Pantybeiliau, an 1840 late-Georgian
stucco house with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, walled garden, paddocks,
and views over the Usk valley towards the Black Mountains. Near the Roman
site of Caerleon and five miles from Usk is Llwyn Celyn (also Elstons),
another stuccoed property with nine bedrooms but just three bathrooms. Both
houses cost around Pounds 500,000, depending on how much land is included.
If you want to fish on the Usk, Mardy Cottage at Llanwenarth Citra, near
Abergavenny, is not a cottage but a house with half a mile of single-bank
angling. Halifax is the agent and the price around Pounds 185,000.
Llanarithon, at Howey near Llandrindod Wells, is a brick and stone farmhouse
on the Welsh borders. It is detached from its farmland and has only eight
acres (for Pounds 225,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Russell Baldwin &amp;
Bright). But up to 175 more acres, and modern agricultural buildings, are
available if you want to farm.
In north Wales, Hillway is a 1930s' seaside house with nine acres
overlooking the Dwyryd estuary at Morfa Bychan, near Porthmadog . Gardens
flourish in this sun trap and the price (from Jackson-Stops) is an
attractive Pounds 185,000.
If you want high ground and a studio barn, the same firm offers Creua, at
nearby Llanfrothen, for Pounds 175,000. A 7.25-inch railway, built by the
present owner, runs round the garden and is also available - but the
locomotives are not.
Further inland is Hafod Tan-y-Graig, in Snowdonia national park. This
substantial Victorian gabled house in seven acres of woods and garden is
offered by Jackson-Stops for Pounds 245,000. Here, you can fish for trout in
the river Edno, go for walks, climb mountains - and see what a beautiful
country Wales is.
