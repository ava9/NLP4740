The cash-starved Grove Shakespeare Festival, which has canceled the final 
production of its current season, is apparently a traitor to American culture 
because it produces the work of foreign authors. 
</P>
<P>
At least that was the message Grove artistic director Thomas F. Bradac says he 
took away from the City Council debate Monday night, when a 3-2 majority denied 
the Grove emergency funds that would have enabled the troupe to close out the 
season in December with Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were all surprised to hear that Councilman (Raymond T.) Littrell 
believes Shakespeare and the classics are un-American," Bradac said in a 
midnight interview Monday, after the Grove board of directors canceled "A 
Child's Christmas" but reiterated its decision to open Oscar Wilde's "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" Oct. 4 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"What he basically said was that we should only be doing American culture," 
Bradac claimed, "that we shouldn't be doing Italian culture or the German 
culture, and we don't need Shakespeare. The issue really comes back again to a 
majority of the council believing that Shakespeare and the classics are not 
something they want in their community." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Littrell said that Shakespeare is not American culture, and 
that "we left England to get away from that." Tuesday, though, he maintained 
that he had not labeled Shakespeare and the classics un-American, nor had he 
asserted that the Grove should promote only American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say that. I said we have a great American culture and we really 
aren't taking care of it. We are doing everybody else's culture," Littrell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This season the Grove has produced three Shakespearean plays -- "Much Ado About 
Nothing," "As You Like It" and "Othello" -- and "The Miser" by Voltaire. 
Shakespeare was English, Voltaire was French, Wilde was Irish, and Thomas was 
Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
Littrell said Tuesday that the issues are money and whether the city should 
fund the theater at all, and not an "artsy thing" concerning various cultures. 
"There's nothing un-American about making a business deal," he said. "When they 
can't keep it together, don't blame (the council). They (the theater) don't 
have a business plan in place to recover from their financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bradac pointed out, however, that a detailed business plan had been presented 
to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old, nonprofit Grove troupe operates the outdoor Festival 
Amphitheatre and the indoor Gem Theatre, both owned by the city, under a city 
contract.
