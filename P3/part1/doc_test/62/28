THIRTY-FIVE years ago British poets such as Christopher Logue, Adrian
Mitchell, Pete Brown and myself started wedding our verses to jazz. A few
years later the Beatles and Stones were importing songs by Chuck Berry and
Bob Dylan and rolling their own. For the preceding half century American
blues, folk and rock songwriter-singers had set the pace. When the Woodstock
generation and British beats became parents, spoken and sung word-sounds
opened up. What had been pigeon-holed as folk, ethnic, R&amp;B and spiritual
genres overlapped more loosely with poetry, pop and, latterly, world music.
These (r)evolutions have been catalysed by artists, writers and producers of
many hues. Dylan has acknowledged how instrumental the 'spontaneous bop
prosody' of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg was in metamorphosing the
Midwest-suburban college boy Zimmerman into the wildly free-ranging
song-&amp;-dance man he remains.
'Talking New Bob Dylan', a song on the recent album History (Virgin 2703) by
Loudon Wainwright III, one of Dylan's most original successors, articulates
the perennial beginning-troubadour situation :'I had to stop listening/times
were too tough/Me being the New Me/was hard enough/You kept right on
changing/like you still always do/And what's best is - the old stuff/still
sounds new.' History sounds newer still, confronting harsh mid-life
realities with telling wit and unescapist fortitude.
Another stream of straight-talking lyricism is renewed in the Stormy
Horizons of C&amp;W populist Hank Wangford, with his resourceful and spirited
band. This recording (Sincere Sounds 004 - cassette Pounds 7, CD Pounds 11
from Frank Management, 3 Chesterton Road, London W10 5LY), is dedicated to
the golden aeon of hillbilly boogie 40 years ago, before the great divide
between rock and country was widened through fear, racism and sexual
suspicion. The music conveys Wangford's passion for Texan honky-tonk,
Tennessee Ernie, the Everly Brothers and the 'sweet sadness of country
harmonies straight from the Kentucky coalfields.'
At the same time it twangs in perfect - and frequently comic - tune with
current British gloom, as in 'End of the Road': 'I've had enough/enough of
the rain/enough of the cold/I'm tired of the nights/The dazzling lights/when
the wipers won't wipe/I've got cowboy craziness/burning inside/but I'm out
of pills . . . I could be warm /lying in your arms/So why am I here/with
another flat beer/I want to go home.'
After temping as a clerk in the City of London, John Baine felt that the
stage-name Attila the Stockbroker would be in keeping with his avowed
contract from the muses 'to liquidate the gaggle of grey lugworms and
displaced Martians who have held the UK poetry set-up in thrall for yonks
resquirming the same old nepotistical pretentious irrelevant gunk.'
Having spent a few years in punk and heavy-metal bands he was no more
sanguine about the pop scene, feeling in 1981 that 'rock has become largely
redundant as a means of communication because the generally inane volume
means you can't hear the words.'
Since then he has issued a dozen lucidly phrased albums and cassettes, the
best of which perpetuate his energy, humour and improvisational verve as a
performance poet, singer and electric mandola virtuoso. Donkey's Years
(Musidisc 107891, cassette &amp; LP Pounds 6, CD Pounds 10 from ATS, 6 Colebrook
Road, Southwick, BN4 4AL) gathers 13 of his latest hits, notably 'Video
Nazis', 'This is Free Europe', 'The Bible according to Rupert' and this
ultra-contemporary lover's complaint: 'Today I took out the rubbish/and
thought of you./ At the bottom of my dustbin/the maggots wriggled round and
round/like planes circling over Heathrow Airport./ Now and then/two larval
aviators collided in the crowded, circular, putrescent grooves of metal/and
I thought yes, this is us - /not even ships that pass in the night/but
maggots wriggling in predetermined circles/in the putrescent dustbin/of the
enterprise culture.'
Paul Weller, like Attila, is 34, but had formed The Jam at 14 and swiftly
built it into one of the most rhythmic, soulful and humanly political beat
groups in the world for the entire decade.
He goes on being one of the only big pop stars to pen hard-edged straight
verse as well as music. His recent recording, Paul Weller (Go] Discs 828
343-1) is, rather surprisingly, his first solo album. It intensifies my
sense of him as a more melodic, inventive and poetic guitarist, tunesmith
and lyricist, especially of love songs, to keep on trucking than anyone
since Dylan and the Beatles - with the possible exceptions of Peter Gabriel
and Billy Bragg.
