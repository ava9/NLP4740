  [Abstract] Inspection of multimodular optical telescopes 
with a synthesized aperture for proper phasing by means of an 
achromatized diffractional hologram interferometer is proposed, 
the aim being to maximize the resolving power of such telescopes 
in terrestrial astronomical observatories. The scheme is 
demonstrated on a bimodular telescope with four smaller mirrors 
including the main one in each module and one common larger 
spherical concave mirror which synthesizes the exit pupil while 
forming the image of a star in its focal plane. The holographic 
system consists of a spherical concave collimating mirror and a 
hologram. It can operate with an either internal or external 
light source. In the former case the light source, a point 
source, is placed in the focal plane of a booster lens and the 
hologram is placed in front of the collimating mirror. The 
holographic system forms the inspecting wave, which is to 
``simulate'' the radiation entering both telescope modules upon 
arrival from a star within the middle of the field of view. The 
hologram is a plane mirror with a reflective diffraction 
grating, an equidistant array of lines, deposited on its active 
surface. Its spatial frequency has been selected so as to ensure 
that radiation in +1 and -1 diffraction orders will impinge on 
the main mirror of module ``+1'' and module ``-1'' respectively. 
Each of these mirrors is covered by a projecting reflective 
hologram with zero-order optical power and the same spatial 
carrier frequency. The collimating mirror and the holographic 
mirror can be combined a single reflective or transmissive 
hologram. A theoretical analysis of the inspection process, 
taking into the geometry of this scheme, indicates that 
decreasing the spatial frequency of the holograms will allow 
widening the tolerances on the telescope parameters. For 
verification, an experiment was performed using an incandescent 
lamp as the light source and diffraction gratings with 200 
lines/mm each. The hologram before the collimator was used as a 
measuring bridge and a Fourier objective with its optical axis 
passing through the center of that hologram was simulating a 
phased telescope with a synthesized aperture. Following 
appropriate adjustment of the three holograms in the focal plane 
of this objective, a high-contrast achromatic interference 
pattern was seen which remained stationary while the lamp was 
being moved in the focal plane of its booster lens. The author
