<TEXT>
<P>
George Seielstad stood numbly as he looked at the wreckage of his 
"one-of-a-kind" radiotelescope set in a valley of the rugged Allegheny 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The radiotelescope, which is as long as a football field, had collapsed in on 
itself one cool November night in 1988, the result of metal fatigue after 26 
years of searching the heavens from a special "radio quiet zone" about 220 
miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless and felt total disbelief. That telescope was one of a kind," 
said Seielstad, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the heap of twisted metal has given scientists a stellar opportunity. Plans 
are under way for a radiotelescope to tower 35 stories above and 330 feet 
around isolated Deer Creek Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the $75-million telescope should be ready to map the undiscovered 
universe by listening to the radio waves of outer space instead of peering into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making something that will define the state-of-the-art radiotelescope 
technology to take us well into the next century," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said the telescope's technical advancements will open more doors to 
understanding the evolution of the universe and composition of gases between 
galaxies. Scientists also can pursue more in-depth studies of pulsars, or 
small, quick-moving stars. 
</P>
<P>
The first telescope, completed in 1962 for $850,000, detected radio signals 
from far beyond the Milky Way and helped unlock the secrets to pulsars and 
quasars. 
</P>
<P>
The new telescope will be designed to receive more and clearer signals with a 
solid surface of about 2,000 individually controlled panels to counteract the 
sagging effects of gravity as the telescope moves. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope also will be fully movable, allowing it to point anywhere in the 
northern sky. The original telescope moved only up and down and relied on the 
Earth's rotation for further direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be 10 times more sensitive than anything else we have on Earth," said 
Ludwig Oster, program manager for the National Science Foundation, which is 
funding the project. "It will be on the cutting edge of technology and will do 
research that can't be done anywhere else. We can look further back in time 
toward the 'Big Bang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The telescope will be able to pick up naturally emitted radio signals from as 
far away as 10 billion light-years, giving scientists a glimpse into when 
galaxies first formed, astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
The first search for intelligent life was at Green Bank and the new telescope 
may be included in some occasional extraterrestrial studies, Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bank is in the world's only radio quiet zone, a 13,000-square-mile area 
designated by the federal government in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Local radio and television stations can be picked up by the valley's 500 
residents, but signals are carefully regulated. Many residents have cable 
television. The mountains of the Monongahela National Forest also shield the 
instruments from radio "noise" caused by anything from car engines to toasters. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes this a unique spot on Earth and is the equivalent of a national park 
except we're protecting radio-frequency space," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Lockman, an astronomer at the observatory's office in Charlottesville, Va., 
said the advanced telescope and radio quiet zone will make Green Bank a leading 
facility for astronomers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse left a major gap, but you have to take events like this and focus 
on the future and new opportunities," Seielstad said. "We couldn't have 
predicted it would have turned out this well."
