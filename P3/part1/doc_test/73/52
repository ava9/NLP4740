FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: When national limits are legal -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National laws restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements do not
infringe Rome treaty rules on the free movement of goods, provided the laws
are not aimed at imports from other member countries and provided they have
the same effect on the commercial freedom to market domestic products as on
imports, the European Court ruled last week.
In a landmark ruling, all 13 judges said that, where those conditions were
satisfied, this kind of national regulation was not by its nature intended
to prevent or hinder access to the market by imports any more than it
impeded the access of domestic products.
The Court's ruling was in response to questions raised by the Strasbourg
Tribunal de Grande Instance in connection with criminal proceedings against
a Mr Keck and a Mr Mithouard.
They were prosecuted for reselling products in an unaltered state at prices
lower than their actual purchase price, in contravention of the French law
which prohibits resale at a loss.
In their defence, they argued that a general prohibition of resale at a loss
was incompatible with the treaty ban on import restrictions as well as other
rules on free movement and competition.
At the outset the ECJ said that it was only appropriate to look at
prohibition of resale at a loss from the perspective of the free movement of
goods, since the prohibition was concerned with the marketing of goods.
The Court confirmed its 1974 ruling in the Dassonville case that any measure
which is capable of directly or indirectly, actually or potentially,
hindering intra-Community trade can constitute an import restriction
prohibited by the treaty.
However, the fact that such legislation may restrict the volume of sales in
the market concerned, and therefore the volume of sales of imports, is not
decisive. It was not the purpose of national legislation imposing a general
prohibition of resale at a loss to regulate trade between member countries.
Before making its new ruling clarifying the scope of Community law in the
context of import restrictions, the Court referred to its 1979 landmark
decision in the 'Cassis de Dijon' case.
The Court said this held that, in the absence of harmonisation of
legislation, import restrictions prohibited by the treaty included obstacles
to the free movement of goods where they were the consequence of applying
national rules laying down certain requirements to be met by goods to
imports from other member countries where they are lawfully manufactured and
marketed, even if those rules apply without distinction to all products.
The only exception was when the application of the rules can be justified by
a public-interest objective taking precedence over the free movement of
goods.
But the Court then said: 'However, contrary to what has previously been
decided, the application to products from other member states of national
provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements is not
such as to hinder directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, trade
between member states within the meaning of the Dassonville judgment',
provided that the non-discrimination conditions are satisfied.
The Court said this kind of rule falls outside the scope of the treaty ban
on import restrictions.
The judgment is important for business. First, the Court has set out to
clarify the Rome treaty's ban on import restrictions in the context of
national rules which limit commercial freedom but are not aimed at products
from other member countries.
It specifically refers to the need to re-examine and clarify its case law in
view of the increasing tendency of businesses to invoke the treaty ban on
import restrictions as a means of challenging any rules which limit their
commercial freedom, even where such rules are not aimed at imports from
other member countries.
Second, the Court expressly acknowledges that this new ruling is 'contrary
to what has previously been decided'.
