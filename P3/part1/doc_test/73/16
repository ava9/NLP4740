PLEA TO DIM LIGHTS GETS GOOD RESULTS

The cry came from Palomar Observatory at the start of the decade: Turn down 
your lights! 
</P>
<P>
And by now they mostly have. 
</P>
<P>
The treasured astronomical finds being made from the world's most famous 
observatory were being jeopardized by Southern California's urban sprawl and 
the increasingly bright sea of street lights, illuminated billboards, parking 
lot lights and even front-yard landscaping lights pointing skyward. The problem 
did not exist atop Mt. Palomar when the observatory was under construction in 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The primary culprits were mercury vapor or incandescent lamps that were washing 
the sky with unwanted white light. Astronomers found that their light-gathering 
telescopes, trained on ultra-faint stars, galaxies and quasars in the far 
corners of the universe, were being poisoned by man's urban lighting. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, the astronomers at Caltech, which owns and operates the Palomar 
Observatory, mounted an intense public relations and political campaign to 
darken Southern California's night sky. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted outdoor light fixtures to be pointed downward. They asked that 
non-essential outdoor signs and billboards not be illuminated after midnight. 
And, most important, they wanted the state Department of Transportation, San 
Diego County and its various cities to convert their street and highway lights 
from the traditional white light to sodium light that -- while unpopular with 
some people because of its yellow hue -- is less offensive to the telescopes 
atop Mt. Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
The filters at the observatory can screen out the yellow light, while the 
low-pressure sodium bulbs effectively illuminate the same area. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the various public bureaucracies, sympathetic to the nature of 
astronomical research and not wanting to render useless one of Southern 
California's greatest scientific tools, cooperatively fell in line to reduce 
light pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, they agreed that when the old lights burned out, they would be 
replaced with sodium units. New housing and commercial developments were 
required to install the yellow lights from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had excellent cooperation and results," said Robert Brucato, the 
observatory's assistant director. "If 
</P>
<P>
the controls hadn't been put in place by the various agencies, we'd be in very 
bad shape right now." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Thicksten, the observatory's superintendent, admits that the new-generation 
public lighting casts an eerie glow over San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll get up in the middle of the night to check on things and I'll 
do a double-take when I look to San Diego," he said. "The region is in an 
orange-ish glow, like a distant forest fire." TOM GORMAN
