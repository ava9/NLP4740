HUBBLE BUILDERS GOT AWARD FEES, MAGAZINE SAYS;

FOR THEIR COST-CONTROL EFFORTS, A PUBLICATION REPORTS.

The government overpaid as much as $1 million in bonuses to two Hubble Space 
Telescope contractors for their cost-control efforts on the device, whose flaws 
have become a major problem for NASA, a magazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Quarterly reported in its Saturday edition that the overpayments 
occurred at the same time costs for the expensive telescope were rising 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The original cost estimate for the Hubble was $678 million, but its final price 
tag was more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said information about the bonus was contained in a July, 1989, 
audit report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's office of 
inspector general. The material was obtained through a Freedom of Information 
Act request. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble telescope was launched April 24 and NASA announced June 27 that its 
two main mirrors would not focus properly. A manufacturing error was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Quarterly said the inspector general's report accused NASA 
management of "not properly considering all . . . cost overruns" in figuring 
cost-control bonuses paid to Hubble's two principal contractors, Lockheed Corp. 
and Perkin-Elmer Corp., now Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which built 
the telescope's mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed received $14.4 million in bonuses and Hughes-Danbury was paid $6 
million in bonuses through April 30, 1987, the report said. If NASA had fully 
considered the cost overruns, the bonuses may have been reduced by as much as 
$1 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts Saturday to reach either of the contractors and NASA were 
unsuccessful. But Congressional Quarterly quoted project managers at Marshall 
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., as disagreeing with the audit 
conclusions but promising to implement many of the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed official also took issue with the report. The magazine said 
Hughes-Danbury declined to comment.
