FUTURE OF KECK TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the headline accompanying your article on the W.M. Keck 
Observatory conveyed a misleading impression of the technical feasibility of 
the project (Science/Medicine, Jan. 30). The principal innovation in the Keck 
Telescope is the use of a primary mirror comprised of 36 hexagonal segments. 
With this approach, it became possible to consider building a telescope with 
four times the mirror area of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the many milestones accomplished to date, the future of the Keck 
Telescope looks bright. Our successes are numerous: At the observatory site, a 
newly completed dome stands ready to receive the telescope. The telescope 
structure is scheduled to be shipped this spring for installation. The support 
systems for the mirror segments are finished. Work on the mirror segments 
recently passed into the manufacturing stage, following a lengthy and 
successful period of developing tools, test equipment, and manufacturing 
procedures suitable for the unique requirements of the segmented-mirror design. 
Even with the delay in mirror development, we expect to begin operations in 
1991, as scheduled, with a telescope that takes optimum advantage of the seeing 
conditions on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

The use of a segmented mirror has been made possible by two new technologies 
that have been developed and demonstrated with prototype hardware by J.E. 
Nelson and his colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. One of these 
involved the sensors and actuators needed to actively monitor and adjust the 
location of adjacent segments so that together they will form the surface of a 
single mirror 10 meters (400 inches) in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
The other enabling technology is stressed mirror polishing, a process that uses 
the simplicity of spherical polishing techniques to produce the aspherical 
surfaces of the individual segments. 
</P>
<P>
We are confident that the Keck Telescope will contribute to unprecedented 
astronomical discovery. By gathering faint light from the universe's most 
distant regions, the telescope will help us piece together the very early 
history of the universe and so learn how galaxies formed. By bringing us views 
from the interiors of star-forming clouds, it will provide insight into how our 
solar system formed.
