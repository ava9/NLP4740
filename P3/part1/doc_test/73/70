"Astronomy": "The Ultraviolet Universe: Space Telescope Studies 
New Stars"] 
  [Text] A new space-based ultraviolet telescope designed and 
built in Israel will make it possible to penetrate the mysteries 
of the universe. That telescope--the result of the joint efforts 
of Tel-Aviv University, the Israeli Space Agency, and the firm 
ELOP--will be the "all-seeing eye" of a spacecraft that will be 
launched in 1995. Israel has received permission to participate 
in an international project involving the first science mission 
for the study of celestial objects in the ultraviolet range of 
the spectrum. 
  "We have all the necessary basic infrastructure for space 
technologies," said Ethan Reys (Eytan Reys), the head of the 
space developments division of the firm ELOP. 
  The TAUVEX telescope (TAUVEX stands for Tel-Aviv University 
UV Explorer) was developed to fill the considerable gap in our 
knowledge of the universe. Astronomers have successfully 
observed stars in a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
to include the visible, radio, x-ray, and infrared ranges of the 
spectrum. The ultraviolet range, however, remains accessible in 
only individual fragments. 
  "It is impossible to perform sufficiently precise 
observations in the UV spectrum from the ground, because of the 
severe scattering of UV radiation in the atmosphere," said Reys. 
"The only way to get images of distant or weak stars is to take 
the science instrumentation into space." 
  TAUVEX will be pointed at "white dwarfs" (new stars that 
emit 
high-energy UV radiation), binaries (binary stars), galaxies, 
and quasars (extremely bright objects at the edge of the 
universe). "We expect the search for quasars to be more 
productive than any other search every undertaken," said Dr. N. 
Brosh, an astronomer at the Weiss [Vays] Observatory of Tel-Aviv 
University. That observatory is the most active observatory in 
the Eastern Mediterranean. "We expect to catalog more than 
10,000 new quasars, which will be identified from their UV 
spectra. At present, only about 4,000 quasars are known from 
ground-based observations." 
  The information that will be obtained in the course of the 
mission will help scientists to have a better understanding of 
the physical nature of high-energy sources such as neutron stars 
and black holes. Using the broad-range UV telescope, scientists 
will have a unique opportunity to get to the heart of the 
process associated with the formation of stars and to ascertain 
their makeup, velocity, size, age, emittance, and position. All 
that information not only expands our knowledge of the current 
state of stars, their origin, and history, but will also help to 
predict their future. 
  The images will be obtained with three telescopes: two of 
them designed for scientific research, and the third serving as 
a position and velocity sensor for the spacecraft itself. Those 
data are very important in that producing images requires 
lengthy exposures. "The data of the third telescope will make it 
possible to reconstruct images that are blurry because of the 
long exposure while the spacecraft is moving. The information on 
direction and velocity makes it possible to produce images as if 
from an immobile platform," said Reys. 
  The spacecraft will be launched into an elliptical orbit 
with 
a maximum distance from Earth of 200,000 km and a revolution 
period of three days. Low-orbit satellites usually complete a 
revolution in an hour and a half. The satellite will function in 
orbit for three years. 
  One other unique feature of the TAUVEX system is that it 
provides a field of view that is 500 times greater than the 
field of view of the wide-angle camera of the Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
  The satellite is to be launched from the CIS. The data will 
be received at sites in Russia, but will be made accessible to 
all scientists participating in the project.
