The recent approval by the Ontario government of a CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds
600m), 20-year project to renovate 34 small hydro electric power stations in
the Canadian province highlights the growing potential of retrofit
programmes for old hydro plants.
At a time when the construction of new hydro electric projects is being
stalled throughout the world by environmental and financing problems,
electric utilities are turning to renovation of old plants as a way to
increase power output significantly and quickly without adding to
environmental disturbance.
There is hardly a single component in an old hydro station whose performance
cannot be improved by a more efficient modern equivalent. Digital controls,
for example, permit more efficient use of the water flow than old manual
ones.
Thanks to the recent development of computer-aided flow simulation
technology, the biggest gains can now be obtained by designing new,
optimised turbines to make maximum use of the available water.
According to the Escher Wyss division of Sulzer, the Swiss engineering
group, retrofitting newly designed turbines can yield increases of power
generation capacity from an existing plant of between 15 and 20 per cent. If
combined with redesigned and manufactured waterways and generator sets, the
gains can be even larger.
The benefits from good turbine design are of two types. First, the
efficiency of the turbine itself can be improved. However, the potential
there is relatively modest, the big gains having been made already. The
efficiency of modern turbines is generally over 90 per cent compared with 75
per cent in 1900.
The other, more important, benefit comes from designing the turbine so that
the flow rate from the same head of water can be increased. The problem with
high flow rates is that the differential in pressure between the two sides
of the turbine blades rises and this accelerates erosion of the blades
through a process known as cavitation (air bubbles imploding against the
surface of the blade). Using computational fluid dynamics, it is possible to
optimise the shape of the blades and water guides to minimise the erosion.
Escher Wyss, one of the world's top three water turbine makers, claims a
lead over its competitors in the lively retrofit sector because of the high
level of sophistication of its computer simulation programmes, developed
during the 1980s in co-operation with the University of Lausanne.
The company says that its programmes work considerably faster than those of
its competitors, so that it can carry out a flow analysis of a specific case
in only a few hours.
This means it can explore several alternative solutions over a period of a
few weeks to find the most suitable one. 'The bottleneck today is the
engineer's understanding, not the computer,' says Helmut Keck, head of
research and development at the hydraulics division of Sulzer-Escher Wyss.
The programmes have also become increasingly precise, with a recent addition
even to simulate cavitation. The company is working on a programme that will
simulate the whole turbine-generator complex.
Keck says that, in cases of small turbines at least, there is no longer any
need to go through the expensive and time-consuming step of building a scale
model to verify the performance claims produced by its computer analysis.
This means that the time from order to completed installation can be cut
almost in half from about two years to one year.
The company's first large-scale use of the technology was for the McCormick
power station of Manicouagan Power in Canada's Quebec province. New turbines
were designed to fit into the existing casing, and the computer simulation
suggested an increase in output of about 14 per cent. A model test confirmed
the indication, and the actual installation, which is just now taking place,
appears to be confirming the projections.
On the Ontario Hydro contract, Escher Wyss's Canadian subsidiary will make
comprehensive proposals for rehabilitating 34 power stations throughout the
province and supply what it calls water to wire electro-mechanical equipment
packages for them. The value of its contract is about CDollars 350m.
Christian Habegger, general manager of hydraulics at Sulzer-Escher Wyss
headquarters in Zurich, says the retrofit business looks set to continue to
grow, especially in industrialised countries where nuclear power plants have
become unpopular.
Habegger says the technology could also be helpful in eastern European
countries where many hydro plants are in a poor state of repair and where
utilities urgently need new sources of power so that they can shut down
their dangerous nuclear plants.
