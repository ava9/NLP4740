What's the big movie this summer? "Batman." What's the big musical? "The 
Phantom of the Opera." What do they have in common? 
</P>
<P>
We already know the story. Like the Greeks trooping into the amphitheater to 
see the latest version of "Medea," we've got a general sense of who the 
characters are and what sort of thing will happen to them. But we're eager to 
see what this telling of the tale will produce. "Tell it again," we say. 'And, 
pray, surprise us." 
</P>
<P>
It's the same with "Cinderella" at Long Beach Civic Light Opera and "Peter Pan" 
at Occidental College's splendid new Keck Theatre. In fact, these are stories 
that we may know too well, those of us who aren't children. Is there anything 
new to say about Cinderella? 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim proved that there was in "Into the Woods." But the LBCLO 
version is Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1957 TV musical adapted for the stage. It 
is rather sweet and slightly funny. (Cinderella's sisters -- Pamela Myers and 
Kathryn Skatula -- are stupes rather than meanies.) 
</P>
<P>
Enchanting? No. Without camping the story, Hammerstein reduces it to his kind 
of fairy tale, where an adorable young woman learns to follow her dream and 
thereby catch the prize, i.e., the prince. It's to the credit of actress Juliet 
Lambert that we like Cinderella as much as we do, for her lyrics are mush. 
</P>
<P>
The prince is played by Greg Louganis, the Olympic diver. When he waltzes with 
Cinderella, it's a neat but modest one-two-three. He has pitch problems in "Do 
I Love You Because You're Beautiful, or Are You Beautiful Because I Love You?" 
</P>
<P>
His line readings aren't bad, though. We can even say that he creates a 
character: a likable young man who doesn't particularly want to be a prince, 
but who is living up to what his parents (Alan Young, Marilyn Child) expect of 
him. This probably comes closer to real life than the standard Prince Charming, 
and is at least a point of interest in Fran Soeder's by-the-book staging. 
</P>
<P>
The major technical interest is to see how the show adapts to the stage. Not 
badly. Cinderella's friendly godmother, Pat Carroll, turns the pumpkin into the 
coach practically before our very eyes (Adam Bezark is credited with the 
special effects), and Cinderella throws her wedding bouquet to the audience, 
proving that it's not TV. 
</P>
<P>
Point of information: The King and Queen's duet, "Boys and Girls Like You and 
Me," wasn't written for "Cinderella" but for "Oklahoma." It was dropped in 
Boston and ought to be dropped here too -- it doesn't pertain. 
</P>
<P>
If "Cinderella" offers no surprises, Occidental's "Peter Pan" offers several. 
This is not the Disney version (back in the movie theaters this summer) and 
it's not the Mary Martin musical version either. It is Sir James M. Barrie's 
original 1903 play, expanded with sections from the novel. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie was a mother-dominated Scots bachelor who really did believe in 
ghoulies, beasties and things that go bump in the dark, and there's a lot more 
death and sex in his story than are dreamed of in the usual presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being a sparky little guy who always gets to go out to play, Peter 
can almost be seen as a creature being punished for his hubris -- a "lost boy" 
who will never make human contact, will never grow older and will never be 
permitted to die. 
</P>
<P>
The gloom is heavily observed in Alan Freeman's production, with its dark 
atmospherics (Pamela Gross did the filmy setting, Howard Schmitt the costumes) 
and its mournful piano music. And yet Freeman's cast tries to play the story 
cheerfully, the way it is played in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity created problems at the preview I saw, which also had some 
technical problems. For example, John Clancy as Peter -- yes, a young man in 
the role for once -- is as frank and open as Huck Finn. But with none of the 
latent poignancy that comes across even in the musical. It's particularly 
missed when the approach is so decidedly serious. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Walsh's Wendy did, however, evoke some of that character's very 
complicated reactions when Peter insists on treating her as his mother. And the 
flying sequences (as in all productions of "Peter Pan," they are managed by the 
Foy Brothers) are magical. 
</P>
<P>
The new Keck Hall is a beauty, by the way: a state-of-the-art version of a 
European court theater, just large enough (400 seats) to make a young performer 
extend himself, but not too large to daunt him. 
</P>
