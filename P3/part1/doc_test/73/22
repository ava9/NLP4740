<P>
This is the drudgery that leads to scientific discovery: the incessant clacking 
of a motor, a technician licking the cream center from a split Oreo cookie, and 
another talking at 4 in the morning about soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
A third worker suggests a soap opera title that would mirror life here, at the 
Palomar Observatory: "As the Dome Turns -- The Continuing Saga." 
</P>
<P>
As she laughs, the dome is turning: the spherical roof above the 48-inch Oschin 
telescope atop Palomar Mountain. A 14-inch-square piece of chemically treated 
glass is being exposed for more than an hour to the night sky as the telescope 
moves almost imperceptibly so the star images won't be blurred by Earth's own 
rotation. The clack-clack-clack is the sound of electrical relays as motors 
nudge the telescope ever so slightly upward and to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Night in, night out -- except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Night -- these 
specially trained telescope and photographic technicians gather to soak in 
Palomar Mountain's most glorious view -- not the pines and grazing meadows and 
gloriously blue sky by day, but the never-ending speckles of galaxies, quasars, 
asteroids and stars framed by the black sea of night, far too faint to be seen 
by the unassisted eye. 
</P>
<P>
These are celestial cartographers documenting the northern sky, preparing a 
sort of Thomas Guide of the stars that will serve as a reference atlas to 
direct astronomers around the world as they search for answers to the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The ones who work here are not formal astronomers with doctoral degrees. They 
were hired for their various technical expertise, trained on the job and paid 
about $25,000 a year to photograph the night sky for later inspection, not 
unlike a nurse preparing the patient for a physician's scalpel. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet, hiccup routine of a night within the 22-year-old dome -- peaks of 
activity separated by tiresome stretches of whiling away the hours -- belies 
the scientific discoveries that are probably being made. The place doesn't have 
the aura of astronomy at the vanguard. In a downstairs office, below the dome's 
telescope, there's only one computer -- the kind you can buy off the shelf in 
an electronics store. 
</P>
<P>
There are no video display terminals allowing a glimpse into what the telescope 
itself is seeing -- just a darkroom where the glass negatives are carefully 
developed, dried and packed for shipment to the California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena for later inspection. A refrigerator is stocked with 
soda and a couple of frozen dinners. The microwave oven is mostly for popcorn. 
Hardly high-glitz stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The Oschin telescope is no headline grabber. The Sky Survey started two years 
ago, and, after some false starts, about 500 plates have been successfully 
exposed. The survey won't be completed until the mid-1990s. Not much breaking 
news here. 
</P>
<P>
But someday -- maybe in a week, maybe in 10 years -- an astronomer will inspect 
one of the exposed glass negatives and probably discover a heavenly body never 
before spotted by the human eye, expanding our knowledge of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
It's 5:30 p.m. and the moon has set, half an hour behind the sun, giving way to 
a black, cloudless sky -- perfect conditions for some astronomical work. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Mueller, Cindy Brewer and Dave Mendenhall are in an office below the 
Oschin telescope, which was put to work in 1947 as an instrument specifically 
designed to photograph the stars. Unlike the neighboring and more famous 
200-inch Hale telescope, through which the universe's most distant and faint 
objects can be detected and studied, the Oschin is a wide-angle telescope that 
provides broader vistas of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The full moon would fill up the Hale's view of the sky. But a sky view 13 moons 
wide can be photographed through the Oschin's 48-inch lens opening. Despite the 
wider view, Mueller, Brewer and Mendenhall will still need to take 894 pictures 
of the northern sky to complete their celestial scrapbook, so that astronomers 
on more narrowly focused missions will know where to train their larger 
telescopes. They'll take two more rounds of photos -- with different filters, 
in order to detect stars emitting different colors of light -- for a final 
complement of 2,682 pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Under the best of circumstances -- a long, dark, cloudless night -- six 
pictures can be taken. That makes it a frustratingly slow process, but Mueller 
says the rewards, however esoteric, are mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
"You know for a fact you're seeing objects never seen before by a human," she 
says. "That's instant gratification." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller will spend part of the night comparing the newly exposed photographic 
plates with ones taken 35 to 40 years ago, when the first survey was conducted. 
Because of advances not only in the hardware of the telescope but, more 
important, in the Kodak film emulsions, objects that were three or four times 
too faint to have been spotted in the late 1940s and early '50s can now be 
photographed. Put another way, the new film material allows the Oschin to 
detect, in rough terms, objects twice as far away. 
</P>
<P>
How many more celestial objects will now be found remains to be seen; it will 
take years for scientists around the world years to pore over the plates being 
exposed by the nighttime trio. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing the findings of the new survey to the first one, astronomers will 
also be able to determine just how the structure and mass of the Milky Way has 
shifted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that discoveries will be made on these plates 15 years from 
now," Mueller says. "It depends on what the people will be looking for. But 
these plates will be keeping astronomers busy for generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
They're exposing their first plate for the evening so they can make sure the 
instrument is in focus for the night's work. 
</P>
<P>
The plate sits in a frame in the middle of the telescope's tube, catching the 
light that enters the lens of the scope and is collected by the 72-inch 
spherical mirror at the bottom. The mirror focuses the light rays back up the 
tube, onto the glass plate coated with chemicals to preserve the photons of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of the new-age photo emulsions -- which produce 
high-resolution negatives -- require exposures of an hour or longer and 
supersensitive developing techniques that last two hours from start to finish. 
But the most critical and difficult work, Mueller says, is in making sure the 
picture is in focus. 
</P>
<P>
The photographic plate must be placed within 30 microns, or one-tenth the 
thickness of Scotch tape, of the optimum position within the telescope's tube 
in order for the light rays to be in pinpoint focus. Even a piece of dust in 
the plate's frame, or the changing night temperature on the glass itself, can 
affect that focus. So throughout the night, the telescope may be adjusted by 
mere microns. 
</P>
<P>
The first plate is now developed. Mueller puts it beneath a microscope, takes 
some readings and telephones the information upstairs to Mendenhall, who pushes 
a button on the telescope's control panel to place the frame correctly within 
the telescope tube, for the first Sky Survey exposure of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Back downstairs, Brewer flips through a computer printout showing, in columns 
of numbers, the nightly coordinates of locater stars that the telescope will 
home in on to photograph that particular piece of the sky. She picks a star in 
a sky field that has not yet been photographed, and sends the coordinates 
upstairs to Mendenhall. He twirls a dial on the telescope's auto-guidance 
gizmo, then pushes a button that swings the telescope into position. The slit 
in the dome follows suit. A smaller telescope attached to the larger one finds 
the target star, and locks in to its brightness so it can track it during the 
exposure. Everything is set; the lens is opened, and Mendenhall, working in 
virtual darkness, walks downstairs into the warm office, where he'll kick up 
his feet and work his way through Carlos Castaneda's "The Eagle's Gift." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer now peers at a readout that shows the rate of light photons hitting the 
glass plate. Based on that, she determines the exposure time on the plate to 
that part of the sky -- an exposure that changes based on how bright that part 
of the sky is that night. 
</P>
<P>
It is just after 6 p.m. They will be here for 12 more hours. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the high-tech care, mistakes, while rare, sometimes happen. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time they forgot to take the giant dust cover off the lens -- an error 
that went unnoticed until the blank plate was developed. (After all, you never 
actually look through the telescope itself during an exposure.) 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they forgot to throw the switch so the dome and telescope would 
move in sync with Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they put the film frame in backward, or the time they put the glass 
plate into the frame, but forgot to raise the frame into the telescope so it 
could be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they forgot to close the box of unexposed glass plates when the 
lights were turned on. 
</P>
<P>
Danger. Humans at work. 
</P>
<P>
It's 7:30 p.m. and Mendenhall drives over -- with only his car's parking lights 
shining his way so he won't pollute the darkness -- to the nearby lodge -- 
nicknamed "The Monastery" -- to snatch some Oreo cookies. The Monastery houses 
visiting astronomers and graduate students, who sleep by day while working at 
the mountain's other telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer and Mueller, who are on the observatory staff full time, live in their 
own small cabins on the observatory campus. Mendenhall also is an observatory 
employee, as opposed to a visiting scientist, but lives a few miles away in his 
own mountaintop ranch home, where he helps manage the family cattle business. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being part of scientific discovery," says the 30-year-old Brewer, an 
Iowa girl who spent 19 years in the Navy as an electronics technician, training 
that serves her well here. When she got out of the Navy, she sought out Palomar 
Mountain's solitude because she basically doesn't like being around crowds of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
She works a shift of 10 nights on, four nights off. She sees her husband, still 
serving in the Navy and stationed in Long Beach, only on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
She likes being up here, virtually unsupervised by the actual astronomers who 
work at Cal Tech, which owns Palomar Observatory. "We'll probably never see 
astronomers inside here," she said. "To do quality work, we need the same 
regimen. That's why we're the same ones doing it night in, night out. The 
astronomers may send down orders to us about shooting a particular sky field 
because there's been a request for one in particular. But essentially we're on 
our own, doing our job." 
</P>
<P>
Now it's 8:15. Mendenhall, back from his cookie run, is upstairs, putting in 
the night's second glass plate. The phone rings on the control board. "Is 
Felipe there?" Wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
In the downstairs darkroom, the first Sky Survey exposure of the night -- a 
look through a spiral arm of our own Milky Way -- has been developed, and 
Mueller cringes. Across the frame are two dark streaks -- the lights of an 
airplane that flew 10,000 feet overhead. An untold number of previously 
undiscovered galaxies millions of light-years away may have been obliterated by 
an airplane bound for Ontario or March Air Force Base. Two hours of work -- and 
a $100 photographic plate -- down the tubes. The plate is unusable. 
</P>
<P>
8:40 p.m. A consolation bag of popcorn is taken out of the microwave and 
there's general complaining because a lot of the kernels didn't pop. 
</P>
<P>
Even the astronomers making heralded discoveries at the neighboring, 200-inch 
Hale -- the world's most valuable land-based tool for inspecting deep space -- 
look to the little guy next door, the 48-incher, for help. 
</P>
<P>
"Without it, we'd be lost," said J.B. Oke, who, along with fellow Cal Tech 
astronomer Marshall Cohen, is in the computer control room of the more famous 
Hale, studying the evolution of distant galaxies. "It gives us the road map so 
we know were to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Oschin is "the most-used astronomical instrument in the world," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brucato is the assistant director of Palomar Observatory; he spends some 
time here and some time at his main office in Pasadena. "So much of science is 
perceived to be gee-whiz stuff, the 'Eureka! I found it!' " he says. "But the 
real progress is made through the drudgery of picking away at the sky, piece by 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"When the 200-incher was being designed, we didn't know what the sky looked 
like and what limits the 200-incher would reach. It was like navigating without 
a map. We didn't know where to look. So we built the 48-incher to help us." 
</P>
<P>
The first Sky Survey was conducted between 1947 and 1956; those photographs 
have since been shared with more than 100 astronomers worldwide, who use it as 
a reference guide to zero in on their particular work. 
</P>
<P>
Given advances in both the construction of telescope lenses and the chemical 
makeup of photo emulsions, the new survey will provide more celestial street 
signs and landmarks for astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hale telescope now "reads" the light in space through a 3-inch-square 
electronic device covered by 6 million ultra-light-sensitive silicon chips -- 
which is then converted digitally by a computer to shades of black and white 
and transferred to a video monitor. The Oschin produces images of space the 
old-fashioned way, through black and white photos. 
</P>
<P>
A similar survey -- this one of the southern sky -- is being conducted in 
Australia, so astronomers will be gifted with an all-encompassing, updated sky 
map. 
</P>
<P>
It's 10:15 p.m. The second plate of the night has been developed -- showing 
this time not one but three separate airplanes having crossed above the 
telescope, leaving six black lines as unwanted souvenirs. "Shoot!" Mueller 
exclaims. O-for-2 on what were otherwise perfect exposures. 
</P>
<P>
It's not too unusual for the first exposure of the night to be ruined by an 
airplane, but two bad plates causes audible irritation. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomy is Mueller's life. The 39-year-old former librarian pores over the 
negatives as they come out of the wash, and is typically back at the dome even 
on her days off to further scrutinize the plates. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller has discovered 10 supernovas, four asteroids and a comet that now 
carries her name. It's due to fly by Earth again in late 1995. "I was just 
scanning the plate, and there it was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you inspect the plates, you almost can't think about what you're looking 
at, because it would be so overwhelming," she says. "When you realize how much 
is out there, it keeps us in our place." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer offers a similar perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at plate after plate of stars and galaxies that go on forever and get 
fainter and fainter and fainter," she said. "It's mind-boggling. I'm not a 
religious person, but it makes you think about God. What if the big-bang theory 
is just bunk? What if God just threw out his arms one day and there it all 
was?" 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall, 46, a quiet, no-nonsense man, began working at the observatory 10 
months ago. He's a fourth-generation mountain resident who, as a child, dreamed 
of working inside one of the domes. Having worked the family ranch and having 
spent 10 years as an air traffic controller, he was hired for the Sky Survey 
earlier this year because of his high-tech mechanical expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this project because it's finite, with a specific goal," he says. "It's 
been done only one time in history, and this may be the last time. I want to be 
a part of it." With a smile, he adds boyishly: "I like to make the telescope 
go." 
</P>
<P>
An Oscar Wilde quote is printed on a placard stuck to the wall of the office: 
"We are all lying in a gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars." 
</P>
<P>
It's half-past-midnight. The third plate has been developed -- and it, too, is 
marred by the lights of yet another airplane. Mueller debates whether to go for 
the chicken or linguine frozen dinner. Linguine it is. Mendenhall has his feet 
up on the desk, eyes closed. Brewer just sits there, looking at the readout of 
the rate of photons exposing the plate like some late-night movie. 
</P>
<P>
Boring. 
</P>
<P>
2:17 a.m. The fourth plate came out fine, with no airplane streaks. Finally, a 
decent exposure! The fifth plate is now being exposed. It will be finished at 
3:25. Is there time for a sixth plate? "We have until 5:15 to finish that 
exposure," Mueller says. "Piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
3:50 a.m. Mendenhall is working his way through "The Eagle's Gift." Brewer is 
filling out the log sheet for the night's exposures. Mueller is developing the 
fifth plate. It's 42 degrees upstairs in the dome. 
</P>
<P>
4:45 a.m. "Our last exposure will be done five minutes before astronomical 
twilight," Brewer says. "It looks like we're going to eke out every photon out 
of the night sky. The photons are crying out for immortality on our plates." 
</P>
<P>
Getting a little punchy now. 
</P>
<P>
5:02 a.m. The fifth plate is developed and looks great. No airplane streaks. 
The sixth and final plate of the night is now out of the telescope and in the 
developer. Mendenhall goes upstairs, secures the telescope, closes the dome and 
goes home, his chores done for the night. "When I wake up," he says, "I'm going 
to do some real work. Cut firewood." 
</P>
<P>
At 5:31, Mueller is looking at the last plate and her attention is drawn to a 
particularly bright galaxy. "Oooooh!" she coos to no one in particular. "Maybe 
I'll come in tomorrow after all." It's supposed to be her day off. 
</P>
<P>
The night's score card: Out of six plates, three are ruined by airplanes and 
three are keepers. It's now nearly 6 a.m.; the eastern sky is turning a blood 
red. Distant roosters are announcing the new day, and the surveyors of the 
stars are calling it a night.
