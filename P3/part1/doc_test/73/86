  [Abstract] A new telescope has been developed for night 
observations at 3-5 mlx background illuminance without 
brightening. The objective of this NZT-3 telescope consists of 
seven successively smaller lenses on the main optical axis: 
convexo-plane first lens; double-convex second lens and 
double-concave third lens forming a compound pair; 
double-concave fourth lens; convexo-concave fifth lens and sixth 
lens; concavo-plane seventh lens. The objective is followed by 
an electron image converter tube on the same optical axis and 
the latter by an image erector consisting of four compound 
lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the main one: 
plano-concave lens and double-convex lens forming first pair; 
plano-convex lens and double-convex lens forming second pair; 
convexo-concave lens and double-convex lens forming third pair; 
double-convex lens and concavo-convex lens forming fourth pair. 
A rotating plane mirror mounted at a 45ë angle to each of 
the two mutually perpendicular optical axes reflects light 
emerging from the image converter into the image erector. A 
second such mirror parallel to the first one reflects light 
emerging from the image erector into an ocular consisting of six 
lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the image 
erector axis and thus parallel to the main one: plano-concave 
first lens; double-concave second lens and double-convex third 
lens forming a compound pair; double-convex fourth lens and 
concavo-convex fifth lens forming a compound pair; convexo-plane 
sixth lens. The light source enclosed with the telescope is a 
type-A laser and a beam-forming objective consisting of three 
lenses of the same size: plane-convex first and third lenses; 
double-convex second lens touching first lens on the optical 
axis. The telescope characteristics include a magnification of 
at least 5.4, a field of vision angle of at least 5ë, and a 
focusing power within (+/-)4 diopters. The telescope has 
successfully passed all tests, including illumination 
measurements. It operates with an internal or external 13.5 V 
electric power supply and weighs 4.5 kg. Figures 3; tables 1;
