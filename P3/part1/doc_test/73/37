A POSSIBLE solution to the dispute between the US and the European Community
over telecommunications and other government procurement contracts was
raised by negotiators yesterday based on 'comparable, effective and lasting
access' to each other's markets, and equal treatment to each other's
exporters.
Negotiators agreed after two days of discussions in Washington that the EC
could exempt US companies from rules which discriminate in favour of EC
bidders for procurement contracts 'if we have comparable access to the US
market'. They plan to meet again in Brussels on March 11.
The clash over public procurement flared last month after the new US
administration threatened to bar European companies from bidding for federal
contracts in the US unless European procurement regulations favouring local
manufacturers were dismantled. It set March 22 as a deadline for EC action.
EC officials conceded in Washington after this week's discussions that there
were 'obstacles in the way' of US companies competing for EC procurement
contracts, but insisted that the market was opening up, and 'serious trade
is being done'.
But they also insisted that systemic differences made it difficult for US
officials to recognise the obstacles that existed for foreign companies to
compete for US procurement contracts. Among these are 'Buy America' laws
used in some federal contracts, and by 37 state governments in the US;
special monopoly privileges under which companies such as AT&amp;T operate; and
the arbitrary use of design standards to keep foreign companies at bay.
'We are trying to find out whether two systems which are completely
different in design - ours based on rules and regulation, and the US system
based on private sector competition - can produce comparable results in
terms of market access for foreign companies,' said Mr Jorn Keck, who headed
the EC negotiating team in Washington.
In response to US arguments that large US private sector telecommunications
operators such as AT&amp;T, MCI-Sprint, GTE or the 'baby Bells', should not be
subject to procurement rules because they are not government run, Mr Keck
said: 'We don't care whether a company is private or not. What really counts
is not ownership, but government regulation, and whether a company has
special or exclusive rights.
'When you look at AT&amp;T, you see they are operating under special privileges,
under monopoly conditions. We need to look at their procurement behaviour
because it is not what you would expect in a free market.'
Officials say they have agreed a text from which to continue negotiations on
telecommunications contracts.
