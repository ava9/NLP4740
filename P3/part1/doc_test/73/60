On Monday, the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by
Christopher Columbus, the US space agency Nasa will start mankind's first
systematic search for extra-terrestrial intelligence.
Seti is a mainstream scientific enterprise, not to be confused with the
fringe activities of UFO hunters. Most astronomers believe that intelligent
life must be widespread elsewhere in the universe and that Seti has a fair
chance of detecting its existence. Such a discovery could be the most
significant scientific event in human history.
The project will use the world's most powerful radio-telescopes, combined
with computerised analysis, to search for artificial signals from alien
life.
On Monday afternoon, Nasa astronomer Jill Tarter will switch on the
300-metre dish at Arecibo in Puerto Rico at the same moment as her colleague
Sam Gulkis activates the 34-metre antenna at Goldstone, California. Within a
month the two antennae will have scanned the sky millions of times more
thoroughly than all previous searches.
The Seti story started in 1960 when Professor Frank Drake tuned his
radio-telescope to a nearby star which, he thought, might have a planetary
system capable of sustaining life. Since then, astronomers have carried out
about 50 individual Seti projects and detected some intriguing signals, but
no clear message from extra-terrestrial life.
Seti supporters are not dismayed by their failure so far, because the
methods used have been rudimentary compared with Nasa's new survey which
uses microwaves - high frequency radio waves. Prof Drake, still the leading
enthusiast, confidently expects an extra-terrestrial signal to be picked up
within 10 years. John Billingham, head of the Seti office at Nasa's Ames
Research Centre in California, says cautiously: 'It's not unreasonable to
think we might detect something.'
Sir Francis Graham-Smith of Britain's Jodrell Bank observatory, which has
helped carry out preparatory research for Seti, is more doubtful. 'The odds
are pretty heavily against hearing a real squeak,' he says. 'But I admire
people who are prepared to dedicate so much of their lives to Seti.'
Recent scientific discoveries support the view that the universe is full of
life. Astronomers now believe billions of other stars have planets like our
solar system. And simple organic molecules, similar to the chemical building
blocks of terrestrial life, are distributed widely through interstellar
space.
'Given enough time and favourable environmental conditions, biological
complexity and intelligence may also have evolved in many locations,' says
Bob Arnold of Nasa. 'If only one site in a thousand has developed
intelligence and technology, there may now be about 10m advanced
civilisations in our galaxy.'
That may be a wild overestimate. Even so, few astronomers believe we are the
only technologically advanced species in our galaxy.
Of all the uncertainties involved in estimating the number of
extra-terrestrial civilisations, the most uncertain is knowing how long they
last on average. Is it a consequence of natural evolution that intelligent
life tends to destroy itself through warfare and/or pollution, soon after it
has mastered the technology to communicate across the galaxy? If so, there
may be only a handful of civilisations in existence at any one time.
On the other hand, if the universe really is teeming with advanced life, why
have we not picked up its signals already? Possibly because the cleanest and
more efficient medium of interstellar communication is not radio but
something our primitive human minds have not yet thought of.
But, with our present technology, searching by radio is the only practical
option. Although Seti astronomers have no idea where in the sky to point
their receivers, they can make an educated guess about the channels likely
to be used for interstellar messages. The Nasa project is concentrating on
the portion of the microwave spectrum which suffers least from natural
background noise.
Over the next 10 years, the scientists plan to use nine radio-telescopes
around the globe to carry out two linked searches. The 'targeted search'
will examine 1,000 individual stars within 100 light-years of earth,
selected for their similarity to our sun. The 'sky survey' will scan the
whole heavens, with a less sensitive resolution.
Computers will process the radio output at a rate equivalent to millions of
words per second. They are programmed to pick out any pattern not
corresponding to signals from known astronomical processes or human
communications.
Man-made interference is a growing problem, as satellite and earth-based
microwave transmissions steadily obliterate the channels chosen for Seti.
'Daily the task becomes more difficult,' Nasa says.
If Nasa does detect an alien signal through the buzz of human communications
it will follow the Seti code of conduct drawn up by the International
Academy of Astronautics. There will be no public announcement until an
international panel of scientists has verified the finding.
What happens then depends on the nature of the signal. Most exciting would
be a 'we are here' message, deliberately transmitted by an alien species
trying to make contact with intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. It
would presumably be based on universal mathematical or physical constants,
for simple decoding.
But if we were eavesdropping on signals transmitted for other purposes - for
example the extra-terrestrial equivalent of the radio waves which have been
leaking out from earth for the past 50 years from television broadcasts and
radars - human scientists might not be able to extract any detailed
information from them.
Under the Seti code, no reply can be broadcast unless political leaders have
agreed on its contents through the United Nations. One can imagine an
impassioned debate, weighing the benefits of learning from more advanced
creatures against the risks of alerting them to our existence.
We would be insulated by an inbuilt time delay. Each message would take tens
or hundreds of years to cross interstellar space, and it would take the
aliens far longer than that physically to reach us unless they have learned
to travel at the speed of light. Even so, the fate of the indigenous
inhabitants of the New World after 1492 might provide an awful warning about
the dangers of contact with a more advanced civilisation.
