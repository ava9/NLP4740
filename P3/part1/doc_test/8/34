challenging the big film studios

Barely a day had gone by in the seven weeks since Jeffrey Katzenberg handed
in his resignation as head of Walt Disney's movie studios without the
Hollywood gossips lining him up with yet another new partner or venture.
This week, the guessing was over. Mr Katzenberg announced that he was
teaming up with his two closest friends: Steven Spielberg, the highly
successful film maker, and David Geffen, the billionaire rock music mogul,
to create a 'dream team' entertainment group.
Their aim is to challenge the leading movie studios that have dominated
Hollywood for decades, such as Disney, which in its last audited accounts
made total revenue of Dollars 2.2bn. The critical question is whether wealth
and talent will be enough to enable them to fulfil their ambitions in the
cut-throat entertainment industry.
'These guys have got great timing,' said Tim Wallace, entertainment industry
analyst at SG Warburg Securities in New York. 'There's huge growth potential
in the industry and no shortage of new investors. But this is a complex and
costly business. They've got lots of talent but enormous egos.'
The three men are dazzlingly wealthy. Katzenberg, 43, is fresh from the
success of The Lion King, Disney's latest animated hit. He is a millionaire
after cashing in his Disney share options.
His partners are two of the wealthiest people in the US. Spielberg, 47,
directed four of the 10 most commercially successful films ever, including
ET and Jurassic Park. Geffen, 51, has become a billionaire by investing the
Dollars 700m he made by selling his Geffen Records stake in MCA to Japan's
Matsushita.
So far, they have been short on detail about their venture. All that has
been said is that they will be equal partners in the company, which will
launch early next year with Dollars 250m of their own capital. Geffen Films
will be merged into the new business, as will Mr Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment. The venture will develop its own projects in animation,
movies, television, music and interactive entertainment.
The decision to create a fully fledged studio flies in the face of current
industry trends. A studio is a huge enterprise with big buildings, a large
staff and highly sophisticated technology.
No one knows exactly how much it will cost the dream team to launch their
studio. However, industry estimates suggest that if they hope to establish
the company as a force in animation, for example, they will need to make a
total investment of up to Dollars 500m over five years in order to release
at least three films of the same quality as The Lion King.
Most new arrivals in Hollywood have balked at such an expensive and lengthy
investment. Some have bought existing studios as Mr Rupert Murdoch did with
20th Century Fox, Sony with Columbia and Matsushita with MCA/Universal.
Mr Murdoch has made a success of Fox. But Sony is still struggling to
restore Columbia's fortunes, while Matsushita is embroiled in an acrimonious
row with the MCA management over the latter's desire to buy back the
business.
Other recent investors have invented 'virtual' studios by making films in
rented facilities and by making piecemeal investments in independent
producers. Ted Turner, the CNN magnate, adopted this approach in making the
recent cult comedy, The Mask. So did PolyGram, the London-based music group,
with Four Weddings and a Funeral.
However, life in the independent sector can be perilous, as illustrated this
week by Carolco, the independent US producer. It is now struggling for
survival after its proposed merger with the Live Entertainment retail group
collapsed this week.
The risks of launching a studio are even greater. But so are the potential
rewards, particularly in animation, where the studio can count on an
impressionable market of children - and their parents - to boost sales of
video, books, toys and other merchandise associated with film. Disney took
Dollars 267m at the box office in the first four months after launching The
Lion King in the US, but that has been surpassed by the income from
merchandising.
'An animated hit like The Lion King can make a fortune,' said Richard
Grand-Jean, president of Global Film Equity, the New York-based film finance
specialists. 'But Thumbelina, which didn't do well at the box office, made
money from video. And no one is better at animation than Jeffrey
Katzenberg.'
Katzenberg and his partners have chosen a good time to launch their venture.
The traditional movie business is buoyant. Box office takings in the US have
reached Dollars 3.94bn so far this year, according to Variety magazine,
against Dollars 3.82bn and Dollars 3.43bn in the same periods of 1993 and
1992 respectively.
The international box office is even healthier, thanks to the emergence of
new markets in eastern Europe and Asia, most recently in China, where Time
Warner has just signed a distribution deal with the authorities.
The merchandising market is also showing strong growth, as illustrated by
The Lion King's success. Meanwhile, new technology offers exciting
opportunities in movie-making and interactive entertainment for the studios
to explore in the future.
Spielberg is a technology fiend, and was at the forefront of experiments in
digital technology with his special effects for Jurassic Park. He sees the
new studio as an ideal vehicle for his future experiments. The next wave of
technological developments should take the studios into new forms of
distribution, such as CD-Roms for use in the home and more sophisticated
cinemas that replicate movie special effects, such as the physical
experience of being in a car chase, for the audience.
The convergence of the entertainment industry with new technology has
attracted a stream of investors to Hollywood. The misadventures of Sony and
Matsushita have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of the other
electronics, information technology and telecommunications companies, such
as ITT and IBM, that are searching for partners in the entertainment
business.
The new venture will offer an appealing package for investors. Microsoft,
the world's largest software house, has already been mooted as a potential
partner for their studio. There is also speculation of an alliance with the
MCA management if it succeeds in buying the company back from Matsushita.
'The movie business is full of swamps: just look at the problems Sony and
Matsushita have had in Hollywood,' says Oscar Moore, editor of Screen
International, the film industry magazine. 'But Katzenberg and Geffen are
very talented men, and Spielberg has made more money for the film industry
than anyone else in its history. A lot of people will be willing to bet on
them.'
