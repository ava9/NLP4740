SOME 4,400 actors, producers and authors from France and elsewhere in Europe
yesterday signed a plea for Europe's 'cultural identity' to be kept from
being submerged in the Gatt trade negotiations.
The appeal, which appeared in Le Monde and other newspapers, coincided with
the release this week of Germinal - Emile Zola's classic novel of 19th
century miners' misery which Mr Claude Berri, the film director, has turned
into France's most expensive film.
The French film industry is hoping the FFr160m (Pounds 18.22m) film,
subsidised by national and local authorities, will help counter inroads from
such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic Park, which is shortly to hit French
cinemas, and highlight the importance of keeping the country's elaborate
system of support for French and European films outside Gatt's trade
liberalisation rules.
Germinal goes on release today after a premiere in Lille on Monday night
attended by President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, and many of the cast that ranged from big stars like
Gerard Depardieu to former miners employed as extras.
The move by the Nord/Pas de Calais regional council to invest FFr10m in the
film has been sharply criticised by Mr Bruno Bonduelle, president of APIM,
the region's development agency, as 'a catastrophe' for an area that is
seeking to shed its rust-belt image and to attract modern investment,
including the planned European central bank. But Ms Marie-Christine Blandin,
the Green politician who heads the regional council, defended the film as
reminding audiences of the 'dignity and solidarity' of the miners.
'If culture cannot be treated as an exception in the Gatt negotiations,
Europe's cultural identity will die,' Mr Berri said this week. The French
government is pressing the European Commission to insist that audiovisual
broadcasting be kept out of the world trade talks. Paris fears that
eventually Gatt rules could be used by the US, first to dismantle the quota
system requiring French TV stations to fill no less than 60 per cent of
their prime air time with EC-made programmes, and then to attack film
subsidies.
