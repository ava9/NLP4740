  [Excerpt] Statoil has made a small oil find in the Barents 
Sea. It is the first time that such a find has been made in the 
area. 
  The oil was found northeast of the North Cape only 40 km 
from 
land, in completely new geological formations. Next week 
Statoil will test the find to see whether oil production is 
possible. 
  According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the field contains 
only 4 to 5 million tonnes of oil. However, development in the 
Barents Sea needs a field containing 50 to 500 million tonnes of 
oil. But the fact that for the first time oil that can be 
exploited has been found in the region is very positive for the 
Barents Sea's future. 
  "The drilling rig, Ross Rig, has found oil in block 7128/4 
off the coast of Finnmark and we will now test this find to find 
out whether it is profitable. If the oil can be exploited, we 
are talking about a relatively small find," Statoil information 
chief Wenche Skorge said. 
  "The most interesting thing is that the find is the first in 
the region, and the first that has been made using this search 
model. The presence of hydrocarbons has been demonstrated in a 
stratum of porous flint which is around 250 million years old. 
This is approximately 100 years [as published] older than rocks 
of the the Jurassic period in which oil has generally been found 
on Norway's continental shelf," she said. The oil find has been 
made in a well which will be drilled to a depth of 2,500 meters. 
  Oil Directorate information chief Jan Hagland confirmed to 
AFTENPOSTEN that traces of oil have been found, but that it is 
thought to be marginal find. 
  The find was made at the last minute, and in the very last 
drilling operation on this part of the Norwegian continental 
shelf. Most oil companies have abandoned their expensive 
exploratory operations in the Barents Sea, after decades of 
drilling without result. A total of over 50 exploratory wells 
have been drilled in the region, and hitherto only gas has been 
found. The Statoil find could therefore have major 
repercussions, particularly since the authorities are now in the 
process of completely changing the rules for drilling in the 
Barents Sea. 
  "If there does turn out to be oil in the find, it comes at 
the absolutely right time. It tells us that we should not 
abandon the Barents Sea. There is still a lot of work to do in 
the region -- for example, several new exploration models must 
be tested," he said. Hagland stressed that this, together with 
the signals contained in the new Oil Report, could trigger great 
optimism about the Barents Sea, although we should continue to 
be prepared for disappointments. The Barents Sea is a very 
complicated area in which to search for oil. [passage omitted]
