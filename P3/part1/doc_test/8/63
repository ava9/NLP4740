Hands up all those who thought 1993 was just as nasty, brutish and short as
1992. You were wrong, at least according to Dentsu, the Japanese advertising
giant.
It says the 'keyword' for 1993 was actually 'taking care' - though surely
that's two words? Anyway, Dentsu's gurus reckon that last year Japanese
getting and spending was dominated by 'being satisfied with yourself and
your world, not being self-centred'.
The taking care meant greater concern for 'nurturing your body',
'unwinding', 'cultivating bonds' (personal as opposed to financial),
'discovering connections' and going for 'quality at home' and 'convenience
close at hand'.
Dentsu's reasoning in this instance is based upon the list of 42 types of
'hit product' which went down well in Japan in 1993. But don't hold your
breath; the list is a rather disappointing collection, including mineral
water, dental mouthwash, carrot drinks, fashion sportswear, beer,
deodorants, aerosol foot sprays and anything to do with Jurassic Park.
Given that two of the other hits were 'power stones' and leather bracelets -
both worn as lucky charms - consumers seem to have spent at least some of
their time, as usual, in taking care to get ripped off.
