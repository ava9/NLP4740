The success of films such as Jurassic Park helped to encourage large
increases in cinema attendances last year, according to research for the
11th annual survey of the industry.
The research for the Cinema Advertising Association found that 69 per cent
of those aged over seven said that they visited the cinema, the highest
proportion in recent history and an increase of 4m on the previous year.
The number of people visiting the cinema regularly, defined as once a month
or more, increased from 11 per cent of the population to 14 per cent. This
accounted for a total of 7.139m visits last year, a rise of 28 per cent
compared with 1992.
According to the survey, carried out by BMRB International, the four most
popular films were Jurassic Park with 14.2m viewers; The Bodyguard, 7.2m;
Home Alone 2, 6.1m; and Sister Act, 5.4m. Jurassic Park set a modern record
with an audience 3m higher than the film ET in 1983.
The survey shows that 24 films were seen by more than 2m people, compared
with 21 in 1992 and 14 in 1990.
More than 40 per cent of cinema visits in the two months prior to the
research, carried out in October and November, were to the 66 multiplex
cinemas in the UK - all of which opened in the past nine years.
The survey also suggests that 85 per cent of those aged over seven have a
video recorder in the home and that, on a monthly basis, 70 per cent watched
programmes recorded from television and 16 per cent from satellite. Some 39
per cent watched hired videos.
