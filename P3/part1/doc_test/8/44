VIDEO game enthusiasts will soon be able to put themselves in Batman's shoes
to exchange blows with the Penguin or cuddle with Catwoman. Or they could
choose to make a music video using film footage of popular rock musicians.
Sega, the Japanese electronic games manufacturer, this week unveiled a
compact disc-based video games system which will allow users to interact
with characters in Hollywood films as well as with popular bands on video.
The system is the first to bring realistic, digitised video film games to
the consumer market.
The videos and films that Sega will incorporate into its new games will
initially come from the libraries of Hollywood studios, such as Warner
Brothers, and music video publishers, including Sony Electronic Publishing,
with which the company simultaneously announced a strategic alliance to
develop CD-based games.
'Up to this point video games have been animated characters. Sega CD allows
players to control real actors. It's like being in a movie theatre and
controlling the actors on the screen,' says Mr Doug Glen, group marketing
director.
Sega has also set up a multimedia studio in Redwood City, California, and is
filming a game alongside Steven Spielberg, on the set of his film Jurassic
Park. The game will be launched at the same time as the film.
Video games are increasingly expected to be based on CDs, which offer better
sound quality, graphics and greater storage capacity and manipulating power
than the games cartridges currently in use.
Nintendo, Sega's main competitor, announced this week it would launch a
CD-based games system in the US and Japan in August 1993.
Sega will launch its new system in the US next month at a suggested retail
price of Dollars 299 (Pounds 173.80).
