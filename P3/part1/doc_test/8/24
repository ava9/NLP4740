film challenge to Disney

Wired, the super-hip technology magazine, regularly carries a recruitment
advertisement from Walt Disney, the entertainment group, bearing the slogan:
'If you're good with a mouse, we've got great people, cool hardware and big
challenges in advanced computer graphics'.
It seems very likely that future issues of Wired could carry a similar
advertisement from Disney's latest competitor - the new entertainment group
being launched by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of
Disney's movie studios, Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film director,
and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul.
The new group, like Disney itself, will be anxious to attract the cream of
the new breed of technology buffs if it is to achieve its ambition of
becoming a force in feature films and animation.
The impact of new technology on the entertainment industry not only played a
pivotal part in persuading the three partners to set up a new studio, but
will be critical in determining its development.
Steven Spielberg has made no secret of the fact that he sees the new company
as a vehicle for his experiments with movie-making technology. The
extraordinarily realistic dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, his Dollars 356m
blockbuster, were digital creations from the computers of Industrial Light
and Magic (ILM), the special effects laboratory set up in San Francisco by
George Lucas, director of Star Wars.
Digital technology enables film-makers to shoot scenes which would otherwise
be too expensive - or logistically impossible - to film.
Jurassic Park proved how appealing such techo-trickery could be. Digital
effects also feature in some of this year's box-office hits, including
Forrest Gump, which creates the illusion of Tom Hanks participating in
famous historical events, and True Lies, the Arnold Schwarzenegger action
film whose director, James Cameron, has teamed up with IBM to create his own
Digital Domain special effects lab in Los Angeles.
Spielberg is intent on further developing the creative potential of digital
effects at the new studio. Similarly, technology is an essential element of
Jeffrey Katzenberg's plans to create a new animation company.
Animation is one of the most lucrative areas of movie-making (largely
because of the high sales potential for videos and other merchandise).
But the expense of recruiting large teams of skilled artisans has
traditionally deterred newcomers from challenging Disney's dominance of the
animation field.
The quality of animated films has been transformed by the computer-generated
techniques that Jeffrey Katzenberg encouraged his animators to use at
Disney, as illustrated by the success of The Lion King, one of the most
elaborate animated films ever, which took Dollars 267m in four months at the
US box office.
These new techniques have also reduced the need for skilled craftsmen,
thereby paving the way for the new company (as well as Warner, one of the
major studios) to move into animation.
Finally, the technological revolution in movie-making has drawn new
investors into the entertainment industry from related fields that include
electronics, information technology and telecommunications. As a result,
there should be no shortage of industrial partners for the new studio to tap
for investment.
Hollywood rumour-mongers have already started to round up likely suspects.
Microsoft, the software giant, is at the top of the list.
