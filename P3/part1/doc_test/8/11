JURASSIC PARK (PG) Steven Spielberg
BARAKA (PG) Ron Fricke
CHILDREN OF NATURE Fridrik Thor Fridriksson
Here it is and was it worth the wait? When you tell someone you have seen
Jurassic Park, back flies the mach-2 question: 'What's it like?' This never
means what it should mean - 'What does it resemble?' - but 'Is it good/is it
bad/will it scare the screaming daylights out of us?'
Let us take the question at first value. Jurassic Park is like Jaws meets
Westworld. (Steven Spielberg, its director, made the first and Michael
Crichton, its writer, wrote and directed the second). It is like a nightmare
day out at the Natural History Museum. And it is like a Hollywood story
conference where savage, primeval pitches rend the air.
'Let's have the palaeontologist hero and the two kids climb the electrified
fence]' 'Let's have the heroine feel a comforting arm on her shoulder and
then discover it's only an arm]' 'Let's have the velociraptors run amok in
the Visitors Centre kitchen]' 'Let's have Lord Attenborough play the park's
founder with a limp, a Scottish accent and a cherubic smile.' (Result: Sir
Richard resembles Ronnie Corbett gone AWOL in an HG Wells novel).
Yes, but you still want to know: 'What is it like?' Well, it is good, it is
bad, and occasionally it scares the daylights out of us. What is good is the
hi-tech presumption of the film. Crichton's novel was a spinechiller-satire
about an ultimate act of hubris. A theme park packed with prehistoric fauna,
recreated through a far-fetched (but not that far-fetched) union of DIY and
DNA, mutinies against its masters. Drawn to the theme of techno-impudence,
Steven Spielberg makes a movie that is all techno-impudence. Jurassic Park
spreads its banquet of gewgaws, gizmos and breakthrough graphics before us,
condemning previous dinosaur films to cinematic prehistory.
Computer imaging and state-of-art modelwork ensure that when Tyrannosaurus
Rex growls into frame to terrify Dr Sam Neill and the two children he is
escorting on an ill-fated preview tour of the park, the said T. Rex is a
glistening, roaring, tail-thrashing mother of all monsters with no hint of
stop-motion jerk.
In fact no signs anywhere of the old clockwork epilepsy we knew and
half-loved in Gorgo and Godzilla. Not in the 'raptors and iguanadons; nor in
the gentle triceratops tended by 'palaeo-botanist' Laura Dern; nor in the
puff-necked 'spitter' that disposes of the villainous Dennis (Wayne Knight),
a park boffin who runs straight into death while smuggling stolen embryos to
a waiting boat.
But if the monsters have evolved beyond stop-motion, the human characters
are a different story. Stereotypes made to fit a game-plan, they stand about
striking prescribed attitudes and between shots make small adjustments of
gesture to present a fresh facet of the same cliche. The palaeontologist
must spout sandblown wisdom. The Chaos Theory scientist (Jeff Goldblum with
Chaos Theory hair and scat speech-patterns) must burble about things
unravelling. And the lady botanist must rail against sexist notions of
female weakness one moment, scream like Fay Wray the next.
In Jaws Spielberg painted an entire, convincing New England community behind
and around the foreground monster. And in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind
he gave a messianic madness to the hero's love affair with the
cosmic-impossible. But in Jurassic Park the characters are prisoners of a
theme park just like the dinosaurs. Only their theme park is called
Hollywood and their inventor-orchestrator is the box-office.
Lowest-denominator thinking means that each character represents a big,
bland constituency for audience identification, from the all-purpose egghead
sceptic (Goldblum) to the all-purpose damsel in distress mildly fuzzed by
feminism (Dern).
Only the actor saddled with the largest burden of cliches, Lord
Attenborough, almost succeeds in throwing them off. Ever since he vanished
behind a movie camera, fans of Sir Dickie the actor have been crying for him
to come forth again. He is marvellous in Jurassic Park. Hammond, the park's
founder, could have been a melodramatic cipher: a science-tampering
scoundrel out of Fritz Lang by Dr No. But Attenborough gives him a foolish
charm, a sing-song passion, even a wistful pain. (Listen to the pure emotion
he finds in a tinselly speech about his flea-circus past).
Elsewhere, the flimsiness of the people undoes even the ferocity of the
beasts. And Spielberg - the Spielberg of ET rather than Jaws - is not above
making the monsters cuddly when there is a pause in the ravening. For
cuddlification comes with the territory: all those covetable tie-in models,
toys, games, T-shirts, gum-wrappers . . .
A Chaos Theory terror movie may be the promise, but in Jurassic Park
cosiness is always just around the corner. As a lexicogapher friend pointed
out, what you really get when you extract DNA from dinosaurs is the word
'souris.' Jurassic Park is a mouse with pretensions. But such is the power
of hype that no one will notice until - only Dollars 100m to go - it has
become the highest-earning film ever made.
Baraka is a film based upon the problematical notion that cinematic silence
equals importance. Subtitled 'A World Beyond Words,' Ron Fricke's film is a
90-minute non-verbal collage of imagery that attempts to show the
interconnectedness of life on the planet. Starting with a snow monkey dozing
off in a hot spring, Fricke's film quickly goes cosmic, presenting the
viewer with a dizzying array of visual takes of smoldering volcanoes,
surging city crowds, traditional religious ceremonies and clouds pouring
over Himalayan mountaintops.
Occasionally, this method provides memorable sequences, such as the montage
comparing assembly line work throughout the world that ends with the truly
unsettling sight of live chicks tumbling down a stainless steel shoot on the
way to becoming inmates at the egg factory. And when Fricke's 70mm camera
zooms in on small details - an Aboriginal man using a plastic comb to paint
his face, for instance - he comes close to making his point. But the film
eventually collapses under its own portentousness, particularly during a
trip to Auschwitz. At times beautiful and arresting, Baraka is ultimately
little more than a stylised exercise in global channel-hopping.
One of the few countries Fricke does not visit is Iceland. Given the starkly
beautiful landscape of that country on view in Children of Nature, you
cannot help but feel he has missed something. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's
heartfelt second film details the last days of an elderly widower (Gisli
Halldorsson) who abandons his farm for Reykjavik, only to have his daughter
pack him off to an old folk's home. There, he meets a childhood sweetheart
(Sigridur Hagalin), a proud and beautiful septuagenarian who wants to visit
her birthplace on the island's desolate eastern region before dying. Their
romance rekindles and, equipped with a stolen jeep, they set off across
Iceland, followed by the police.
Writer/director Fridriksson has fashioned a subtle, sometimes moving film
about people who will not go gently into the Arctic night. Lovingly
photographed and well acted, Children of Nature avoids casting the elderly
as cute curmudgeons. However, Fridriksson fails to strike a consistent
emotional tone, moving too abruptly from unrelieved gloom to fantastical
whimsy. And the film's subtitles are replete with enough misspellings to
keep the eye from fully enjoying those bleakly beautiful Icelandic vistas.
