FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as a US
attempt to use the world trade negotiations to swamp Europe with Hollywood
films.
Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Dollars 8.8m) in aid to encourage
film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also
warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) deal were to cover the cinema, the French government 'will
not sign it'.
France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over
agriculture, because it cannot credibly claim that the livelihood of less
than 4,000 French employed in full-time film-making is as vital a national
interest as the future of more than 1m farmers. Paris would therefore
probably allow itself to be outvoted on any audiovisual deal.
But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into
its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture.
Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park and Last Action Hero were
already taking too large a slice of the French cinema market, the minister
claimed that Gatt's general free trade principle of non-discrimination would
make it impossible for France to keep its regular FFr1.3bn a year subsidy
for the making of French films and its requirement that French broadcasters
must air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made films.
The special aid announced by Mr Toubon yesterday is particularly aimed at
helping French studios fighting competition from lower cost locations in
eastern Europe and Portugal.
As with agriculture, France is at odds with some of its EC partners, and the
European Commission, over the right approach to the US in Gatt. Paris argues
that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by claiming a total
'exception' for it.
By contrast, the Commission maintains that by including audiovisual
products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of this sensitive cultural
area, the EC would be better placed to defend Community broadcasting
legislation, as well as the tougher national provisions of countries like
France, from unilateral US attack in the future.
The EC's television broadcasting directive merely recommends that European
stations schedule a majority of EC-made programmes. French legislation
requires national stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent of EC-made
programmes, while also subsidising local film-making from a 5.5 per cent
levy on TV station turnover and an 11 per cent tax on cinema tickets.
