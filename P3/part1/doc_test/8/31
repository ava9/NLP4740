The European culture com-missioner yesterday called for an end to the system
that has allowed big Hollywood studios to pool their resources to distribute
films in Europe.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro said he would propose that the Brussels Commission
terminate the current system, which has granted the distributors exemption
from EU competition rules during the past five years.
'What I want in this expanding market is more room for European works and
fairer distribution,' said Mr Pinheiro. He said that with 80 per cent of
distribution controlled by Univeral International Pictures - which
distributes films for Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and MCA - US film
producers had a near monopoly.
Any attempt to weaken the power of US film producers in Europe is likely to
be welcomed by many EU member states, particularly France, which campaigned
to defend its film industry against Hollywood during the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade talks last year. The audiovisual sector was excluded
from the provisions of the Uruguay Round.
Commission officials said Mr Pinheiro's demand had strong support within
much of the Commission, but stressed that the decision now lay with the
competition directorate, which had not yet reached a final position.
The competition directorate is conducting an investigation, and Mr Karel Van
Miert, EU competition commissioner, is due to decide soon whether to
recommend that the Commission renew the exemption for the US film producers.
In November the European parliament demanded that UIP's exemption lapse,
claiming it had damaged the European film industry. UIP said then that the
parliament sought to 'attribute unwarranted responsibility to UIP for the
difficulties experienced by certain elements of the industry'.
British film distributors, who command no more than 10 per cent of the
industry, generally welcomed Mr Pinheiro's proposal. Mr Alistair Nicolson of
Mayfair Entertainment, which has distributed The Hour of the Pig, Howards
End and The Crying Game, said: 'Any help we can get from the European
Commission is gratefully received. But if you have films like Jurassic Park,
which UIP did, you cannot fight that. You cannot stop people from going to
Jurassic Park.'
But, Artificial Eye, the company that distributed Farewell My Concubine,
does not believe removing UIP's exemption will help the industry. Mr Robert
Beeson, general manager, said: 'If UIP has the films that everyone wants,
regulation will not change anything, unless the EC wants to interfere with
free trade.'
UIP, meanwhile, strongly denied Mr Pinheiro's charges that it had tied
distribution of hit movies to the sale of rights to less successful films.
'We have not acted illegally and Mr Pinheiro should either present evidence
of his charges or issue an apology,' said Mr Brian Riley, UIP general
counsel.
UIP also disputed Mr Pinheiro's figures. 'UIP held an 18 per cent market
share in Europe in 1992 and has never held anything like an 80 per cent
share.'
UIP says it has applied for an extension of its exemption from
anti-competitiveness rules on the basis that its distribution arrangement
benefits consumers, by reducing costs, and that there have been no material
changes in the market since the exemption was first granted five years ago.
The five-year exemption was granted in 1989 after a seven-year investigation
by the Commission, which said it was not
anti-competitive, UIP said.
