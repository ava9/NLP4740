If Steven Spielberg had directed Schindler's List when he bought the rights
to Thomas Keneally's book in 1982, two weeks after the US opening of ET, it
would have been a movie not a film, he said yesterday.
As things turned out, it became a document 'rich in incident and
information', or even 'a Holocaust Museum at 24 frames a second'. And if it
is a success by his personal reckoning, and educates people (a financial
bonanza goes without saying) 'then this picture is a public service'.
Speaking hours before last night's German premiere, he could not but be
aware that it was already having such an effect. The face of the main
character, the un-saintly Oskar Schindler, had two weeks earlier appeared on
the front cover of the mass-circulation news magazine Der Spiegel, with the
cover-line, 'The Good German'.
It came as a mild relief to a country recently confronted with vile images
of neo-Nazis burning out and killing refugees, defacing Jewish cemeteries,
and reviving notions worldwide that 'the ugly German' was the sole and true
representative of the nation.
Awareness has since spread that the Jewish-American box-office king, with a
history as a specialist in the ludicrously sentimental, had presented a
work, harsh, true and uncompromising, but free of caricature and cliche.
Speaking in the home town of Oskar Schindler, the libertine National
Socialist party member and industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Jews from
death in wartime German extermination camps, Mr Spielberg reminded his
audience of mainly German and central European journalists that last year 60
per cent of US school children had not heard the word 'holocaust'.
The same cannot be said of German youth, but it won him warm applause from
journalists who have already taken up the public service cause with a
vengeance. A front page editorial in the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung said yesterday the 'profoundly unideological' work had a chance to
reach an audience far wider than the 'selected public' usually reached by
'often very important documentaries'.
Mr Spielberg, who watched it again last night in the presence of President
Richard von Weizsacker, was himself inspired to start work by film and
videotape images transmitted relentlessly out of Bosnia.
He was still putting the finishing touches to another blockbuster movie,
Jurassic Park. 'But when I first heard the words 'ethnic cleansing', it
shattered me and I decided to rush into production,' he said.
He braced himself for the realities of filming in Auschwitz, arriving with
'a chip on my shoulder' and spent four months at work in 'a cemetery'. His
children learnt how to speak Polish and eat herring. He himself eventually
learnt to speak civilly to young German actors in Nazi uniforms, and he
heard from them that the work in progress was 'the best thing that could
happen to their generation'.
He could not say if Germany was ready to face the past, as he was asked by a
young journalist last night. He could not say why more Jews did not resist
being driven to the 'asphyxiation rooms'. Perhaps these were subjects for
future films. 'This is about education, awareness and consciousness. . . .
and I hope it is not the end of motion pictures about the Shoah,' he said.
