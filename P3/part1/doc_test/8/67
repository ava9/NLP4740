The designation on the map of "National Natural Landmark" is a tip-off, but 
nothing can prepare hikers for the colorful hills that make up Rainbow Basin. 
Pink, white, orange, brown, red, black and green sediments form the basin's 
rainbow-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Basin is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the agency 
in charge of the 1.5 million-acre East Mojave National Scenic Area. Rainbow 
Basin's location just north of Interstate 15 in Barstow puts it just out of the 
scenic area (which will become a national park if Sen. Alan Cranston succeeds 
with his California Desert Conservation bill). 
</P>
<P>
Though geographically gerrymandered out of the scenic area, Rainbow Basin is, 
to say the least, colorfully scenic. This place in the Calico Mountains is 
ideal for the hiker to sample the mountains, the geology and the rich historic 
record of the East Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The topography of the Mojave, termed "basin and range," is characterized by 
south-trending mountain ranges rising abruptly from the desert floor, separated 
by irregularly spaced basins. (Basins, unlike valleys, are not drained by 
rivers.) The mountains have been formed by the movement of land along 
earthquake faults that run through here. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 million years ago, grasslands filled Rainbow Basin, then populated by 
saber-toothed tigers, mastodons, camels, three-toed horses and even 
rhinoceroses. Their fossil remains are encased in sedimentary rock that once 
formed a lake bed. As a result of intense geologic activity over the millennia, 
what was once at the bottom of the lake is now a series of folded, faulted, 
colorful hills. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Canyon, one of three moderate hikes in Rainbow Basin, takes its name from 
the barn owls who live there. Hikers should be reasonably agile in order to 
tackle Owl Canyon Trail, because getting through the canyon means scrambling 
over some boulders. 
</P>
<P>
You could spend a pleasant weekend camping and hiking in Rainbow Basin. 
Stationed at Owl Canyon Campground is a campground host, who can provide hiking 
and touring tips. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trail head: Follow Interstate 15 to Barstow, then join Highway 58 
to Ft. Irwin Road, following it 5 miles. Turn west on dirt Fossil Road and 
proceed 3 miles to Owl Canyon Campground. The trail begins at the north end of 
the campground. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Follow the marked trail into Owl Canyon. Half a mile up-canyon look 
for a small cave on your right. Sandstone and silt stone, shale and volcanic 
debris are among the exposed rock. The geologic formations en route are not 
only rainbow-colored but dramatic in shape. Particularly evident are massive 
down-folds geologists call synclines. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon narrows for a time then opens up at its end into a multicolored 
amphitheater. Velvet Peak is the high spot above the rocky bowl. Experienced 
hikers can scramble up the bowl's rocky ridges for fine views of Rainbow Basin 
and the vast East Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
Return the same way. 
</P>
<P>

Area, visit the California Desert Information Center, 831 Barstow Road, 
Barstow, or call (619) 256-8617.
