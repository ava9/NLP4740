How jolly nice of BBC1 to donate a 30-minute commercial to the makers of
'Jurassic Park'. Not that they actually need it, by all accounts, having
already taken tens of millions of dollars at American box offices, but
without the sort of promotion provided by Spielberg And The Dinosaurs (7.00,
just right to catch the primary school audience) how could they be sure of
equal success in Britain?
Subject of Birthrights is the staff of the Chinese restaurants which you now
find in even the most remote corners of Britain, in country town and seaside
resort as well as metropolis. Behind the scenes, we are told, life is not
always easy for the British Chinese. Is your life always easy? (7.40 BBC2)
World In Action is also about food preparation. It asks whether the British
are too reliant on fast food and junk food and whether basic cooking skills
are being forgotten. The answer in each case is 'Yes', so do we really need
to watch? (8.30 ITV).
Timothy Spall plays the title role in ITV's Frank Stubbs Promotes, playing a
Soho ticket tout progressing (9.00).
