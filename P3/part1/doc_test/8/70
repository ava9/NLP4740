BASINGSTOKE, that small southern English town, has suffered at the hands of
dramatists ever since Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. Now it has its revenge with the
splendidly refurbished Haymarket Theatre, entirely reconstructed since June
last year and reopening with The Cheeky Chappie, a play about the comedian
Max Miller.
The theatre itself was on show for the event. The building opened in 1865 as
a Corn Exchange, and then passed through lives as a cinema, roller-skating
rink and fire station.
The 18-month restoration has consolidated and developed existing resources.
The Haymarket now seats 450 in a two-level auditorium, with raked stalls and
a hanging circle built within an iron frame inside the old barrel-vaulted
theatre. The auditorium presses itself on the senses with primary colours,
the foyers are bright and clear, the restaurant in the basement itself a
tricksy stage set. If this seems overdone, it is at least intelligently
overdone and consistently carried through.
Outside, original moldings have been meticulously renovated, and from the
street the theatre looks inviting and easy on the eye.
Architects Renton Howard Wood Levin - theatre credits include the Donmar
Warehouse and the Prince Edward Theatre - should be congratulated on the
Haymarket, as should Basingstoke and Deane borough council and Hampshire
county council which provided Pounds 2.5m and Pounds 640,000 respectively
for the project. The patron, Richard Attenborough, should have better
fortune with this than with his latest  - fictional - charge of Jurassic
Park in Michael Crighton's film.
Now for the show, easy to hear and see because of the inclined auditorium
and apron stage. Adrian Reynolds directs a breezy, undemanding dash through
the life of Thomas Henry Sergeant (1895-1963) who became Max Miller. He was
happily married for 44 years, notwithstanding the appalling jokes about his
wife Kathleen Marsh, but still concealing a 20-year relationship with his
secretary, Ann Graham.
John East's biography, The Cheeky Chappie, has the facts, but Dave Simpson's
1986 play with music conjures a fuller, rounder character out of the
on-stage smut and the off-stage paranoia.
Miller had a laugh like a starter motor and a mind like a sump: 'I went home
the other night, there's a fellow there, not a stitch on. 'Who's this?' I
says to the wife. 'Oh, he's a nudist, and he's come in to use the phone]' -
that's a clever one from the wife, eh?' There is plenty more of this, from
Miller's famous 'Blue Book' of jokes.
The chorus dances and sings a range of music-hall standards, from the
resolutely English of 'Let a smile be your umbrella' and 'If you were the
only girl in the world' to the neatly contrived irony of 'I can't believe
that you're in love with me' sung by Miller's wife (played by Pamela Power)
while Miller and Ann (Helen Fraser) go to bed in the background.
Kenneth Macdonald, who plays Miller, has all his traits and tricks: the foot
on the footlights, the walk developed to avoid creaky planks in seaside
boarding houses late at night, the jaunty shoulders, the high elbows and the
rotating wrists. It is a wonderful characterisation of this teller of puns
and reveller in double entendres.
