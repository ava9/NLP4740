FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sun move prompts market confusion

MR RUPERT Murdoch's price cutting exercise at The Sun is causing
considerable confusion in the stock market for shares of newspaper groups,
with analysts divided on the consequences.
Mirror Group Newspapers and United Newspapers, in particular, have suffered
in the aftermath of News International's decision to reduce the price of The
Sun from 25p to 20p for the rest of the summer.
At James Capel, media analyst Mr Guy Lamming turned MGN from one of his
strongest buys to a sell and believes uncertainty will remain until it is
clear how long The Sun is going to stay at 20p.
'If Murdoch was to take a possible irrational decision to maintain the price
war it would have a big impact on MGN profits,' he said.
The Daily Mirror, Mr Lamming suggested, could not sustain a 7p price
differential over The Sun indefinitely.
Four days into the circulation war an early pattern seems to be emerging.
The Sun appears to be holding on to a rise in circulation of just over 8 per
cent, but the Daily Mirror is still up some 1.5 per cent with the help of
its Jurassic Park wall chart promotion. Although the Daily Star is being
squeezed by its two bigger rivals, latest estimates put its loss at only 2
per cent.
Overall the popular newspaper market has risen so far by 2 per cent.
The modest sales drop at the Daily Star hardly seems enough to explain a
fall of 28p to 516p in the share price on Wednesday of United Newspapers,
although the Pounds 190m rights issue could be a complicating factor.
Yesterday, the price shed another 2p.
'The market doesn't understand price wars. It doesn't like the uncertainty,'
said Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson who believes
some institutional investors have also taken the opportunity for profit
talking.
He believes that MGN is fundamentally a strong and resilient business.
