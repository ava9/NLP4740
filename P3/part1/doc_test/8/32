In rock and roll's Jurassic Park, a theme park where revivified creatures
from another age stalk the stage failing to scare the children but taking
money from their parents, Iggy Pop is one of the few dinosaurs who still has
all his own teeth.
Iggy has been at it since the late 1960s. His recorded output has been
patchy, but on stage he still gives a masterclass in the essence of rock
music. His three piece band dress dully and stay in the background. They
provide a simple musical stage for Iggy's star turn with pounding drums,
relentless bass and very loud power chords spiced up by occasional, but
brief, screeching guitar solos. 'I Want To Be Your Dog', 24 years old, fits
seamlessly alongside songs from Iggy's latest album American Caesar.
If Iggy has learnt anything in 25 years on stage it is how to exploit his
talent for rock theatrics. He starts the show bare chested, his scrawny but
well-muscled torso thrust forward. He yelps, he pouts, he stamps, he jumps.
He marches round with a peculiar stiff-hipped, arthritic strut. He clambers
on to speakers, he smashes microphone stands, he falls over. In the pause
after just the third number he dives off the stage, to the evident surprise
of his band and roadies, to be caught, pawed and clung to by the crowd and
has to be dragged back on stage. He drops his ripped jeans and hops round
the stage like a naughty child who does not want to go to the loo. He pulls
out his penis to provide a clear demonstration of the link between sexual
excitement and rock music. 'All the world's a stage,' he sneers during the
encore.
He applies his talent for the dramatic to the music as well. He has a few
aces up his sleeve and plays them cleverly. 'Raw Power', forever the simple,
crashing, statement of what Iggy stands for, is the second song. Other early
Stooges numbers pop up later: 'No Fun' builds to a frantic sustained climax.
The songs from the Bowie liaison provide a sparser, even - in the case of
'China Girl' - melodic contrast, without sacrificing the hard edge.
The show ends with a chaotic encore; more stage diving, more trouser
dropping. Beer glasses start to fly, one particularly large fan tries to
wrestle his way on stage. And Iggy drags rock music back into the primordial
ooze with a basic version of 'Louie Louie', the most basic of rock and roll
songs. He has squared the circle, proved that the basics of rock music have
hardly changed in 30 years. Here is the raw stuff from which life forms as
diverse as Deep Purple, the Sex Pistols and Nirvana evolved. Scientists
should take samples of Iggy's DNA for the benefit of later generation.
