Microsoft, the big US software group, is buying Canada's leading animation
software company in a deal worth USDollars 130m.
Softimage, based in Montreal, is best known internationally for the
animation technology that helped to create the lifelike dinosaur scenes in
Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park film.
Its range of software products is used by film studios, editing houses,
broadcasters, graphic artists and product designers in North America, Europe
and Asia.
Microsoft is acquiring Softimage in a share exchange deal which, with
adjustments, values Softimage shares at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 24.
Its stock traded in New York on Monday at around Dollars 15.
Daniel Langlois, who owns about 25 per cent of the company, and the rest of
the board have accepted the Microsoft offer and urge other shareholders to
do the same.
Microsoft said Softimage will continue to be autonomous. It will develop
specialised software for the creation of high quality digital content for
multimedia services.
