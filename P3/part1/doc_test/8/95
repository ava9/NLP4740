MATSUSHITA Electric, hit by weak sales and a strengthening yen, yesterday
reported a 7 per cent decline, to Y33.7bn (Dollars 326.2m), in first-quarter
consolidated pre-tax profits.
The Japanese consumer electronics group said sales were down 7 per cent, to
Y1,596bn compared with a previous Y1,713bn. Net income was 23 per cent lower
at Y6.7bn against Y8.7bn.
Matsushita, in common with other Japanese consumer electronics
manufacturers, has suffered the impact of the high yen, continuing sluggish
demand for audio-visual products, and a cool summer in Japan.
Although sales in overseas markets were actually higher than the previous
first quarter on a local currency basis, the gains evaporated under the
impact of the higher yen, Matsushita said.
In Japan, the company continued to face weak demand as consumer spending
tailed away. The weakness of personal consumption and private capital
spending have been cited as the main factors preventing the Japanese economy
from recovering.
Sales of video products declined 13 per cent, while audio equipment fell 6
per cent on slow demand.
Home appliances were down 13 per cent as sales of air conditioners were hurt
by an unusually cool summer in Japan. Demand for communication and
industrial equipment was also weak.
Matsushita is currently enjoying huge box-office success with Jurassic Park,
a movie produced by its MCA film studio subsidiary. However, it still
suffered a 2 per cent decline in sales from its entertainment businesses.
This was blamed on the yen's appreciation, which more than offset an
increase in dollar-based sales, the company said.
Although Matsushita has had some recent consumer successes, such as an
advanced rice cooker, and cordless telephones, it has faced prolonged
weakness in the Japanese market, particularly for audio-visual products.
The strong demand expected for key products, such as the digital compact
cassette, a digital portable audio format developed with Philips, the Dutch
consumer electronics group, has not materialised. It will take considerable
time for demand to emerge for other promising products, such as
high-definition TV.
The company's second-quarter results are expected to be disappointing.
Private consumption is not expected to improve significantly in the near
term, unless the government agrees to an income tax cut soon.
