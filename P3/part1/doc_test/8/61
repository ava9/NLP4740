  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
presented the country's highest annual national scientific and 
technological awards to 4,484 scientists and technical experts 
here today. 
  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng met 
representatives 
of the award-winning scientists before the ceremony. The award 
winners, including nine scientists from Hong Kong and foreign 
countries, had between them completed 781 scientific and 
technological projects for the country in 1993. 
  Congratulating the scientists, Jiang said that he hoped the 
scientists will spread the seed of science and technology 
throughout the country and make yet greater contributions to the 
country's economic development and social progress. 
  He said Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of making science 
and technology the driving force behind production is the 
guiding principle for developing the country's science and 
technology and the national economy as a whole," the president 
said. 
  Jiang asked the scientists to pay close attention to applied 
research and development research while keeping a necessary 
contingent in basic sciences. 
  He said, "the practice of reform and development needs a 
correct theory and rich knowledge." He also urged officials at 
all levels to gain more knowledge of modern science and 
technology, and make new and realistic contribution to the 
country's modernization. 
  The national science and technology awards include natural 
sciences awards, invention awards, science and technology 
progress awards and spark awards. 
  According to professor Zhu Lilan, vice-minister in charge of 
the State Science and Technology Commission, the prize-winning 
projects of 1993 have produced an estimated economic result of 
21.3 billion yuan (2.45 billion U.S. dollars). 
  Projects associated with key industries in the nation's 
economic development plan outnumbered the others in the winners' 
list. 
  The winning projects are concerned with industries and 
transport, agriculture, education, medicine and basic scientific 
research. 
  One project was on research to make pandas give birth to 
twins, conducted by the animal institute of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences and other research institutes in Chengdu, Sichuan 
Province. 
  Another winner was research into Jurassic dinosaurs in 
Sichuan mountain regions, conducted by the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences and Chengdu Geology College.
