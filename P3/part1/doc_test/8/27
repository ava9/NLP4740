FT  30 SEP 93 / MMC to examine allocation of films

THE DISTRIBUTION of films to cinemas has been referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Sir Bryan said yesterday the Office of Fair Trading had decided to
investigate the industry after independent cinemas complained it was
difficult to obtain popular films from large distributors.
Independent cinema owners welcomed the inquiry, but large companies called
it unnecessary, saying the increase in multi-screen complexes and a sharp
rise in attendances meant consumers now had a wide choice of films.
Sir Bryan said the independent cinemas' difficulties had continued despite
changes which followed an MMC report in 1983. The report resulted in the
prohibition of 'barring', under which distributors decide in advance which
cinemas have the right to show films first.
Sir Bryan said: 'Most major companies are vertically integrated into the
production, distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas and follow
practices which could lead to the exclusion of independent producers,
distributors and exhibitors from the marketplace.
'I am aware of the changes that have taken place, such as the emergence of
multiplex cinemas, but I consider that competition remains restricted to
such an extent that it is appropriate for the MMC to undertake a fresh
investigation.'
Mr James Higgins, president of the Society of Film Distributors, said he was
confident the commission would find that distributors and cinemas were
providing consumers with greater choice than ever before. He said Pounds
500m had been invested in new cinemas over the past 10 years, a larger
amount than in any other country. Cinema admissions had increased from 52m
in 1984 to over 100m last year.
Mr Higgins said films were being distributed far more widely than at the
time of the last report. He said that a decade ago, 220 copies of ET had
been distributed to UK cinemas, which was then a record. He said 450 copies
of Jurassic Park, this year's blockbuster, had been distributed.
Mr Tony Kirkhope, managing director of the independent two-screen Metro
Cinema in central London, said he had difficulty obtaining US pictures.
'They don't offer them to us - only the dogs.' He said the large
distributors had 'made it amply clear they weren't going to deal with the
independents in the West End'.
Mr Geoffrey Henshaw, owner of the three-screen Cine City cinema in
Manchester, said small operators found large distributors' terms onerous. Mr
Henshaw said distributors insisted that cinemas show their films for three
weeks, regardless of how well or badly they were doing.
