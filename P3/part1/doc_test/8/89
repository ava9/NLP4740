  [Text] Brasilia -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, PT [Workers 
Party] candidate, was harshly criticized yesterday during a 
meeting of the PT federal bloc to discuss the government program 
drafted by the PT executive board. Opposition to the 
controversial points in the program, such as the legalization of 
abortion and marriage between homosexuals -- namely from 
deputies Benedita da Silva (Rio de Janeiro) who belongs to the 
Evangelical Church, and Irma Passoni (Sao Paulo), who is 
Catholic -- forced Lula to review these subjects. 
  Deputy Irma Passoni said: "You cannot support these ideas 
before discussing them within the bloc." 
  Benedita commented: "This cannot be included in the 
government program, because it is a mistake. We are going to 
discuss it with the Church." 
  Lula answered: "We must look at abortion as a public health 
issue. Wealthy women go to posh clinics to have an abortion 
with little suffering. Poor women risk their lives at home, 
where abortions are performed under inadequate conditions." 
  Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-Sao Paulo) upheld the need to draft 
a 
new program for Lula's government. 
  Genoino said: "The PT has one program, while Lula has 
another. One cannot mix government politics with social issues." 
  The alliance parties -- the PPS [Peoples' Socialist Party] 
and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] -- also demand changes. 
The PPS, for example, does not accept a moratorium on the 
foreign debt. 
  In Sao Paulo, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
President Tasso Jereissati asserted that the PT proposals make 
the possibility of an alliance between the two parties even more 
remote. 
  "The PT has become more and more distant from the PSDB. 
These PT proposals are an example of that." 
  Paulo Maluf, virtual PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] 
candidate, also criticized the PT. 
  Maluf commented: "The program has reached a deadlock, and 
Lula has contributed to this." 
  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party], chose to criticize the program, 
which he labeled "Jurassic," in general terms. According to 
Fleury, the PT proposals regarding the debt and privatization 
subjects are "obsolete, and harmful" to the country.
