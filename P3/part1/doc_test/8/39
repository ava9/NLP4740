in Hollywood

One topic hovers over Hollywood this new year: will 1995 be the year the
Japanese pull out?
Sony, one of Japan's largest electronics groups, recently announced a
Dollars 2.7bn write-down on Columbia/TriStar, the movie studio it bought for
Dollars 3.4bn in 1989. Matsushita, its compatriot, has hired Allen &amp; Co, an
investment bank, to advise it on the future of MCA/Universal, for which it
paid Dollars 6.1bn four years ago.
The next few months will be critical for both groups.
Matsushita has been the more successful of the two. MCA has had a string of
hits under Matsushita, including Jurassic Park and The Flintstones at the
cinema and Aerosmith and Nirvana in the music charts.
The problem is that the architects of its success, Mr Lew Wasserman, the
81-year-old chairman, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, 59, his second-in-command,
are not happy with their Japanese parent. 'We have no complaints on a
day-to-day basis,' said a senior MCA executive. 'Lew and Sid still have
control. But Matsushita hasn't allowed us to expand.'
The MCA deal preceded Japan's descent into recession. Matsushita has since
been unwilling to sanction further investment in the US while cutting back
at home. First it blocked MCA's plan to acquire Virgin Records (eventually
bought by Thorn-EMI) and then its attempt to invest in NBC, the TV company.
'Matsushita didn't make any promises in our original negotiations,' says one
MCA executive. 'The talks were conducted very quickly. We just assumed that
as they were so keen to keep the same people in charge they'd follow their
recommendations.'
The situation came to a head in October when Matsushita's chairman flew to
San Francisco for a summit meeting with Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg. The
outcome was the appointment of Allen &amp; Co, coupled with that of Michael
Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency, to consider MCA's future.
One option for Matsushita would be to sell a minority stake in MCA to
provide it with capital for expansion. Another would be to sell out
completely and Matsushita is rumoured to be willing to consider offers of
Dollars 9bn-Dollars 10bn. Mr Tsuko Murase, executive vice president, denied
this: 'We're not stockbrokers. We did not buy intending to sell when the
value went up.'
But Matsushita is running out of time. MCA may face difficulties next year.
Junior, the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy billed as a Christmas hit, is only
a modest success. The production of Waterworld, an aquatic sci-fi epic
starring Kevin Costner set to open next summer, has been plagued by problems
and now has the dubious honour of being the most expensive film ever, with a
budget estimated at Dollars 145m.
Finally MCA is about to lose some of its most talented executives. Mr David
Geffen, founder of its Geffen Records subsidiary, is leaving in April. Mr
Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg have threatened to quit when their contracts end
in late 1995 - unless Matsushita provides more capital.
If Mr Sheinberg went, Mr Steven Spielberg, the highest grossing director in
Hollywood's history, would go too. He is setting up his own entertainment
company with the dream-team of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt
Disney's film interests, and Mr Geffen. He will still be free to direct for
other studios and could make a planned sequel to Jurassic Park, but only if
Mr Sheinberg stays.
This Hollywood revolt has exposed Matsushita to ridicule in Japan. The
simplest way of averting it would be for MCA to invest in the dream team.
This would placate Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg, while protecting MCA's
relationship with Mr Spielberg and Mr Geffen. The problem, as ever, is
whether Matsushita will pay up.
Sony confronts a very different set of problems. It has also adopted an
arms-length approach to the day-to-day management of its Hollywood
subsidiaries, but it has not had the advantage of a stable management team.
And, unlike Matsushita, it could scarcely be criticised for not spending
enough money.
Sony is estimated to have spent more than Dollars 10bn during its five years
in Hollywood. It began by paying Dollars 700m to hire Mr Peter Guber and Mr
Jon Peters, the Batman producers, only to see Mr Peters leave after 19
months with a Dollars 30m pay-off. It has since suffered a string of
departures culminating in Mr Guber's exit this autumn.
Its movie studios have had a few hits, such as Philadelphia and Sleepless In
Seattle. But they have also had several flops, including Last Action Hero
and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Sony's share of US box office revenues has
fallen 14.7 per cent in 1990 to about 8.9 per cent in 1994.
The consensus in Hollywood is that Sony has exercised insufficient control
over its film business and taken action too late. 'The alarm bells should
have rung when Peters left,' said a rival studio head. 'You don't pay
Dollars 700m for a duo only to be left with half of it.'
Mr Guber's departure and the Dollars 2.7bn write-off should, in theory,
enable Sony to start again. However there is little confidence in Hollywood
that the Japanese company has got a grip on its film interests.
Mr Mickey Schulhof, chairman of Sony's US interests, is still in overall
charge. He is well respected in the music business, but has no experience of
film-making, nor does Mr Alan Levine, the entertainment lawyer now in charge
of the film division. Mr Mark Canton, the new head of production, knows the
business but was recently described by the New Yorker magazine as 'easily
one of the most unpopular executives in the industry'.
Sony has given them three years to salvage the film business. Hollywood
sceptics suspect the real reason for the write-off was to prepare for a
disposal. Tokyo commentators argue that it would be even more embarrassing
for Sony, or Matsushita, to quit Hollywood now given the long-term thinking
that characterises Japanese corporate behaviour and the abhorrence of
short-term profiteering.
Moreover the film business is so volatile that the picture might look very
different in a year. 'Just think how different things would be if Last
Action Hero had been a hit,' said one Hollywood veteran. 'Though I shudder
to think what will happen if Waterworld flops.'
