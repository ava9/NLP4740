Mr Steven Spielberg, the Hollywood producer and director, is to collaborate
with Knowledge Adventure, a California multimedia software company, in
developing educational software for children.
Mr Spielberg has also invested in Knowledge Adventure, a privately-held
company which is best known for its 'Dinosaur Adventure' and 'Space
Adventure' titles that incorporate rich graphics and videos.
Terms of the investment were not revealed.
The collaboration brings one of Hollywood's best-known directors together
with a leader in the multimedia software field. Mr Spielberg's recent
successes include Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. He is renowned for his
use of new technology in film-making.
'I've been following the growth in the multimedia software industry with
great interest,' said Mr Spielberg. 'In particular, I've been impressed with
the work being done at Knowledge Adventure.'
Mr Spielberg's interest in the field of interactive computer software
reflects growing ties between Hollywood and Silicon Valley as the
entertainment and digital technology fields increasingly overlap.
Mr Spielberg said he has found common interests with Knowledge Adventure
founder and chairman Mr Bill Gross. 'Our sons are about the same age, and we
are both devoting our energies to creating great experiences for them. I'm
anxious to participate in innovative, enriching educational software,' said
Mr Spielberg.
Mr Spielberg is expected to be involved in developing a new line of software
products for Knowledge Adventure.
'I am thrilled to have Steven Spielberg involved,' said Mr Gross. 'I firmly
believe that great educational experiences can be as exciting and engaging
as entertainment.'
