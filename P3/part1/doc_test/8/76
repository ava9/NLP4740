FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as an
American attempt to use the Gatt world trade negotiations to swamp Europe
with Hollywood films.
Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Pounds 5.7m) in aid to encourage
film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also
warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a Gatt agreement were to cover
the cinema, the French government 'will not sign it'.
France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over
agriculture, and would probably allow itself to be outvoted on any
audiovisual deal.
But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into
its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture.
Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park were already taking too large a
slice of the French cinema market, the minister said Gatt's principle of
non-discrimination would make it impossible for France to keep its regular
FFr1.3bn a year subsidy for the making of French films and its requirement
that French broadcasters air 60 per cent EC-made films.
Paris argues that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by
claiming a total 'exception' for it. But the European Commission says that
by including audiovisual products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of
this sensitive cultural area, the EC would be better placed to defend
broadcasting legislation, as well as tougher national provisions, from
unilateral US attack in the future.
Lisa Bransten adds from Washington: Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in
charge of trade, said yesterday Europe and the US would lose all credibility
with other Gatt members if they could not reach agreement and conclude the
Uruguay Round by the December 15 deadline.
