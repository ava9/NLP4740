for Hollywood

Forgive the inhabitants of Beverly Hills this weekend if they indulge in
bouts of self-admiration even greater than normal.
This week has brought evidence that the summer of 1993 could be shaping up
as a good one for the US film industry, despite early flops which had some
critics writing it off as a 'summer of stinkers'.
The biggest hit seems certain to be Jurassic Park, directed by Steven
Spielberg, of Jaws and ET fame. It has been breaking industry records since
it opened.
As every human susceptible to the Hollywood publicity machine must now know,
it is a tale of dinosaurs brought back from extinction, which proceed to run
amok in a tropical theme park. The stars of the film are the extraordinarily
life-like reptiles, created by computer graphics, which provide viewers with
an entirely new dimension in cinematic terror.
But the past 10 days have also seen the release to big audiences (but mixed
reviews) of two more movies with substantial hit potential: Sleepless in
Seattle, a romantic comedy featuring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan; and The Firm
starring Tom Cruise, a thriller about a crooked law firm based on the
best-seller by John Grisham.
The summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for
the US movie industry, which releases its most popular films now or at
Christmas, when people tend to have more leisure. The three and a half
months of summer generate about 40 per cent of annual US box office
revenues.
So far this summer US ticket sales are up 7 per cent on 1992, according to
Mr John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations, a film industry
consultancy, who reckons that a host of films only now being released will
provide a 'second wave' of momentum.
'It's going to be a big summer,' he says, 'probably a record breaker,
passing 1989.' That summer was the industry's best, with US box office
receipts soaring well over Dollars 2bn, thanks to such movies as Batman,
Lethal Weapon 2, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, and When Harry Met Sally.
If the predictions are right, there will be a much-needed psychological
boost to an industry which has seen the volume of US ticket sales edge down
in each of the past three calendar years, and is suffering from a decline in
the numbers of 13- to 25-year-old Americans - traditionally the most avid
movie-goers.
However, the upturn will not necessarily put the industry in better
financial health. For the number of films being released this summer is
unusually large - about 60, up by a third from last year, which far
outstrips any likely improvement in revenues.
One of the biggest winners among the top Hollywood studios appears to be
Universal, part of the MCA entertainment group, which is in turn owned by
the Japanese electronics company, Matsushita. Universal is behind Jurassic
Park, which smashed through Dollars 100m in box office receipts just nine
days after its release, beating the record of 10 days set by Batman in 1989.
Industry observers reckon the film could challenge Spielberg's own record
for the best-selling movie of all-time, set by ET, which grossed Dollars
399m in the US between 1983 and 1985. However, allowing for ticket price
inflation, Jurassic Park would need to top Dollars 650m genuinely to beat
ET, and that seems unlikely.
Jurassic Park certainly needs to be a monster hit, for Universal reputedly
invested well over Dollars 100m in making and then heavily marketing the
movie, with an estimated Dollars 25m spent on creating the dinosaurs alone.
Columbia, part of Japan's Sony group, is thought to have poured about
Dollars 100m into the early summer's other hugely promoted film, Last Action
Hero, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the lantern-jawed muscle man who
habitually terminates villains with extreme violence in blockbuster action
movies. Schwarzenegger received an up-front free of Dollars 15m.
However, the film has not been a great hit. Observers reckon it may gross
only Dollars 50m to Dollars 60m in the US and will have to rely on overseas
sales to recoup its costs.
Unlike a traditional action movie, Last Action Hero aims for a degree of
sophistication, gets confused and falls between all sorts of stools. It
contains a complex film within the film and numerous gags about classic
movies, including a walk-on role for Sir Ian McKellen, playing the figure of
Death from Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal, let loose in present-day
Manhattan.
But Sony, Matsushita's long-time rival, has other potential winners in its
hand - and it needs them badly, since its US entertainment industry profits
are now playing a big role in offsetting the poor state of the Japanese
electronics market.
Its Tri-Star studio is responsible for Sleepless in Seattle, which was
directed by Nora Ephron, author of the 1989 hit When Sally Met Harry. And
later this month Columbia will release a new Clint Eastwood film, In the
Line of Fire, which deals with an attempt to assassinate the US president.
Perhaps more than any other big studio, Paramount needs a string of hits to
bolster the lacklustre profits record of its parent, Paramount
Communications. It had a strong performer earlier this year with Indecent
Proposal, featuring Robert Redford, but then stumbled at the start of the
summer with Sliver, starring Sharon Stone, Hollywood's latest sex symbol.
Critics panned the film.
Now, however, it may have a blockbuster on its hands with The Firm, which
grossed Dollars 7.2m on its first night.
Neither Walt Disney nor Warner Brothers, part of the Time Warner media
empire, seems to have anything as strong, though Disney's What's Love Got To
Do With It - a biography of rock star Tina Turner - is playing well,
compensating for the company's flop with the comedy Super Mario Brothers.
But while the summer is young, dinosaurs seem set to rule the film world.
