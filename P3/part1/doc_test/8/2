'AND then there is the merchandising. The picture books, T-shirts, video
games, caps, stuffed toys, comic books, and pets. . .The zoo is the
centrepiece of an enormous enterprise' - Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton.
Even by Hollywood standards, the hoo-ha surrounding 'Jurassic Park' is
mammoth. The new MCA/Universal dinosaur film, directed by Steven Spielberg
and based upon Crichton's best-selling novel, is at the centre of a
publicity blitz fuelled by the entertainment industry's biggest licensing
and merchandising programme to date.
In common with Crichton's fictional zoo in which cloned dinosaurs run amok,
the film of Jurassic Park has become the centrepiece of an enormous
enterprise involving more than 100 companies licensed to sell over 1,000
products carrying the film's distinctive emblem: a dinosaur skull
silhouetted against a blood-red sky. Advertising for Jurassic products is
expected to top Dollars 65m this year.
With Jurassic Park opening at thousands of US cinemas tomorrow, stores are
already loaded with everything from pyjamas and boxer shorts to video games,
sweets and toys, trading cards, stickers, board games and puzzles, baseball
caps and, inevitably, breakfast cereal.
Ferrara Pan Candy expects to sell Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) to Dollars 40m
of fruit gum dinosaurs, dinosaur fruit snacks and jellies. Then there are
stuffed animals from Dakin - a 30-inch brachiosaurus, smaller spitters,
raptors and triceratops.
Winterland Productions of San Francisco will turn out 30 to 40 different
T-shirt designs based on scenes from the film.
'We will take dinosaur mania to a new level,' gushes Linda Berkeley, senior
vice-president of development and head of merchandising for MCA/Universal.
'All the enthusiasm, all the excitement has been building. We have such a
comprehensive programme in play. Jurassic Park merchandising will far exceed
that of any other movie.'
With MCA aiming to break the record of Dollars 1bn in retail sales set by
Batman, merchandising revenue could also dwarf box office returns. Jurassic
Park is expected to be the most expensive movie of the year, with production
costs of Dollars 60m and costs of film prints and promotion estimated at
more than Dollars 40m.
For all the hype, however, there is bound to be apprehension with so much
money at stake. However, as Marisa Carcio of the Toy Manufacturers of
America, an industry trade group, points out, 'the success of the
merchandising programme all depends on how well the movie is received. We
are all anxious to see the public reaction.'
US toy makers have profited enormously in the past from tie-ins to movies
such as Star Wars, but there have also been disappointments such as Dick
Tracy and Hook.
Jurassic Park merchandisers also face a significant challenge in
differentiating their products from the wide range of dinosaur-related
paraphernalia already on the market, and with which they may have to share
shelf space in some stores.
Another uncertainty is the appeal of toys, sweets and clothing aimed at
young children that carry the logo of a film many will not see. Jurassic
Park has received a 'PG13' rating in the US, meaning that children under the
age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult. The film's makers acknowledge
that its 'intensity' may be frightening for children aged under about nine
or 10.
Yet as Carcio points out, even R-rated (for adults only) movies such as
Terminator 2 can spawn successful toy products, while there are plenty of
Jurassic Park products for older children. Sega of America is planning
hand-held and TV video games and Nintendo fans will be offered dino-games by
Ocean of America.
McDonald's is selling 'dino-sized' meals: a triple cheeseburger, extra large
portion of fries and a 32-ounce drink served in a Jurassic Park collector's
cup; its restaurants have been designated 'Jurassic Park visitor's centres'.
Advance ticket sales suggest that Jurassic Park will be the hit movie of the
summer. Already, cinemas are scheduling extra showings to accommodate
demand. What cannot be predicted is just how long the movie will pull the
crowds.
MCA is already planning follow-on products including a TV series and a theme
park attraction that could cost more than the movie itself. Nobody is yet
talking about Jurassic Park II, but who knows? The original dinosaurs roamed
the earth for millions of years. Spielberg's creations may well have enough
life in them for a sequel.
