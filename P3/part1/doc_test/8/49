The Rank Organisation yesterday announced annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
276.6m, compared with a restated Pounds 125.8m, but said there had been
little improvement in market conditions.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the upturn was the result of
cost-cutting and improved cash management.
The UK and US markets had remained weak in 1993 and conditions in Japan and
some continental European countries had deteriorated.
There were signs, however, that consumer spending was picking up in the UK
and the US.
The year to October 31 saw sales rise 5 per cent to Pounds 2.11bn (Pounds
2.01bn). Operating profit increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 200.4m (Pounds
176.6m).
The shares rose 20p to Pounds 10.01p.
All of Rank's main business sectors increased operating profits. Film and
television's input rose to Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 22m). Mr Gifford said the
advance was largely the result of improved profitability in film processing.
Admissions to Odeon cinemas rose 10 per cent, largely because of the film
Jurassic Park. Rank was unable to increase admission prices, however,
because of strong competition.
Operating profit from holidays rose to Pounds 51m (Pounds 42.5m). Holiday
volumes grew by 8 per cent, although some of the improvement came in the
off-peak period when prices are lower. Profits rose at the Butlin's holiday
camps but the Shearings coach holiday business saw a small decline.
Mr Gifford added that holiday bookings for the first half of 1994 were up 9
per cent. Bookings for the second half, which includes the summer season,
had increased 7 per cent.
The recreation businesses, which includes bingo, casino and social clubs,
reported operating profits of Pounds 63m (Pounds 57.3m). Admissions were
similar to 1992, but spending per head in social and bingo clubs increased
by 6 per cent. Spending in the casinos rose 4 per cent on unchanged
admissions.
The leisure division, which takes in US resorts, Hard Rock Cafes and
nightclubs, lifted profits to Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 33.6m), of which the US
contributed Pounds 10m.
UK nightclubs increased admissions by 13 per cent, but spending per head
remained static. Mr Gifford said many of the new customers were coming to
nightclubs during the week, when spending was usually lower.
Rank's share of the pre-tax profits of Rank Xerox rose to Pounds 151.2m
(Pounds 137.3m). The contribution from other associates, primarily Universal
Studios in Florida, rose by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 11.5m.
Earnings per share were 46.5p (6.1p). There was no final dividend as Rank
announced last July that it was paying an accelerated total for the year of
31p, the same as in 1992.
A Kershaw, whose main asset is its shareholding in Rank Precision
Industries, had investment income after all charges of Pounds 10.1m (Pounds
9.9m). Profit on ordinary activities after tax was Pounds 9.9m (Pounds
9.7m). The final dividend of 18p makes a total of 27p, from earnings of
28.5p (27.9p).
