Matsushita, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday affirmed its
determination to retain control of MCA, its Los Angeles-based entertainment
business, in spite of demands from MCA's senior management to take control
of the company.
Mr Yoichi Morishita, chairman of Matsushita, held five hours of talks in San
Francisco on Tuesday with Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran MCA chairman, and Mr
Sidney Sheinberg, president.
The US duo, the longest established management team in Hollywood, tabled a
request for managerial control. Mr Morishita rejected the request by telling
them: 'As long as Matsushita holds 100 per cent of the shares we can not
cede control.'
The San Francisco showdown followed months of strained relations between MCA
and its Japanese parent company. Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg have
criticised Matsushita for allegedly blocking their plans to expand MCA's
entertainment interests at the same aggressive pace as rivals such as Time
Warner and Viacom.
Tuesday's meeting followed a few days after the news that Mr David Geffen,
the billionaire music mogul who founded MCA's Geffen Record subsidiary, and
Mr Steven Spielberg, the director of its latest box office hits, Jurassic
Park and Schindler's List, were joining forces with Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg,
former head of Walt Disney's film studios, to form an entertainment company.
The potential loss of Mr Geffen and Mr Spielberg has intensified the
pressure on MCA and Matsushita to resolve the US company's future.
However, some US entertainment industry analysts speculated that Mr
Wasserman, 81, and Mr Sheinberg, 59, may have over-played their hand by
giving Matsushita the chance to replace them with a younger management team.
