Christmas presents

Soap or socks are not the only Christmas presents for those who have
everything. There are still a few surprises.
One gentleman from the United Arab Emirates has bought a life-like,
automated baby tyrannosaurus rex from the catalogue of Neiman Marcus, the
Texan Christmas mail order book for the truly rich and famous. At Dollars
63,000 (Pounds 42,300) the model has darting eyes and moving head, legs and
tail, and the mouth opens and closes.
For those with a big enough home, Neiman Marcus still has the baby
dinosaur's partner for sale - a Dollars 93,000 model of a full-grown
triceratops, nearly 7ft high and more than 12ft long.
Elsewhere in the US, the promise of a robust economic recovery is filtering
through into the high street. At New York department store Bloomingdale's
some of the most popular presents this year are cashmere sweaters, gloves
and scarves.
The 'hemline index', which dictates that when times are good, skirts get
shorter, appears to be holding true. Bloomingdale's reports the surprise of
the season is the continuing demand for the '16-inch micro-mini skirt'.
In Europe, too, sales of Christmas gifts are higher than in previous years.
At Harrods, still one of London's grandest stores, managers are keeping
their fingers crossed for the shop's best ever Christmas. They have sold out
of their seasonal food hampers, which cost up to Pounds 1,000 a time, and
staff have been put to work filling more.
Fashion jewellery has proved particularly popular, with 10,000 pairs of
earrings - a quarter of the department's annual sales - sold in the run-up
to Christmas.
At Giorgio Armani in Milan, sales are booming of traditional Christmas gifts
such as accessories and perfume. Perfume, not surprisingly, also tops the
list in Paris at the high-class Printemps store.
Meanwhile, in Germany many consumers will find a telephone among the piles
of seasonal favourites this year. The big demand follows the recent
liberalisation of the local telephone system, according to Kaufhof, the
Cologne-based stores group.
In Europe, customers appear to be turning their backs on opulence only at
the gift department of Paris's Galeries Lafayette. Staff report a rush for
imported ethnic garments and household goods. Customers are also keen, they
say, on ecologically sound items such as recycled writing paper.
In Australia, traditional presents such as writing paper are also selling
well. But it is French perfume that has surprised Australian re-tailers with
an 'extraordinary comeback', says Don Grover, general manager of one of the
David Jones stores in Sydney. He believes this is because of the launch of
several new perfumes in Australia over the past year. The number one slot,
however, is still held by Chanel.
With Christmas taking place at 300C, many Australian women can look forward
to getting a pair of lady's boxer shorts. For Australian men ties are big
news, with one designed to celebrate the staging of the Olympic Games in the
year 2000 selling well. (Presumably its popularity will run and run.)
Elsewhere, the less favourable economic mood has reduced the chance of
receiving an expensive or exotic Christmas present. In Japan the current
economic downturn is taking its toll.
During the 'bubble' period of the late 1980s, the winter gift-giving season
was a chance for both ordinary Japanese people and corporations to overwhelm
relatives and clients with tasty foods: expensive liquors, live crabs and
lobsters, and carefully wrapped fruit.
This year many people are not sending the customary gifts, and those that
are tend to choose basic products such as soy sauce and soy bean paste.
Takashimaya, the upmarket retailer, says it is the first time in 10 years
that customers have chosen such products.
One of the few pieces of good news is for the pearl industry, thanks to this
year's Imperial wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, the
former career diplomat. She is often seen wearing pearl earrings and
bracelets, and as a result many men are buying pearls to send their
girlfriends and wives.
For the kids, taste and incomes vary. Computers and computer games head many
lists. A survey by market researchers Mori shows that one in three British
families will buy a computer-related present this Christmas, a finding borne
out by London toy shop Hamley's, where Sega games machines top the list of
purchases.
But whereas this year's Mortal Kombat game has hit the headlines with its
seemingly gratuitous violence, and its password to bar younger children from
the higher levels of gore, gentler games have proved popular in Europe. Fifa
International Soccer and Jurassic Park are the big sellers this Christmas in
the UK, for example.
For Australian children rollerblades and golf clubs are among the most
requested presents in the 'Dear Santa' letters analysed by Australia Post,
while many youngsters requested their own mobile phone. Dinosaurs (the
remote-control version) are also much in demand.
In the US it is not the mobile phone but the pager that is the latest
high-tech addition for the with-it kid on the street. Discredited for many
years because of their association with drugs dealers, pink, blue or yellow
pagers are now proving so popular that some schools are having to ban them
to prevent them bleeping during lessons.
And for those that cannot afford a Neiman Marcus mechanised dinosaur, there
are alternatives. The merchandising opportunity of the year has been Barney,
an insipidly sweet, purple, stuffed toy dinosaur. Youngsters, it would seem,
just cannot get enough of him.
