AN 'anti-science' mood is sweeping Britain and undermining medical research,
Sir David Weatherall, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University,
said yesterday.
Sir David, president of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, was speaking in advance of the association's annual meeting at
Keele University next week.
He said young people blamed science for environmental problems and were
alarmed by the 'Jurassic Park' image of genetic research. They were also
concerned about 'the possible stigmatisation of people' carrying undesirable
genes.
Despite high-profile developments in genetic research, people could not see
improvements in healthcare, Sir David said.
