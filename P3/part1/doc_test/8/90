Three boys turn the pages of an enchanted book. As a glow starts to emanate
from inside, the overture comes to an end, the lights dim and the show
begins: The Magic Flute as fairy-tale is at least as valid an interpretation
as any other.
For the audiences that Opera North services on its touring around the
country, a production of this favourite Mozart opera that combines a clear
telling of the story with pantomime fun is likely to go down well. The
company's new staging by Annabel Arden (best known for her work with Theatre
de Complicite) is a modest effort in every sense, simple in concept, basic
in design, but it allows a naive enjoyment of the opera. A full house at the
second performance on Thursday clearly loved it.
Among its simple pleasures are a comic dragon with a fiery red tongue to
menace Tamino in the opening scene and an array of strange, multi-coloured,
rubbery creatures that appear when he plays his flute, as if he has strayed
into a kindergarten extension of Jurassic Park. The adult aspects of the
story tend to get short shrift, although it was an amusing idea to have
Sarastro's throne growing out of the tree of knowledge. Rae Smith was the
designer, working (one imagines) on a shoe-string.
There is little sense of the production team agonising at length over the
moral implications of this complicated tale. By using the translation of the
musical numbers by Jeremy Sams the company has ensured simply that the story
comes across clearly and humorously, in extremely user-friendly English. The
spoken dialogue has been newly translated by Arden, not to mention heavily
cut: a relief, as it is stiffly delivered.
Opera North is lucky to have William Burden back after his successful La
Boheme as a personable Tamino, free from assuming any false princely airs,
singing the tenor's music as though it has no difficulties to it at all. His
pint-sized Pamina, Linda Kitchen, was less fortunate; her voice does not
always take kindly to the broad, sustained, lyrical style. William Dazeley
works hard to be cute as Papageno, too hard for my taste, though the
audience thought otherwise. Eileen Hulse was a lightweight Queen of the
Night without much regal authority. John Rath as Sarastro had trouble
staying in tune.
All of them were hustled along by Andrew Parrott in the pit. He does not
necessarily race ahead where the music is fast, but almost nothing sounded
relaxed, able to give the drama space in which to encourage contemplation,
enhance understanding. Scenes such as Tamino's arrival at the Temple of
Wisdom felt perfunctory. Although this Magic Flute is a minor addition to
the sum of Mozart productions, it should win over first-time visitors to the
opera: the cheers at the end sounded genuine.
