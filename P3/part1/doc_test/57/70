What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
The smartest Christmas shooting stockings - as worn by the Prince of Wales -
are knitted in local traditional patterns by Alison Thomson of 30 High St,
Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway for just Pounds 19, made to measure.
A gundog slip lead is a good stocking filler at Pounds 6 (Turner Richards,
tel: 021-359 5577), but if the labrador is steady at the hottest pheasant
drive he may merit immortality through Simon Gudgeon, whose dog portraits
start at Pounds 125 (tel: 0243-811613).
The silver dog whistle from Holland &amp; Holland, Pounds 38 (tel: 071-499
4411), is a better bet for owners of hooligan hounds - as it is 'silent'.
This asset will be lost on the 50-plus shooting men bellowing over the port.
The best present for those still with hearing is a pair of Sound Censor
ear-plugs. Individually moulded to the ear canal, they are unobtrusive and
extremely effective. They cost Pounds 130 a pair, although syndicates should
be able to obtain group discount (tel: Mrs Perkins at Holland &amp; Holland).
More light-hearted are the Loon cartoon boxer shorts - 'Cocks Over' - from
the Enormous Handkerchief Co Hounds and, inevitably, fly fishing versions
are also available at Pounds 9.95 (tel: 0333-329559).
For more public display, the silver salmon cuff-links from William Powell's
are good value at Pounds 50 (tel: 021-643 0689). And for a keepsake of an
epic tussle with a fresh-run spring fish, there can be little lovelier than
the hand-drawn river maps from Fred Cholmeley (tel: 047-683235), illustrated
with water-colours of birds and mammals chosen by the client. Prices start
at Pounds 95 unframed.
All fish and fowl can be red-inked in true style in the new range of
game-books by The Game Book (from Pounds 20.50, tel: 071-351 0233) but if
the season's tally looks meagre, Roxton Bailey Robinson can organise the
highest pheasants in the land from Pounds 800 per gun (tel: 0488-683222).
Just thinking of such a day causes insomnia, so Wildsounds' Nocturne of
Nightingale - one hour of nightingale song (Pounds 10.99 on CD, Pounds 6.95
on tape, tel: 0263-741100) - should send in the sandman before Santa.
