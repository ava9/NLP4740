Pounds 29m - Objectives achieved as acquisition of Dowty IT business gives
the group international status

CRAY Electronics Holdings, the Berkshire-based data communications and
software systems group which acquired the Dowty information technology
division from TI for Pounds 50m in August last year, yesterday reported
sharply higher profits for the year ended April 30 1993.
Swollen by the Dowty acquisition, profits on disposals and foreign exchange
as well as margin improvements and organic growth, pre-tax profits jumped
from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m.
Earnings per share were 13.8p (1.9p) and the recommended final dividend is
increased to 1p (0.5p) making a total of 1.5p (0.5p).
As expected the results will trigger the final tranche of a three-part
share-option based incentive bonus package, worth in total about Pounds 27m.
The package will be shared by former chairman Sir Peter Michael, his
successor Mr Roger Holland, Mr Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon
Richards, managing director, each of whom invested Pounds 750,000 in the
stock at 50p a share when they took over in 1989.
Mr Holland, who succeeded Sir Peter last month, said: 'Our objectives of
improving profit margins, increasing exports and consolidation in the growth
sectors of information technology have been achieved.'
Turnover increased to Pounds 200.8m (Pounds 84.8m) including a 40 per cent
increase in turnover from continuing operations to Pounds 90.4m (Pounds
64.6m) and Pounds 97m attributable to Dowty.
Continuing operations generated Pounds 11m (Pounds 3.22m) of operating
profits in addition to the Pounds 7.2m of profits attributable to the
acquisition and Pounds 322,000 (Pounds 2.14m) from discontinued operations.
After paying Pounds 871,000 (Pounds 2.61m) in interest charges the company
reported 'normal trading profits' of Pounds 17.6m, slightly higher than most
forecasts. An additional Pounds 3.43m in realised foreign exchange profits
made total profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 21m (Pounds 2.74m).
Pre-tax profits were further boosted by exceptional profits on disposals
which with a Pounds 12.6m gain on the sale of Malvern Instruments partly
offset by a Pounds 4.55m loss on other items.
At the divisional level, Cray Communications, which now incorporates most of
the Dowty business, emerged as the largest and most profitable division
within the company with profits of Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 127m
representing almost 70 per cent of the total. The Dowty data communications
companies accounted for Pounds 7.2m of the profits and Pounds 97m of the
divisional turnover.
COMMENT
The acquisition of the Dowty IT business has transformed Cray Electronics
into an international force in the fast growing market for data
communications equipment. The business has been quickly integrated but there
is still room to push up margins in the combined communications division.
The balance sheet is solid with Pounds 12m in net cash at the year end and
pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 25.5m this year producing earnings of
8.7p per share. The shares slipped 6 1/2 p yesterday to close at 156p and
therefore trade on a lofty prospective p/e of 17.9.
