FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Holland outclass Irish to end Charlton's
dream
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shrugging off criticism of their first-round form, Holland stirred memories
of their heyday a generation ago by beating a bedraggled Ireland 2-0 in
Orlando yesterday to take their place in the World Cup quarter-finals.
Bergkamp and Jonk scored the first-half goals for Holland which ended
Ireland's low-scoring run. The Irish tried to rally in the second half - a
late goal by McGrath was disallowed - but their limitations had been exposed
by a far sterner and more imaginative Dutch side.
Bergkamp scored in the 11th minute and Jonk blasted home the second in the
41st. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper - extending his record of Irish caps to
77 - grappled with Jonk's searing 25-metre drive but failed to stop it.
Holland's two-goal advantage was the least they deserved as their forwards
constantly out-paced the Irish defence. Manager Dick Advocaat had flirted
with the idea of fielding just two men up front but changed his mind.
Overmars, whose place on the Dutch right flank had appeared most under
threat, more than justified his inclusion.
In the quarter-finals Holland meet the winners of last night's Brazil-US
clash in Dallas.
