Thirty years' worth of understated and carefully nurtured tenor playing
produced the Grammy-winning Joe Henderson in full bloom at London's Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Monday. A diffident personality, usually wreathed in
cigarette smoke, Henderson's restraint and lack of bluster has kept him out
of the headlines but in the best musical company since his early years with
Kenny Dorham and Horace Silver. A new label deal and a series of
well-conceived discs which diffuse the polished melodies of Billy Strayhorn
and mellow the cool loneliness of Miles Davis brought him blinking into the
spotlight last year.
At a time when young saxophonists are expected to make their mark through
sonic attack, Henderson leaves a deep and lasting impression through his
sonorous, considered interpretation. Backed by the talkative upright bass of
Dave Holland and the bright, skittish drumming of Al Foster, the Henderson
tenor ripens before your ears.
Proceeding from Strayhorn's 'Isfahan' a melodic picture sensitively built
up, 'Take The 'A' Train' introduced gentle harmonic embellishment and a
choppy 'Lush Life' even produced the odd skirl from the reed. Typically,
Henderson's development of these seasoned works took on the manner of a
journey to an unknown destination with pauses on the way to savour the
melody. The conclusion of each number is reached unwittingly but naturally.
Diversions created by thrumming, fret-rattling solos from Holland or
good-humoured polyrhthyms from Foster, are carefully measured - Henderson's
own excursions rationed to not overwhelm the ear.
The saxophone trio must be one of the most testing formats for the concert
hall, for all concerned. It is a tribute to the Joe Henderson trio's
musicianship that their tunes hang in the air, without hiatus, to be
savoured in all their richness, with neither introduction nor explanation
needed. The group's fine volume balance, Henderson's magisterial lead, deep
sensitivity to the music, and each other's involvement in it, now set the
standard for small groups of any instrumentation.
