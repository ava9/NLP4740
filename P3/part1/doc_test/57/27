Like the wedding guest who objects to the marriage at the last moment, a 
Connecticut investor has spoken up in a bid to ruin the proposed merger between 
Newport Electronics Inc. and a Silicon Valley company. 
</P>
<P>
Milton B. Hollander of Stamford, Conn., who owns a 13% stake in Newport 
Electronics, launched a bid Thursday to take control of the Santa Ana firm, 
just one month before Newport's proposed merger with Sensor Control Corp. of 
Sunnyvale is expected to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
If Hollander's bid succeeds, Sensor Control and Newport Electronics will not be 
able to complete their merger, Ronald L. Wilson, Sensor's chief financial 
officer, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still reviewing what his offer is and what it means," Wilson said, "but 
we don't think his offer is as good as ours." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Electronics directors discussed the Hollander bid at a meeting Friday, 
board member Norman Gray said. Gray said the board reached no decision about 
whether to recommend or reject the new offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Made in April 
</P>
<P>
Newport agreed in April to be acquired by Sensor, a manufacturer of industrial 
sensors, for $9 a share, or $10.8 million. Officials of both companies said 
that the plans to merge are progressing and that the deal is scheduled to be 
completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The new bid from Hollander will complicate those proceedings, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, a self-employed engineer and former vice president at Gulf + Western 
Inc. (since renamed Paramount Communications) in New York, is proposing to buy 
392,000 shares of Newport for $9.50 a share, or $3.7 million, raising his stake 
in the firm to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander and his wife, Betty Ruth Hollander, are the sole owners of Omega 
Engineering Inc., a Stamford catalogue distributor of electronics instruments. 
Betty Hollander is the chief executive officer of Omega, and Milton Hollander 
is a director. 
</P>
<P>
Omega is a customer of both Newport and Sensor, according to officials of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Firm Makes Offer 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, whose offer is being made through a new company called High 
Technology Holding Corp., said he wants to obtain working control of Newport, 
according to a filing made Thursday with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, Hollander has no plans to replace Newport Chairman 
Barret B. Weekes or any of the other current Newport officers, but he did say 
that he will seek representation on its board. Hollander also said he would 
consider selling Newport to Omega. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson of Sensor said his company believes that its offer is better because it 
would pay $9 a share for 100% of Newport's stock. Hollander's bid would pay 
$9.50 a share for 35% of Newport's stock.
