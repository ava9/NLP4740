from The Hague by Nerijus Maliukevicius, press attache of the 
Lithuanian president, that President Algirdas Brazauskas arrived 
on an official visit to the Kingdom of the Netherlands this 
morning. 
  A solemn welcoming ceremony took place at (Valkenburg) 
military airport. [passage omitted] 
  The president was welcomed by the Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers. He presented to Brazauskas the people taking part in 
the welcoming ceremony. Brazauskas presented the Lithuanian 
delegation. [passage omitted] 
  The Lithuanian delegation arrived at the Royal Palace in the 
morning. Here the Lithuanian president was received by Her 
Majesty Queen Beatrix. At the start, the Queen and the 
president conversed for half an hour and then the Lithuanian 
guests were presented to Her Majesty. A luncheon in honor of 
the Lithuanian president was held. Queen Beatrix and Brazauskas 
exchanged speeches during the luncheon. 
  Brazauskas visited the Netherlands parliament in the 
afternoon. He met the chairmen of its lower and upper chambers. 
After a brief welcoming speech by the chairmen of the chambers, 
the president acquainted them with the priorities of Lithuanian 
foreign policy and replied to questions by the parliamentarians 
[words indistinct] the cooperation for peace program, 
Lithuania's economic situation and how the Netherlands state 
could help Lithuania. 
  [Foreign] Ministers Povilas Gylys and Pieter Kooijmans 
signed 
two agreements in the Foreign Ministry: On marine transport and 
on the incentives and protection of investments. 
  The Netherlands press focused a great deal on the visit. Two 
news conferences took place, one in the press center and the 
other in the residence occupied by the president. Journalists 
were mostly interested in Lithuanian-Russian relations, the 
stance on the document of cooperation for peace program, which 
is to be signed in NATO headquarters tomorrow [27 January]. 
  The prime minister of the Netherlands gave a dinner for the 
Lithuanian president in the evening. 
  The Lithuanian delegation will leave The Hague for Brussels
