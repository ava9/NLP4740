Wrangling About Van Thijn's Successor"] 
  [Text] The appointment of Amsterdam Mayor E. van Thijn as 
home affairs minister is uncontested in national politics. The 
large parties value his administrative qualities. But his 
departure from Amsterdam has launched an immediate struggle over 
the question of which political party is to supply his successor. 
  D66 [Democrats 66] says that given polls of voters' 
intentions, it is no longer self-evident that the PvdA [Labor 
Party] should provide a candidate. D66 holds few mayor's 
positions and none in the four large cities. The fact that VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] alderman P. de Grave 
is to become acting mayor has raised questions, because De Grave 
is also the VVD's leading candidate in the municipal elections. 
  On 15 January the cabinet voted unanimously in favor of the 
nomination of Van Thijn to succeed minister Dales, who died last 
week. PvdA party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Kok said that 
in his view Van Thijn "was the first choice and the best 
candidate." 
  Van Thijn has much political and governmental experience and 
briefly held the position of home affairs minister in 1981. 
Last weekend Kok let there be no misunderstanding that he 
wanted a heavyweight like Van Thijn to strengthen the PvdA in 
the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the subsequent 
formation of a government. 
  Van Thijn had planned to give up his position as mayor no 
sooner than next year, when his second term of office was due to 
end. Kok put an end to the plan. "The PvdA needs you," he told 
Van Thijn. The party leader also wants him to remain minister in 
the following cabinet should the PvdA participate in government. 
"Although you can neither give nor ask for guarantees on that 
sort of thing," Kok said. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers said on Saturday [15 January] that 
Van 
Thijn's appointment would present Amsterdam with problems, just 
before the municipal elections. "But that was no reason not to 
appoint him," Lubbers said. "The problem would have occurred 
soon anyway, because he had indicated that he did not want a 
third term in office." 
  Today Van Thijn will resign formally as mayor and will be 
sworn in tomorrow by Queen Beatrix. Lubbers did not want to 
speculate on the political color of the future mayor of 
Amsterdam. "In the first place that is a question for the 
Queen's commissioner in North Holland, who is approaching a 
successor in consultation with the municipal council."
