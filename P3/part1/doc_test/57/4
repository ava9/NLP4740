price-cutting in an unexpected area of retailing

EYEBROWS may rise today along Savile Row, home of the gentleman's wardrobe,
at the news that one of Britain's most famous tailors has been obliged to
make the unkindest cut of all - a cut in prices.
Bernard Weatherill, the sporting tailor which supplies hunting clothes to
the Queen, has reduced prices by up to 30 per cent for suits, coats and
shooting jackets in a move intended to stimulate sales.
A three-piece gentleman's suit can now be had for Pounds 1,150 plus value
added tax, while hunt coats have been reduced to Pounds 725 - representing a
saving of Pounds 275. Mr Hugh Holland, managing director, said the move had
been prompted by the recession, in which sales had fallen by more than 60
per cent. Tough trading conditions had been worsened by uncertainty about
the future of hunting, he added.
'We have built a client base of English country gentlemen, but they will not
order their hunt coats and affiliated items if they feel the sport is going
to be banned,' he explained. 'Some of our customers feel that is inevitable
if the Labour party wins the election. Those that can vote will certainly
vote Conservative.'
The organisation was formerly the family company of Mr Bernard Weatherill,
the retiring speaker of the Commons. In the past, it has discreetly cut
prices for those brazen enough to ask for reductions. 'But we thought it was
wrong to offer discounts to the one-off punter when we were not offering
them to our most valued long-standing customers,' Mr Holland said. 'I
therefore sent a letter to our 4,500 customers announcing these price cuts.'
However, all is not desperation on Savile Row. Bernard Weatherill's sister
company Kilgour, French &amp; Stanbury, which relies heavily on overseas
customers, has continued to enjoy strong sales. 'As far as the Americans are
concerned, the customers we deal with are recession-proof,' Mr Holland said.
'They are still ordering half a dozen suits at a time. Thankfully that type
of business is not diminishing.'
