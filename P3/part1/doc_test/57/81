EUROPA Metalli, the industrial arm of Societa Metallurgica Italiana,
Europe's biggest maker of semi-finished copper and alloy products, plunged
to a L67.4bn (Dollars 44m) loss last year owing to the recession and
problems at its big French subsidiary.
In 1991, net profits at the company, which controls Kabelmetal in Germany
and Trefimetaux in France, amounted to L10.9bn.
Sales in 1992 rose by about 3 per cent to L3,112bn, based on average
exchange rates for the year. However, the decline in demand was reflected in
turnover in Ecu terms, which fell by about 0.5 per cent.
Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman and main shareholder, attributed the sharp fall
in earnings to financial factors and the recession. Extraordinary items in
1992 resulted in a loss of L3.2bn, compared with earnings of L32bn in 1991.
Operations in France reported a heavy loss, while activities in Germany,
which had buoyed other parts of the group, also witnessed a downturn in the
second half. Meanwhile, the group's defence business, principally
ammunition, remained heavily in the red owing to stagnant demand.
The group forecast an upturn this year thanks to a restructuring plan
involving investments of L150bn over the next two years to improve
productivity and product quality, and lift sales. It also plans to cut its
workforce, now about 11,000. by 14 per cent, with the sharpest reductions in
France.
Net group debt rose to L1,043bn from L863bn in 1991, although much of the
increase was due to exchange rate factors.
New Holland, the farm and construction equipment business formed from the
acquisition by Fiat of Ford's New Holland subsidiary, is buying 50 per cent
of Fabrica de Tractores Agricolas, a leading Mexican farm equipment maker.
No price for the deal has been revealed. FTA, owned by the Mexican Barrera
group, had sales of about Dollars 100m last year and controls around 40 per
cent of the Mexican farm equipment market.
The deal envisages the transfer of Fiat technology to FTA for tractors of
between 65-100 horsepower and offers FTA access to the international New
Holland sales network for its products.
