FT  12 NOV 94 / Property: Ripple becomes a wider stream - London recovery
spreads

The little ripple that started running through the central London property
market two years ago has now spread.
The small upturn started after the devaluation of sterling in September 1992
made the prime areas of central London attractive to buyers from the Far
East. The knock-on has now reached to areas of central-outer London where UK
buyers predominate, either established Londoners moving house or the young
starting their careers.
Which parts of town are on the up? Agent Winkworth, which gets a good
picture from 31 franchised offices across the capital, suggests familiar
names such as Notting Hill and Islington - and surprises such as Acton and
Victoria Park, in the depressed East End district of Hackney.
The buyers divide into two types: those seeking a single, or main, residence
and those who have a larger place elsewhere and are after a pied-a-terre in
town.
In Bloomsbury, famed for writer Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Set, the
pied-a-terre brigade makes up 80 per cent of buyers, says David Salvi of
Barnard Marcus. They are mostly lawyers, doctors, and people in publishing
and the media.
It is much the same in nearby Covent Garden, says Lesa Green, of EA Shaw.
'They want a simple pad. It does not matter if it is over a shop or
restaurant.'
One of the tricks is to work out which areas are about to become fashionable
and buy before the stampede drives prices up. In the west London district of
Notting Hill, the herd is gathering already, although prices are cheap only
by comparison with similar accommodation in Chelsea, Knightsbridge,
Kensington and Holland Park - the areas where the ripple began.
Communal gardens, a feature of the area, are a great advantage. A large
Notting Hill maisonette opening on to one costs Pounds 450,000 to Pounds
500,000 and will attract younger buyers away from two-bedroom flats in
Chelsea and Knightsbridge. And there are large family houses at about Pounds
2m, against Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7m for similar town mansions in Holland
Park.
In some cases, prices in the area have risen sometimes by as much as 20 per
cent this year, says Giles Hoskins, of Winkworth in Notting Hill - and 90
per cent of the buyers are British.
This demand has spread northwards to W10 where the Queen's Park estate
(originally the Shaftesbury estate) north of the Harrow Road is popular.
Terrace houses with two or three bedrooms, costing Pounds 75,000 to Pounds
100,000, go quickly to young professional couples or singles.
The latter are often first-time buyers who continued renting through the
recession. Now, they have enough money to jump the usual first step in the
housing ladder - a studio flat - in favour of something more substantial.
Further west, Acton W3 takes over-spill from Chiswick and Hammersmith.
Prices range from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 155,000 for a house near Acton
Town (District and Piccadilly Underground lines) in the triangle of roads
formed by The Ridgeway, Park Drive and Princes Avenue.
Those prices are 10 to 15 per cent lower than they would be in neighbouring
Chiswick, and Winkworth has sold 17 houses in this triangle in the past
year. The alternative is the 'poets' corner' near Acton Central (North
London line) where the roads are named after Cowper, Milton and others.
Further north and east, Islington offers fine Georgian and early-Victorian
houses, theatres, restaurants and good public transport. For real value,
though, Winkworth's Andrew Towler advises buyers to go half a mile east to
the De Beauvoir estate.
This has excellent Victorian houses interspersed with council homes. A
three-bedroom property there would cost Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 160,000,
compared with Pounds 250,000 near the Angel in the heart of Islington.
Still further east, City people are discovering Victoria Park, E9, where
four-bedroom houses cost from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 250,000 and it is
easy to reach the City and the West End by bus or Underground (District and
Central lines).
At Clapham South SW4, (Northern line), four estate agents have opened
recently to cover the streets off Abbeville Road, near the south-east corner
of Clapham Common. A five-bedroom house in Elms Road with conservatory, roof
terrace and garden is available from Winkworth for Pounds 365,000.
But go a mile south-east, to Streatham SW2, and you will find splendid value
in five streets around the area of Telford Avenue. The houses are
substantial and mostly red-brick late Victorian and Edwardian, with five to
eight bedrooms and costing around Pounds 250,000.
