The Gate Theatre in Notting Hill has achieved the distinction of being
heavily oversubscribed on a wet Monday night even for such an unpromising
play as Thomas Bernhard's Elisabeth II. The first half consists of a
seemingly endless monologue in the style of an ageing Austrian Jimmy Porter
without the jokes, but it is necessary to sit through it in order to
appreciate the second.
What Austria in general and Vienna in particular did to Bernhard to deserve
such spleen is never clear. He was born, the illegitimate son of an Austrian
mother, in Holland in 1931. Most of his education took place in Austria. He
died in 1989, having written about 20 plays, but is scarcely known in
Britain.
This is psychological guesswork, but I suspect that the underlying theme of
Elisabeth II is a lament that Austria is not what it used to be. Bernhard
would have preferred the old imperial splendour and the intellectual life
that sometimes went with it. The Elisabeth in question is not Elisabeth of
Austria but the Queen of England paying a state visit to Vienna in the late
1950s. All Viennese society turns out to see her.
The Queen does not appear. Instead we have the rich, disabled Herr
Herrenstein whose apartment is being used to view the Queen from the
balcony. He is a cantankerous old man who lost his lower legs in a driving
accident. In the first act he rants about the decline of Austria and the old
civilisation. From his references to Schopenauer, Hegel and Kant, he is very
well-educated. He is also intolerably rude to his servants and professes
near-total misanthropy.
The part is played with immense self-confidence by Julian Curry, yet the
monologue is heavy going by any standards. Then suddenly it turns out that
the old man has life, even affection, in him after all. He is concerned that
his long-standing manservant Richard (Ian Gelder) is about to desert him.
Although he is on stage throughout, Richard has barely a dozen lines:
Gelder's performance, showing his white gloves and the occasional movement
of the eyebrows, is a gem.
There is also a philosopher friend called Guggenheim, played by Barry
Wallman, who has spent his most creative years in Oxford. In his presence
Herrenstein becomes a different man, capable of kindness and friendship. It
looks remarkably like hero worship of the civilising influence of an English
university.
As the Queen's approach nears, the stage fills up with a cocktail party to
see her. Here is the Austrian society which Herrenstein despises, though
again there is an exception in Countess Gudenus (Eileen Page) who is not
only beautiful, but appreciates Guggenheim's writing.
The end is startling, yet ambiguous. The balcony collapses with nearly all
the people on it. a Herrenstein might have plotted this all along, or
equally Richard might have finally push his master over the edge. At any
rate the last half hour or so has been worth waiting for. The direction and
designs are by David Fielding and the translation by Meredith Oakes. About
half of act one should be cut.
