New Supercross champion Jeff Stanton closed the stadium motocross season 
Saturday night by winning the Coors Super Challenge of Motocross before 40,173 
fans at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It took Stanton eight laps to catch George Holland, but once he got the lead, 
there was no stopping the Honda rider from Sherwood, Mich. Two Kawasaki riders, 
Jeff Ward of Mission Viejo and Ron Lechien of El Cajon, finished second and 
third, respectively, as Holland faded to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In prerace ceremonies, Stanton received a check for $50,000 for winning the 
Supercross championship and also received the traditional No. 1 plates from 
1988 champion Rick Johnson of El Cajon. Johnson, who won the first five stadium 
races this year, was injured during practice last March and has not ridden 
since. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Stanton's fourth of the 15-race season. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, Stanton's Honda teammate from Kerman, Calif., came off the starting 
line in front, much as he did in his heat, but in neither race could he hold 
on. Ward caught and beat him in the heat, and Stanton caught him after several 
laps over a Coliseum track that included two side-by-side runs up and through 
the peristyle arches. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought all along I could catch Holland because I ride with him in practice 
and I knew he wasn't in as good a shape as he needed to be to go 20 laps on 
such a long track," Stanton said. "The track was very fast, but very long for a 
Supercross and it was very tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more concerned that Ward might be coming on, but after about 15 laps I 
felt pretty secure. I only wish Ricky Johnson could have been riding all along. 
We'd have put on quite a show, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of confidence when I beat him straight up before he got hurt and I 
think that helped me all season long." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton also leads the 250cc national outdoor series with two races remaining. 
He will then set his sights on the 500cc outdoor season, during which Johnson 
expects to be ready to defend his championship. Stanton, who has virtually 
clinched the 250cc title, would become the first rider to sweep all three 
American Motorcyclist Assn. divisions if he were to win the 500. "I think the 
500 is my best series because it favors a bigger rider and I'm bigger than 
most," the 6-foot 180-pound Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Cooper of Stillwater, Okla., who was in second place in Camel Supercross 
standings going into Saturday's race, did not ride after suffering a broken 
collarbone during practice late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country earned $10,000 for winning the 125cc Camel 
Shootout between the top riders of the East and West coasts after a 15-lap duel 
with Damon Bradshaw of Charlotte, N.C.
