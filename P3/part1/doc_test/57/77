rapid expansion of Willis Corroon

WILLIS CORROON, the world's second biggest insurance broker, is close to
completing a network of European subsidiaries and associates - following the
acquisition this week of a 20 per cent stake in a medium-sized German
insurance broker, C Wuppesahl &amp; Co Assekuranzmakler.
The deal is the latest in a series effected by Willis since the October 1990
merger between Willis Faber of the UK and Corroon &amp; Black of the US.
Over the past 18 months, at a total cost of some Pounds 25m, Willis has
bought 50 per cent stakes in operations in Italy and the Netherlands and a
40 per cent stake of an operation in Spain.
New ventures have been begun in France, Sweden, Hungary, Russia, Denmark and
Czechoslovakia. Wuppesahl, which handled premiums of more than DM300m in
1990, earning brokerage revenue of DM30m, has offices in seven German
cities, and also brings Zurich representation in Switzerland and Austria.
Negotiations are afoot with a Belgian partner. A deal here would complete
the network.
The speed with which Willis has assembled its network is symptomatic of the
interest in the rapidly-growing European market of the world's biggest
insurance brokers, which provide insurance and risk management services for
the world's largest companies.
Increasingly brokers are also interested in the business of medium-sized
companies which, following the approval of key planks of the European
Commission's liberalisation programme, are now more likely to buy their
insurance from companies located outside their home territories.
Brokers, which in many European countries have handled only a small
percentage of commercial insurance business - as little as 15 per cent in
Germany and Italy for example - see rising demand here as another source of
growth.
Keen to take advantage of this opportunity, many brokers have begun building
European operations. Recent developments include:
In February Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, spent Dollars 105m
acquiring control of Faugere et Jutheau, the French family-owned broker.
Europe has generated faster growth for Marsh than any other territory. The
completion of a continent-wide network has been a priority.
The Marsh network in Europe - which covers 16 countries - also includes the
Lloyd's broker, CT Bowring, in London and Germany's largest broker, Gradmann
Holler, which was acquired in 1989.
In August last year Rollins Burdick Hunter, the US broker which is part of
Aon Corporation, paid more than Dollars 200m to acquire Holland's leading
broker, Hudig-Langeveldt.
In the past five years both Sedgwick - which links London's Sedgwick with
Fred S James - and Alexander &amp; Alexander - formed when A&amp;A took over
Alexander Howden of London in 1982 - have strengthened their European
networks.
A&amp;A was represented in 60 European cities as early as 1989. But Willis's
recent drive has been particularly urgent because of the way the October
1990 merger affected its European links.
The link-up with Corroon &amp; Black ended a century-old relationship with the
US broker, Johnson and Higgins, and a loose alliance of international
brokerage connections, which included Mees Zoonen of Holland, Gras Savoye of
France and Gil &amp; Carvajal of Spain.
Without the funds for big acquisitions, Willis has opted to link with small
and medium-sized brokers or back existing teams of brokers in new ventures.
Willis's strategy means it lacks the weight in some European markets enjoyed
by some of its rivals - especially after the recent acquisitions. Critics
also suggest that its control may be limited in some cases.
Nevertheless there are also advantages. In particular by leaving local
owners and managers with substantial stakes of each subsidiary, Willis feels
it is likely to encourage a more dynamic development.
'By leaving substantial shareholdings with local managers and owners we have
created incentives for people to develop the business nationally,' says Mr
Adrian Gregory, the group director responsible for Europe.
Mr Gregory says the main emphasis has been in building links with brokers
who can help service the group's multinational business.
Willis's lower profile approach will also allow it to develop its existing
relationships with the continent's large reinsurers more sensitively. 'The
network doesn't disturb our existing business connections in reinsurance,'
adds Mr Gregory.
