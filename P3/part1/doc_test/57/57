Costa Mesa resident Jerry Allen Holland, who ended an argument with his wife by 
driving their 2-ton pickup truck over her three times in April, was arrested 
Thursday morning for allegedly beating her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old man was arrested at his home on the 300 block of Ogle Street 
after police received a call from his wife, Lindy Sue Holland, who reported 
that her husband had assaulted her, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Sam Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Holland was being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail on 
suspicion of beating his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Cordeiro said the woman told police that her husband woke her early Thursday 
and started beating her for no apparent reason, which led to the call to 
police. The 33-year-old woman had red, swollen marks on her arms and her left 
ankle, Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
At the couple's home Thursday afternoon, Lindy Holland said she did not want to 
talk about the alleged beating. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very emotional time. . . . I just can't talk about it right 
now," she cried as she retreated into the couple's home on a quiet Costa Mesa 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2 weeks earlier, the woman requested that her husband be released from 
jail after he ran over her with their truck after she refused to give him her 
$400 paycheck, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher P. Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
Kralick declined to say whether Holland would be charged in the latest 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Holland was charged with attempted murder, assault and assault with a deadly 
weapon in the April 19 incident. His wife suffered only cuts and bruises 
because the truck ran mainly over her legs while she was lying flat on the 
ground, Cordeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, however, refused to cooperate in prosecuting Holland on the 
attempted murder charge, Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
"She made it real clear that she was in love with him and they were going to go 
to counseling together," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
Without her cooperation, prosecutors were forced to drop the attempted murder 
charge. Holland then pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was 
sentenced to 3 years' probation by a Harbor Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the circumstances with that case, I felt fortunate that we were able to 
get the probation sentence," Kralick said. "Other situations where spouses 
refuse to cooperate usually get dismissed without a hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Kralick said incidents in which girlfriends or wives stick up for their 
companions happen very often. "We have lots of girlfriends and wives (who) 
refuse to prosecute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And there's a myriad of reasons: "They don't want to go to court. They love the 
man and say it's an isolated occurrence. They say it'll never happen again. Or 
they want to go on with their lives," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the probation sentence, Holland was restricted from contact with his 
wife unless she initiated it. He was ordered not to violate any laws and was 
required to seek counseling and cooperate with his probation officer.
