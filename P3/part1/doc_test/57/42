SHOP STEWARDS at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Fiat and Ford,
decided yesterday to organise selective strike action in an attempt to gain
improvements in a three-year pay offer providing 4 per cent in the first
year, Michael Smith writes.
Mr Dave Vos, convener, would not say what form the action would take or when
it would happen, but on Monday he mentioned the possibility of one-day and
two-day strikes.
The 1,600 manual workers who have been made the offer oppose the duration of
the deal and the company's proposal to introduce temporary workers. Skilled
workers want financial recognition for new responsibilities they say they
have taken on.
Ford New Holland has refused to change its offer.
