Weston's Wagon Wheels - the chocolate - coated, mallow - filled biscuits
beloved of children in the UK - have established a new market: they are now
among the most popular imported biscuits on sale in Russia.
Their manufacturer, Burton's Biscuits, has won a Queen's Award for exports
thanks to a surge in overseas sales in the past three years.
Although Burton's still only exports about a fifth of its Pounds 160m
turnover, its exports have doubled in the past three years and rose by 70
per cent in the past two years.
Burton's claims to be the UK's fastest growing biscuit manufacturer. It is
part of Associated British Foods, which merged with Weston Biscuit company
in 1968. The Weston family are major shareholders in the big milling and
baking group with Mr Garfield Weston chairman.
Burton's products include Jammie Dodgers, Jaffa Cakes, Royal Edinburgh
Shortbread, Rich Tea biscuits and Liquorice Allsorts. It produces its
biscuits and other confectionery in factories at Llantarnam in Gwent, in
Edinburgh and in Blackpool where the business was founded in 1935.
Though based in Bracknell, Berkshire, its export division is based in
Edinburgh. Burton's has invested Pounds 80m in manufacturing equipment in
the past seven years.
According to Mr Ian Gibson, the general manger of the export division, the
company's export efforts focus on Europe. 'We've developed private label
products for food retailers in France and the Netherlands to sell under
their own names, and we also have a branded operation,' he says.
The Nordic countries are good markets for Burton's brands, and its biscuits
sell in Singapore, Australia and North America.
Burton's is a good example of a British manufacturer taking advantage of the
opening up of eastern European markets since the fall of the Berlin wall in
1989.
As well as selling in Russia it has also developed markets in Hungary,
Bulgaria and Slovenia.
