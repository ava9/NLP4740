BRITISH COMPANIES have won a record 127 awards for exports in the latest
Queen's awards for export and technology, which are announced today.
The number of applications for export awards was the highest for 13 years,
reflecting companies' determination to seek new markets while domestic
demand is slow.
Although Britain's biggest enterprises are heavily represented, the winners
include such smaller companies as Fortnum and Mason, the luxury London
retailer, which has opened outlets in Japan since it began its export
department in 1981.
J Barbour and Sons, best known for its outdoor clothing made of oiled
cotton, now sells in 25 markets while Grants of Dalvey has moved on from
bagpipe manufacturing to make sporrans and hip flasks popular in Germany,
Japan and 23 other countries.
The Queen's awards were introduced in 1966. They are made on the advice of
the prime minister helped by a committee which comprises representatives of
industry, commerce, trade unions and the government.
Rolls-Royce won for its sales of aero-engines and British Steel's general
steels division also won an export award. ICI won three awards, two Queen's
awards for technology and one for exporting purification technology.
The smallest winner is Associated Timber Services, with just nine staff.
UK-based Japanese companies which won awards include Nissan Motor, the car
maker, and Yamazaki Machinery, a producer of machine tools. Both export to
Japan.
The BBC won one of 38 technology awards for the development of the Nicam
digital television system, while Portakabin was rewarded for its development
of luxury portable offices.
Electronics and computers dominate the technology awards list. Winners
include IBM and Oxford University - their jointly developed computer
programming language is used by financial services companies - and Oxford
Lasers, whose copper laser is powerful enough to guide telescopes.
