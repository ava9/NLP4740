that Schubert and Janacek have a singing lyricism in common

THE MUSIC side of the festival is starting to get some mileage out of its
Schubert and Janacek theme. Both composers explored some of their most
personal feelings in their chamber music and the morning recitals at the
Queen's Hall are invariably among Edinburgh's rewarding events.
That is certainly how it seemed on Wednesday, when Andras Schiff gave a
programme drawn from the two composers' piano music. In this area, as in
every other, it is the differences between them that seem obvious. Schubert
left his most important work in the piano sonatas, Janacek in freer pieces.
Schubert asked classical forms to shoulder structures of enormous
architectural breadth and power; Janacek's thoughts occur in short, sudden,
immediate bursts.
Out of these extremes Schiff's playing revealed with unexpected clarity one
progression of thought which the two do have in common. Each has a singing
lyricism at his heart, in Schubert derived from song, in Janacek from opera
and his fascination with the sounds and rhythms of human speech; but both
are led by the very intensity of their music to climaxes which are
insistent, forceful, even violent.
Schiff is not a Viennese interpreter of Schubert who sets out to make the
music charm. In the E flat Sonata there was no question of him giving way to
temptation and loosening the rhythms so that they went with a smile and a
popular dance-like lilt. His playing was sensitive, but straight-laced. For
the late, much greater C Minor Sonata he aims for as wide a scale as the
music can bear, taking it from barely-voiced lyrical moments to a fierce
attack on the climaxes. A lack of affection is less of a drawback here and
the performance attained an impressive stature.
His Janacek was the Piano Sonata (other major pieces were to follow on
Friday). Extremes of expression are built into this score, written in the
heat of patriotic rage after a young Czech worker was killed by troops loyal
to the German authorities. Schiff is quick to react, communicating both its
pain and its heartfelt sympathy. For the music of both composers he has
proved the festival's first top-class advocate so far.
It is difficult to say which was missed most the next morning at the Queen's
Hall: Schiff's ability to say exactly what he wants or his ambitions for the
music. The Gould Trio, prizewinners in the UK, Holland and Australia, in
fact lauded round the world, followed him with a mixed programme of Janacek
and Schubert chamber music, including the Czech composer's Violin Sonata and
the Austrian's best-known Piano Trio (in B flat).
There was nothing sub-standard about the way they played any of the items,
but the power of the music had been diluted. In the Schubert Trio phrases
continually asked to stretch, breathe and be filled with expression, but
they went for little. The three musicians, technically very able, well
balanced, with a good sense of style, need to take the next crucial step. Be
daring] - let the power of Schubert's and Janacek's inspiration release
those inhibitions.
