Norbrook Laboratories

The break-up of the former Soviet Union has helped Norbrook Laboratories
break into its furthest - flung market.
The veterinary pharmaceuticals company, based in Newry, Northern Ireland,
now has a good line selling animal antibiotics to Mongolia.
Mr Alan Patterson, deputy managing director, said: 'Mongolia was left in the
lurch by its former Soviet suppliers and we now do significant business with
our range of antibiotics for goats and cattle.'
Such successes have now gained Norbrook its third Queen's Award for Export.
It previously won the award in 1987 and 1990.
Since 1991 Norbrook's export sales have risen by 86 per cent and account for
nearly 85 per cent of turnover.
'Since the last time we won the award in 1990 we have started selling in 22
new countries taking the total number to 95. There are now not many more
countries left,' said Mr Patterson.
Founded in 1969 by Mr Edward Haughey, chairman and managing director,
Norbrook now has 350 staff in Newry, making it the town's largest private
sector employer.
It has a further 50 employees in its overseas offices in the US, Holland and
Kenya.
Mr Patterson said that the company could not survive without exports.
'Research and development is very important and very expensive so we have to
develop products for the global market,' he says.
The company has 44 staff in research and development on which it spends
around 10 per cent of its sales.
Mr Patterson said that recent export growth was based largely on a series of
new products, including Alamycin LA 300, the world's first antibiotic to
give animals cover for six days.
