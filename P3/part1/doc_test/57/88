   IDEAS ARE in the wind for the creation of a new modern art gallery
</DATELINE>

more ambitious than has gone before - to greet the approach of the second
millennium. Here is a modest proposal which might go even further and create
a market for art as well. There should be an art park, a mixture of public
and private interests, stretching across a large part of some already
established international art capital. The aim would be to bring artists,
collectors, sellers and buyers more closely together. The idea is developed
later in the article, but first some background.
The underlying thesis - impossible to prove conclusively, but even harder to
refute - is that demand for art will always exceed supply. You can see that
in many ways. At the top end of the market Christie's can still sell a
Titian for nearly Pounds 7.5m in spite of the recession. New galleries
continue to open in different areas as recession hits the more traditional
establishments. The paintings and drawings strung along the railings of
London's Hyde Park on Sundays are a sign that interest is always there.
Demand for viewing art, rather than buying it, also goes on rising. Official
figures are not up-to-date, but show that the number of visitors to the main
national museums and galleries in London went up from 10.3m in 1979 to 12.1m
a decade later. Figures from the Policy Studies Institute suggest much
higher increases in some of the regions. Anecdotal evidence would include
the high attendance at the small, selective Manet Exhibition 'The Execution
of Maximilian' at the National Gallery and the Magritte Exhibition at the
Hayward. Others can supply their own evidence from Paris or New York, and
note that where admission is free, not everyone is counted.
Almost anything to do with art has a tendency to arouse public passions. The
long-running dispute over the rights and wrongs of museum charges is one
example. Another is the perennial argument over whether privately-owned
paintings which come up for sale should be 'saved for the nation', and how.
A new dispute has broken out over proposals by Nicholas Serota, gallery
director, to split the Tate collection into foreign and British works.
At first sight, this outline of rising public interest fits ill with the
reports of falling profits and turnover at the main auction houses of
Sotheby's and Christie's and the closure or financial difficulties of a
growing number of private galleries in London's West End. There is clearly a
price adjustment under way, but I suggest a deeper explanation: the demand
is there, but the supply side isn't working.
In broad terms, art holdings fall into the following categories:
museums or other official institutions, such as churches and palaces;
private galleries, which exhibit, buy and sell;
corporate collections held, for example, by Pearson, Reuter and Robert
Fleming;
private collections, some of which are on show or on loan to exhibitions;
random private holdings, mainly inherited, but sometimes bought ad hoc and
occasionally a gift from the artist or a friendly gesture of encouragement
by purchase.
Leaving aside the right of an individual to collect and hold whatever piece
of art he or she chooses, provided it is legally acquired, all those
categories have their deficiencies.
The problem of museums is well-documented. Essentially they hold more than
they can show. Recall the story of the Corots in the Louvre - kept in an
upstairs gallery and only brought to wider attention when exhibited
elsewhere in Paris. The same could be said about Britain's Turners. The Tate
can only show about one quarter of its collection at any time.
The problem of private galleries, certainly in central London, is not
dissimilar from that of other businesses in a recession. They may carry
excessive overheads, be in the wrong place, open at the wrong times and be
inaccessible to a new public. There is no reason why new galleries should
not open elsewhere in line with the earlier revolution in the retail trade.
Some have already done so.
Corporate collections are a much under-studied and under-catalogued subject.
Suffice it to say that some companies have made a point of collecting art
and do not know what to with it.
Private holdings are, of course, a private matter. Yet, it is striking in
major shows that so many of the exhibits come from private collections or
simply private owners. In the big Magritte exhibition at the Hayward, more
than half the works fell into that category. Of the 108 paintings in the
Allan Ramsay exhibition at this year's Edinburgh Festival, more than 30 were
from private owners. There were 76 exhibits in the same festival's 'Dutch
Art and Scotland'; 34 were privately held. Sometimes the owners are willing
to be identified; sometimes, not. In the two Edinburgh cases cited, a
majority withheld their names. The Queen lent to both.
It is also clear from social observation that a sizeable number of people
have works of art which, although they may not amount to a collection, are
interesting or possibly valuable in their own right. Often the potential
value was not and could not have been known when the piece was acquired.
More of these private owners might like to have their paintings shown; some
might like to consider selling.
In theory, the auction firms exist as a clearing house when art changes
hands. Yet one doubts how far they are an adequate means of developing a
wider and more active market. Witness, by contrast, the success of The
Guardian's 'Art for Sale' which puts artists in touch with potential buyers.
The newspaper has found that it can hardly cope with demand: sellers and
buyers rate it highly.
It is the peculiar mix of public and private ownership that makes art
different from other commodities. If there is to be a greater movement in
the market - more on show, more to sell and more to buy - there will have to
be some rearrangement of public and private interests. This is germane to
the question of a new modern art gallery and underlines the need to be
ambitious. Where should it be and how should it be run?
The location will make sense only if it is close to, and can evolve from, an
existing international art centre where museums, galleries, auction houses,
a viewing and a buying public are already part of the tradition. It will
also require space - masses of it. As it happens, there is an obvious
candidate: London.
By the standards of Paris, Rome or even parts of New York, London is not the
most beautiful metropolis in the world, but it does have one superb, large
and conveniently empty site. It stretches, with only a few obstacles, from
St James's Park, Green Park, through Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and,
pushing it only a bit, on to Holland Park. It is already ringed with
galleries, small and large, public, private and royal. The Queen's
paintings, now partly open to the public, are nearby. The Royal Academy
almost faces Green Park. There are some splendid galleries in the Mall, and
the Royal College of Art looks on to Kensington Gardens. On Sundays the
surroundings are full of artists peddling their wares.
The great bulk of the parkland is untouched but not immune. There is the odd
Henry Moore, the greatly under-used and under-ambitious Serpentine Gallery
in the middle, and a few tiny galleries in and around Holland Park at the
western end. In between there is the supreme prize of Kensington Palace
which, with official permission, could be turned into a major gallery in its
own right - almost the hub of the concept.
Someone would have to co-ordinate the project, so let me define it more
closely. A new gallery of modern art is too small a definition. A more
accurate term would be a modern gallery of art, containing old as well, and
not just one gallery but a string of them, indoors as well as out (for
sculptures and itinerant artists). It would combine exhibiting and selling.
That is why, however infelicitous, I have chosen the term art park.
The co-ordinator would be appointed by the government. He or she would
require wide powers - a bit like those for the opening up of Docklands.
There would have to be co-operation with all sorts of bodies: the Queen (if
Kensington Palace is to be secured), the local authorities, the trustees of
existing museums who like to keep art rather than trade it. Some, although
not many, new buildings will be needed. There might be a gallery to show
corporate collections, and perhaps a place for private owners to exhibit
their holdings. Smaller galleries could proliferate - as to some extent they
have - in the areas round about.
To help the co-ordinator, there must be a company in this country capable of
running a theme park, and leasing galleries as franchises.
There may also have to be changes in the law: some are on the way. Just
before the last general election, Tim Renton, then arts minister, put
through Parliament the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 which empowers the
Tate to sell paintings and sculptures from its existing collection. Renton
would have liked the Act to have gone further and extended to the National
Gallery, but it is at least a start.
The power to dispose does not, of course, rule out the power to acquire. On
the contrary, the change in the law helps to create a market and provides
greater freedom for gallery directors.
I have deliberately said nothing in this article about the aesthetics of
art: that is a matter of taste and fashion. Nor have I mentioned public
funding: there is no reason to suppose that what I suggest would cost much
additional money. It is more a question of better co-ordination and a change
in attitudes. The opening up of a market would help artists and purchasers
alike.
The timing is ripe: not only the approach of the millennium, but the
creation of the ministry of national heritage, which has been given an
empire but not yet found a role. Should the area around the Serpentine prove
too small, there are others available. Why not put paintings and sculptures
in Regent's Park as the animals depart from the zoo? There could be no
clearer acknowledgement of changing tastes. Renton has thoughts about
Butler's Wharf, in London, where there is space aplenty, then on into
Docklands.
One final thought: if London does not take up the idea, somewhere someone
else will. The outstanding candidate is Berlin, which has lots of money,
lots of space, lots of art, and masses of ambition. Must the Germans lead?
