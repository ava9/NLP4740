LLOYDS Chemists, the acquisitive UK retailer which took over its rival
Macarthy in March, increased pre-tax profit by 78 per cent, from Pounds
20.8m to Pounds 36.9m, in the year to June.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 509.4m, from Pounds 247.5m, as the
group added in Macarthy for three months, a maiden Pounds 53m from its
wholesale operation, and the expansion of its health food and drug store
chains.
The share price shed 10p yesterday to close at 202p.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said acquisitions had added
more than Pounds 3m to profit. The figures also benefited from a full year
from the 1990-91 acquisitions, notably Kingswood chemists' and Holland &amp;
Barrett health food stores.
Like-for-like growth was 9 per cent in the chemists' shops; 4 per cent in
the drug stores; and zero in health food, turned round during the year.
Operating profit advanced by 66 per cent to Pounds 40.1m as the group
absorbed the lower-margin Macarthy businesses, including the Savory &amp; Moore
chemists' chain, and expanded its Barclay Enterprise wholesale wing.
The full-year impact of the Kingswood-linked rights issue and the shares for
more recent purchases held the advance in fully diluted earnings per share
to 20 per cent: from 20.96p to 25.05p. The total dividend rises by 33 per
cent to 5.55p after a 4p final.
Mr Lloyd said the figures included a Pounds 2m provision for the NHS-imposed
cut in generic drug prices. In the current year, this would cost Pounds
6m-Pounds 8m.
The sales breakdown showed the chemist division, with the highest margins,
increasing from Pounds 190m to Pounds 314m. Drug stores contributed Pounds
62.9m, up from Pounds 51m, and Holland &amp; Barrett, up to Pounds 46.8m from
Pounds 6.5m. Operating profit from these three rose from Pounds 26.1m to
Pounds 39.2m.
Wholesale and manufacturing, a new division, made Pounds 3.4m profit on
Pounds 83.1m turnover. Property again contributed Pounds 1.1m.
Interest costs were little changed at Pounds 3.3m and net debt rose to
Pounds 20.9m, compared with Pounds 5.5m cash, debt-equity gearing of 22 per
cent.
Mr Dick Steele, finance director, said more than Pounds 40m had been spent
on acquisitions, mostly on debt taken on in the process.
