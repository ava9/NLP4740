FT  04 MAY 93 / NatWest to launch German storecard

NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to introduce the storecard to Germany as part
of a fresh expansion by British financial services companies into
continental Europe.
The bank is setting up an operation to offer retailers the credit cards
under its Comfort brand, which operates in Holland and Belgium, it said
yesterday. The establishment of NatWest's German card company is expected to
employ about 300 people by 1997.
Although banks have been hit by high provisions against bad debts in
operations such as mortgage lending in France and Spain, they are keen to
offer British products such as store credit cards in markets where they are
less known.
NatWest said yesterday that the use of store credit cards, now the dominant
means of buying consumer durables such as washing machines and freezers in
the UK, had not yet developed in Germany, or some other European countries.
Mr John Morgan, marketing director of the personal finance operation of
NatWest's Lombard North Central finance house subsidiary, said the bank had
already received expressions of interest from some 3,000 German retailers.
NatWest will not charge German retailers for providing their branded credit
cards. Although the store's name appears on cards, the bank lends money and
makes interest charges on the amount borrowed, as well as assessing risks.
German retailers have until now relied on generic credit cards such as
MasterCard and Visa as well as debit cards. The transaction charges paid by
retailers each time one of these cards is used have acted as a disincentive.
NatWest said it was forming a venture called Comfort Card GMBH, based in
Dusseldorf. A similar operation opened in Holland in 1985 is used in 6,000
retail outlets, while NatWest opened a branch office in Belgium last year.
Mr Morgan said the bank had carefully researched the risks of bad debt in
Germany, and concluded that consumers were 'cautious about the way they
spend their money, and prudent in the need to repay what is borrowed'.
He said NatWest might extend branded cards to other EC countries.
