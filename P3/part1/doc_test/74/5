Tally up another kudo for the indefatigable Benny Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old composer/saxophonist/trumpeter, who just last week was in New 
York to conduct his orchestra at the "Hearts for Ella" American Heart Assn. 
benefit at Avery Fisher Hall, is one of 18 jazz artists, and the sole Los 
Angeles resident, to receive a grant from the 1989 Meet the 
Composer/Rockefeller Foundation/AT&amp;T Jazz Program. 
</P>
<P>
The grants, which total $283,000 and were announced recently, pair the 
composers with a sponsoring music and performing arts organization for which 
the composers create original works and then serve as artists-in-residence to 
oversee the work's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the results of these creative collaborations, and to 
continuing our support of Meet the Composer in this initiative to stimulate 
exchanges between jazz composers and artists working in other art forms," 
stated Alberta Arthurs, director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Arts and 
Humanities Division, in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1989, was awarded $15,000 
to write two 20-minute pieces to feature vibraphonists Lionel Hampton and Milt 
Jackson. The commissions, sponsored by the Lincoln Center of the Performing 
Arts in New York, will be debuted at a later, unscheduled date with the 
16-piece Classical Jazz Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Other recipients included pianist Billy Taylor, who will write a 15-20 minute 
work to be performed by his trio and the Juilliard String Quartet on a national 
tour; saxophonist Julius Hemphill, who will concoct a 45-minute work for IMP 
ORK, a 30-piece improvisational orchestra, also to be performed nationally; 
guitarist Kenny Burrell, who is currently appearing at the Indigo Jazz Club in 
Compton, who will write a work featuring the Boys Choir of Harlem; and pianist 
Stanley Cowell, who will compose a 15-20 minute jazz piano concerto to be 
performed with the Toledo (Ohio) Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Composer was founded in 1974 to foster the creation, performance and 
recording of works by contemporary American composers and to develop new 
audiences for these works. The group sponsors over 4,000 such performances a 
year. Information: (212) 787-3601.

Carter, whose latest LP is "Cookin' at Carlos 1" (Musicmasters), can be heard 
leading a superlative mainstream band -- pianist Hank Jones, bassist Ray Brown 
and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and singer Sylvia Sims are among the members -- 
on NPR's American Jazz Radio Festival, which airs locally on KLON-FM (88.1), 
March 2, 10 p.m. The group plays such Carter classics as "Key Largo" and "Easy 
Money."

The International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation (IOAJA) has kicked off its third 
annual "Jazz Goes to School," a seven-week program that brings jazz and jazz 
history to students in Los Angeles elementary and junior high schools. 
Conceived and conducted by drummer Washington Rucker, JGTS utilizes various 
musicians to demonstrate subjects such as "The Blues," "Boogie Woogie &amp; 
Swing to Be-Bop" and "The Future of Jazz" to enthusiastic youngsters at schools 
that included La Salle Elementary, Foshay Junior High and 54th Street 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is really progressing and each year we increase the size and the 
scope of it," said Ruth Roby, IOAJA's executive director. "And the kids love 
it. The letters we get from them are incredible. A lot of them say things like, 
'We thought jazz would be old folk's music, but we like it.' And we get high 
praise from teachers and principals as to what it does for the children." 
Information: (213) 469-5589.
