</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's jazz scene isn't out of adolescence yet, but it sprouted a few 
whiskers and grew to nearly full height in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Low wages, a shortage of club work for local players and the demise of some key 
clubs kept the scene wobbly despite its longer legs, but overall, jazz was 
bigger and stronger. Among the signs of new maturity: 
</P>
<P>
* Elario's was reborn under the guidance of San Diego Jazz Festival founder Rob 
Hagey, who began mixing young lions in with the club's usual lineup of veteran 
jazz stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
* All That Jazz opened in Rancho Bernardo, and talent coordinator Tony Sidotti 
helped both the new club and the Horton Grand Hotel downtown expand their 
horizons to include such nationally known acts as Jimmy and Stacy Rowles, 
Milcho Leviev, Bill Mays and Barney Kessel. 
</P>
<P>
* The Jazz Link, the San Diego-based jazz monthly, celebrated its second 
birthday in May, added correspondents in Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; 
Portland, Ore.; Denver, and Chattanooga, Tenn., and expanded its readership to 
47 states as well as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, England and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
* After a few false starts, KIFM (98.1) has a solid Sunday night straight-ahead 
jazz program. New host Ron Galon just might expand the horizons of the 
station's light jazz audience. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Jazz Party in February and the Thanksgiving Dixieland festival 
in Mission Valley brought traditional jazz to large numbers of fans. 
</P>
<P>
* Croce's in downtown San Diego continued to present jazz twice a day, seven 
days a week, making it the leader in local live jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Of course growth didn't come without growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
As Elario's showcased more young, rising talents who 
</P>
<P>
wanted to bring their own bands, top locals such as drummer Jim Plank and 
bassist Bob Magnusson worked less at Elario's and had to look elsewhere to fill 
some nights. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of jazz jams at Kelly's Pub, the Salmon House and Croce's meant 
fewer chances for young players to test themselves against the pros, and for 
established locals to get together just for fun once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
The Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach and Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach 
discontinued jazz after struggling for months to build audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Diego's Loft may come back in 1991. Famed clarinetist Bobby Gordon hopes to 
work the room occasionally. And the Beach House's tiny bar may try jazz again 
next summer, but as of last summer, wasn't drawing enough people to support 
appearances by a variety of locals and talented out-of-towners including Denver 
pianist-vocalist Ellyn Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
What were the year's top performances? 
</P>
<P>
* Etta James, bold and bawdy at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, gave one of the 
most soulful performances during the summer concert series which generally 
leans toward middle-of-the-road light jazz and pop. 
</P>
<P>
* Chico Freeman brought his hip and gritty New York licks to Elario's, where he 
was equally at home on sax and flute. 
</P>
<P>
* Plus several hot performances by rising jazz stars at Elario's, including 
those by guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Michel Camilo (with former San Diegan 
Cliff Almond on drums), saxophonist Christopher Hollyday and pianist Marcus 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Keiko Matsui took top honors in the overexposure category. Earlier 
in the year, she played the Sunday jazz series at Culbertson's Winery in 
Temecula, and in the fall, made almost back-to-back appearances at the Michelob 
Street Scene and Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative modes of jazz, however, didn't have many outlets in 1990. The Ruse 
Performance Gallery, which recently moved from space in the Gaslamp Quarter to 
the Marquis Public Theatre, presented some of the few performances by 
cutting-edge jazz groups including the Rova Saxophone Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians Local 325 found itself fighting for respect as many jazz players 
chose not to join. Many feel that the union doesn't offer enough in exchange 
for the $78 annual dues; the union will attempt to improve its image by opening 
its own booking agency in January. 
</P>
<P>
While KIFM's repertoire expanded with Galon's Sunday night show, KSDS-FM 
(88.3), San Diego's only full-time jazz station, continued presenting a rich 
mix of music, events and special programs, most notably the seven-part radio 
biography of Miles Davis (it also aired on KPBS-FM). 
</P>
<P>
KSDS jock "T" celebrated his seventh anniversary as host of "Every Shade of 
Blue," the Saturday blues program. Longtime San Diego radio personality Rod 
Page, the self-dubbed "Golden Page of Music," joined KSDS with a Sunday 
afternoon show, and former KSDS jocks Christine Reeves and Ron Dhanifu returned 
to the fold with shows Sundays and Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV taped 11 new "Club Date" programs during its 1990 fiscal year, bringing 
the total number of shows to more than 25. New shows featured Hank Jones, Buddy 
Collette, Mundell Lowe and, in a departure from the the usual straight-ahead 
fare, fusion keyboardist Rob Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS will make six new programs in 1991, beginning with tapings of Jeannie and 
Jimmy Cheatham and the Sweet Baby Blues Band Jan. 6 and saxophonist Frank 
Morgan Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Collegiate jazz in San Diego jumped on the national map when the San Diego 
State University Jazz Ensemble's CD "Don't Make Noise!" received three out of a 
possible five stars in the December issue of Downbeat, with special praise 
going to alto saxophonists Colin Mason and Art Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Gretchen Geib brought good jazz to San Diegans through their Society 
for Straight-ahead Jazz, including a rare performance by former John Coltrane 
bassist Art Davis at Diego's Loft, and another by guitarist and former Padre 
Eric Show in a quintet also featuring local saxman Gary LeFevre, which drew 270 
people to the Salmon House. 
</P>
<P>
Summer outdoor jazz was more available than ever, led by the city of Carlsbad's 
series of nine concerts at neighborhood parks. Who could forget avant-garde 
saxophonist Turiya's performance? In shorts and sunglasses, she looked like a 
tourist as she delivered driving jazz to moms, pops and kids on a warm summer's 
eve with the group Kokopelli.
