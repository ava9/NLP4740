SCOFIELD MIXES IT UP WITH MASTERY

John Scofield, the guitarist who played with Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham and 
Jay McShann, among others, before coming of age with Miles Davis in the early 
1980s, brought his trio to the Catalina Bar and Grill. 
</P>
<P>
An infrequent visitor to the Southland, Scofield was greeted on the first night 
of his weekend gig with enthusiasm by a sparse crowd at the Hollywood night 
club. Considering the man's talents, the place should have been packed to the 
rafters. Working with bassist Anthony Cox and drummer John Riley, Scofield 
presented a set that mixed his own compositions with those of the standard jazz 
repertoire. In each instance, Scofield's technical mastery was matched by his 
musicianly approach. 
</P>
<P>
Though a trio setting for any soloist can pose problems, this one didn't for 
Scofield. Bassist Cox, whose solos were quite imaginative, played a larger part 
in quelling any sense of emptiness in the group's sound with his full sound and 
powerful harmonic structuring. So, too, did drummer Riley help fill any gaps 
with his "brush fire" of rhythmic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield plays with a purposely distorted but attractively full sound, while 
never disguising his melodic or harmonic intent. His illustrious musical 
background provided him with an eclectic approach that, on "All the Things You 
Are," for instance, had him starting in a be-bop mode before finding a raucous 
and bluesy midsection that would have delighted Jimi Hendrix fans. He returned 
to be-bop with liberal "From Thelonious Monk." 
</P>
<P>
Though his music is enough to recommend Scofield to anyone interested in jazz, 
his presentation will disappoint those looking to be entertained. Hunched over 
his guitar, his level of seriousness is that of an artist -- not of a nightclub 
performer.A. JAMES LISKA
