BILL BRUFORD: MARCHING TO BEAT OF HIS OWN DRUM;

Bill Bruford doesn't have to worry about traveling to the beat of a different 
drummer: the evolutionary English percussionist's own approach to rhythm will 
do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt it was unnecessary to try and cover the work that other 
drummers are doing so brilliantly," Bruford, 40, said. "Maybe my time would be 
better spent trying to find something that other drummers don't do and see if 
that proves fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford, who brings his Earthworks band to the Strand in Redondo Beach tonight, 
has long espoused the philosophy that drummers should also reach beyond being 
mere rhythm players and stretch into the areas of harmony and melody as well. 
</P>
<P>
Putting his money on the line, Bruford -- known to pop fans for his work with 
Yes, King Crimson and, most recently ex-Yes men Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and 
Howe -- plays the Simmons SDX. The SDX is a state-of-the-art electronic drum 
set that through a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) can be linked to 
a multitude of other electronic instruments. This set-up allows access to 
sounds previously only heard in a drummer's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play all kinds of exotic things from the sounds of Africa and Latin 
America to cowbells and gongs or notes and chords. It even sounds like drums 
sometimes, too," said the musician who led the fusion band Bruford, with 
guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bassist Jeff Berlin, from 1978-80. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of on the extreme edge of what a drummer does. I keep a kind of 
pulse, but it's very melodic as well. I come up with very intriguing percussion 
figures and chords that can be jumped on by the guys in the band." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford's melodies are usually played on a Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer, which is 
MIDI-ed to his drums. "The keyboards are triggered from the drum pads," he 
explained, "and by hitting the pads at varying velocities, and in different 
positions, you get a different sound." 
</P>
<P>
Reflective of Bruford's singular way of making music is Earthworks, a quartet 
with Iain Bellamy, saxes, Django Bates, E Flat tenor horn and keyboards and Tim 
Harries, bass. The band's most recent LP is "Dig?" (Editions EG) and has 
everything from avant-garde edgy numbers to serene ballads dappled with 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our music is unstructured, but it's definitely jazz," he said. "We 
actually play quite carefully, though in a sloppy kind of way, limiting 
ourselves to what we feel is effective rather than just wasting notes." 
</P>
<P>
The leader finds the blending of acoustic and electronic sounds appealing. 
"Electronics don't have to be harsh," he said. "We're looking for a warm sound, 
one that provides an entertaining and refreshing kind of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford, Bellamy and Bates have been together for almost five years; Harries 
joined in 1988. That length of time has provided a closeness and musical acuity 
that leads to exhilarating performances, Bruford said. "I'm still a believer in 
groups that don't change personnel often, because when you know each other, you 
can get spills, chills and cliff-hanging accidents. You have the opportunity to 
take risks and know that if you make a mess, somebody will be there to clear up 
the pieces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruford feels he's making some of the best music of his 20-year career, thanks 
in good part to his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"With these musicians, I can detach myself and thoroughly enjoy being at the 
gig of which I'm the drummer. I can also play less. I'm old enough now to 
realize you don't have to do the history of drumming in each tune." 
</P>
<P>
The native of Kent, England, began drumming as a preteen, playing a pair of 
brushes his sister gave him. As a teen-ager, he was enthralled by the swing and 
Dixieland drummers he saw on television but they were nothing compared to 
hearing saxophonist Graham Bond's R&amp;B/jazz band, with bassist Jack Bruce 
and guitarist John McLaughlin, in person. "That group absolutely branded me for 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Though jazz-influenced, Bruford first opted to play in rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock was the exciting place to be in London in 1968-69, much more exciting 
than jazz, which was asleep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's exactly the opposite. Jazz, without all the rules and regulations 
with which it was once encumbered, is infinitely more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his prominence in percussion circles, Bruford tends to look upon 
himself with a stern eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not terribly keen on myself as a musician," he said. "I have that classic 
British middle-class inability to pretend I'm any good at anything much. I feel 
that at any moment somebody might point a finger at me and say, "You're a 
charlatan." 
</P>
<P>
"Half the time I think anybody could do what I do, then I realize that anybody 
isn't doing it and I feel better again." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, music helps Bruford get a clearer view of who and what he is. 
</P>
<P>
"I see music as a mirror," he said. "I can look at myself performing and say 
that though I might not like what I see, at least that's what I am and I have 
an opportunity for changing myself at that point. That change can be both 
personal and with those around me."
