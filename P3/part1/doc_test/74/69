SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SWEETS EDISON BRINGS HIS SOLID 
REPUTATION TO S.D.

Trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, who opened at Elario's Wednesday night, 
cemented his already formidable reputation during the '40s as a featuring 
soloist with the Count Basie Orchestra. Rooted in the swing of the '30s and 
'40s, Edison's solos made such classic Basie tunes as "Panassie Stomp," "Jive 
at Five," "Shorty George," "Texas Shuffle" and "Moten Swing." 
</P>
<P>
After Basie disbanded his group in 1950, Edison went on to work with most of 
the greats of jazz: Lester Young, Barney Kessel, Lionel Hampton, Ben Webster, 
Johnny Hodges, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Williams, Joe 
Turner, Oscar Peterson. As a studio musician in the '50s, he backed top singers 
including Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
Edison is best known for the sound from which he gets his nickname, an approach 
which stresses subtle phrasings and the tasteful use of silences to enhance the 
power of his lines. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's through Sunday, he will be joined by Sherman Ferguson on drums, 
Marshall Hawkins on bass and Bob Hamilton on piano. 
</P>
<P>
When Anna and Steve Ball were married, he gave her an 1890s-vintage Rinaldi 
violin from Italy for her left hand instead of an engagement ring. That says 
something about the couple's priorities. Soon after, they formed a string 
quartet and named it Rinaldi -- after the violin. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later, the group has evolved an eclectic approach to music that 
blurs the boundaries between jazz, rock and 
</P>
<P>
classical music. Their performances are built around Steve Ball's 
reconstructions of everything from be-bop to the Beatles and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz patron Bob Geib thinks they're jazzy enough to be included in his 
jazz-oriented "Innovations in Modern Music" series at Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach, which opened with Peter Sprague and Steve Kujala on March 31 and closes 
with former John Coltrane bassist Dr. Art Davis on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Rinaldi String Quartet appears this Saturday night, April 14, at 8. Harpist 
Marian Rian Hays, percussionist Richard Steiger and flutist Lori Bell will add 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Balls on violins, the group includes cellist Jennifer Holson and 
violist Karen Elaine. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, all are classically trained, but they all appreciate several 
brands of music. Steve Ball has even played electric violin in rock bands. 
After years of focusing on classical music, the group's true personality began 
to emerge, Anna Ball recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"We did start out with classical and pop, but we realized our audiences liked 
rock and jazz. We started doing in concerts the arrangements we usually just 
played on our own. Peter Gabriel's 'Big Time,' for example." 
</P>
<P>
It takes some getting used to, hearing violins interpret the melody shouted out 
by Gabriel in the original, but Ball's delicate re-working makes you appreciate 
the complexities of rock music like Gabriel's. 
</P>
<P>
Ball discovered that Dizzy Gillespie's "A Night in Tunisia" and the Jefferson 
Airplane's "3/5 of a Mile in Ten Seconds" share chord changes, so he 
superimposed them in an arrangement for the quartet. The result has haunting 
echoes of both bop and Haight Ashbury. 
</P>
<P>
These songs, plus Dave Grusin's "Anasazi," a Beatles medley and David 
LaFlamme's "Don and Dewey," originally recorded by It's a Beautiful Day, will 
all be in the lineup Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the San Diego Jazz Festival and the San Diego Jazz Society are 
vying for shares of the money raised by San Diego's hotel room tax, which last 
year amounted to $5.2 million. The city Commission for Arts and Culture will 
make funding recommendations regarding this year's 84 applicants in May or 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The festival wants $15,000 to produce 10 jazz shows, but its application came 
in after the Jan. 22 deadline, according to a source at the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, late filing eliminates groups from the running, but the festival 
filed an appeal just after the noon deadline March 22. The appeal was 
subsequently denied by the arts commission but the City Council's Public 
Services and Safety Committee has the option of overturning the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz society, which recently closed its three-concert "Salute to the 
Masters" series with a concert by trumpeter Snooky Young with the San Diego 
State University Jazz Ensemble, wants $29,500, up from $12,800 last year. 
(Because of an illness, the festival's application was also late last year, and 
the group received no money). The jazz society proposes to present four "name" 
jazz acts next year, instead of this year's three, expand its free public jazz 
concerts program from three to four dates and add a program of live jazz in 
city libraries.
