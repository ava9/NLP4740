For several years Cuban bands and musicians such as Irakere, Gonzalo
Rubalcaba, Arturo Sandoval and Paquito D'Rivera have visited Britain and
Europe. Without exception their impact had been explosive. The big band
sound of the 12-piece Irakere, the technical mastery of pianist Rubalcaba,
the stratospheric gymnastics of trumpeter Sandoval and the hot-as-chili
alto-sax of D'Rivera have widened the ears of local audiences, notably at
Ronnie Scott's Club.
The link between the club and Cuban music since the mid-1980s has burgeoned
to such an extent that this year's international jazz festival in Havana was
jointly presented by the club in the persons of Scott and his partner Pete
King, in association with the Cuban Institute of Music.
King had sensed a deterioration in production at the last Cuban jazz
festival and promptly offered to co-produce this year's and guarantee the
necessary finance to attract international artists. Thus the sign in the
large courtyard of the Casa de Cultura, where the main concerts were held,
proclaimed: 'Ronnie Scott's Salutes Havana Latin Jazz Festival '93.'
Inevitably Irakere, this year celebrating its 20th anniversary, has featured
heavily, its pulsating Cuban rhythms never failing to stir the thousand-plus
Cubans into swaying, writhing activity in the cramped but atmospheric
open-air venue which sadly lacked dancing space. But it soon became clear to
visitors that Contemporary Cuban Music, whether labelled Latin jazz, salsa
or even rock-salsa, falls into two distinct compartments: the more
traditional, mainly acoustic sounds exemplified by bands like Irakere, and
the smaller groups with their emphasis on electronics and ugly-sounding
guitars to the detriment of the music's natural rhythms.
In the latter category was Cuarto Espacio which became a focal point mainly
because of its remarkable 19-year-old drummer, known simply as Jimmy, whose
multi-rhythm patterns, astonishing speed and power left audiences and
musicians gasping. A similarly rock-infested sextet, Perspectiva, paid
tribute to Miles Davis and also bowed in the direction of one of the
visiting British musicians with Song for Jim Mullen, not surprisingly
composed by the group's guitarist.
Keyboardist Pucho Lopez led a band which played what was described as
'avant-garde jazz-fusion,' a tag sufficient to dismay and alienate me but
which, like so many of the larger units, had an impressive front line, here
two saxes, trumpet and trombone. The sextet Diakara showed a strong African
influence with its accent on chants and repetitive rhythmic figures, which
were a reminder that repeated musical phrases and lyrics can become boring
to European listeners.
Of the larger bands, Bobby Carcasses and Afrojazz presented another aspect
of Cuban music. Leader Carcasses plays flugel-horn, sings, scats and on his
sung Summertime was accompanied solely by a dancer. Later he played what
looked like an ordinary rhomboid hollow box but which was a Cuban quinto, a
rhythm instrument developed from the African slit-drum.
The strong influence of rock on salsa was fiercely illustrated at one of the
concerts at the Karl Marx Theatre featuring singer Jackelin Castellanos and
the group JB. The band was of such ear-damaging power that it, and the
grossly over-amplified, distorted voice of the attractive but unintelligible
Castellanos, forced me to the aural safety of the back row of the upper,
upper circle. This was also the best position to appreciate the other band
of the evening, Elio Reve and his Charangon of Cuba. Reve, a genial,
white-suited veteran of the local scene, leads his band from the back on
timbales. His front line had four trombones plus three singers and the
disappointingly small audience was soon dancing in the stalls.
After so much enthusiasm it was bizarre to hear no applause between numbers
nor at the end of the concert, when the theatre curtain descended slowly on
the still-playing musicians - yet another side of the tradition of Cuban
music.
Illustrious American visitors, all of whom have played at Ronnie Scott's,
added extra quality to the week-long fiesta. The flamboyant
vibraphonist/singer Roy Ayers was a predictable favourite with his visual,
show-bizzy sets. Fluent, powerful tenor-saxist Chico Freeman, guesting with
several groups including Irakere, played a memorable 90 minutes with the
quartet of Chucho Valdes, Irakere's leader. But undemonstrative singer Irene
Reid, with her rich, bluesy voice, large ear-rings, tinted glasses and
visual proof that she was really enjoying herself, was almost certainly the
hit of Havana.
Amid all this vibrancy and excitement were the British bands: Ronnie Scott's
sextet, Andy Sheppard In Co-Motion and the Jim Mullen quartet. Their
polished but mainly introspective jazz lacked the essential outwardness of
the other bands and one pondered why they were chosen for Cuba. Lesser known
but more extrovert British groups could have been more suitable for a
festival where the most important qualifications for performers are rhythm,
heart and soul.
As well as late night sessions in various venues in Havana, there were
workshops, video shows and a photo exhibition in which British photographer
David Redfern was an exhibitor. Most of Havana's hotels have small bands of
varying quality playing the island's music and the lasting impression a
visitor takes away is of a throbbing, musical capital. Oh, those
percussionists] And those trumpeters with that distinct Cuban sound] Even at
the superlative Tropicana night-club the 20-plus band backing the singers,
dancers and speciality acts, sent a thrill down the spine with its
hard-blowing, precision playing.
In two years a lot can happen in jazz as in politics, and February 1995 is
the next chance to savour the sounds of hot Cuban music at the source in
festival conditions. Start saving now]
