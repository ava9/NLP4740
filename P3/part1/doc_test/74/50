There was a time when jazz music was easily identified by its
instrumentation, syncopation or its nervy improvisation. But contemporary
music has become harder to label and today's venn diagram of jazz contains a
perplexing number and diversity of sets. From hiphop to hardcore and new
music to world music, everybody wants a piece of jazz and jazz wants a bit
of everybody else. But if the argument over whether the interchange dilutes
or strengthens the jazz tradition is as long and circular as an Evan Parker
soprano solo, what is certain is that festival programmers have an ever
widening spectrum of possibilities from which to choose.
The London Jazz Festival, which winds down this weekend, has ranged from
scientific abstraction to the loping riddim of reggae via explosive fusion
and the effing and blinding of rap. Yet one of the highpoints of the week
has been provided by the (rare) appearance of jazz music's master of
understatement, US guitarist Jim Hall. Ever the thinking musician's
guitarist, Hall has achieved a modest cult following for his quiet communion
with pianist Bill Evans, clarinettist Paul Desmond and the swaying reeds of
Jimmy Giuffre.
Joined on the altar of Islington's Union Chapel by the choice chords of
pianist Larry Goldings, Hall unfolded a succession of exquisitely fragile
arrangements that bound together beautifully with the minimum volume. 'This
next one,' he said to the sound of pins dropping, 'is a stretched out blues
with some funny notes in it.' So subdued and spacious was Hall's delivery
that applause for delicacies like 'Some Day' and 'My Funny Valentine' seemed
intrusive. His more swinging originals featured devastating technique and
razor rhythm delivered with similar nonchalance.
In stark contrast to Jim Hall's effortless enchantment of his audience,
pouting Brazilian salsa queen Tania Maria put a great deal of energy into
dissipating the electricity generated by an excitable crowd at The Forum in
Kentish Town the following night. Somewhat exposed at the keyboards
(electric and acoustic) in a trio alongside bassist Eddie Gomez and
percussionist Don Alias, Maria's hamfisted attempts at crowd control were
enervating. An early attempt to enjoin the party crowd in a clapalong
session failed when it became clear that Maria herself was unsure of the
time signature. Poor Gomez and Alias stuck doggedly to their groove as Maria
splintered chords and wailed hideously into the wraparound mike. At the
controls of a large and fast moving band, Maria's fiery fusion of Brazilian
dance music and jazz can be exhilarating; uncut it is more like salsa hell.
The four trombones (one a bass), three trumpets and various reeds of John
Surman's Brass Project provide the perfect antidote to this sort of
nonsense. Kicked along by a feisty rhythm section and all overseen by
director John Warren, Surman's swooping bass and alto clarinets, soprano and
baritone saxophones front a uniquely English and folky form of big band
jazz. But Warren's compositions, most of them new and premiered at the
Lilian Baylis Theatre, packed in well-sprung Ellingtonian themes, choral and
classical sentiment rounded off with an extraordinary arrangement based on
the music hall refrain 'My old man said follow the van . . '. Surman's own
soloing goes from strength to strength. His spiralling soprano helped by a
delay button was hypnotic, the dancing baritone set against ostinato brass
uplifting. The concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on June 5.
