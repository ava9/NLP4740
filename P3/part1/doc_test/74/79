SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: 'LIGHT' JAZZ HAS FOUND A HEFTY MARKET 
IN S.D.

Exact demographics for the San Diego market may not be their strong point, but 
the people at GRP, perhaps the leading "light" jazz label, know they've got a 
major market here. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego's always been considered a good jazz town because of KIFM and the 
promoters -- the shows they do at places like Humphrey's and the Bacchanal," 
said Mark Wexler, head of marketing for the New York record label that was 
founded by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Wexler labeled San Diego a small town and pegged the area's 
population at "about 750,000" (it's well over 2 million), he had a better idea 
of just how well his company's records -- by artists such as Lee Ritenour, 
Grusin, Chick Corea, David Benoit and Tom Scott -- are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler couldn't supply figures for San Diego alone, but said sales here account 
for a significant portion of the label's Southern California sales, which 
totaled more than $3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Records on Sports Arena Boulevard, the largest record store in the 
county, with sales of $500,000 a month, can attest to GRP's strength here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good market," said Danny Birch, assistant manager at the store. 
"There are two radio stations in town that play commercial jazz. You don't find 
that in other cities. They've always done well, even when they were 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
GRP signed a distribution agreement with MCA a couple of years ago that puts 
its albums in nearly every major record store in the country. Birch said a top 
GRP artist such as keyboard man David Benoit might sell 300 to 400 albums at 
the Sports Arena Tower store alone. By comparison, straight jazz artists are 
lucky to sell half-a-dozen copies. 
</P>
<P>
Those who enjoy echoic sax riffs a la David Sanborn or the Chinese water 
torture of drum machines will want to check out saxophonist Gerald Albright's 
8:30 p.m. appearance March 8 at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
Albright is a versatile talent. Immediately after college, he toured with 
keyboard player Patrice Rushen, first on sax, later on bass. Unfortunately, 
there's only one track from his new self-produced "Bermuda Nights," where his 
playing takes precedence over the electronic Jacuzzi jazz fog. On the 
composition "Too Cool," his smooth, sexy playing, reminiscent of Grover 
Washington Jr.'s, is perfectly set off by the lyrical work of Bobby Lyle on 
acoustic piano. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the album is headed for commercial success, having already sold 
120,000 copies. Albright acknowledges his desire to make music that appeals to 
a wide audience. Pressed, he even admits being a victim of the corporate 
marketing machine at Atlantic Records, his label. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has to go into the way the record company likes to market me," Albright 
said. "There's a fine line between how they'd like to market me and how I'd 
like to be marketed. My music touches the technical, electronic side, and the 
beat. Record companies subconsciously think you've got to have some kind of 
beat to promote sales. Between those two elements, we arrived at the type of 
music that I'm doing, and I feel real comfortable doing it." 
</P>
<P>
For a more challenging evening, consider hearing free-form reed master Vinny 
Golia on Monday night at Jazz Mine Records and CDs in La Jolla. Golia has 
recorded with New York free jazz tenor sax man Tim Berne and with pianist Wayne 
Peet and bassist Ken Filiano, who will form part of a quintet for the Jazz Mine 
date. His new album, "Worldwide and Portable," is one of about a dozen he's 
made as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tierrasanta producer and musician John Archer placed his name among rarefied 
company on Grammy night last week. Archer and Ronn Satterfield are the players 
behind the local band Checkfield. Both are fluent on guitar, piano, vocals and 
synthesizers, and they play a majority of the instruments on Checkfield's new 
11-song album, "Through the Lens." 
</P>
<P>
Some call the music, with its thick, studio-produced textures, "New Age." 
Recorded at Network Productions in Rancho Bernardo, where Archer works as a 
producer, the album is receiving local radio play and selling well in such 
cities as San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Archer's work at the control board that got the Grammy nomination, 
not the music. Along with albums by Doc Severinsen, Stevie Winwood, Glenn Frey, 
Little Feat and Scritti Politti, Checkfield's album was up for best 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid very careful attention to the blends between the acoustic and 
synthesized instruments," Archer said, explaining why he thinks the recording 
was a contender. "Most people would be hard-pressed to tell what's acoustic and 
what's synthesized." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Archer's seamless production, the Grammy people gave the engineering 
award to singer Winwood's "Roll With It." 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RIFFS: The last of the Athenaeum's five-part jazz history lecture series 
starts at 7 p.m. Monday. San Diego Union music critic George Varga will talk 
about jazz and its many mutations in the 1970s and '80s. . . . By the way, the 
Athenaeum has been adding to its jazz collection -- on tape, CD and vinyl -- 
and a $35 membership provides you access to the whole works. A librarian at the 
La Jolla cultural center has about 1,000 jazz recordings, including 500 
records, more than 200 tapes and 200 CDs. There's a five-album limit per 
checkout. . . . Guitarist Joe D'Orio opens three nights at Diego's Loft 
tonight. . . . Pianist Jimmy Corsaro and singer Sharon Andrews play Wednesday 
through Saturday nights at The Library on Mission Gorge Road, a piano lounge in 
the form of two living rooms filled with books.
