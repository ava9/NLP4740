In the latest tally of openings and closings of Los Angeles jazz spots, the 
score is 3 to 1 for the good guys. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are only two new venues to report -- the Silver Screen Lounge 
and Sasch -- but why not count Chadney's, since, as of a week or two ago, the 
Burbank room has increased its jazz schedule to seven nights a week. The lone 
closure was Churchill's in Glendale, which decided to drop the jazz policy in 
favor of Top 40 groups after giving the music a scant two-week tryout. Heard 
that song before? 
</P>
<P>
With proper presentation, jazz can work. Chadney's is a perfect example. "We 
went to jazz three nights a week almost a year ago, and the popular response 
has allowed us to extend the schedule as planned," said Chadney's owner Steve 
Hoeller, in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Silver Screen Lounge is reason for celebration. During the 
early '80s the nightspot, located in a ground floor corner of the Hyatt on 
Sunset Hotel (8401 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 656-1234), presented 
such greats as pianists Tommy Flanagan and Hank Jones and the late saxmen Eddie 
(Lockjaw) Davis and Warne Marsh. The current policy, co-sponsored by the Hyatt 
and the Los Angeles Jazz Society, will feature jazz artists Thursday-Saturday, 
9:30 p.m.-1:30 a.m. There will be no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist John Collins' quartet kicks off the series on Thursday, followed next 
by Don and Alicia Cunningham with the Al Aarons Quartet, then by Bob Cooper's 
quartet and the Clayton Brothers, and many more. 
</P>
<P>
And there's Sasch, the rock haunt in Studio City (11345 Ventura Blvd., (818) 
769-5555) that now offers a Sunday Jazz and Fusion series at 7:30 p.m. This 
Sunday, it's flutist Tim Weisberg and guitarist Jeff Richman, with pianist Rob 
Mullins and the group Accent scheduled for May 20. Cover charges vary. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ GOES TO SCHOOL: The sound of jazz will spread to four junior and high 
school campuses under a program co-sponsored by the International Assn. of Jazz 
Appreciation (IOAJA) and the Playboy Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, saxman Herman Riley's foursome plays for students of Washington 
High School in Los Angeles at 1:20 p.m. On Friday, the IOAJA Goes to School 
Band, with bassist Larry Gales and drummer Ndugu Chancler, performs at Sun 
Valley Junior High School in Sun Valley (10:40 a.m.), and trumpeter Bobby 
Rodriguez' Latin/jazz band entertains the troops at Stevenson Junior High in 
Los Angeles (1 p.m.). The brief series wraps up on Tuesday,with a performance 
by trombonists Buster Cooper and Thurman Green at Canoga Park High in Canoga 
Park at 10:30 a.m. Following each concert, the musicians will hold clinics for 
interested students. 
</P>
<P>
BASSIST ON THE MOVE: The above-mentioned Larry Gales, currently part of the 
back-up band (see below) working with singer Jon Hendricks at St. Mark's in 
Venice through Saturday, is heading back to New York for some well-deserved 
exposure. "I'm going home," said the former Thelonious Monk sideman, referring 
to his native Manhattan, during intermission at the Venice club. "I'm going to 
do a quartet date at Bradley's, with tenor saxophonist Junior Cook, pianist 
Walter Davis Jr. and drummer Ben Riley, and then later I'll do a sextet stint 
at Birdland." Gales plans to record the sextet. 
</P>
<P>
Gales, who worked and recorded with Monk -- alongside drummer Riley and the 
late saxophonist Charlie Rouse -- during the mid-to-late '60s, was featured 
prominently in the recent film, "Straight No Chaser: The Music of Thelonious 
Monk." "That really helped me," he said. "These New York dates are the result 
of that film." 
</P>
<P>
MORE HENDRICKS QUARTET TIDBITS: Pianist Benny Green, whose Blue Note debut, 
"Lineage," is due out in early June, is working all over. The New York-based 
artist, whom Angelenos have heard here with Betty Carter and Art Blakey, goes 
to San Francisco after the Hendricks gig to do a solo recital. He'll perform a 
similar program at the JVC Newport in New York festival in June. The 
up-and-coming giant will also appear with altoist Bobby Watson's band in the 
Midwest this month, and at Bradley's with a trio led by tenor ace Ralph Moore. 
This summer, he heads to Europe as part of a quintet headed by trumpeter 
Freddie Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
Splendid saxophonist Noel Jewkes, an off-and-on Hendricks associate for over 20 
years who all but never plays the Southland, said he's working a lot in his San 
Francisco base, "though it's not always jazz," he noted. "That's not so great, 
but it's good to be working. I am looking to perform more with a seven-piece 
band for which I have about 70 charts, including many originals." 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Eddie Moore, who has played L.A. with the likes of vibist Bobby 
Hutcherson, looked much trimmer than usual on Wednesday. "I've lost 78 pounds," 
he beamed on his way to the bandstand.
