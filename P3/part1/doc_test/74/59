A good thing came in threes Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center with the appearance of Joe Pass, George Shearing and Joe Williams in a 
program billed as "A Gathering of Friends." The concert was presented as part 
of the Irvine Symphony Orchestra's Performing Arts Center Series. 
</P>
<P>
Pass opened solo with a playful, yet polished, presentation of standards. The 
guitarist achieved an almost orchestral effect, backing single-note melody 
statements with smart chording and the infrequent bass lines, toying with 
rhythms and twisting familiar themes into something barely recognizable. " 
'Round Midnight" opened at a gentle, reserved pace before shifting into swing. 
In an Ellington tribute, "Mood Indigo" evolved into "Satin Doll" with a line 
from "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" thrown in near the end. 
</P>
<P>
Pass' subtle ability to move between moods shone on Oscar Hammerstein's "It's A 
Wonderful World," developing from a stately dance-like figure into a rich, 
rhythmic affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist added percussion to his complex voicings with pops of his strings 
and infrequent taps on his instrument's body. 
</P>
<P>
Shearing, in the company of bassist Neil Swainson, also stuck to familiar 
numbers, which he embellished with shifting textures and rhythms. Standouts 
included his moody reading of "Misty" and the crisp, unison statement between 
bass and piano on the theme to Miles Davis' "Donna Lee," the bop-era workhorse 
that Shearing managed to work into a barrelhouse rag. A particularly somber 
rendition of the World War I nostalgia tune, "Lili Marlene," was full of 
foreboding derived from a minor key setting. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Shearing played his signature tune, "Lullaby of Birdland." 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Swainson seemed a perfect musical foil for his employer, supplying a 
steady walk, speedy theme statements in tandem with the keyboard and melodic, 
to-the-point soloing. His improvisation on "Donna Lee" was a showcase of 
agility and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the pianist delivered much the same between-tune chatter 
("Delighted to see you," is the blind musician's standard greeting to an 
audience) that he used during his Performing Arts Center appearance last year, 
even stooping to tell the same jokes. One would hope that this tired patter 
might reflect something new the next time he comes to town, or be dropped 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, backed by Shearing, Swainson and drummer Clayton Cameron, put his 
bouncy, brassy voice to blues and standards such as "Just Friends" and 
Ellington's "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart." Despite his reputation as a 
blues singer, Williams' was most satisfying while performing ballads, which he 
delivered with warmth and conviction. His reading of Thad Jones' "A Child Is 
Born" was particularly moving, accented by Shearing's hushed, minor-key lullaby 
that closed the tune. 
</P>
<P>
Pass' inclusion on the last few numbers almost seemed an afterthought. Nearly 
inaudible when providing accompaniment, the guitarist stepped out for short, 
slippery improvs before disappearing back into the mix. The three men closed 
with a tune from Williams' Basie days, "The Comeback," which the singer 
dedicated to those serving overseas. Pass, Shearing and Williams will appear 
Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall.
