Some people just don't know what they're missing. That was certainly true 
Sunday evening at the Studio Cafe as drummer Wally Stryk's trio, Flight, played 
to a small, chatty, largely inattentive crowd. 
</P>
<P>
What those in attendance chose to ignore was a smooth performance of 
well-chosen standards, done with taste and a bit of flash. Stryk, a Boston 
native who has been in the Southland for two years, performs with Segment, a 
percussive-heavy ensemble that includes marimbas, African percussion and 
Stryk's trap work, in addition to various editions of his own trio. The bassist 
for this engagement, Ken Filiano, has recorded with multireed man Vinny Golia's 
Large Ensemble, trombonist Joey Sellers' Jazz Aggregation and adventurous 
keyboardist Richard Grossman in addition to putting out a pair of his own 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
The ringer among the three was keyboardist Don Preston, who is probably best 
known for his association with the Mothers of Invention. But Preston, a 
Michigan native who honed his chops in Detroit after-hours clubs with the likes 
of Elvin Jones and Yusef Lateef, has solid jazz credentials. He has worked with 
Don Cherry, Michael Mantler, Gil Evans, Carla and Paul Bley, among others, and 
has also contributed to several film scores, including that of "Apocalypse 
Now." Lately, he's been heard in Los Angeles as a member of cornetist Bobby 
Bradford's Mo'tet and, just last week, he presented a program of enticing 
originals at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill with a trio that counted bassist and 
Orange County resident Art Davis among its members. 
</P>
<P>
Though Stryk had worked with both men at different times, this was the first 
time the three had worked as a unit. Except for brief discussions between 
numbers, that fact was hardly apparent as the trio found common ground during a 
first set that relied mainly on familiar Miles Davis tunes. 
</P>
<P>
They warmed up to the trumpeter's "All Blues," with Filiano, the possessor of a 
full, meaty tone, stating the familiar bass line while Preston added dissonant 
twists to the simple theme. Stryk punched up the pace, working a double-time 
into the bridge that sent Preston scurrying into his solo. Preston swirled 
warmly through Davis' "Solar" while Stryk managed to keep things heated despite 
being crammed into a tight corner of the tiny bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Preston's best moments came during a duo with Filiano on Miles' near-mystic 
tune "Nardis." Though his own material has him working the keyboard with a 
Cecil Taylor-like intensity, his approach here was more fluid with a lyrical 
right hand sparked by a pushy left. In support, Filiano wasn't content to walk 
or merely track chords, but played off the pianist's story line, emphasizing a 
phrase here, adding embellishment there. His own solo was a warm, melodic 
reworking of the theme that wandered across the full range of his instrument. 
Preston drew the piece to a close with a Middle Eastern-flavored line that 
ended darkly below middle C. 
</P>
<P>
"Django," the paean to the well-known guitarist written by Modern Jazz Quartet 
pianist John Lewis, injected some seriousness into the proceedings, with 
Preston's respectful, classically influenced block-chord introduction moving 
into smoothly drawn lines that Stryk shaded with brushes and mallets. The 
up-tempo blues that followed allowed the drummer to show some swing. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd's response to this satisfying effort? At the conclusion of each 
tune, as if in answer to a Zen riddle, could be heard the sound of one man 
clapping.
