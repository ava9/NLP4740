Though difficult to master, the baritone sax can produce amazing sounds in the 
right hands. Unfortunately, few jazz players have chosen to make it their 
instrument of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone sax player Nick Brignola's appearance this Saturday at 8 p.m. at the 
San Diego Convention Center is a rare opportunity to hear what this horn can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The concert is the second in the three-part "Salute to the Masters" series 
being presented by the San Diego Jazz Society. Brignola's show will be a 
tribute to jazz saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker, generally considered one of 
the half a dozen most important jazz artists of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Brignola began his musical education as a schoolboy clarinetist, and switched 
to alto sax as he began to get serious about jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I found the baritone and that was it," Brignola said. "I was able to 
express my personality more." 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" was known for the lightning be-bop lines he invented on alto, and one 
might expect that Brignola would have a tough time rekindling Parker's memory 
on the larger, more air-consuming baritone. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what instrument I pick up, it translates the music inside me," 
Brignola said. "The instrument is just a vehicle. I feel I can play different 
horns with equal facility, but I've worked hard at it. I may be one of few who 
can do it. It's hard, rather like a trumpet player picking up a tuba." 
</P>
<P>
Brignola, who names baritone sax predecessors Harry Carney and Pepper Adams as 
influences, has long been a favorite of jazz purists. A New York Times writer 
last year referred to his "full, hard-bottomed sound and . . . urgent, 
swaggering attack." In various jazz polls, he's consistently named by critics, 
fans and peers as the top baritone player. 
</P>
<P>
During the '50s, Brignola leaned toward the West Coast cool-jazz sound being 
pioneered by players such as Paul Desmond, Stan Getz and Bud Shank. "It was 
easy to learn -- palatable music," he said. But when he sought something more 
challenging, he became a be-bop convert, with Parker as his main guru. (Parker 
died when Brignola was still a teen-ager, and the two never met.) 
</P>
<P>
"On a Different Level," Brignola's new recording, should be in stores any day. 
It pits Brignola with drummer Jack DeJohnette, pianist Kenny Barron and bassist 
Dave Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"The improvisations were going to be very esoteric, so we decided to use 
standards so listeners could hang their hats on it," he said. "There's music by 
Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington, Tadd Dameron. It 
was designed to let me do my thing like I do on the job. Some cuts are a little 
longer than normal air play time." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of great commercial success doesn't bother Brignola, who said he is 
lucky to sell 15,000 or 20,000 copies of his recordings. "Pure jazz was never 
meant to appeal to the masses. Anybody selling over 40,000 records would be 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Brignola, who plans to bring both soprano and baritone saxes, 
will be supported by pianist Frank Strazzeri -- whose meandering improvisations 
sometimes call to mind Thelonious Monk -- plus trumpeter Jimmy Noone, drummer 
Tootie Heath and bassist John Leitham. The material will lean heavily on 
Parker's own compositions and his versions of popular jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
The new album by San Diego's own Checkfield, "A View from the Bridge," is the 
strongest yet from the duo of Ron Satterfield and John Archer. The pair, both 
experts with mixing boards, synthesizers, guitars, vocals and keyboards, 
brought in top players, including San Diegans Peter Sprague, John Rekevics, 
Mark Hunter, John Leftwich and Duncan Moore, plus out-of-towners such as 
guitarist Pat Kelley, flutist Steve Kujala and violinist Darol Anger. Where 
earlier albums from Checkfield were technically polished but lacking in punch, 
the new project is more dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 11 songs, all composed by Checkfield, "Conjuring" stands out, with its 
African and tropical rhythms providing the backbeat for Kujala's soothing 
flute. Anger's soaring violin lines are impressive on several cuts. The album 
includes more singing than past Checkfield efforts. Archer and Satterfield have 
serviceable voices, but their lyrics sometimes get too singsong and cute. The 
album is due to be in stores next week. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego flutist Lori Bell and her musical soul mate, L.A. pianist Dave 
Mackay, play Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest Friday and Saturday 
nights, and the Salmon House restaurant on Mission Bay on Sunday night. They'll 
work as a duo Friday and Saturday and be joined by drummer Barry Farrar and 
bassist Bill Andrews on Sunday. Bell and Mackay are shopping around a demo tape 
that includes five new songs in the more commercial, light-jazz direction they 
began with the song "The Goose Is Loose" from their last album, "Take Me to 
Brazil." At Words &amp; Music, their repertoire will include several originals, 
plus music by George Gershwin, Michel Legrand and Charlie Parker. Bell's song 
"Waltz for Joe," written for San Diego pianist Joe Azarello, is included on a 
new Japanese release from local pianist Mike Wofford titled "All Alone." 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Open Channel, the new electric-jazz band fronted by San Diego guitarist 
Jim Storey and including top local saxophonist Steve Feierabend, plays the Del 
Mar Hilton this Friday and Saturday nights and again next weekend. Vocalist 
Cath Eckert will perform with the band and may join it permanently if the 
chemistry is right. . . . Sunday night from 7 to 8, the Claude Bolling Big Band 
is featured on "Le Jazz Club," the French program imported to KSDS-FM (88.3). . 
. . Jazz artists such as local pianist Glenn Horiuchi have incorporated 
authentic Oriental influences into their music. Friday night at 8, the real 
thing can be heard at UC San Diego's Price Center Theatre, as Silk and Lace, 
the orchestra of the Chinese Music Society of North America, performs several 
classical and modern Chinese works.
