Jean (Toots) Thielemans, the veteran virtuoso from Belgium who opened Tuesday 
at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood, is a man of several talents, as 
guitarist, whistler, composer and harmonica player. 
</P>
<P>
They have given him an entree into many areas, from commercials (Old Spice) to 
records with Quincy Jones, and even pop dates with Paul Simon; but a small jazz 
group remains his preferred setting. 
</P>
<P>
As the man who brought to the chromatic harmonica the same acceptance in jazz 
that Larry Adler had earned for it in classical music, Thielemans improvises on 
it with such clarity of vision, such dexterity and tonal beauty, that one 
reacts to the message without ever being concerned about the modesty of the 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
Playing pop and jazz standards -- "I Can't Get Started," "Days of Wine and 
Roses," Thad Jones' "Three and One" -- he interspersed his set with sentimental 
comments about his days with Benny Goodman, George Shearing and, most notably, 
Jaco Pastorius, to whose "Three Views of a Secret" he brought a warmly personal 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed justifiable pride in his sidemen. They are the sensitive, 
harmonically imaginative pianists Michel Herr -- a fellow Brussels native, who 
played his own award-winning composition "Labyrinthe" -- and the Italian 
bassist Riccardo Del Fra, whom he turned loose on a deeply moving treatment of 
"I'm A Fool to Want You." 
</P>
<P>
For a finale, as always, Thielemans switched to guitar and offered his 
whistling-and-guitar-unison version of his most famous composition, 
"Bluesette." When the audience insisted on more, he introduced a new and 
delightful original, "Song for My Lady," then picked up the harmonica to close 
with "Ne Me Quitte Pas." 
</P>
<P>
In the world of jazz, Thielemans remains one of a kind, an artist of unique 
musical and personal charm. An hour under his spell is a rare and rewarding 
experience. He closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER
