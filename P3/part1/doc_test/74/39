Trumpeter Harry James died in 1983, but his band lives on, providing a dream 
job for trumpeter Art Depew. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, who played with James for five years during the 1950s, returned 2 1/2 
years ago to lead the Harry James Orchestra, a 17-piece swing ensemble which 
hits the Del Mar Fair's Grandstand Stage this afternoon at 2. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, James was occasionally criticized for playing music he knew 
would succeed commercially, at the expense of innovation. But Depew has 
respected his idol's work since the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"I first heard him with Benny Goodman, when I was 12 or 13," Depew recalled, 
"but I saw him live for the first time at the Hollywood Palladium in 1943. He 
had a great deal of technique, an awful lot of power and strength, nice tone 
and vibrato. He was very creative and very advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry was a commercial trumpet player, but he played great jazz too -- his 
solo on 'Sing, Sing, Sing' with Benny Goodman became the song's definitive 
melody. His jazz was so lucid and clear. His solos went from jazz solos to 
becoming the melodies audiences expected to hear." 
</P>
<P>
As leader, Depew now plays these solos, and he sings an occasional number. The 
material consists mostly of such James' band standards as "Sleepy Lagoon," "The 
Mole," "I've Heard That Song Before," "Cherry," "Two O'Clock Jump," "Blues for 
Sale," "Don't Be That Way" and "You Made Me Love You," James' "most successful 
ballad," according to Depew. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, who considers swing-era big band music "a lot more stimulating than 
Bruce Springsteen," said the style is catching on all over again back East, 
where people in their 20s and 30s are packing dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, 65, has worked with band leaders including Tommy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, Tex 
Beneke and Charlie Barnet, but considers his career to be one long training 
session for his ultimate job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely in love with what I'm doing. I have to maintain my abilities, 
so I practice three or four hours a day to play those solos the way I've 
trained my entire life to play them." 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that many of James' original recordings bear some 
relationship to recordings by the Count Basie Orchestra; James often borrowed 
Basie band members for his sessions. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison's sake, you can hear the newest version of Basie's group, under 
the direction of saxophonist Frank Foster, tonight at 7:30 and 9:30 at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Basie died in 1984, but his band continues to earn rave notices for the quality 
of the ensemble work and soloists. Compared with the intricate musical themes 
played by other big bands, the characteristic Basie sound emphasizes bluesy 
swing and rhythmic subtlety as much as harmonic complexity. 
</P>
<P>
If you missed Marimba Mike's multimedia performance downtown at Ruse 
Performance Gallery earlier this year, you've got another chance. Mike, a.k.a. 
Bryan Jackson, will repeat the exotic original piece "People of the Lake," an 
"ethnomusicological journey through time and space," this Friday night at 8 at 
Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. He also plans to include compositions 
by Chick Corea, Charles Mingus and others. 
</P>
<P>
A master of many percussion instruments, Mike also plays a variety of unusual 
African wind instruments and whistles. On "People of the Lake," he uses tape 
and electronics to enhance the sound, while images of primitive art and foreign 
landscapes are projected. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $7.50; reservations are recommended (298-4011).
