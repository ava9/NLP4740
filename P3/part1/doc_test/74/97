THE JOINT IS JUMPIN' AT BOSTON'S BERKLEE

The recent death of veteran cornetist Wild Bill Davison led to the by now 
familiar expressions of gloom heard at memorial tributes: The giants are 
passing on, the line grows thin, and who, if anyone, will be around to replace 
them? 
</P>
<P>
These pessimistic reflections are not justified by the facts, according to Gary 
Burton, the award-winning vibraphonist who is in a unique position to foresee 
the future. Burton is an 18-year faculty member and currently dean of 
curriculum at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He was a student there in the 
early '60s before going on the road with George Shearing and Stan Getz. 
</P>
<P>
"We have over 2,800 students at Berklee," said Burton, "divided into those who 
are interested in pop music and those concerned with jazz. The jazz players 
subdivide into various contemporary and traditional styles. You might think 
that a young player would go for what is new and contemporary, but many of them 
are attracted to the jazz of the 1940s and '50s. This trend toward diversity is 
very healthy and augurs well for the future of the music. 
</P>
<P>
"Movies like 'Round Midnight' and 'Bird' and Monk's 'Straight No Chaser,' as 
well as people like Wynton and Branford Marsalis, have stimulated a revival of 
interest in straight-ahead jazz. Today, you find enough of an audience to 
support acoustic groups like Mike Brecker's or my own band, as well as electric 
music played by Chick Corea or Pat Metheny." 
</P>
<P>
Burton's remarks were made during the recent annual jazz festival cruise aboard 
the S.S. Norway. With a few exceptions, the major names among those who took 
part in this event were black and over 60, while the young musicians (including 
Burton's group and an entire 19-piece ensemble from Dallas) were white. Several 
were second-generation jazzmen: Trombonist Al Grey had his son, Mike Grey, 
playing second trombone, along with bassist J. J. Wiggins, son of the Los 
Angeles pianist Gerald Wiggins, and Joe Cohn, a brilliant guitarist whose 
father was the saxophonist Al Cohn. Terry Gibbs, who played a vibraphone duet 
session with Burton, had his 25-year-old son Gerry on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Burton's own Berklee-trained sidemen seemed to bear out his optimistic beliefs. 
All in their 20s, they included Greg Gisbert, a trumpeter who at 22 looks about 
15; Gildas Boclas, a bassist from France; Renato Chicco, a Yugoslav pianist 
still studying at Berklee and, most remarkably, Don McCaslin, a 23-year-old 
tenor saxophonist who amazed the audience one night by virtually stealing the 
show in a saxophone jam featuring such seasoned pros as Red Holloway, Phil 
Woods, David (Fathead) Newman and Flip Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the educational advantages and incentives offered by Berklee and a 
growing number of institutions partly or exclusively devoted to jazz, a factor 
that has all but assured a thriving future is the internationalization of the 
music. Jazz courses are now held in many countries, a number of them in the 
Soviet Union. Still, Berklee remains the best known school and has produced a 
stream of promising alumni. A recent breakdown of the student body revealed 
that there are over 600 foreign students from nations around the world, 
including Aruba, Iceland, Ethiopia and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign list is headed by Japan, with 138 students; Canada has 58, Israel 
36, West Germany 24, Brazil 25, France 34. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why students flock to Berklee from around the globe to study jazz, Burton 
said: "If you were into Japanese haiku, your dream would be to go to Japan and 
study with one of the masters. Jazz is one of the most popular music forms 
wherever you go." 
</P>
<P>
Burton remains firmly convinced of a healthy outlook. "I tell my students to 
keep an open mind, to move ahead with the music, the way the people we hold in 
most reverence did -- the Miles Davises, the Duke Ellingtons. 
</P>
<P>
"The men in my group have a broad range. They play demanding original pieces; 
they play standards and know the whole repertoire. My drummer plays a lot of 
rock gigs as well as jazz jobs. That kind of diversity will serve them well. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how the music evolves, whatever they feel is important for them to 
play, they'll have the tools and the variety of experience to be a vital part 
of it as they move into the 21st Century."
