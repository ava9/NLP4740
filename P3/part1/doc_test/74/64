For the first time in more than five years, Santa Barbara has a jazz festival. 
</P>
<P>
Headlined by saxophonist Stan Getz, the Santa Barbara International Jazz 
Festival kicks off tonight and runs through Saturday, with performances -- by 
such name artists as Getz, pianist David Benoit and conga drummer Poncho 
Sanchez, and such Santa Barbara-area musicians as pianist Debbie Denke and 
flutist Bob Ledner -- in venues all over town. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think I'm totally crazy to try and pull off a festival here, 
but I thought it could be done if it emphasized that Santa Barbara is a 
beautiful place to go," said Jack Butefish, festival director. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to create an atmosphere where jazz is happening all over town, 
including bands in the streets Friday and Saturday, on a big stage in front of 
City Hall, in the nightclubs and the concert halls," said Butefish. 
</P>
<P>
Among the special events will be the Amtrak Jazz Train, which will carry 
festival-goers -- entertained by a jazz trio en route -- from Los Angeles' 
Union Station to Santa Barbara Friday (a return trip is scheduled for Sunday), 
and a jazz club crawl, led by noted KKGO-FM disc jockey Chuck Niles, which will 
take place after Getz's Saturday evening concert.

Information: (800) 321-3378 or (805) 962-0800.

The Boys Club of Pasadena and the MacKenzie-Scott Branch Women's Assn. will 
share the proceeds from the Kirk Whalum Benefit Jazz Concert, scheduled to 
begin at 8 p.m. Sunday at Pasadena City College's Sexton Auditorium. In 
addition to jazz/funk saxophonist Whalum, the bill includes singer Diane 
Reeves, saxmen Gerald Albright and George Howard and an all-star band. 
Information: (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.

Though Corky Hale is perhaps best known as a jazz harpist, talk to her for a 
few minutes and she will let you know she wears a few other musical hats as 
well. "When I worked at the Cocoanut Grove in the '50s, I played harp with the 
orchestra, flute on the Latin numbers, intermission piano and sang with the big 
band," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her biggest thrills have been as a pianist. "I've played piano for 
everybody," she quipped. Among the singers she has accompanied are Barbra 
Streisand and Billie Holiday, the latter in a two-week stint at Jazz City, the 
popular room at Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue that spotlighted jazz 
greats from Art Blakey to Shelly Manne and Conte Candoli in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Hale can be heard Thursdays in October at Tom Rolla's Gardenia Club in 
Hollywood, backing some of her favorite songwriters -- Hal David (tonight), 
Johnny Mandel, Alan Bergman and the team of Lieber and Stoller. (Mike Stoller 
also happens to be Hale's husband.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have each of the writers do a couple of their songs, and then I'll do 
one," she said. Bassist Herb Mickman and drummer Gene Estes will also be on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Another facet of the show will find Hale doing tunes that she worked on with 
such stars as Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. "I'll talk about the tunes, and 
about how I got to do them. I've done a lot crazy things, and I hope to put 
some of these happenings in my show," she joked.

***** "Messages" (Prestige), from the marvelous-yet-underrecognized saxophonist 
Hank Mobley, is the epitome of a hard-bop recording. This superb 1956 
two-record set (on a single CD) offers a blend of bop classics -- "Bouncing 
With Bud," "52nd Street Theme" -- along with torchy ballads and crackling 
medium and up-tempos, all infused with the bluesy tinge that marked the 
hard-bop genre. Mobley, a master improviser who could weave art and funk into 
sumptuous, melodic cloths, is assisted by trumpet greats Kenny Dorham (who was 
seen a bit in the recently re-released "Dangerous Liaisons 1960"), pianists 
Barry Harris and Walter Bishop, bassist Doug Watkins and drummer Art Taylor. 
This is music that never stops cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Records are rated from one to five stars: ***** means a swinging must-have for 
the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.
