Business bosses may complain about the congestion on the roads and troubles
on the trains but the West End of London is still the place most favoured by
British companies for their headquarters. See map on page 24.)
The area which takes in Oxford Street and Mayfair and extends through
Kensington towards London Airport, boasts 57 corporate headquarters, five
more than the City of London with 52, and 15 ahead of south-west London, the
area incorporating Knightsbridge and Chelsea, and extending south into
Wimbledon.
London's dominant position overall as the business capital of the UK emerges
from an analysis of the addresses of the top 500 (to be published next month
in an expanded reprint of the FT500).
In spite of the relocations that have taken place over recent years to towns
around the M25 orbital motorway, and in some cases to other parts of the
country, the London postal districts combined still account for 198 or
roughly 40 per cent of all UK500 company headquarters.
There are, nevertheless, some surprises in the location list, which uses UK
post code areas - in effect Britain's city regions - as its geographical
basis. Birmingham, with 21 headquarters justifies its claim to be Britain's
second business centre. Somewhat more unexpectedly, Reading, a beneficiary
of some out-of-London moves,is the next most popular provincial location,
and home to 13 companies.
Edinburgh and Leeds with 12 each - a score also equalled by Slough - are
ahead of their usually higher-profile rivals, Glasgow and Manchester, and
unfashionable Bradford also scores well with nine company headquarters.
A number of big cities such as Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry and Sheffield fare
relatively badly with only two apiece, while Aberdeen, in spite of its
position as Britain's oil capital, boasts only one, as also do Portsmouth,
Southampton, and Croydon.
Former new towns Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, and Peterborough, (six
each), all figure more strongly, with Liverpool and Derby on the same total,
ahead of Huddersfield, Nottingham, Warrington and Redhill on five.
Regionally, Yorkshire with the headquarters of 40 quoted companies, the West
Midlands (38), the Thames Valley (35) and the North West (34) are Britain's
most significant regions outside London, followed by Scotland (33).
Outside these areas company headquarters are thinly spread, with Wales, the
West of England, East Anglia, Northern Ireland and the North East, home to
only a few companies with strong local roots.
In the European list (see chart on page 35) the UK, with Europe's big stock
market, is dominant with 187 out of the total of 500 top companies or
roughly 37 per cent of the total. The UK share of the list's total market
capitalisation is similar at 37 per cent - Dollars 828.5bn out of Dollars
2,213.8bn.
France has the second highest number of companies in the list (77) but at
Dollars 310.2bn, their market capitalisation lags slightly behind that of
Germany whose 67 companies were valued at Dollars 315.2bn. Netherlands has
17 companies with a market capitalisation of Dollars 187.5bn.
Italy, in spite of the size of its economy, manages only 25 companies in the
list, valued at Dollars 84.7bn, slightly ahead of much smaller Sweden, which
has 22 companies valued at Dollars 83.4bn. Spain has only two fewer
companies in the list than Italy but their combined capitalisation, Dollars
85.2bn, is marginally greater. By contrast, its Iberian neighbour at the
bottom of the list, Portugal, has only one representative, three fewer than
Ireland, Luxembourg and Austria.
