Braniff Inc. will move its headquarters from Dallas to Orlando beginning in 
May, Braniff Chairman William McGee announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters move had been expected since the airline was purchased by a 
Philadelphia and New York investment group last summer, and speculation on the 
location had centered on Kansas City, Mo., and Orlando, where Braniff has hubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Kansas City is and will remain our largest hub, our decision to 
locate our headquarters here signals our commitment to the growth of central 
Florida as well," McGee told a news conference in Orlando.
