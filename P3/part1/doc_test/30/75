FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (8): Smart move to
Atlanta - Case study, United Parcel Service

MANY companies that relocate have at least a few regrets about how they
handled the move. But United Parcel Service, the world's largest parcel
delivery company, says the Dollars 100m shift of its headquarters two years
ago to Atlanta came off almost flawlessly.
A look at why the transfer was successful and at what the company believes
it could have done a bit better offer some useful lessons to others
contemplating a relocation.
UPS already had experience with relocations. Its move to Atlanta was the
third change of corporate home in its 85-year history. The company started
as American Messenger Service in Seattle, moved to New York in 1930 and in
1975 to Greenwich, Connecticut, a plush New York suburb. It also, as company
policy, made a practice of regularly moving its executives around to give
them experience in its various operations.
The main requirement for a successful relocation is to choose the right
site. That means knowing exactly what you want. For UPS, Atlanta was a
virtually perfect fit and it has won overwhelming employee approval.
The company had begun to feel uncomfortable with the contrast between the
luxurious Greenwich setting of its headquarters and its plain folks image.
By comparison, in Atlanta the cost of living and the cost of operating were
far lower. A survey of employees a year after the move, according to Ms
Susan Rosenberg of UPS, found that 'far and away' the majority of the
company's employees approved of the move.
'Everyone was able to meet or exceed their standard of living,' she
explains.
High on the list of factors contributing to employee satisfaction was more
reasonably priced housing. The cost of homes in Greenwich, where the average
family four-bedroom home sold for Dollars 569,000 two years ago, had made
managers shun transfers to headquarters and left many non-management
employees without a chance in the housing market. The average cost of a
comparable home in Atlanta was Dollars 138,500 in 1991, according to
Coldwell Banker.
The travel needs of UPS were also an important factor in selecting a site.
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, the world's fourth busiest,
offered easier access by car or public transport and a better network of
convenient flights than New York's airports. UPS executives flew 18,000
flight segments in 1990. This year, boosted by strong growth, particularly
in Europe, they will fly double that many.
Atlanta's physical characteristics were also appealing. Its tree-covered
rolling hills resembled New England and helped employees feel they were in
an environment to which they were accustomed.
But even with Atlanta's attractive amenities, officials at UPS say two other
decisions helped make the relocation a success.
First, all 900 employees, not just management, were offered transfers.
Although their relocation advisers, PHH Fantus, said that usually only 10
per cent of an hourly workforce accept agree to move, some 60 per cent of
UPS's non-management employees took the transfer. And 96 per cent of its
managers accepted the move.
These exceptionally high numbers are explained in part by the company's
egalitarian culture. Loyalty is strong at UPS, which is privately owned by a
management group composed of 26,000 of its own employees, 'People
development,' as Ms Rosenberg calls it, whereby managers work their way up
through the ranks, is company policy.
The management was advised by Fantus that, if it moved hourly employees,
that would provide enough savings in hiring and training to offset much of
the relocation costs.
Secondly, UPS top management helped employees make their transfer decisions
 -and perhaps enticed more of them to move - by providing ample information
and even familiarisation tours of Atlanta. After Mr Kent 'Oz' Nelson,
chairman of UPS, announced the site choice in May 1991, the company held
briefings not only for employees but also for their families. The Atlanta
tours were thorough, including neighbourhoods, schools and recreation and
cultural facilities. Information centres were set up in Greenwich as well as
in Atlanta.
Yet even what seemed a model relocation had a few flaws. There were several
complaints about the company's lack of assistance for job-seeking spouses.
Given that many American families now depend on two incomes, the importance
of this demand was underestimated by UPS. Mr Ken Sternad, chief of public
affairs, said: 'It was a stronger issue than we had calculated. We didn't do
as good a job as we should have done.'
Some employees also felt that a move in the middle of the school year was
disruptive for families. But the company did not want to wait too long after
announcing its decision to relocate. In such waiting periods the uncertainty
tends to result in a loss of productivity.
The biggest glitch was, however, on office property. UPS had wanted an
existing building and was negotiating for one just before announcing it
would move. But that deal fell through and the company ended up having to
rent space in three different office buildings, dividing its workforce.
That three-way split led the company to decide in September 1991 to build
its own headquarters building and, in effect, move again. However, UPS
regards the planned building, which is expected to cost Dollars 75m and to
be completed next year, as a happy ending to a sticky dilemma - and one that
company growth may eventually have demanded anyway.
The company's expansion has proceeded so rapidly that it has increased its
workforce to 1,400, a 55 per cent increase over the number who worked in
Greenwich. The new headquarters, a relatively modest pair of seven-storey
structures connected at the lower levels, will be built to house an eventual
2,000-strong staff. And, say satisfied UPS officials, it will be built to
meet all of the company's needs.
