BANQUE INDOSUEZ, one of France's leading investment banks, is moving out of
central Paris into the suburbs to a new corporate headquarters in the old BP
Tower, the office block at the centre of a recent property scandal.
The move comes as Indosuez, part of the Suez industrial group, is trying to
raise capital and cut costs to offset the steep provisions it has been
forced to make on the losses on its property and business loans portfolios.
Late last year, Indosuez, which saw its net profits fall to FFr82m in the
first half of 1992 from FFr517m in the same period a year earlier, raised
FFr400m from the sale and leaseback of its prestige headquarters in the
heart of the Paris banking district.
It plans in 1996 to move all its operations, currently spread between five
different buildings, into the BP Tower, now renamed the Paul Doumer Tower.
The BP Tower has been clouded by controversy since the discovery of
irregularities in its sale to Lucia, a French property company then headed
by Mr Christian Pellerin.
Indosuez last month participated in a recapitalisation of Lucia, in which
Suez, its parent company, is a minority shareholder with other French
financial institutions.
The move for Indoseuz forms part of the trend for large companies to move
out of central Paris. Societe Generale, another leading French bank, is
leaving its Boulevard Haussman headquarters in 1995 to move to the La
Defense business district.
Ironically, the drift to the suburbs is intensifying the financial pressure
on companies which have large property holdings in the French capital. The
Paris property market is in a precarious state with average rentals down by
20 per cent in the past three years. The move out of the city centre is
aggravating this problem by increasing the number of properties available
for sale or rental.
