THE youngest sector of the UK property market is going through a baptism of
fire. After being nurtured by the relaxed planning controls, buoyant demand
and easy money of the second half of the 1980s, business parks have now
stumbled into some of the harshest conditions for the property industry in
living memory.
The market still shows promise but its growth has been badly stunted. Gone
are the careless days at the end of the 1980s, when business parks were
planned at the rate of four a week, even though it would take 30 years to
fill them all.
Over the past year, developers have struggled to fill their buildings, while
some who paid inflated prices for their land have gone bankrupt.
Many of the planned developments will not be built, although plenty of new
projects are in the pipeline. Last year nearly twice as many out-of-centre
schemes were completed as in the year before, according to Applied Property
Research (APR).
This year it forecasts a 10 per cent drop in completions to 13.5m sq ft of
completions, while next year it reckons that some 9.6m sq ft will be
completed.
While supply has been building up, the recession and the Gulf war have taken
their toll on demand.
Just over 10m sq ft was taken up last year, down 21 per cent on 1989. So far
this year, 1.4m sq ft has been taken up, leading APR to estimate a total
take-up of 9m sq ft for the year.
The demand figures, although weak, suggest that business parks have managed
to appeal to a broadening audience. Last year, the most enthusiastic
newcomers to business parks were the telecommunication industry, government
services - which are relocating out of London to reduce costs - insurance,
electronics and computers. This year, food and drink industries are tipped
to be important space takers.
The result is that there are enough business parks to satisfy demand for 18
months and enough land with planning permission to last for decades,
according to APR.
However, the picture is clouded by large variations in quality and location.
Agents report that choice is relatively limited in some regions and,
moreover, that well-designed, well-located office parks are still attracting
reasonable demand.
For the best schemes, rents are rivalling, if not outstripping the city
centres. That said, it is unquestionably a tenant's market and few places
are entirely immune from the slump which dragged down overall office rents
by about 7 per cent last year.
As the property industry grapples with oversupply, the marketing advantages
of business parks are being closely scrutinised by tenants offered cut-price
rents to stay in town.
The quality of the working environment and good car parking provisions is
often bait enough for tenants used to cramped, congested city centres.
However, Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks reckons that the problems of business
parks have been underestimated by nearly everyone involved. 'Car parking and
a better environment are not everything,' it says.
'Rural locations can mean isolation: poor public transport and back-up
facilities, few neighbours and only a shallow pool of staff nearby.'
Some of these criticisms are inescapable, but the business park industry
would argue that its best schemes are trying to address some of the
complaints.
The evolution of business parks has been a rapid affair, producing a large
discrepancy between the concept and quality of different schemes.
The original goal of UK business parks, which were modelled on US schemes
such as Silicon Valley in California, was to give industrial companies a new
standard of space and environment. In reality, these turned out to be
slightly more appealing than average industrial estates.
High-tech developments were introduced in the early 1980s for computer-based
industries that did not need or want to separate offices, production and
warehouses. These second generation schemes were larger than their
predecessors and more likely to be out-of-the-town centres and in the green
belt.
As most of these scheme were agreed outside the existing planning controls,
there was an increasing demand to clarify the planning rules. In the 1985
White Paper, Lifting the Burden, the government said it would deregulate
planning legislation and, as part of this process, review the Use Classes
Order 1972 to cater for high-tech development.
The resulting introduction of the new business activity use (B1) in 1987 had
a decisive impact on the growth and nature of the business park market.
Between 1979 and 1981, under 250,000 sq ft of space was completed on
business parks, while between 1982 and 1986 the market grew gradually so
that just under 3m sq ft of space was completed in 1986. The new planning
rules were so eagerly received that by the end of 1988 more than 10m sq ft
of new B1 space was coming forward for completion in 1989. 'At timesit
appears that every farmer with land near a motorway junction was seeking to
develop a B1 business park,' says APR.
The change in planning rules also fundamentally changed the nature of
business parks.
The 'third generation' of business parks were office campus schemes for
corporate headquarters as developers discarded the original concept of
allowing high-technology companies to perform all its functions under one
roof.
The 'B1 effect' has produced a tendency for developers to think exclusively
in terms of maximising land values through office development to the
exclusion of mixed use and industrial buildings and this new phenomenon is
transforming the mixed use business parks of the 1980s into the office parks
of the 1990s,' says APR. In 1988, offices were 32 per cent of the total
market compared with 79 per cent in 1991.
The bonanza clearly got out of hand. Many schemes were ill thought out and
badly located. Clearly, some may have to revert to warehousing and
industrial schemes, even though office prices were paid for the land.
What is more difficult to predict is where business parks go from here. The
definition of a business park is increasingly blurred thanks to its changing
role, the introduction of new terms such as Stockley's 'mid-urban' park at
Chiswick, and the tendency of developers to borrow the label for any clutch
of new suburban buildings surrounded by a few trees.
The fourth generation schemes, meaning a business park that covers hundreds,
if not thousands, of acres with leisure facilities and housing, are limited
to one or two examples and some intensive lobbying of planning ministers.
There is not even any clear consensus on which types of schemes are the most
successful.
It has long been assumed by the industry that if a business park is to
compete with the town centres, it must be large enough to offer a
restaurant, a health club, a creche, a hotel and even shops.
In spite of the logic in this argument, the facts do not back up the
industry's hunch. Good quality small schemes get taken up just as well as
good quality large ones, according to APR, which has examined the relative
take-up of schemes larger than 50 acres and the rest. 'It is our view that
size of schemes has only a marginal impact on the size of lettings to be
accommodated,' it says.
Nonetheless, the bare statistics should not invite complacency about schemes
which do not offer attractive amenities for employees. When the economy
emerges from recession, employers' choice of new premises will have to
reflect their anxiety to win and keep good staff.
