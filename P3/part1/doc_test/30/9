The internationalisation of business has meant that multinational companies
have needed to establish regional headquarters for coordinating and
supervising their activity in a number of countries.
The emergence of regional trading blocks such as the EU and more latterly
the EEA, Nafta as well as other regional free trade areas has focused
attention increasingly on centralisation of management activities within
those areas. Headquarters locations are chosen for a variety of reasons
apart from the tax rules. These will include the qualify of life for senior
executives, proximity to markets, communications and quality of local labour
sources.
Many countries offer incentives and tailor their tax rules to attract
headquarters operations on the basis that they create employment,
particularly in services, and may encourage other local investment.
Headquarters operations comprise a wide range of activities. Traditionally,
this has included the provision of head office services to members of a
multinational group including administration and financing, accounting,
lobbying, marketing and advertising.
Increasingly in regional trading blocks, the functions are often expanded
beyond group financing and administration to group procurement and
purchasing of raw material and selling to multinational customers.
Within Europe, a number of countries have vied with each other to attract
headquarters operations. A number of countries including France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK have all offered so-called 'cost
plus' arrangements.
In essence, this means tax authorities have been prepared to apply transfer
pricing rules on the provision of group administrative services on the basis
of a profit mark-up element charged over the cost of providing the services
to group companies. The attraction of such arrangements for multinational
companies is that they bring certainty to the overall tax position of the
group by agreeing in advance the contribution of those activities to the
group as a whole.
The manner in which the arrangements are provided varies enormously.
The UK, for example, which attracts the highest number of headquarters
operations in Europe, has no formal rulings process. Others, such as the
Belgium Coordination Centre, have a formal legal basis. Similarly, although
the cost plus arrangement is widely used, the actual application varies from
country to country.
The profit mark-up may range anywhere between 5 and and 30 per cent.
The costs which are to be included and excluded also vary from one country
to another. Similarly, all activities are not viewed in the same way by all
tax authorities. Activities which relate directly to the business of the
multinational company itself such as group purchasing or selling will
probably be most closely scrutinised.
A second important headquarters function is that of group holding company.
In Europe, this market has historically been dominated by the Netherlands
with other countries such as Luxembourg or Austria playing a very much
secondary role.
The passing of the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive has however opened up the
playing field considerably. The Directive requires EU member states to
eliminate withholding tax on dividends to parent companies in other EU
member states.
It also requires member states where parent companies are located
effectively to eliminate double taxation on these distributions by either
exempting them from tax or giving credit for corporate income tax paid by
the subsidiary.
The impact of this Directive and amendments that have been made in several
member states offer a wider variety of choice to the multinational company
in choosing a European group holding company location.
Although the UK attracts a significant number of administrative headquarters
operations, the impact of Advance Corporation Tax previously placed the UK
off-limits as a holding company location.
The introduction of an International Headquarters Company Regime in the 1994
Finance Act is a move towards attracting such companies. An International
Headquarters Company is one that is essentially foreign owned. No ACT is
payable on dividends paid to its foreign parent company out of dividends
received from its own foreign subsidiaries. The new regime falls short of
the ideal requirements for an international holding company, but is widely
regarded as a step in the right direction.
Other centralised activities such as group financing or licensing operations
are highly sensitive to the tax environment.
Since they are not dependent for their operations on a physical
establishment, these operations are carried out in many cases away from the
headquarters in locations such as the Netherlands or the Irish Dublin Docks
area.
No single country fulfils all the wishes of a typical multinational group
and therefore the various activities are spread among a number of countries.
Personal taxation of executives forms a crucial element in the package to
attract international headquarters operations.
Again a number of countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands offer
attractive tax regimes aimed at foreign executives on secondment. This is an
area where the UK has traditionally held the lead.
Its long established system of taxing non-domiciled individuals is regarded
as one of the central features in maintaining London's preeminence as an
international financial centre.
