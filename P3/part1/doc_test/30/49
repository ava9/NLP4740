LONDON FORUM, the private-sector body set up to promote London as a business
location and tourist centre, is to create two organisations to attract
inward investment and expand tourism, Sir Allen Sheppard, Forum chairman and
chairman of Grand Metropolitan, announced yesterday.
London Inward will encourage business investment with emphasis on persuading
international businesses to locate their headquarters in the capital. Led by
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, it plans to take over the
First Stop Shop created by the City Corporation, Westminster City Council
and London Docklands Development Corporation to provide information for
inward investors. London Visitors will try to raise income from tourism by
developing existing markets and targeting new markets in Japan, the European
Community and the US.
It hopes to merge with the London Tourist Board.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said London needed to fight harder
in world markets to maintain and raise its share of future opportunities. He
added: 'We must all make the most of every opportunity to tell the world
what London has to offer.' The deputy chairmen of the London Forum board
are: Sir Hugh Bidwell, chairman London Tourist Board; Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman British Airways; Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman Wembley.
The other members of the London Forum board are: Sir Christopher Bland,
chairman LWT; Mr Rocco Forte, chairman Forte; Mr Nigel Fox Bassett, senior
partner Clifford Chance; Mr Harvey Goldsmith, director Allied
Entertainments; Mr David Goldstone, chairman Regalian Properties; Ms Jan
Hall, chief executive of Coley Porter Bell; Mr Anthony Hilton, managing
director, Evening Standard; Sir Brian Jenkins, senior partner, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand and former Lord Mayor of London; Mr Keith Oates, managing director,
Marks &amp; Spencer; Mr Brian Pearce, chairman Pearce Signs; Sir Idris Pearce,
consultant Richard Ellis; Mr Ian Reeves, chairman Highpoint; Mr Maurice
Saatchi, chairman Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; Sir David Scholey, chairman SG Warburg;
Mr Clyde Williams, chief executive WWA.
