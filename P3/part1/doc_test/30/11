Emerald Systems Corp. has signed a $6-million lease to move its corporate 
headquarters from its current location at 4757 Morena Blvd. in San Diego to 
Carmel Mountain Ranch.

Grubb &amp; Ellis, the agent who negotiated the transaction, said the firm 
signed a seven-year lease for a 62,000-square-foot R &amp; D building being 
developed by Judd Development Co. on World Trade Drive. It is nearly double the 
size of the company's present facility.

Associates of San Diego.
