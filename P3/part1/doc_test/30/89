Mining, and Energy Sources: "The Chrome Industry Has Prospects 
for Development in the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Independent Trade Union of 
Miners in Albania, led by Asllan Myshku; the trade union of the 
chrome corporation, led by Sabah Pata; the "Albkrom" 
corporation; and the Ministry of Labor, Emigration, and Social 
Assistance, along with the deputy minister of industry, mining, 
and energy resources, Albert Brokaj, have held a meeting in 
Bulqize, in the largest mining center of the chrome extraction 
and processing industry. 
  During this meeting representatives of these trade unions, 
which belong to the Union of Independent Trade Unions of 
Albania, led by President Valer Xheka, brought up some important 
issues related to the collective labor contract, which they said 
was signed in a unilateral manner. They also raised issues 
related to production, the opening up of new jobs, the financing 
of new projects dealing with the development and future of the 
chrome extraction and processing industry, the urgent need to 
update technology, the creation of a joint enterprise, and 
possibilities for privatization. They wanted to know why workers 
in the corporation have not received 20-percent wage increases 
in accordance with the government decision. They were concerned 
about the sale of chrome, chrome concentrate, and ferrochrome, 
about the consequences of the embargo [against Yugoslavia] in 
the chrome extraction and processing industry and about the 
satisfaction, as soon as possible, of demands for housing and 
for the improvement of the miners' living and working 
conditions. 
  The participants in the meeting raised a number of other 
issues regarding the organization and management of work in the 
corporation and stressed the need for a bitter struggle against 
possible signs of corruption and for the further improvement of 
social assistance. 
  In their response, Deputy Minister Brokaj and the 
representatives of "Albkrom" and the Ministry of Labor, 
Emigration, and Social Assistance said that the government has 
drawn up a strategy for the chrome industry, which is a valuable 
national asset, and, therefore, the government has demonstrated 
and will continue to demonstrate concern for its continued 
development. It was pointed out that this corporation has had a 
higher hard currency income than any other corporation or 
production unit in the country and that the greater part of this 
income is used for the needs of the corporation. There are good 
possibilities for increasing this income. 
  It was stressed that the ministry must seek compensation 
from 
the United Nations for the serious consequences which this 
industry has suffered in the northeastern part of the country 
because of the embargo. At the end of the meeting the trade 
unions strongly stressed that a resolution containing the 
following demands should be issued: 
  -- the collective contracts should be re-signed, with the 
participation of all the trade unions, especially the trade 
union of the corporation, which represents about 46 percent of 
the employees; 
  -- the financial situation of the corporation should be 
improved by forgiving the taxes for 1992 and 1993; 
  -- workers should receive a 26-percent wage increase; 
  -- negotiations for the creation of a joint enterprise 
should 
be accelerated; 
  -- additional funds should be sought from the government for 
the construction of the Klosi traverse bank, the ramp, and shaft 
No. 7, which are linked to the future of the mining industry; 
  -- the price of energy for the chrome corporation, the 
largest consumer of energy, should be reduced; 
  -- the headquarters of the corporation should be transferred 
to Bulqize and the retirement age for certain categories of 
workers should be lowered. 
  The demands in this resolution will be presented to the 
government. It was decided that the collective contract would be 
re-signed on 15 April 1994 at the corporation's headquarters in 
Tirana.
