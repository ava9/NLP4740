Beleaguered Northrop is considering the shutdown of "non-productive" 
facilities, but the company is being stealthy about which locations are the 
most likely to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to answer 'what if' questions," a spokesman declares. 
</P>
<P>
Shutdowns would have the most impact on the Los Angeles-based aerospace firm's 
Southern California employees, who represent 75% of its work force. Most at 
risk are employees at the Ventura County operation, the sprawling Hawthorne 
facilities and the hilltop Palos Verdes research center. 
</P>
<P>
At Northrop's annual shareholders meeting, President Kent Kresa said: "We are 
going to continue to sell non-productive assets -- those holdings that don't 
match the business environment we see ahead of us or where we feel better use 
can be made of the assets." 
</P>
<P>
The company will eliminate 3,000 of its 41,000 jobs this year, after having 
eliminated 2,500 last year, Kresa said. With fewer people, the company will be 
left with more space than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the firm has sold its corporate headquarters in Century City and a 
manufacturing plant in Anaheim. At the end of 1989, it owned 12.9 million 
square feet of office and factory space, and it was leasing 5.6 million feet. 
Leased space was down 400,000 square feet from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has tried to sell its Palos Verdes center in recent years but was 
thwarted by city regulations that prevented potential buyers from establishing 
light-industrial operations on the property, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a gorgeous property," one source said. "A lot of it has an ocean view. 
It has an area with swans in it." 
</P>
<P>
The facility is out of sync with pressures for austerity in the aerospace 
industry arising from defense budget cuts and programs being canceled, the 
source said. The cuts have resulted in excess space for Northrop in a number of 
places, including Hawthorne, El Segundo and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has owned its Ventura County facility in Newbury Park, worth as much 
as $132 million, since the early 1960s. It has 2,000 employees. After 
developing the Tacit Rainbow cruise missile in Ventura, the company elected in 
the mid-1980s to build it in Perry, Ga. Sources say Northrop had planned at one 
point to build the missile at a new plant in Santa Maria, but that facility has 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in Ventura have grown increasingly concerned amid mounting 
speculation that Northrop will sell the facility and move remaining programs to 
Hawthorne or Georgia. "You are right on the edge of your seat," an employee 
said. "The attitude is that is going to happen at any time." 
</P>
<P>
In its aircraft and missile sectors, Northrop owns dozens of old buildings in 
Hawthorne and El Segundo, intermingled with newer facilities. Because Northrop 
has invested heavily in research facilities in Hawthorne, it is unlikely to 
abandon the Hawthorne facility entirely -- in contrast with Lockheed's move 
from Burbank. Lockheed recently announced that it would relocate several major 
programs to Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cost-cutting effort," said Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio. "We may 
shift things around from one facility to another. If we do, it may cause excess 
capacity. And if it does, we may sell that excess capacity or we may not renew 
leases." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, estimated that 
Northrop owns 218 acres of land in Hawthorne, worth $410 million. Harris 
speculates that Ventura and a substantial portion of Hawthorne could be sold 
off to help reduce the firm's $1 billion in debt. Kresa said the firm aims to 
be debt-free by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Having lost a number of programs, the industry source said, the company needs 
to consolidate. He noted that the firm ended production of the F-5 fighter last 
year and lost a competition to continue production of a key piece of the 
guidance system for the MX missile. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Northrop has excess space at its electronics division in Hawthorne and at 
its aircraft line in El Segundo on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The company is unlikely to move production of the F-18 fuselage from El Segundo 
or the Boeing 747 jetliner fuselage from Hawthorne. Large jigs used to produce 
those parts would be difficult to move and very costly to recalibrate at new 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's electronics division in Hawthorne has a relatively new assembly 
building for missile guidance systems. Although it lost the MX program, it is 
believed to be building a guidance system for the B-2 bomber at the unit. It is 
unclear whether that building could be vacated or not. 
</P>
<P>
But Northrop has dozens of small buildings scattered about the Hawthorne area 
that are strong candidates for abandonment, sources said. The buildings, 
painted drab brown in the Northrop color motif, house many of the design 
operations for the advanced tactical fighter program. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa said the company would locate the ATF development program, if it wins a 
competition against rival Lockheed, at its B-2 bomber operation in Pico Rivera. 
That decision should free up some space in Hawthorne. It also appears to be a 
strong commitment for Northrop's Pico Rivera plant, which Kresa called the 
"most modern aircraft development and manufacturing facilities in the nation."
