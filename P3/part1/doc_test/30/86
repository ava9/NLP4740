The proposal would have permitted an associational, occupational, or multiple group credit union converting to
a community charter as a result of significant corporate or military restructurings to maintain service to groups
in its field of membership prior to conversion and to add other groups within the credit union's operational area after
the conversion, but for only so long as needed to ensure the credit union's continued viability. A group consisting
of all NCUA Regional Directors and the Director of Examination and Insurance would vote to determine the necessity
of allowing the converting credit union to maintain the select employee groups. Eighteen commenters favored the
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters believed this authority should be expanded to all community charters where continued viability
is threatened by a major employer's restructuring. These commenters believed there was no reason to treat a ``converting
to'' community charter any different from existing community charters when in both cases the threat is viability
caused by similar events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though many commenters suggested abandoning the operational area requirement altogether (see ```Public Interest'
Addition Comments'' below), one in particular urged that it at least be abandoned in distress situations. Eight commenters
opposed the proposal. Two commenters stated that military credit unions should not be granted community charters
except in rare cases where an isolated base is the community. These commenters believed that in a heavily populated
area where there are many other credit unions already serving select groups, this proposal would grant an unfair advantage
to military credit unions. Six commenters approved the special administrative approval procedure but nine objected
to it.

B. NCUA Board Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is persuaded that federal credit unions of all types need additional flexibility when faced with distress
situations such as significant corporate or military restructuring. The final IRPS:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Permits federal credit unions of all types_occupational, associational, multiple group, and community_to
apply for designation as a ``distressed federal credit union'' and to do so regardless of whether they are converting
to community charter
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Permits federal credit unions with such designations to add occupational and associational groups to their
fields of membership regardless of location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an added assurance that the process is administered consistently and proper guidance is given, the NCUA Board will
reserve to itself, at least initially, the authority to grant ``distressed credit union'' designations. The Board
believes that, with this added requirement, there will be adequate controls in place to prevent abuse: There will
be a comprehensive review by the NCUA Board prior to initial designation; groups must request service in order to be
added to a distressed credit union's field of membership; the regional director must approve all expansion requests;
and normal overlap procedures will apply.

The proposal suggested only slight modifications of current policy. It stated that a proposed federal credit union
whose primary sponsor is a particular corporation may include the employees of that corporation who work at another
location, employees of the corporation who are paid from or are supervised from the headquarters location, such as
sales persons or sales agents who work at a number of locations, employees of a division or majority-owned subsidiary
of the parent company regardless of location, and employees of a related company (such as a person working regularly
for an enterprise under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with the sponsoring enterprise).
Each group to be served (e.g., majority-owned subsidiaries, contractors) was to be separately listed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the proposal that each group to be served must be separately listed. This commenter suggested
that NCUA be more lenient. Another commenter requested that if an occupational credit union furnished evidence of
its parent company's preference for one credit union, that credit union should be allowed to describe its field of
membership to include the parent and all other companies under common control. One commenter stated that the components
of a field of membership definition should be limited to legal entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the Chartering Manual does not state procedures necessary for a credit union to keep its
existing membership, if a company or a division has been sold. This commenter believes that if a company or division
is sold to a company which has a credit union, then the original credit union loses the field of membership after the
sale; otherwise, service should be allowed to continue.

2. NCUA Board Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCUA Board agrees that the wording of this portion of IRPS 89&hyph;1 pertaining to business relationships is in
need of some revision. The final IRPS has been rewritten to provide more clarity. However, the Board does not see a need
to broaden the occupational common bond definition in general at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board does believe, however, that it is a disservice to cut off service to groups which are divested from a sponsoring
firm. The final IRPS permitted continued service if the group desires it.
