FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (8): Early lettings
welcomed - Property: A difficult scene

THE LARGEST pre-let contracts in the UK, in both 1991 and 1992, were
negotiated on 170 acres of land owned by Grosvenor Waterside, the property
development arm of Associated British Ports, in one segment of Cardiff Bay.
The brick-built, flat-roofed, Welsh Health Common Services Authority
building, covering 150,000 sq ft, and costing Pounds 15m, is now approaching
completion and will be ready for occupation from September. Work is about to
start on a Pounds 16m building for NCM Credit Insurance, which will result
in the creation of a flagship 119,000 sq ft office development built to a
very high specificiation in pink granite, with an atrium, facing the inner
harbour.
Also planned for Capital Waterside, which adjoins the historic Pier Head
building, once the headquarters for all the Great Western Railway's dock
operations, are a new Welsh national opera house, which will be the subject
of an international design competition, a high quality 200-250 bed hotel,
25,000 sq ft of shops and 200 houses.
'These lettings represent a significant commitment to the bay,' according to
Mike Rees, director-in-charge of the Cardiff office of Chesterton. And Rhys
James, partner with DTZ Debenham Thorpe, adds: 'In the present climate these
deals represent real success. Now what Grosvenor Waterside has to do is to
create a better mix on the site. The group needs to find clients who will
take around 10,000 sq ft of space, so that one or two very large buildings
do not dominate. Grosvenor has planning permission for 800,000 sq ft on the
site, which is plenty of capacity for such a mix.'
Despite these two big successes, the general property scene in Cardiff has
not been any easier than elsewhere in Britain as the recession bites. 'There
are clients looking around but they cannot get rid of their present leases,
especially those wanting to move out of the south east of England,' Mr James
says.
Among those looking, according to Mike Hall, of Cooke and Arkwright, are the
Property Services Agency, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's department,
which is seeking 45,000 sq ft for a relocation from London; the insurance
group Axa, which wants about the same space; the Department of Health and
Social Services; and Maryland Bank, an American finance house which is
understood to have Cardiff as one of three potential centres for a European
operation.
Any one of these would continue the office-market momentum developed by the
health authority and NCM. The bay itself, a relatively small part of the
Welsh capital, has been successful in the past two years with a number of
high-profile names arriving, among them the Prudential which took 22,000 sq
ft a year ago at Atlantic House for a regional headquarters for 150 staff.
The bay has been given a further boost with the rescue of Alexandra Gate, a
development on the eastern edge of the bay area, the developer of which was
a local firm which subsequently went into receivership. Welsh Water is to
move its corporate headquarters from another building in the city to
Alexandra Gate, a campus-type development, with the private mining group,
Ryan, and Wales and the West Housing Association taking the other two
blocks.
These moves have met some criticism, however. Chesterton's Mr Hall argues
that the incentive packages offered through public and quasi-public sources
have made comparable city centre schemes uncompetitive.
There are about 200,000 sq ft - 18 months supply - of good-quality
accommodation available in the centre of Cardiff. The largest of these is
Principality Building Society's own development in Queen Street, the city's
main shopping street, where about 55,000 sq ft out of the 65,000 sq ft built
is still available.
Mr Hall also says that potential entrants to the bay, such as Legal and
General, and Canada Life Assurance, have been been frightened off by the
lack of speculative developments, poor access and difficult parking. 'About
100,000 sq ft of offices, both refurbished and second-hand, remain vacant at
the commercial heart of the bay at Mount Stuart Square, but poor
accessibility, specification and parking are likely to result in these
remaining vacant in the short- to medium-term.'
Cardiff rents remain, generally, below those asked in Bristol and further
east along the M4 motorway corridor. DTZ Debenham Thorpe's Mr James believes
around Pounds 16 a sq ft is as much as could be obtained. 'Two years ago we
were hoping to reach the Pounds 20 level'.
The Welsh Health Services building has been let on a 25-year full repair and
insurance lease, at an average rent for the first five years of Pounds 14.50
per sq ft with five year reviews. NCM has negotiated a 15-year lease at a
rate in excess of Pounds 15. The shorter-than-normal term represents a
compromise agreed with Grosvenor Waterside between normal UK practice and
10-year deals, common in the Netherlands where NCM is based. Cooke and
Arkwright's Mike Hall agrees that 'between Pounds 14 and Pounds 16 is about
the top of the market at the moment, especially in the bay'.
These rates, however, take no account of hidden incentives, which neither
developer nor client is willing to discuss. Mr Rees believes a client such
as the Prudential may have extracted a rent-free period equal to 12-18
months rent.
The dice are, naturally, very much loaded in the tenants' favour in the
present economic climate. 'Of all the deals done in Cardiff in the last
year,' says Mr James, 'just over 90 per cent were leasehold. That is, they
were in the tenant's favour, with attractive break clauses and rent-free
periods. The developer is now almost looking to the first rent review to
recover.'
According to Jim Fitzsimmons, the property development manager for Cardiff
Bay, the main developments will come on stream at the right time when the
economy generally is emerging from recession. A key area is known as the
Bridge, located between the city centre and the bay. Here around 1m sq ft of
office development is planned around a new city square at the top of the
main highway out of the bay. 'Once the barrage is completed we expect a
strong level of interest. We will have large amounts of land available, too,
at this time,' Fitzsimmons argues.
Elsewhere there is strong activity at the moment in the retail sector, with
Comet, MFI and McDonalds going to an out-of-town location developed by
television contractor HTV, near a recently opened site on which both Tesco
and Marks and Spencer have stores. In the city centre, too, there is
interest in a development being undertaken on the site of a former Allders
store in the main Queen Street shopping thoroughfare by a London and
Edinburgh Trust (LET) and BICC joint venture.
Known as Queen's Arcade, it is planned to open at Easter 1994, with the
largest units totallling around 25,000 sq ft. Pre-lets have been arranged
with Dolcis, Argos and Leeds Permanent building society, and others are
expected in the next few weeks. Tesco is also taking a prestige site for a
superstore on the western side of the barrage in Penarth Haven, where a
successful marina and housing development has already taken place.
On the industrial side, the Bay has three fully-serviced sites at Ocean
Park, Pengam and Tremorfa. Sites at the 100-acre Ocean Park, which has been
zoned for B1/B2 development, are being offered at Pounds 150,000 per acre on
a 999-year lease with an option to convert to full freehold for a peppercorn
sum. The development is expected eventually to provide 1.2m sq ft of factory
floor space, 150.000 sq ft of offices, 300 homes and 30,000 sq ft of leisure
facilities.
According to the CBDC, there are signs of renewed interest among developers,
with a number of interested parties talking about schemes in the region of
140,000sq ft to 180,000 sq ft.
