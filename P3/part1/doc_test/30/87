<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Notice indicated that the location of CS Holding and Affiliates is New York, New York. The applicant states that
the corporate headquarters of CS Holding is actually located in Zurich, Switzerland, and its affiliates operate
in a variety of worldwide locations. Accordingly, the exemption heading has been amended to include this information.

2. The operative exemption language in the Notice concluded with the following phrase: ``*&blank;*&blank;* including
any current or future affiliate of CS Holding, other than BLL, which in the future may become eligible to serve as a QPAM
under PTE 94&hyph;14.'' The applicant requests, in the interests of completeness and accuracy, that the words ``is
or'' be inserted between the words ``which'' and ``in''. In response to this request, the operative exemption language
in the final exemption includes the requested insertion, and the phrase reads as follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;* including
any current or future affiliate of CS Holding, other than BLL, which is, or in the future may become, eligible to serve
as a QPAM under PTE 94&hyph;14.''

3. The Notice states that the proposed exemption was requested ``on behalf of CS Holding affiliates that are banks,
investment banking firms, or registered investment advisers which are or may become eligible to serve as QPAMs.''
The applicant comments that it is more accurate to state that the proposed exemption was requested ``on behalf of CS
Holding affiliates that include banks, investment banking firms, and investment advisers which are, or may become,
eligible to serve as QPAMs.''

by the applicant's comment.
