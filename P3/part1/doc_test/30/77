AMI'S NEW CHIEF WIELDS SCALPEL TO CUT HEAVY DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: HARRY J. GRAY BELIEVES THAT HIS EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER HEAD OF 
UNITED TECHNOLOGIES WILL HELP HIM IN HIS QUEST TO LIGHTEN THE DEBT BURDEN OF 
THE RECENT BUYOUT.

In the 1970s as head of United Technologies, Harry J. Gray was one of the 
master builders of the giant conglomerate. Today, as chairman of American 
Medical International, Gray has traded his trowel for a scalpel as he tries to 
whittle down the hospital company that he and a group of investors acquired 
last October for $1.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, the 70-year-old executive said he doesn't intend to 
dismantle AMI, but he has moved aggressively on his predecessors' plans to sell 
$1 billion in AMI assets and drastically reduce the corporate staff to cope 
with the buyout debt. To date, Gray said AMI has sold two hospitals for about 
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
AMI has stated a goal of reducing the corporate staff to about 400 people from 
about 1,000 (down from about 1,500 last year) who work in Beverly Hills, Marina 
del Rey, Costa Mesa and field offices outside California. Gray said he expects 
that there will be about 100 people at the new corporate headquarters when the 
company completes a planned move to Dallas from Beverly Hills. The company may 
also make more cuts in its data processing operations in Marina del Rey and 
Costa Mesa, he said. "We've had a lot of data processing that may not be 
absolutely necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When AMI announced its move last month, the Beverly Hills headquarters had 
about 200 people, and the Marina del Rey and Orange County sites combined had 
about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Before his involvement with AMI, Gray's closest look at the health-care 
industry was from the perspective of a patient -- one lying flat on his back in 
traction. More than two decades ago, he suffered a serious motorcycle accident 
that shattered his thighs and put him on crutches for eight months. He sealed 
his reputation for toughness and tenacity when he moved his office into the 
hospital, missing only two days of work. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts caution that hospitals present a unique set of management problems for 
Gray. For one thing, demand for services is largely beyond the control of 
managers, they said, and hospitals in particular are under pressure from 
competitors to maintain costly equipment while government and private insurers 
demand that they limit patient stays and justify their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although his management experience has been mostly in defense industries, Gray 
said his experience with service companies owned by United Technologies will 
apply to AMI. "I find it rather comfortable moving into AMI. There are quite a 
few analogies I find helpful, especially in cost control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the health-care industry has not been sufficiently attentive to 
controlling costs. "To survive, they must deliver quality on a cost-effective 
basis," Gray said. AMI has already implemented an incentive program for 
hospital executive directors. The managers win and lose points based on how 
they manage their working capital, how discharged patients respond to an 
independent survey on the quality of their treatment and an outside review of 
the performance of the hospital's doctors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The program thus far has resulted in some "pleasant" surprises, Gray said. Some 
of the hospitals targeted for sale because of lackluster performance are doing 
better. That doesn't necessarily mean that they won't be sold, but it "does 
make them more palatable" to potential buyers. Hospitals that were targeted for 
sale, he said, were those that could not produce enough operating cash flow to 
pay for capital improvements and to contribute their share of the total AMI 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
AMI intends to sell all 23 of its foreign hospitals and about seven of the 
domestic hospitals, leaving the restructured AMI to operate about 40 hospitals. 
Despite analysts' worries that AMI would not get the best prices for the 
hospitals because the industry has far more hospitals for sale than buyers, 
Gray said the two AMI hospitals sold so far attracted bids higher than 
expected. The company sold its Singapore hospital and a facility in North Miami 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said his goal is not only to pare costs at AMI, but to foster a new 
"corporate culture." He explained: "Our purpose is to convince the people who 
are not directly associated with a hospital that their function in life is to 
serve the hospitals." To foster that, Gray said the new corporate headquarters 
will be known as the "service center." Gray said the role of chief executive 
was not one that he envisioned for himself when he decided last year that AMI 
was a good investment. IMA Acquisition Corp., jointly owned by Gray's 
investment firm and First Boston Corp., won a bidding contest for AMI triggered 
last spring when a group led by M. Lee Pearce, an AMI director and major 
shareholder, proposed to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no intent to go back into active management," Gray said, explaining 
that he had little choice when AMI Chairman and Chief Executive Richard 
Gilleland resigned suddenly after the buyout. Gilleland had been brought to AMI 
less than a year earlier after successfully turning around a troubled Texas 
health-care concern. Shareholders, dissatisfied with the pace of AMI's recovery 
from a $97.3-million loss in 1986, had pressured Gilleland's predecessor, 
Walter Weisman, to resign in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gilleland said earlier that he didn't want to invest in an AMI buyout and 
decided he didn't want to manage the company long term, Gray said. "I think he 
did the best that he could for the shareholders. I think he was surprised that 
others wanted to buy the company," he said. Gilleland couldn't be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts speculated that Gilleland resigned because he feared that Gray 
would demand too big of a decision-making role after he joined the board upon 
completion of the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
As head of United Technologies for 14 years, Gray was known for a reluctance to 
share power and groom a successor. Four men who might have succeeded him as 
chairman either quit or were forced to resign, associates said. Gray was 
accused of ordering the bugging of the home and office of one of the company's 
presidents before the man's resignation. But a committee of United Technologies 
directors cleared him in an internal investigation conducted in 1984, and Gray 
has always steadfastly denied the alleged bugging. That same year, as Gray 
neared the mandatory retirement age of 65, directors forced him to choose a 
successor. Gray retired at the end of 1986 and was succeeded by Robert F. 
Daniell, who was earlier elected president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
A Georgia native who started his career in sales, Gray held various posts at 
Litton Industries in California in the 1950s and '60s. He became United 
Technologies' president in 1971. By the time he left, he had built the 
Hartford, Conn.-based company from a $2-billion aerospace company to a 
$16.3-billion conglomerate and a leading defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Some people called him "the shark" and "Jack the Ripper" for his record of 
successful takeovers, such as that of Otis Elevator and Carrier Corp. If there 
is a notable blemish on Gray's record as a shrewd manager, it was United 
Technologies' 1982 involvement in the complicated takeover battle between 
Bendix Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. United Technologies baffled many 
observers when it jumped into the fray as an ally of Martin Marietta, which had 
responded to an unsolicited takeover bid from Bendix by attempting to swallow 
Bendix instead. Of the companies involved in the so-called Pac Man war, United 
Technologies emerged relatively unscathed as Allied Corp. leaped in and 
swallowed Bendix, and Martin Marietta remained independent at a huge cost.
