UNITED Parcel Service (UPS), the world's largest parcel delivery company,
has had four homes in its 85-year history.
It began in Seattle as the American Messenger Service; moved to New York in
1930; shifted up the Long Island Sound in 1975 to the plush suburb of
Greenwich, Connecticut. Then, last year, it relocated to Atlanta.
The decision to move south has been attributed in large part to the
all-too-familiar failings of the New York area. UPS employees found that
housing in the Greenwich area had become hugely expensive and their
willingness to relocate from other offices to the company's headquarters was
dwindling. The time taken in making travel connections in New York City
itself - getting to either John F Kennedy or La Guardia airport, for example
 -was wasteful.
There was, moreover, an intensifying dichotomy between UPS's plain image,
and the sumptuous area in which the corporate headquarters was housed. UPS,
a private company owned largely by its employees, has nutured an egalitarian
culture. Executives travel coach class, for example, and everyone eats in
the same cafeteria. Greenwich, with its yacht-packed marina and manicured
lawns, is usually viewed as a home of Wall Street bankers and corporate
big-wigs.
UPS's search for a new headquarters was masterminded at the highest levels
within the company - and amid a good deal of secrecy, lest employees became
unsettled. It also called on the services of a specialist 'site-selection'
consultancy which, with top management, drew up a shortlist of three cities:
Dallas, Baltimore and Atlanta.
Today, UPS attributes the choice of Atlanta to a handful of different
factors. First, the Georgia city seemed to address many of the problems
which had occured in Greenwich. Housing, for instance, was still affordable
 -and in fairly good supply, In addition, the physical characteristics of
the region bore some resemblance to New England, suggesting that employees
would not feel hopelessly displaced.
Second, UPS was looking towards moving into a community where, although it
would be a big corporation, it would not be the dominant employer.
Third, the city scored fairly highly in terms of 'quality of life' issues.
And finally, like many other companies moving to Atlanta, UPS saw the city's
communications as an immense advantage.
UPS has been expanding heavily in Europe recently; it reckons that its
managers take 18,000 'flight segments' a year. The large and extremely
convenient network of flights available from Hartsfield International
Airport looked like an invaluable asset.
Once announced, the choice proved popular with employees. UPS says that
about 96 per cent of its managerial staff elected to move and 60 per cent of
its administrative employees. This worked out at about 700 people
altogether. Today, the delivery company employs about 1,150 people in the
Atlanta headquarters, compared with about 1,000 in Greenwich.
Not everything was perfect, however. UPS still does not have a single head
office building; it splits its operations between leased space in four
separate buildings. A new headquarters is scheduled to be constructed - if
all goes according to plan, this will open in 1995. Only then will UPS's
move south be complete.
