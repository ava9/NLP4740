  [Text] In an inflexible attitude and rejecting talks to 
study their demands which have been proposed by the government, 
a small group of former Government Ministry soldiers have 
carried out coercive pressure at the UN headquarters. The 
government has decided to discontinue discussing their demands 
until they stop the pressure. The government will enforce the 
state of law and guarantee the country's institutionalization. 
  The Government Ministry was scheduled to meet with this 
group, and Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who has been sick for the 
past three days, authorized a ministry delegation, including 
deputy ministers, to meet with the group. At first, however, the 
protesters stubbornly refused to hold the meeting, demanding 
Minister Mendieta attend the meeting. 
  This same group has occupied the Managua Cathedral twice 
before. They also tried to ruin the awards ceremony when 
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani visited our country 
recently. 
  The government delegation talked to representatives of the 
Nicaraguan Human Rights Center to persuade it to convince the 
protesters to change their minds regarding their demands that 
the minister be present at the meeting. The protesters agreed 
but, at the same time, a small group of protesters began 
exerting pressure at the UN headquarters. The government 
decided not to continue talking to them until they stop exerting 
pressure at the UN headquarters. The Government Ministry 
reiterates its willingness to advance the state of law and 
guarantee the democratic development of the country's 
institutionalization. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 0029 GMT on 10 Mar 94 cites 
Managua radio stations as reporting that "at least 50 former 
Sandinist soldiers occupied today, Wednesday, the building where 
the UN headquarters is located in Nicaragua to pressure Violeta 
Chamorro's government to compensate them for retiring to 
civilian life." ACAN adds that according to media sources, the 
former soldiers "are holding Francesco Vincenti, UN 
representative in Nicaragua, at the UN installation," and they 
want him to mediate to get the Nicaraguan Government to accept 
their demands. The report adds: "A riot police contingent has 
cordoned off the UN building, located near Plaza Espana, in the 
southwestern part of Managua."]
