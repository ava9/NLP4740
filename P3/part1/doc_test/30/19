CHICAGO WAS founded on the brawn of meatpackers and steelmakers at the
conjunction of the nation's biggest rail and water corridors. The
meatpackers have gone and the steel mills are struggling, but good transport
and proximity to the raw materials of agriculture and basic industry remain
the mainstay of corporate activity.
The commodity and stock exchanges, early outgrowths of midwest agriculture,
have made Chicago the financial centre of the region, and given it an unique
international flavour. Deals linking trade with London, Sydney and Tokyo are
frequent front-page news.
Economists say the diversity of the city's economy is what saved it from the
dramatic ups and downs seen elsewhere during the boom and bust of the 1980s.
Despite its heavy industry, the area avoided rustbelt rot. That's not to say
there hasn't been a slowdown. Many leading company's have seen their growth
stalled, and others, already lean, are downscaling further.
Values in Chicago's residential real estate market dipped only slightly in
the past two years, in part because they never really experienced a
speculative buying frenzy. As with the rest of the US, Chicago's commercial
real estate market is overbuilt, and financing for some of the city's
downtown showplaces is now quietly under renegotiation.
Chicago was one of the last cities in the US to stop building skyscrapers,
and so, analysts say, will be among the last to digest the excess.
The city's agriculture and heavy industry base saw a regional recession very
early in the 1980s, suffering from international competition and a strong
dollar. The experience forced serious cost restructuring, and the companies
that survived, according to Mr Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern
Trust, are competitively positioned for the expected global economic
recovery.
These companies include the state's metal-benders like its biggest exporter
Caterpillar, Navistar (formerly International Harvester), Deere (which makes
agricultural machinery), and an array of small businesses that process steel
and manufacture parts for the auto and trucking industries. Stock gurus
think the companies read like a shopping list for president-elect Bill
Clinton, who has promised to revive the flagging economy by rebuilding the
country's infrastructure.
At the south end of the city, a small revival is occuring as companies
employ the cheap property and skilled labour left by the cutbacks in
manufacturing there. Australian-owned Welded Tube Company of America is
undergoing a Dollars 40m expansion in the Lake Calumet area, and other
companies are also retooling. However, the area's recovery was dealt a blow
when a plan to site Chicago's third airport near Lake Calumet failed this
summer.
Favourable exchange rates supported exports and revived moribund companies
like Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker and the area's largest exporter.
Illinois, including the Chicago area, had Dollars 16.5bn in exports in 1991,
the bulk of it heavy equipment, chemicals, and agricultural goods. Had they
been included in the export accountings, Chicago would have ranked near the
top of the country in the export of financial services and trading
technology. Canada, Japan and Mexico are the state's biggest trading
partners. Goods shipped to Mexico jumped 23 per cent in 1991, reaching
Dollars 1bn, and offsetting small export declines to the UK and Japan.
While Illinois exports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crops annually,
the city gains most of its agricultural profits from processing. Downstate
giant Archer Daniels Midland and its competitors have plants in the Chicago
area that produce high-fructose corn syrup, ethanol, starches, animal feed
and vegetable oils. The processed materials supply Chicago's big food
companies like Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and United Biscuits' subsidiary
Keebler. ADM alone exports about Dollars 3bn in farm products annually.
Foreign direct investment in Chicago and its surrounding counties levelled
off in 1992, after growing dramatically in the previous decade. KPMG Peat
Marwick's 1992 survey of inbound investment in Illinois counts 617
foreign-owned companies headquartered in the state, up from 173 a decade
ago. Most are located in the Chicago area. Of the 312 companies that
responded to the survey, 132 were Japanese, followed by Britain with 47, and
Germany with 41. They represent combined employment of 30,417, and capital
investment of Dollars 1.9bn. Fourth-five per cent of those surveyed said
they planned to expand.
Brawny industry is just the underpinning to a strong service-based economy.
The city boasts the greatest number of Fortune 500 corporate headquarters
outside New York. Drug and high-technology companies dot Chicago's suburbs.
Multinational giants like McDonald's, Waste Management, United Airlines and
Motorola are based there, though their operations and workforces are
scattered around the globe.
Although the November issue of Fortune magazine named Chicago as one of the
nation's top 10 cities for business, not all of the city's corporate
citizens would agree.
Chicago's bad public school system and the pull of a better-prepared
suburban workforce has begun to drain corporate interest from the downtown
area. Sears, the financial and merchandising giant, is relocating its
36,000-plus Chicago workforce from its trophy mid-town office tower to a new
campus in suburban Hoffman Estates. The decision was made in advance of this
summer's news that Sears plans to break up and spin off many of its
operations in order to concentrate on its retailing core.
High taxes, heavily organised labour, and limited availability of suitable
land parcels for expansion are forcing some companies out of the area
entirely. Spiegel, the retail and catalogue giant, will pull its
127-year-old operation out of Chicago in early 1994, and relocate the 2,200
jobs to Columbus, Ohio. It already has a non-unionised facility there, where
there is an adequate site for expansion.
In an effort to stem the outflow, the city last summer floated a Dollars
160m bond issue to finance infrastructure improvements. One of the first
projects to benefit will be a planned relocation of the city's vital South
Water Street produce market to a 62-acre facility on the west side. City
planners say the site offers more viable truck routes as well as modern
facilities.
Improvements are also under way at O'Hare, which is in a tough battle with
Houston to keep its place as the country's premier airport. A plush new
international terminal is scheduled to open next summer. The new
construction, first priced at Dollars 470m, has experienced cost overruns,
and may leave the city holding a bill for Dollars 600m. Air France recently
opened an Dollars 18m cargo-handling facility at O'Hare, a nod to the
fastest growing segment of the airport's business.
