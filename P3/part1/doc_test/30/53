overseas / Profile of NFC

WHEN NFC, the UK-based transport and logistics giant, decided to pack up its
Home Services Division and move to North America a year ago, it was not
looking for cheaper labour, a more favourable tax climate or relief from
trade barriers. Its aim was to place a corporate division in the heart of
its increasingly international business and in the process raise the
company's profile in the minds of US investors.
Best known in Britain for its Pickfords and Hoults Group home moving
services, NFC viewed the US and Canada as prime markets for business
expansion and sources of fresh investment capital. The company, which
advertises itself as 'the world's largest mover', has in recent years
struggled to keep its UK operations profitable. A moribund UK property
market has halved the company's home moving business there and had also
depressed results from the home delivery services NFC's Merchants Group
provides for UK retailers.
Other sectors of NFC businesses have also come under fire, with its big
Logistics group undergoing reorganisation in 1991. Successive losses in its
Pickford Travel unit resulted in the sale of the unit in 1991, with the
remainder of NFC's Travel and Property division being scaled down.
Until UK interest rates decline and the domestic home mortgage market
revives, NFC executives are looking to geographic expansion and product
innovations to fuel growth, particularly in the Home Services division.
When the division moved to North America, NFC was already deriving 30 per
cent of its profits from US and Canadian operations and wanted to expand
non-UK profits to 50 per cent by the end of 1992.
So Mr Denis Olliver, NFC's managing director of the Home Services Division,
was not entirely surprised when the company's chief executive, Mr Jack
Mather, called him into the Bedford, UK executive suite in early 1991 and
suggested Mr Olliver move, with his divisional staff, to the US.
'While NFC has significant employee ownership, we had just converted the
ratio of our ADRs from one for one, to one for five. That increased the face
value of the shares and - we hoped - would attract institutional investor
interest in the US.
'The relocation had become a shareholder issue. We wanted more visibility in
the US and Canada,' Mr Olliver said.
From a personal perspective, the relocation order was more of a jolt. 'I had
just that afternoon signed a contract for a new house. My wife had wanted to
move closer to her mother and we had found a place just 8 miles away,' Mr
Olliver says. and 'I told her we were moving, but that it was not going to
be eight miles away from her mother, it was going to be 4,000.'
Aside from the shareholder issues, the scope of NFC's North American
operations made it strategically important that one UK member of the NFC
Board should have a North American perspective and be available to the US
and Canadian business managers for direct communication.
The company owns Illinois-based Allied Van Lines, the second or
third-largest of the 23 leading van lines in the US, depending on the
measure used. Orange and Black Allied trucks move households across the US,
with Allied's profits holding at Dollars 16m in 1991, in spite of a
faltering US economy. NFC bolstered its home moving business this year by
acquiring Allied Van Lines, Canada. It also operates Pickfords, Canada.
Another divisional business, California-based Merchants Home Delivery
Service, was growing rapidly through acquisitions and successful marketing.
Merchants' trucks and staff perform home deliveries of appliances and
furniture for some of the US's largest retailers, including Sears, J C
Penny's and Federated Department Stores, the parent of Bloomingdales.
Merchants, which had income of Dollars 40m in 1985, grew to a Dollars 120m
business in 1991.
Separate from the Home Services Division, but still in North America,
NFC-owned Exel Logistics was building a reputation as one of the largest
independent providers of warehousing and distribution services in the US.
Anxious to accomplish the relocation relatively swiftly, NFC executives
narrowed potential sites to Atlanta and three US cities where the subsidiary
businesses were already headquartered.
Atlanta, with its warm weather, active international airport and friendly
business climate was attractive but the suburban Chicago location was
finally selected.
'First, we liked its central location, within the US and globally. We have
operations in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Europe and the UK. In
the UK we only had a one-hour overlap in the business day with Australia. In
Chicago we overlap by several hours with the UK and Australia - we like the
timeliness, the improved communications,' Mr Olliver said.
Since Allied already had a well-established infrastructure in Chicago, NFC
had only to move the core of its Home Services staff. Legal, marketing, and
other support staff were already in place. The marriage of the Allied office
into a corporate divisional headquarters had the added benefit of giving US
employees there more promotional opportunities within NFC. Although NFC
employees are unionised in the UK, they are not in the US, and union issues
were not a factor in the NFC move.
A big factor in the selection process for the globe-trotting executive was
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. A new international terminal is due
to open at O'Hare in mid-1993. The state-of-the art terminal will double the
amount of square footage devoted to international travellers and will have
21 gates, 156 ticketing postions and 68 customs inspections stations. A
'people-mover' system will transport weary travellers to the central core of
the airport.
NFC did not seek tax or other incentives from Chicago or Illinois to sweeten
the move. 'There wasn't time and I don't believe in them,' Mr Olliver said.
However, he said that Allied Van Lines did accept a tax and training
incentive package from Mr Jim Thompson, then the governor of Illinois, after
it considered a move to Texas several years ago.
The move - predictably for a company in the moving business - went well.
Executives say NFC is already benefitting from having input with 'an
American point of view'. The cultural import was first seen in a revamp of
the Home Services Division's marketing literature. 'Everything we sent out
to shareholders, all our communications, have been completely
de-Anglicised,' Mr Olliver says.
He says the managers of NFC's American companies now believe NFC has a
better feel for their businesses. He also thinks that he gets a fresh
viewpoint and exposure to new ideas. 'What we try to do here is not keep
re-inventing the wheel. If something is working in California, we try to see
how it would work across all our operations. We have a real exchange of
ideas worldwide.'
Illinois-based NFC executives have also assisted in a Dollars 20m computer
revamp at Allied, a measure the company is undertaking to diversify Allied's
services and leave it positioned for growth as the US economy recovers.
Real financial dividends of the relocation have yet to be measured. NFC was
due to release its 1992 financial report in early October. Mr Olliver says
the fading US economy will keep the Home Services division results flat for
the year, but that revenue declines are not expected.
