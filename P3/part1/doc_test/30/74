According to the applicant, the Canadian Standards Association is an independent, not-for-profit organization
governed by a Board of Directors selected by the membership, providing integrated services in the fields of standards
development and conformity assessment. The Standards Division of CSA is responsible for the administration of the
development of voluntary consensus standards. The Certification and Testing Division provides conformity assessment
programs including laboratory testing, certification, inspection and quality management services. The organization
started out in 1919 as the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA), which was changed in 1944 to the present
name.

The applicant states that during the last 70 years, CSA has developed more than 1,400 standards and codes which cover
industrial and consumer products and services in a wide range of product areas. In 1940, CSA began to test and certify
products and today is an international organization with more than 9,000 volunteer members from 20 countries representing,
among others, consumers, and regulators. They are supported by a staff of approximately 1,000 employees.

Again according to the applicant, over 14,000 manufacturers worldwide use CSA's testing and certification services,
and the CSA Certification Mark appears on over one billion products a year. CSA processes some 36,000 engineering
projects, and the inspection staff makes follow-up visits to some 19,000 factories in almost 60 different countries,
each year.

The Certification and Testing Division's Engineering and Quality Assurance (EQA) Office reports to the Vice President
in charge of the Certification and Testing Division. The Eastern, Central, and Pacific Operations as well as each
of the Regional Offices has a Quality Assurance Office. The Regional Quality Assurance Offices have a reporting relationship
with the respective Operations Quality Assurance Office, and with the EQA from the corporate headquarters.

The Regional Quality Assurance Offices are responsible for quality assurance at their respective facilities. The
Operations Quality Assurance Offices are responsible for quality assurance not only of their respective operations
but also of all of the regions within their operations. The Engineering and Quality Assurance Office is responsible
for the Certification and Testing Division's quality assurance, including all Operations and Regions.

The Certification and Testing Division's (C&amp;T) Divisional Director of Engineering and Quality Assurance (EQA)
establishes the quality assurance philosophy for the three operations, the Eastern, Central, and Pacific. The EQA
uses Divisional Quality Documents (DQD) to establish Quality Assurance Procedures, Certification and Testing
Division Operating Procedures (CDOP) and so-called Test Packs to provide evaluation procedures for products submitted
for testing, Technical Information Letters (TIL) to document technical interpretations of standards, and Engineering
Policy Supplements (EPS) to provide policies.

The CSA audit structure is multilevel. EQA audits the regions, the Operations Quality Assurance Office audits the
regions, and the Regional Quality Assurance Offices perform self-audits. In addition, outside agencies such as
the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) perform yearly audits which involve EQA representation during the audit. For
example, Edmonton and Moncton were subjected to at least five audits, and Winnipeg at least four audits, since July
of 1991. In addition, specific technical audits of each Region are performed by the Senior Technical Engineer from
the concerned Operation's Quality Assurance Office.
