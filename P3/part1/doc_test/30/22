headquarters

Few London buildings exude as much corporate self-confidence as the
neo-classical monolith of Imperial Chemical House at Number Nine Millbank,
headquarters, since 1926, of one of Britain's biggest industrial companies.
The pomp of the stone and granite exterior is matched by the grandeur of its
ultra-modern interior.
A Pounds 30m refurbishment in 1988 replaced the original oak-panelled
corridors and rabbit-warren of offices with a set of wall-to-floor glass
offices arranged around a transparent atrium.
A sense of corporate identity is stamped on the building by a huge atrium
carpet made from ICI-produced fibres and the vibrant, modern oil paintings,
commissioned for ICI, which line the walls.
Given the strong sense of identity associated with the building, it is
poignant that ICI has now decided to move to smaller and cheaper premises.
ICI's headquarters staff numbered 2,000 two decades ago. Now, following
decentralisation, retrenchment and the demerger of Zeneca, ICI's bioscience
offshoot which has moved to new premises, there are only 240 people based at
Millbank. By the end of 1995, the figure will have been reduced to 150.
ICI's decision to rethink its occupancy of the Millbank site is being
mirrored by similar cost-cutting decisions on property at its subsidiaries
throughout the UK.
Since ICI has set itself targets on return on capital of at least 20 per
cent, it needs to make its assets work. In addition, restructuring, job cuts
and disposals of non-core and under-performing businesses have added to the
backlog of property problems to be solved.
The job of overhauling ICI's portfolio of 400 properties and 30,000 acres of
land has fallen to Mr Andrew Sturt, a former developer who became a
consultant to ICI in October 1991, following Mr Ronnie Hampel's appointment
as chief executive.
Mr Hampel's decision to appoint a property consultant reflects the view at
ICI that there was an insufficient awareness of the importance of property.
Mr Hampel believes property should be viewed as an asset, rather than as a
resource.
For the past decade ICI has operated without a group property manager and
decisions relating to property have inevitably been handled on an ad hoc
basis.
'There was a lack of a property dimension in decision-making,' says Mr
Sturt.
Such an approach had it drawbacks, principally a lack of flexibility. ICI
would build premises in locations which appeared to be cheap. However, the
premises were often unsuitable for occupation by another tenant, which made
them difficult to dispose of once ICI had ceased to require them. 'It is a
burden that was totally unnecessary,' says Mr Sturt.
Recession, the decline of manufacturing industry and, in some cases, the
contamination of land has exacerbated the problems of disposing of property
in difficult locations. In Harrogate, for example, ICI owns a large expanse
of vacant offices, laboratories and 70 acres of land on a site that was
formerly the headquarters of ICI Fibres.
The difficulty in cases such as these is in obtaining planning permission
for a change of use for the site. The scale of recent job losses in
Harrogate has made the local authority reluctant to allow a change of use
for land that was previously used for employment generating purposes.
Sometimes, circumstances change with time and a problematic property can
become valuable. Near Bristol, for instance, ICI owns 1,500 acres of surplus
land on a site acquired in 1957 to accommodate a petrochemicals plant. The
plant occupies 370 acres, while the remainder of the land, which was
originally earmarked for the expansion of the plant, has so far been unused.
But the construction nearby of the second Severn Crossing and the addition
of an intersection to the M49 motorway could make the site valuable.
ICI will seek planning permission later this month to build 2 1/4 m square
feet of warehouses on a third of the site. It intends to seek institutional
partners to build the warehouses, which will be up to 300,000 sq ft in size.
In other cases, it is hard to imagine anything that could add value to a
site. In Dumfries, Scotland, ICI owns a 100,000 sq ft office building, built
in the 1960s. Only a handful of people occupy the building and ICI has
little chance of finding new tenants given the poor local demand for
offices.
In the case of the Dumfries building, the decision to locate a business in
an out-of-the-way spot dates back to a decision taken during the second
world war to find a manufacturing location beyond the reach of German
bombers. But many of ICI's surplus premises stem from more recent decisions.
In Welwyn, for instance, ICI is trying to dispose of a four-year old,
120,000 sq ft building that was built to house the headquarters of its films
division. Following restructuring and relocation, only a handful of people
now occupy the building. 'As soon as the headquarters was completed, the
rationale for it had gone,' says Mr Sturt.
A similar situation, on a larger scale, has arisen with ICI's group
headquarters at Millbank. The building has several unused floors as a result
of ICI's restructuring and, in particular, the demerger of Zeneca.
However, sub-letting space at Millbank is not a viable solution. The
building's design offers insufficient privacy if shared by two companies.
company.
Instead of sub-letting the surplus space, ICI plans to find itself new
premises, obtain a new tenant for the existing premises and then sell its
Millbank building, together with two adjacent buildings it owns that are let
to the government.
Finding new premises is proving difficult, given ICI's intention to remain
close to the City and Westminster, its need for car parking spaces and its
insistence on easy access for visitors.
Mr Sturt has been unimpressed with the 100 buildings he seen so far. 'What
is in the market at the moment is disappointing,' he says.
The problem of property disposal highlights the question of whether
corporate buildings should be owned or leased. The case for owning
production plant is strong, for example, because of the necessity to invest
large amounts of capital in specialist equipment.
For other types of property, such as offices, however, there is a strong
case for renting, rather than owning property. 'With the pressure on the
businesses to achieve a 20-30 per cent return on capital, it is crazy to be
investing in a low-yielding property asset. It is putting a millstone around
the neck of businesses,' says Mr Sturt.
'Planning for business is relatively short term compared with even a decade
ago,' he argues. 'There is no point in investing in premises for ever.'
