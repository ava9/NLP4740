ANHEUSER-Busch, the US brewery group, said yesterday that it would reduce
its white-collar workforce by 10 per cent before the end of next year as
part of package of 'significant organisational and operational changes'.
The company said the restructuring would help it cut costs by about Dollars
100m a year beginning in 1994.
It would realise additional savings of Dollars 300m a year by 1997 by
accelerating a modernisation programme at 13 breweries.
In the announcement, which was made after the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the company said the restructuring programme would
result in a one-time pre-tax charge of about Dollars 565m, or Dollars 1.26 a
share, in the quarter to end-September. In the third quarter of 1992,
Anheuser-Busch posted net income of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 1.12.
The company said it hoped to reduce its salaried staff by 1,200 primarily
through attrition and an early retirement package to be offered to employees
aged 53 or older. It also announced a salary freeze during 1994
Campbell Taggart and Eagle Snacks, the company's food divisions, face
operational reorganisation as well. In the first quarter of next year, the
headquarters of both will be moved from Dallas to St Louis, where the the
corporate headquarters are located. About half of the divisions' Dallas
staff will be offered the opportunity to transfer.
