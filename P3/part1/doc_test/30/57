FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control
Systems (13): Choosing from a privileged position - Financial consolidation
at ICL

ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority
stake, had inside knowledge of the software market when looking for ways of
improving its worldwide financial control, but it didn't have all the
answers. Now its directors do - and within five days of business completion
The international computer company, ICL, is still involved in a continuing
evaluation of the packages it is using for financial control, writes Claire
Gooding. Even before its acquisition by Fujitsu, ICL was changing its
direction and becoming a supplier of computer services rather than hardware.
Even so, its restructuring into 26 businesses worldwide brought exactly the
kind of problem it seeks to solve for its own clients: a move away from
proprietary software to something less costly to maintain, and more flexible
to use, which would be a single, integrated worldwide solution.
'We were trying to resolve the problem of creating separate autonomous
businesses,' explains Cornel Wight, the strategist and manager of financial
systems whose job it was to assess ICL's financial and commercial
infrastructure across the world.
ICL wanted tools its various national offices could use to develop local
systems in their own language.
'As well as reporting to the headquarters on a monthly basis, the right
tools had to meet fiscal requirements,' says Mr Wight. 'With 80 sites around
the world, each has its own culture. We wanted a solution that would suit
their own local needs, timetable, and structure, and minimum requirements
for management reporting.'
The computer company already had its own proprietary software, but it didn't
meet the 'time zone' problems, and because it was centrally-driven, people
were deserting in droves to use spreadsheets. ICL was in a privileged
position in having inside knowledge of some well-established packages,
including executive information systems from Planning Sciences and Comshare,
and accounting packages with 'EIS-like' extensions, such as Tetra's
Chameleon.
But although ICL spread its net wide, the choice was limited by two factors:
First, the data had to be 'dynamic,' and not contained in a separate
database, so that businesses could report to the managing director on the
same day.
Secondly, the software had to work with many different 'inherited' packages
in use in various businesses and acquisitions, such as Nokia. The choice was
narrowed to two of the best-known consolidation packages, from IMRS and
Comshare.
'The key was that the IMRS packages were friendly for the account managers
and had a neat separation of the consolidation and the reporting functions.
There was also a high 'comfort factor' in working with the company, and the
user-endorsements were very convincing,' adds Mr Wight.
ICL implemented the IMRS Micro Control consolidation and reporting system
with Hyperion, its Windows-based companion, and the OnTrack graphical
reporting module.
The initial contract was worth around Pounds 1m, with installation taking
place across local area networks and PCs in ICL companies worldwide. An
in-house 'hit team' implemented the software to ICL standards and culture at
each site.
Mr Wight's team had been working for some time to reduce the completion time
for accounts - 'now, without fail, we are meeting our five-day requirement
between closing the books and reporting to group. It also facilitates
budgeting and forecasting, because people are familiar with the spreadsheet
format.
'We wanted to capitalise on the all the various models and techniques that
people had built up, without any re-keying of data. Their data is
automatically imported into Micro Control.'
It is the product's ability to present different faces to different groups
of users that most appeals to Cornel Wight's users - 'friendliness is at
appropriate levels: 'point and shoot' for managers, ledger-like for
accountants. Early users report that they are halving their costs: that's
significant when spending around Pounds 1m annually on reporting.'
Micro Control
This product, currently on release 3.5, was launched in 1987 as a DOS-based
data collection, data collection, consolidation and reporting system. Other
IMRS products are OnTrack, launched 1991, described as visual information
access, (EIS reporting), and Hyperion, launched 1993, claimed to be the the
world's first Microsoft Windows-based enterprise-wide financial control
tool.
Users: there are 1,300 corporate headquarters, with thousands of
reporting-locations worldwide.
Supplier: IMRS, founded in the US in 1981; UK operations launched in 1987.
IMRS common stock is traded in the NASDAQ National Market System under the
symbol IMRS.
Price: a corporate site licence starts at Pounds 60,000; maintenance is
charged at 15 per cent of initial sale after one year.
User views include: 'Stable,
robust software, auto-link with Lotus and Excel; integration of IMRS
databases; computer-based training; easy to install.'
