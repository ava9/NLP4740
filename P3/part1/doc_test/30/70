DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEASE OF 6-ACRE SITE AT VAN NUYS AIRPORT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A development company's plan to lease nearly six acres at Van Nuys Airport was 
approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On an 11-0 vote, the council agreed to allow Retlaw Development to use the land 
for an airport plaza that is to include corporate headquarters, a hangar for 
corporate aircraft, a parking lot, a restaurant and an aviation support 
services office. 
</P>
<P>
Minimum rent on the land was set at $305,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Board of Airport Commissioners deleted restrictions on the number 
and type of aircraft allowed on the new airport plaza, despite complaints by 
nearby residents about the potential for increased noise. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board asked city staff to submit recommendations of ways to 
regulate aircraft and minimize noise at all of the city's airports.
