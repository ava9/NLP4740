  [Text] Basel, Switzerland, April 5 (AFP) -- The European 
Monetary Institute (EMI) has found a building in Frankfurt, 
Germany, for its headquarters, the Institute's Press Department 
announced in Basel on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The EMI, the forerunner of the European Union's [EU] central 
bank, has been theoretically headquartered in the German city 
since January 1, but it had not found premises. 
  The announcement said the Institute would be moving into its 
premises next November 1, in the Eurotower Building in the city 
center, facing the Frankfurt Opera. It formerly belonged to BfG 
bank. 
  EMI President Alexandre Lamfallusy of Belgium signed a lease 
to the building on Tuesday. The Institute has been temporary 
housed in Basel at the headquarters of the Bank for 
International Settlements -- which Lamfalussy headed until last 
January 1. 
  The Institute's status as the forerunner of a European 
central bank and in preparation for the EU common currency was 
laid down in the Community's Maastricht Treaty.
