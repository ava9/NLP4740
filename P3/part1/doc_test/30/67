AN important difference between Milton Keynes and other towns and cities
looking for new investment and relocating companies in the past decade was
that there was not much industry in Milton Keynes in the first place.
Swindon and Peterborough - towns similar to Milton Keynes in that they grew
rapidly in the 1980s - were both railway towns with a pool of skilled labour
that new companies could utilise and build on. Similarly, south Wales and
the north-east of England had declining industries such as steel, coal and
shipbuilding, all of which shed labour in recent years.
But Milton Keynes' lack of an indigenous labour force did not act as a
deterrent to new investors. At first the development corporation and later
the private sector made sure that enough houses (about 45,000 ) across a
wide price range were built to accommodate the workers and managers that
relocating companies would need.
The absence of an industrial past, so to speak, had three effects. Milton
Keynes has a smaller-than-average manufacturing sector for somewhere so
close to the Midlands. It has comparatively few large companies. And it has
a relatively young workforce.
There are few very large manufacturing concerns, although there are a
considerable number of medium-size light manufacturing companies involved in
component manufacturing. The manufacturing sector employs 21 per cent of the
workforce, below the national average.
A recent employment survey undertaken by the Milton Keynes Development
Corporation showed that the two largest categories of companies were those
which employed less than 20 people and less than 100. Only 160 companies
have more than 100 employees. Sixty companies employ more than 200 people
and only 15 employ more than 500.
Service and distribution companies dominate among the largest concerns and
the smallest.
The biggest employer is now the bank, Abbey National, which has 3,500
workers on the payroll, but it has only grown to this size in the past four
years. In 1987 it employed 800. At that time the largest employer was the
Open University which employed 2,300, similar to the number it employs
today.
Other large companies are the Argos group, the catalogue showroom retailer,
and motor car distributors such as Volkswagen.
Companies in the service sector and manufacturing have flocked to Milton
Keynes because of its strategic location, because there is plenty of space
for working, living and parking and because its costs remain low compared
with London, the south-east and Birmingham. Of the 3,300 registered
companies or parts of companies, 2,500 have established themselves in Milton
Keynes in the past 20 years.
In the early 1980s, when Abbey National found itself bursting at the seams
in its headquarters in London's Baker Street, it wanted somewhere cheaper
but close enough to London so that an important number of staff would move
either by commuting or by physically relocating. It also wanted a location
where there were no larger employers, particularly in the service sector.
Milton Keynes fitted the bill.
Mr David Woollcott, group personnel manager, says: 'We wanted somewhere
which was close enough to London for executives to come and go to the London
headquarters. We still operate management, treasury and corporate functions
from there. But we also wanted a place where other key staff would work.'
More than half the 800 employees of the early 1980s came from the London
office. As the company has expanded, staff either commute in or have been
taken on locally.
Mr Woollcott says: 'There are trains every 20 minutes to London's Euston
which is just up the road from Baker Street. The fastest trains take just 35
minutes.'
Mr Woollcott also says the company likes the space and lack of congestion in
Milton Keynes. Parking is easy, although Abbey employees have to pay a small
fee because their office buildings are near the station and their car parks
were apt to be invaded by commuters. Parking used to be free.
BRS, formerly British Road Services, is in the process of moving 200
employees into newly acquired offices in Milton Keynes. The company says the
space and good communications were important considerations in selection of
the city.
Ms Sue Simpson, marketing manager of the transport group, says: 'We looked
at Bedford, where our parent company NFC (formerly the National Freight
Corporation) is based. But Bedford is basically a market town with parking
problems and congestion.
'We also looked at various business parks. The trouble with these are that
they are usually on the outskirts of town, and you either have to build your
own amenities, canteens, gyms and leisure facilities or see the staff
travelling into the nearest town for lunch. Here in Milton Keynes, you can
have the best of both worlds. You are right in the middle of town, so there
are pubs, restaurants and shops close by. But it is also easy to get in and
out and park.'
The space and lack of congestion was also attractive to Mr Kyoshi Watano,
managing director of Alps Electric (UK), one of the 43 Japanese concerns in
Milton Keynes.
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation was never able to offer grants and
other incentives of the kind offered by areas such as south Wales and the
north-east. But it was able to offer land and factories which would enable
expansion. Alps started up five years ago with 80 employees. It makes
electrical components for VCRs and televisions.
Mr Watano says: 'We wanted to be in England for our European operation
because of the English language, and to be near other Japanese companies -
particularly our customers. I looked at south Wales, and also Telford, but I
chose Milton Keynes because this was the best for distribution for all our
customers. One of our customers is Philips which is in Holland. They might
not have liked it if we had gone to Wales because Sony is there.'
Asked whether the company did not mind going without the incentives
available in Wales or Scotland, Mr Watano says: 'Grants do not make a
company; it is the quality of the people. Here, there are good, well-trained
people.'
Even without subsidies, Milton Keynes remains a competitive relocation
destination. Wages are between 10 and 20 per cent below those in London.
With the recession throwing people who commuted to London or Birmingham on
to the local market, fears of skills shortages have receded.
Office rents at Pounds 15 a sq ft are a third of those in central London.
There is plenty of land left for offices, factories and houses.
Milton Keynes is an hour's drive from Heathrow airport and just over half an
hour on the train from London. Once the economy improves, Milton Keynes
should again see an inflow of investment on a substantial scale.
