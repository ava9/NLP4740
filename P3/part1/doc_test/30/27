FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken Deutsche Bank five years to decide to integrate its investment
banking activities with those of its Morgan Grenfell subsidiary. Even so,
yesterday's belated decision to do so gives Germany's largest bank a
sporting chance of joining the investment banking big league with the likes
of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Its decision to locate the headquarters
of the operation in London also strengthens the City's position as Europe's
pre-eminent financial centre. Other Continental banks, seeking to develop
their corporate finance and international equity businesses, may feel under
pressure to follow suit.
The decision is undoubtedly a blow to Frankfurt. Efforts to bolster
Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - have not
succeeded. Germany may be Europe's leading industrial power, but its
financial system remains relatively underdeveloped while its equity markets
are over-regulated and illiquid.
Deutsche Bank will not find it easy to achieve its ambitions. While Morgan
Grenfell still has a strong presence in corporate finance, neither it nor
its parent is known for equity research and trading. There is also a big
question over whether Deutsche can successfully merge its solid but slightly
stodgy culture with Morgan's more entrepreneurial spirit. One reading of the
decision to locate the investment banking headquarters in London is that
Morgan's culture will come up on top. But, given that Deutsche has yet to
agree a name for the business, it would be a mistake to bet on it.
