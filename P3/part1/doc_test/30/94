<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received written comments on the proposal from seven entities and conducted a public hearing at the request of
one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing was held in Washington, DC, on December 14, 1992, at which four organizations were represented.
As a result of these comments and further analysis of the amendments proposed, FRA now publishes its final rule. FRA
recognizes the importance of a railroad's operating rules and its radio rules for moving trains and other pieces of
rolling equipment safely. The requirements promulgated in the final rule take this factor into account by balancing
FRA's interest in reviewing pertinent documents against the railroads' interest in reducing their paperwork burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule reflects reconsideration of the proposals announced in the NPRM. In the interest of reducing certain
paperwork requirements, FRA has adopted certain proposed revisions to the regulations. FRA has also authorized
railroads to retain information electronically so long as the railroads satisfy the stated conditions. Nevertheless,
FRA has retained the filing requirements prescribed in existing &sect;217.7 for Class I railroads and Class II railroads.

Interstate Commerce Commission (``ICC'') regulations at 49 CFR Part 1201 and ICC General Instructions 1&hyph;1.
FRA has determined that its headquarters office, located in Washington, DC, needs to continue receiving copies of
the operating rules of national and regional railroads to remain apprised of such rules. Finally, FRA believes that
operational test and inspection records require more specific data elements. FRA has concluded that the newly identified
data points serve to clarify the existing information requirements by defining the individual sources comprising
each operational test and inspection.

Discussion of Comments and Conclusions

FRA received written comments from the American Public Transit Association, Association of American Railroads
(``AAR''), The American Short Line Railroad Association (``ASLRA''), Consolidated Rail Corporation (``Conrail''),
New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and United Transportation Union (``UTU'').
At the public hearing held December 14, 1992, four organizations participated: the Railway Labor Executives' Association
(``RLEA''), the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (``BLE''), AAR, and Conrail. The discussions that follow examine
the issues raised by the commenters and analyze the reasons behind the adoption of the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether FRA should abolish requirements that railroads file their operating rules, radio rules, and certain other
documents with FRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two unions representing railroad employees objected to the proposal that railroads merely retain their operating
rules, programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction on operating rules, and annual summaries.
The UTU declared that FRA was abdicating its responsibility of reviewing the documents for regulatory compliance.
The UTU alleged that requiring the relocation of records to the railroad's system headquarters and division headquarters
would vest FRA's field inspectors with total enforcement responsibility and that, consequently, document inspection
would be entirely discretionary and no longer an integral part of FRA's safety assessment of a railroad. In other words,
the UTU claimed, FRA was sending a message that administering the operating rules regulations was no longer a priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLE echoed the UTU's concerns, stating that the removal of agency review at the headquarters level represented
a priority shift by FRA to no longer monitor a railroad's compliance with its operating rules or operational testing
and inspection program (i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, efficiency testing program). The purpose of these regulations was to afford FRA headquarters the opportunity to
analyze the data from the submitted documents. FRA needed to review incidents where railroad employees violated
their employers' operating rules to determine whether these violations compromised railroad safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR, however, fully endorsed FRA's proposals to eliminate filing. The AAR saw the filing of operating rules and
related documents as unnecessary, burdensome, and serving no safety objective. Furthermore, the AAR noted that
the railroad divisions comprising each railroad's system already provide the regulatory documents that FRA field
inspectors request for review. Requiring relocation of these records to offices that are visited by FRA field personnel
would facilitate document accessibility and retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASLRA also supported an end to the filing requirements. The ASLRA commented that these amendments would improve
efficiency and economy for the short line railroads and would promote review by inspectors familiar with a railroad's
operations. Three Class I railroads agreed that these measures would relieve burdensome requirements of photocopying
and mailing these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FRA proposed redesignating the locations of these records, FRA has reconsidered the impact this measure
would have on enforcement, accident investigation, and other functions. A railroad's operating rules and timetables
are valuable resources that are used by personnel of all disciplines in FRA's headquarters Office of Safety. For example,
at FRA headquarters, these documents are reviewed in conjunction with accident reports filed at headquarters under
49 CFR Part 225 by the railroad. The railroads' rules and timetables are also consulted during FRA headquarters' analysis
of draft accident investigation reports submitted by FRA field personnel. By maintaining a copy of the operating
rules and timetables of major railroads, FRA retains its ability to determine whether the operating rules themselves,
or violations of them, contributed to an accident. Retaining immediate access to these documents in Washington,
DC, provides FRA's headquarters office with an efficient means to identify unsafe or inadequate procedures and to
recommend practices that will ensure protection of train movements.
