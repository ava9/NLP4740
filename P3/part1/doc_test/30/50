SAN DIEGO AMERICA'S CUP RUNNETH OVER WITH DEBT; 
</P>
<P>

Yachting's prized racing trophy, the America's Cup, at last came home to San 
Diego this month, won not in honorable combat on the waves, as is tradition, 
but in a stuffy New York courtroom. After a particularly dismal cup event in 
1988, and 18 months of tacking through a legal storm, the trophy returns 
tarnished in spirit and metal, and still facing an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from its homecoming was the enthusiasm that greeted the 
America's Cup when sailing champ Dennis Conner carried it through the city's 
streets on his hero's return from Fremantle, Australia, in 1987. Also absent is 
the city's unquestioning desire for the America's Cup regatta. Things have 
changed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Conner and Malin Burnham, the San Diego businessman and 
world-class yachtsman who spearheaded the Sail America syndicate's Australian 
challenge, made San Diego beg for the privilege of holding the next America's 
Cup regatta, then planned for 1991. This was despite the fact that the sailing 
syndicate's challenge was sponsored by the San Diego Yacht Club. By tradition, 
the yacht club whose burgee flutters at the top of the winning boat's mast 
hosts the subsequent race. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as president of the America's Cup Organizing Committee, it has been 
Burnham's turn to be rebuffed by the same agencies and officials he forced to 
beg three years ago. Still $4 million in debt from the 1988 fiasco pitting 
Conner's catamaran against New Zealand challenger Michael Fay's hopelessly 
outmatched racing sloop, the organizing committee now needs $20 million to 
retire the debt and to finance the next cup race -- scheduled 12 months from 
now. Burnham hopes to get at least $10 million from public sources, the 
remainder from private ones, including corporate donations and television 
broadcast fees. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the regatta organizers are promising to reward the region with a 
$1.2-billion economic windfall from America's Cup XXVIII, including nearly $50 
million in local and state tax revenue. That kind of talk was enticing three 
years ago. It isn't today. 
</P>
<P>
Both the county and city of San Diego are in no position to provide funding. 
The county is struggling to find ways just to pay for long-needed new jails and 
to reinforce the escape-plagued jails it already has. The city of San Diego may 
have to lay off staff, freeze hiring for its already too-small police force and 
cut back its much underfunded library system to deal with a $60-million budget 
shortfall. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency is forcing city 
officials to upgrade its sewage-treatment facilities, which could cost San 
Diego as much as $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, legislation written by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee 
(R-Carlsbad), proposing the state provide the America Cup's committee with a 
$10-million "loan" was shelved after city and county officials opposed the 
bill's requirement that the money be matched by regional public funds raised 
through a temporary increase in the local hotel occupancy taxes. San Diego's 
proposed fiscal '91 budget already calls for diverting money from arts and 
tourism programs financed by those revenues for more urgent needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the normally cash-rich San Diego Unified Port District is beginning to 
count its pennies. The agency is fighting several lawsuits, which the port 
director says may put much of its surplus money in jeopardy. Port commissioners 
have already granted the organizing committee more than $100,000 to begin 
planning for the regatta; they will hear another appeal from Burnham on 
Tuesday. Cup organizers may have to stand in line behind the five bayside 
cities, including San Diego and the nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach, which also 
would like to receive some of the district's legendary cash surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials may even find San Diego corporate dollars wanting. Such 
contributions tend to come from corporate headquarters. Since the early 1980s, 
when Sail America received strong support from corporations headquartered in 
San Diego, the number of such offices here have dwindled. As a result, local 
arts and community groups that rely on corporate largess are finding huge voids 
in their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee isn't the only group facing money problems. The eight 
U.S. sailing syndicates hoping to vie for the privilege of defending the 
America's Cup in 1992 will be competing for donations to design and build their 
yachts and train their crews. 
</P>
<P>
Several well-financed potential foreign challengers already have boats built 
and in the water. So far, the only American hull to wet its keel is a scale 
model undergoing tank tests in Escondido. The American syndicates hope to make 
up for lost time by pooling design data, but even that technological advantage 
may not be enough to overcome the brimming coffers of some foreign challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Even the design of the new 75-foot, America's Cup-class racing sloop presents a 
problem. San Diego had more than enough docking space for its predecessor, but 
there are few available commercial berths in the harbor deep enough to 
accommodate the new boats. Dredging the berthing areas, anchoring barges in or 
building platforms out to deeper water may be too costly and environmentally 
unsound. San Diego Bay is plagued by several toxic "hot spots," many of them in 
areas already envisioned for regatta docking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a world-class sporting event no doubt has its benefits for San Diego. 
Yet even the promise of $1.2 billion in revenues doesn't alleviate the doubts 
about the wisdom of publicly financing a yachting regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Yachting remains a rich man's sport. There are few chances to join a pick-up 
yacht race in Barrio Logan, Clairemont or anywhere else in the city except, 
perhaps, wealthy Point Loma, where the San Diego Yacht Club and other clubs are 
located. It is telling that most of the regatta organizers seeking public money 
for the race are political and fiscal conservatives who would most likely 
oppose public funding of much more needed programs. Furthermore, most of the 
regatta-generated revenue would be enjoyed by the tourism-related industries 
along the coast, while the region's poorer, inland communities would go 
wanting. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup has become less a tribute to good sportsmanship than to 
personal greed and power. That's how Dennis Conner himself summed it up to 
reporters two years ago. "The America's Cup is about money," he said. "Money, 
money, money, money. Then power and glory, power and glory, power and glory 
after that. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
The question is what price is that glory, and who should pay it?
