Consolidated Natural Gas Company, CNG Tower, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222&hyph;3199 (``Consolidated''),
a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of
the Act.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prior Commission orders, dated November 27, 1985, March 20, 1986 and December 18, 1989 (HCAR Nos. 23926, 24052 and
25002, respectively), Consolidated was authorized to issue 1,500,000 shares of its common stock, $2.75 par value
(``Common Stock''), from time-to-time through December 31, 1994, to the agent for participants in Consolidated's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (``DRP''). Pursuant to those orders, 84,097 shares of Common Stock have been issued through
September 8, 1994. It is anticipated that 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock allocated to the DRP will remain unissued
as of December 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated proposes to continue the DRP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), offer participants
either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market. Authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated.
The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchase from Consolidated will be the closing price of Consolidated's
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape on the dividend payment date. Consolidated will use
the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not
needed by Consolidated, DRP shares will be acquired through open market purchases by Society National Bank (``Society'')
in Cleveland, Ohio, which will continue to act as agent for stockholders participating in the DRP. Consolidated will
absorb all brokerage commissions and administrative charges, such as agent fees.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No one has the right to vote any shares acquired through the DRP other than the respective participants in the DRP who
own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number of shares reserved under the DRP which may be issued in order
to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the DRP in the event of a stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization or similar event with respect to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is
appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock, or such shares as may actually
remain unissued at December 31, 1994, to Society as agent for the DRP until such number shall be exhausted, but not beyond
December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and par value (if appropriate) of
shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the DRP in the implementation of the anti-dilution of rights provisions
of the DRP.

Central Power and Light Company (``CPL''), 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, an electric utility
subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective
amendment to its application, previously filed under sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act, under sections 9(a) and 10 of
the Act and Rule 54 thereunder.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By order dated April 13, 1989 (HCAR No. 24863), the Commission authorized CPL to lease to nonaffiliated third parties:
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Approximately 23,400 square feet of excess space on the first two floors of its corporate headquarters building,
located at 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas (``Headquarters Building''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Approximately 17,800 square feet of excess space on the third and fourth floors, in the basement and on the roof
of the Headquarters Building; and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Space in one of its former office buildings pending eventual sale of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPL now proposes to lease to Enron Oil &amp; Gas Company, a nonaffiliated third party (``Enron''), approximately
34,954 square feet of excess space in Headquarters Building (``Leased Space''). CPL has entered into a Lease Agreement,
dated September 16, 1994, with Enron providing for such lease, as supplemented by a letter, dated September 22, 1994,
from CPL to Enron (``Lease''). The obligations of CPL under the Lease are subject to and conditioned upon receipt by
CPL of all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including this Commission's. The term of the Lease is
for five years, commencing on November 1, 1994 and ending on October 31, 1999, unless certain improvements to the Leased
Space have not been completed or all required governmental and regulatory approvals have not been received by November
1, 1994. In the case of such a delay, the term of the lease will commence when such improvements have been completed or
such approvals have been obtained and will end five years thereafter.

The rental payments due under the Lease are $30,584.75 per month, equivalent to an annual rental rate of $10.50 per
square foot of ``net rentable area,'' as defined in the Lease. The rental payments are subject to increase in accordance
with increases in a specified Consumer Price Index and to other customary adjustments. The Lease also provides for
a grant by CPL to Enron of a ``tenant finish allowance'' of $325,072.20 or $9.30 per square foot of net rentable area
for the purpose of constructing improvements to the Leased Space. This allowance is payable as work on improvements
to the Leased Space is performed and, to the extent not expended on improvements, shall be credited to rent due under
the Lease. Under the Lease, CPL is to pay a brokerage fee to Enron Property Company, an affiliate of Enron, of $73,403.40
or 4% of the gross rental due over the term of the Lease. Such fee is payable within ten days after the date the Lease becomes
effective. CPL believes that the rental payments, the tenant finish allowance and the brokerage fee provided for
in the Lease, taken together, will result in net rental payments that are at or near market rates for space comparable
to the Leased Space.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPL has also agreed to give Enron a right of first refusal to lease any additional space on two floors of the Headquarters
Building that might become available for lease during the term of the Lease. Such provisions as to additional space
are in addition to and independent of the provisions governing the Leased Space. Any lease of such additional space
would be for the remaining unexpired term of the Lease, at an annual rental rate per square foot equal to the rate to be
paid under the Lease. The lease would also provide for a tenant finish allowance per square foot equal to the allowance
to be paid under the Lease, but proportionately reduced to reflect the portion of the term of the Lease that will have
then expired. In all other respects, the lease of such additional space would be on the same terms and conditions as
are contained in the Lease.
