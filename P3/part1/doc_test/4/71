  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 11 (AFP) -- Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui Friday met his Indonesian counterpart Suharto during a 
lunch kept under tight wraps, a source here said. 
  "They had lunch together at the presidential palace in 
Tampaksiring and a meeting was held after the lunch," the source 
said without saying how long the meeting lasted. [passage 
omitted] 
  The meeting between the two leaders, at the summer palace 
built by founding president Sukarno and overlooking the sacred 
Hindhu bathing place and temple of Tampaksiring, was closed to 
the press, journalists in Bali said by telephone. 
  The Taiwanese president flew to Bandung in West Java on 
Thursday where he played golf and visited the state-owned 
Nusantara National Aircraft Industry (IPTN) accompanied by its 
president, Research and Technology Minister Bacharudin Jusuf 
Habibie. [passage omitted]
