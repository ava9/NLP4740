the Cockerel - Simon Davies reviews prospects for the market

The Year of the Cockerel is being greeted by many in Taiwan as the year
which will see the stock market finally rebound from its 73 per cent slide
over the past two years. But there are growing signs that it will open with
further falls.
The government has finally made it clear that it is keen to support share
prices and it has proposed long-awaited concessions, such as halving the
stock transaction tax and easing restrictions for foreign institutional
investors.
As a result of these measures - which have yet to be approved - the Taiwan
Stock Exchange index rallied 8 per cent to 3,420.62 in the last seven
trading days before the Chinese New Year holiday.
In a market which has historically shown little interest in fundamentals,
there are brokers who suggest that the 0.3 percentage-point tax reduction
could be the sign local investors are looking for to return.
The economy is still seeing reasonable growth of around 6 per cent a year
and company earnings are expected to recover in 1993 after declining in
1992. However, the market still looks fundamentally expensive by comparison
to others in the region. HG Asia Securities in London expects company
earnings in 1993 of 8.5 per cent, putting the market on a price-earnings
ratio of 21.8 times. This compares with a p/e of 9.4 in Hong Kong and 13.7
in Thailand.
Politics will remain a focus of attention when trading resumes next week.
February will bring to an end the sensitive debate over who will replace
Premier Hau Pei-tsun - one of the last key members of the mainland-born old
guard - following President Lee Teng-hui's unconvincing victory in
December's legislative elections. 'This market gets upset by political
instability, because it is not used to it,' says Mr Peter Kurz, senior
representative of Baring Securities Taiwan. He predicts that the weighted
index will fall below 3,000 during 1993.
The political news is not entirely negative. President Lee's mainstream
faction of the ruling Kuomintang party encountered a substantial protest
vote in the recent elections, but it still controls sufficient power in the
legislature to suggest that there will be no significant change in its
market-oriented policy.
Fundamental restraints remain. The government is projected to raise TDollars
100bn (USDollars 4bn)from privatisations this year, while brokers pre-dict a
further TDollars 60bn from private sector capital raising.
This could create a substantial drain on liquidity, although the government
plans may prove over-ambitious, after the TDollars 2.8bn China Airlines
public offer was only 11 per cent subscribed.
More competition for liquidity will come from 15 new banks that opened last
year and which are keen to expand their deposit base. Also, the level of
Taiwanese investment into mainland China is showing no signs of abating:
provisional estimates suggest Dollars 3.5bn was invested last year.
Counteracting this liquidity drain will be the capital invested by 11
proposed investment trusts, each of which has 45 days to raise TDollars 4bn.
The first companies started fund raising shortly before the Chinese New Year
and this should provide some support for blue chip companies.
Overall, the Year of the Cockerel appears unlikely to bring initial joy to
Taiwanese stock speculators. However, there are some attractive sectors
within this gloomy picture, such as electronics companies.
Brokers still hold out the distant hope that the prohibition on direct air
and sea links, and investment, with the mainland will soon be lifted,
allowing Taiwanese companies to gain the full benefits from China's
expanding economy.
Mr Graham Ormerod of head of research at Jardine Fleming Taiwan Securities,
says: 'It is a risky market, but with high risks come potentially high
rewards.'
