About 40 opposition deputies yesterday stormed out of a session of Taiwan's
National Assembly after leaping onto their seats, screaming and unfurling
protest banners as President Lee Teng-hui began an address, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
'Long live Taiwanese. Oppose overseas Chinese voting for the president,'
deputies in the main opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) chanted
as the assembly convened a three-month session to debate constitutional
reforms.
'Look clearly Mr President,' a DPP assemblyman screamed as he and colleagues
held up banners reading: 'Giving overseas Chinese the right to vote for the
president is like luring a wolf into one's home.'
Under a political reform package proposed by the ruling Nationalist party,
ethnic Chinese living outside Taiwan and China will have the right to vote
for the island's president.
DPP deputies oppose the proposal, arguing many of the overseas Chinese do
not pay taxes and have dual citizenship. 'The loyalty of overseas Chinese to
Taiwan is questionable,' one DPP assemblyman said.
According to government statistics, there are about 34m overseas Chinese
worldwide. Taiwanese authorities are still studying how many would be
eligible for absentee balloting.
The package needs the approval of the 314-member assembly, dominated by the
Nationalists who hold 247 seats.
Mr Lee appeared indifferent to the walkout and screaming, and continued with
his speech.
'We cannot cut ourselves off from society and amend the constitution without
basis . . . We must gradually revise concepts, laws and systems which are
out of keeping with the times,' he told the session.
Outside the assembly chambers, DPP deputies shouted insults at deputies
appointed to represent overseas Chinese.
Earlier, a group of DPP assemblymen charged the podium, jumped onto the
chairman's table and ripped away microphones to protest the presence of
plainclothesmen in the chambers, delaying the start of the session.
The reform package also calls for the introduction of direct presidential
elections by popular vote - an issue which had previously divided the
Nationalists.
