  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui on 
Thursday [24 February] pledged to do everything in his power to 
heal the national wounds caused by the Feb. 28, 1947 killing of 
Taiwan civilians by government troops. 
  "I fully understand that to heal the wounds is a very 
difficult task, but I will do my best," Li said while meeting a 
group of families whose relatives were killed during the 
incident. 
  It is still unknown how many people were killed in the 
incident, which Li said was triggered by a misunderstanding 
between native Taiwanese and Chinese who had fled communist rule. 
  According to an estimate by an ad hoc committee formed by 
the 
Executive Yuan to deal with fallout from the incident, between 
18,000 to 28,000 people -- mostly Taiwanese -- were killed. 
  Li said the incident was indeed a "tragedy" that he 
regretted. But he stressed that the government has been active 
in recent years in trying to soothe the spirits of the deceased 
and compensate their families, pointing to the building of a 
monument commemorating the victims and the appointment of a 
special task force to handle related affairs. 
  Li promised to lead a memorial service when the monument is 
completed next year. 
  Prof. Lin Tsung-yi, who represents families of the victims 
on 
the Executive Yuan's special committee, gave a positive 
appraisal of what the government has done to assuage the 
families, and thanked Li for the concern he has shown. 
  Li also guaranteed that he would push for passage of a bill 
regarding compensation to the victims' families. The bill had 
passed a first reading at the legislature, but was shelved when 
the families demanded more money. 
  Many of those in attendance at the meeting [words 
indistinct] 
sobbed when recalling events of the historic day.
