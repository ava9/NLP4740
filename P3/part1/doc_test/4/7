Fearful of becoming irretrievably ensnared in China's web, Taiwan is
attempting to slow development of cross-strait ties to win time to build
support for its attempts to rejoin the international community.
In its first white paper on China policy, to be released today, the
government is expected to advocate a go-slow approach to the rapprochement
launched with historic talks between the two sides in Singapore in April
1993. After seven years' detente, the paper comes amid a sharp escalation in
cross-strait tensions since the March 31 deaths of 24 Taiwanese tourists in
China's Zhejiang Province.
While Taiwan business backs closer ties with China, most Taiwanese remain
profoundly distrustful of Beijing's leaders. The tourist killings played
into the hands of President Lee Teng-hui, who is using the incident to
further his agenda of getting the world to recognise Taiwan as an
independent sovereign state, observers say.
It is rumoured among Taipei politicians that shortly after Mr Lee became
president following the death of Mr Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988, opposition
leaders asked him to seek formal Taiwanese independence from China. Mr Lee
is said to have replied: 'Just give me time'. The story may be apocryphal,
but Mr Lee's record speaks for itself.
The Taiwan-born agricultural economist built up a power base from virtually
nil, presided over a transition to democracy and in early 1993 shoved off
the political stage the military-backed mainlanders who ran the country for
over 40 years.
Weeks later, he launched a campaign to rejoin the UN, which Taiwan left in
1972, after that body switched recognition to Beijing.
In the past year, he and his ministers have globe-trotted constantly, trying
to drum up international support for entry into the UN and other
multilateral bodies from which Taiwan has long been excluded because of
China's objections.
Taipei maintains full diplomatic relations with 29 countries. Beijing
threatens to break off ties with any country which formally recognises
Taipei. As a permanent member of the UN security council, it can veto
Taiwan's entry. But Mr Lee's tactics are causing consternation, not only in
Beijing, which views the island as a renegade province, but also in
Washington, Taiwan's closest ally and benefactor.
'Taiwan has turned into a kind of Frankenstein's monster,' observes Mr
Parris Chang, a lawmaker from the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP). 'The US fostered Taiwan's democratic development
and some might say the policy worked too well. Now the US has to live with
the consequences.'
The US strategy seems to be simply to wait. The Clinton administration
recently completed a comprehensive review of US policy toward Taiwan, the
first in 15 years. Minor though symbolically important changes in the US
stance are expected to be announced shortly. But there will be no change in
the US's 'one-China' policy dating from the late 1970s acknowledging
Beijing's claim over Taiwan.
Taiwan now experiences a cacophony of views on the island's identity and
future. The debate is further shrouded by a haze of rhetoric emanating from
the government. Because China threatens to use force should Taiwan declare
independence, the ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, persists in
larding its assertions that 'the Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign
state' with dubious claims that its 'transitional two-China policy' is a
interim measure whose ultimate goal is reunification.
'The Republic of China on Taiwan is already an independent nation by
whatever definition,' says Mr Hanson Chien, the KMT spokesman. 'There's no
need to antagonise the PRC and invite a war.'
Public opinion is divided. A government-commissioned survey in late June
found 12 per cent of Taiwanese support independence, 21 per cent support
reunification, and 56 per cent prefer to maintain the status quo. A Gallup
poll conducted shortly after the tourist killings showed support for
independence at an all-time high of 27 per cent.
'China should realise the only reason more people don't openly support
Taiwan's independence is because they are afraid China will attack, not
because they want reunification,' says Ms Maysing Yang, head of the DPP's
foreign affairs department.
About the only matter on which there is a national consensus is that Taiwan
should rejoin the UN, and is it on this aim that President Lee appears to
have staked his hopes.
Ultimately the US will play a decisive role in Taiwan's future, says Mr Wang
Chien-shien of the KMT-breakaway Chinese New party. 'It is in the US's
long-term interest to have an independent Taiwan. Some day, when it suits
their purposes, the US will play the Taiwan card against China. Now the time
is not mature.'
By March 1996 at the latest, Taiwan will hold direct presidential elections
for the first time. Mr Lee's popularity makes him likely to win should he
run. It is easy to dismiss a country whose leader was installed by a waning
military dictatorship, but harder to exclude one whose leader is
democratically elected.
