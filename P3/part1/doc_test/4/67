  [Text] Manila, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Philippine defense 
officials have held "secret" meetings with their Taiwanese 
counterparts over the acquisition of 12 F-5E fighters Taiwan 
plans to discard once it acquires French-made Mirage fighters, a 
senior defense official said Thursday [17 February]. 
  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told 
KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE that Defense Undersecretary Ernesto Gidaya had been 
invited to Taipei "several times" to talk about acquisition of 
the aircraft, though Gidaya is using veterans' activities as a 
cover for his trips. 
  The source said that even before the informal meeting 
between 
President Fidel Ramos and Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui on 
February 9 in Subic Freeport, 126 kilometers northwest of 
Manila, "there had been low-key defense and military contacts 
between the two countries." 
  The three-hour Ramos-Li meeting at Subic drew the ire of 
China, and Manila has since been walking a tightrope in its 
relations with Beijing and Taipei. 
  The Philippine Government had asked Taiwan in August 1992 to 
either donate or sell its old aircraft at concessionary rates to 
the Philippine Air Force. 
  The Foreign Affairs Department made a recommendation that 
year to purchase the planes, in a memorandum to Defense 
Secretary Renato S. De Villa, following the U.S. 
Administration's decision to allow defense sales to Taiwan for 
the first time since a break in diplomatic relations in 1979. 
  The Philippine armed forces, regarded as the most obsolete 
of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), launched a 
10-year program in 1991 to modernize its inventory of World War 
II and Vietnam war vintage planes and ships. The 10 billion 
dollar program has so far progressed at a snail's pace due to 
lack of funds.
