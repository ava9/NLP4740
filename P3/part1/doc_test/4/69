  [Text] The mainland's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits [ARATS] yesterday [18 February] sent a message to 
the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in which it expressed the 
hope that private visits to the mainland by Taiwan officials can 
be arranged through the cooperation of the two organizations. 
This is the first time that ARATS has ever made such a request. 
It also shows that the Chinese Communists' departments in charge 
of work toward Taiwan is trying to use this as a tool for 
further strengthening official contacts across the Straits. 
  As the Chinese Communists do not recognize our country as a 
reciprocal political entity, it has been learned that they 
welcome Taiwan's high-ranking officials to visit the mainland as 
long as their visit is of a private nature. The Chinese 
Communist authorities have even openly indicated they welcome 
President Li Teng-hui to visit the mainland on a private trip. 
Moreover, after President Li Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit 
to the three Southeast Asian countries, the mainland side's 
suggestion, made through the ARATS, that intermediate 
organizations of the two sides make arrangements for officials 
of our side to visit the mainland on a private trip, affords 
much food for thought. 
  It has been learned that the message faxed by the ARATS 
yesterday was in the form of the script of talks by a person in 
charge of the ARATS. The SEF has noted that the ARATS' 
intention is to place Taiwan's officials' visit to the mainland 
under its overall management. Regarding out side's reply, the 
SEF said it will replay to ARATS after consulting with the 
Mainland Affairs Council.
