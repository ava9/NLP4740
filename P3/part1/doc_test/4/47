than 1m Taiwanese will visit China this year

TAIWAN'S relations with China have improved markedly following a series of
so called pragmatic initiatives by President Lee Teng-hui starting in the
late 1980s. But the widely differing views held by the two sides, and 40
years of open hostility, suggest further progress will be slow.
Taiwan last year recognised Beijing as the mainland's legitimate government.
It has also established government and quasi-government agencies to handle
cross-straits relations. Restrictions on visiting China and investing there
have slowly been lifted, although all contact must still be indirect. More
than a million Taiwanese are expected to visit China via Hong Kong this
year, compared with less than 7,000 in 1987. Trade through Hong Kong in the
first seven months of this year increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars
4bn.
The cautious opening to China is as important as other initiatives to
increase democracy and to lift Taiwan's international status. 'If we cannot
deal with the cross strait relationship, constitutional reform and
diplomatic improvements mean nothing,' said Mr Wu An-chia, convenor for
mainland affairs research at Chengchi University.
In return for its policy changes, Taiwan wants Beijing to recognise it as an
equal political entity, allow Taiwan more international ties, and renounce
the threat to re-unify Taiwan using force.
But China, which still sees Taiwan as a renegade province, is not prepared
to confer any legitimacy on its government. China's position is that Taiwan
should accept a solution based on 'one country, two systems', as negotiated
with Hong Kong. Taiwan is being offered more autonomy than Hong Kong,
however. For example it could keep control of its defence forces.
The impasse has stalled progress on relaxation of Taiwan's ban on direct
air, shipping and postal links with the mainland. Taiwan's national
unification guideline, setting out the limits to mainland policy, makes
clear lifting the ban is not a near-term objective. But pressure from
Taiwan's businessmen, who say the ban increases costs of investing in China,
has led to hopes the ban could be eased.
Taiwan's government seems more concerned to maintain the ban as an important
negotiating position with which to squeeze concessions from China at a later
stage. Meanwhile, China is also refusing to soften its stance on the use of
force. This again is partly a negotiating position, and China also sees the
threat as a way to limit the ambitions of Taiwan's independence movement.
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party campaigned for independence
during last year's national Assembly elections. After the party polled only
24 per cent of the votes, the issue has been sidelined, thus averting a
serious rift with Beijing.
Most people in Taiwan are happy to maintain the island's present de facto
independence, but do not support open calls for a split with Beijing.
Assuming political and economic reform accelerates in China, reunification
is regarded as a long-term inevitability.
In the short term, civilian and unofficial contacts will be built up and
work will continue on problems stemming from both sides' refusal to
recognise the other's legal system. Taiwan's government-funded Straits
Exchange Foundation, which handles direct negotiations with China's equally
non-governmental Association for relations Across the Taiwan Straits, has
been negotiating endorsement of documents and indirect mail services with
the Chinese. Discussions were aborted in March after the Chinese suddenly
raised issues of sovereignty. 'I urged them not to mix politics with
technical matters,' said Mr Chen Rong-jye, SEF secretary general.
Slow progress on China relations is also frustrating Taiwan's ambitions to
boost its international status. South Korea's August decision to switch
recognition from Taiwan to China was a severe blow to the island, removing
its last Asian diplomatic ally.
Taiwan now has full diplomatic relations with 29 countries, although many -
like Tonga and Guinea-Bissau - are only of symbolic importance. Worryingly,
China seems keen to improve relations with South Africa, the only large
country which still recognises Taiwan.
Taiwan has made progress improving unofficial links with France, especially,
and with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Taiwan has also stepped up
efforts to gain admission to international bodies, and was last year
admitted along with China to the Asian Pacific Economic Conference grouping
under the compromise title Chinese Taipei.
China probably assented to simultaneous entry as a precursor to dual entry
to the Gatt. At the moment, the US is in favour of simultaneous entry,
perhaps next year. Although entry would harm Taiwan by abolishing some
import restrictions, membership is seen as a diplomatic imperative in
Taipei.
One recent development, the slightly distasteful 'bidding wars' between
Taiwan and China for recognition by third world governments, may not last.
Growing democracy in Taiwan makes episodes such as last year's stealing of
Niger from China harder to justify. 'People don't want their taxes spent on
black Africa,' one analyst said.
