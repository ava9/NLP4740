  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he would 
meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on February 27 and 
expressed confidence that relations with Beijing would not be 
affected by the recent visit to Thailand of Taiwan's president. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he would meet Mr Qian during the 
Chinese 
foreign minister's stopover in Bangkok and, if need be use the 
opportunity to clarify any problems. [passage omitted] Earlier 
in the day, Sqn Ldr Prasong said he had instructed Permanent 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem to clarify the 
country's stance with the Chinese embassy, and the Government 
itself was ready to confirm the policy. "The visit of Taiwanese 
President is like that of the Dalai Lama during which China also 
protested to the Thai Government," said Sqn Ldr Prasong. 
[passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that Thailand's 
one-China 
policy did not bar Thai people and businesses from making 
contact with the Taiwanese regarding commerce and trade affairs 
or at a personal level. The minister noted that there was no 
official welcoming ceremony for the Taiwanese president when he 
arrived in Bangkok on Wednesday. He also said Dr Amnuai did not 
receive Mr Li in the capacity of a senior official. 
  He said people who went to meetings with the Taiwanese 
president were not from the Cabinet, which belongs the executive 
branch, but from the Parliament which is regarded as the 
legislative branch. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he was happy to clarify the matter with 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee at their invitation about 
his involvement in the matter if he was available during that 
time. If not, he would instruct the permanent secretary to go 
instead. [passage omitted]
