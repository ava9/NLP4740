  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Secretary-General Hsu 
Shui-teh of the Kuomintang on Thursday [19 May] released an 
article attributing Taiwan's political and economic achievements 
to the able leadership of President Li Teng-hui. 
  Hsu wrote the article, entitled "Opening a New Era With 
Wisdom and Courage," to mark the fourth anniversary of Li's 
inauguration. 
  In the article, Hsu says Li has successfully led Taiwan in 
pushing ahead with political reforms while maintaining high 
economic growth during the past few years. 
  "Taiwan is now using its political success and economic 
strength to make a breakthrough in the diplomatic arena and 
exercise its influence in the mainland with its market-oriented 
reforms," the article says. 
  Hsu said Li's major achievements have been implementing the 
constitutional reforms initiated by the late President Chiang 
Ming-kuo; adopting a flexible policy in order to expand Taiwan's 
diplomatic arena and increase its presence in the international 
community; and reducing cross-strait tension through increased 
exchanges with the mainland.
