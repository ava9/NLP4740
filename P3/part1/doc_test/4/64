  Finance Minister Views Taxes, Investment With 
Indonesian Counterpart 
  Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo held talks with his Indonesian 
counterpart Muhammad in Honolulu on 17 March. During their 
talks, Indonesia promised to allow the establishment of 
Taiwan-invested banks, whereas Taiwan will help promote 
Indonesian goods in Taiwan. Lin Chen-kuo told Muhammad that 
Taiwanese enterprises had invested $4 billion in Indonesia. Lin 
also said that if a treaty of mutual income tax exemption could 
be signed, more Taiwanese businesses would invest in Indonesia; 
Muhammad shared the same view. The second round of 
Taiwan-Indonesia negotiations on mutual exemption of income tax 
is slated for 8 April. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH PAO in Chinese 19 
Mar 94 p 1) 
  Cabinet Views Cooperation With Thailand, Indonesia, the 
Philippines 
  Premier Lien Chan invited Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh, Economic 
Minister Chiang Ping-kun, Foreign Minister Chien Fu, and other 
cabinet members to a meeting on 9 March, discussing programs for 
cooperating with and investing in Thailand, Indonesia, and the 
Philippines, as proposed during President Li Teng-hui's visits 
to these countries. Programs considered include land 
development, agricultural cooperation, occupational training, 
establishing a Chinese school in Thailand, and investment in the 
petrochemical, sugar refining, and pharmaceutical industries. 
Taiwan will also seek to sign investment guarantee agreements 
with the three countries. Premier Lien ordered the Research, 
Development and Evaluation Commission to follow up on the 
implementation of these programs and present their findings to 
the president within three months. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH PAO in 
Chinese 10 Mar 94 p 1) 
  Taipei's Exports To PRC Valued at $12.8 Billion in 1993 
  According to statistics of the Board of Foreign Trade 
[BOFT], 
Taiwan's 1993 export value to the PRC totals $12.8 billion, 
14.88 percent of the total export value -- a sharp increase from 
7.71 percent in 1992. This is the first time that Taiwan has 
included the value of cargo and goods transiting via Hong Kong 
in its figures on exports to the PRC; hence the drastic increase 
in the export value to $12.8 billion, which is very close to the 
$12.9 billion figure given by the PRC. Economics Minister 
Chiang Ping-kun said that most exports to the PRC were capital 
goods such as raw materials and machinery. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH 
PAO in Chinese 18 Mar 94 p 2) 
  Petroleum Company Plans To Build Industrial Zones in 
Indonesia, SRV 
  In response to the government's "southbound policy," the 
China Petroleum Corporation [CPC] is considering moving its 
facilities overseas by building a petrochemical industrial zone 
in Indonesia and Vietnam, thus establishing a trade network 
there to help Taiwan businesses move into Southeast Asia. 
Earlier this year, the CPC signed a $1.3 billion contract with 
Vietnam to build an oil refinery there. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH 
PAO in Chinese 21 Mar 94 p 6) 
  Taipei Lifts Ban on Textile Investments in PRC 
  The Industrial Development Bureau has initially decided to 
allow indirect investment in restricted textile items in the 
PRC. The ban on 325 textile items -- including wool, cotton 
yarn, and cotton cloth made of synthetic fibers -- will be 
lifted. At the same time, indirect imports of most garment 
items will be allowed. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH PAO in Chinese 16 
Mar 94 p 6) 
  Ministry Draws Up Plan To Strengthen Economic Work in 
Southeast Asia 
  The Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China 
[ROC] and other relevant units have drawn up an outline to 
strengthen economic work in Southeast Asia, which includes the 
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, 
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. The outline includes the 
following goals: 1) actively expand two-way trade and 
technological cooperation with Southeast Asian countries; 2) 
help Taiwan businesses find production and marketing centers in 
the Southeast Asian region and expand economic activities there 
in order to reduce investment and trade overdependence on the 
PRC; 3) enhance Taiwan's relations with Southeast Asian 
countries; 4) strive to participate in the activities of 
economic organizations in the Southeast Asian region. (Taipei

  Planning Council Says Annual Per-Capita Output Value 
Increases 
  The Council for Economic Planning and Development [CEPD] 
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out on 11 March 
that the annual per capita output value of Taiwan's 
manufacturing industry has risen to $NT2.197 million [$84,500] 
from $NT1.416 million [$54,460] in 1989, indicating that 
manufacturers have switched from the development of 
labor-intensive industries to technology-intensive ones.

  Economic Minister Holds Forum With Electric Appliance 
Makers 
  At a forum with members of the Taiwan Electric Appliance 
Manufacturing Association on 16 March, Economic Minister Chiang 
Ping-kun confirmed that the division of work between industries 
on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is conducive to increasing 
the competitiveness of Taiwanese goods, and promised to allow 
imports of more semi-manufactured goods and component parts from 
the PRC and to ease restrictions on visits by PRC businessmen. 
Responding to suggestions on allowing direct cross-strait cargo 
shipments and setting up a cross-strait free trade zone, Chiang 
noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs [MOEA] had drafted a 
program on shipping services between designated points on the 
two sides, but for political reasons it is not likely to be 
realized in the near future. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH PAO in 
Chinese 17 Mar 94 p 12) 
  Directorate Announces Figures on Imports of Technology 
  The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and 
Statistics 
[DGBAS] under the Executive Yuan said on 16 March that Taiwan's 
technological imports amounted to only $520 million in 1991, 
lower than South Korea's $1.18 billion, and far below the 
figures of other countries like the United States, Germany, and 
Japan. The DGBAS noted that Taiwan manufacturers' unwillingness 
to import high technology will affect the pace of technological 
upgrading on the island. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH PAO in Chinese 
17 Mar 94 p 2) 
  Executive Yuan Says Economy To Grow by 6.32 Percent 
This Year 
  Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 6.32 percent this year, 
the Executive Yuan told lawmakers at a meeting on 10 March. 
According to the Yuan, Taiwan's GNP was $220.2 billion in 1993, 
ranking 20th in the world, while per capita income was $10,566, 
ranking 25th. Fueled by the upturn in the world economy, 
Taiwan's economic growth rate may reach 6.32 percent this year, 
higher than last year's rate, 5.74 percent. (Taipei CHING CHI 
JIH PAO in Chinese 11 Mar 94 p 2) 
  Trade Board Says Benefits of GATT Entry Would Outweigh 
Losses 
  The Board of Foreign Trade [BOFT] has released a report on 
the effects of GATT entry on Taiwan's manufacturing industry. 
According to the report, if tariffs are lowered by 10 percent, 
Taiwan's manufacturing industry will suffer a loss of $NT3.1 
billion [$120 million], but its consumers will benefit by as 
much as $NT4.7 billion [$180 million]. The BOFT said the 
economic benefits from Taiwan's GATT entry will outweigh 
economic losses, except for household appliances and 
automobiles, the economic benefits of which will be slightly 
smaller than the corresponding losses. (Taipei CHING CHI JIH 
PAO in Chinese 10 Mar 94 p 2)
