  [Text] ROC [Republic of China] President Li Teng-hui has 
reached agreement with Indonesian Minister of Research and 
Technology Jusuf Habibie on issues of investing in the natural 
gas, (?physics) and (?coal) industries between the two 
countries, while President Li Teng-hui was spending the Chinese 
New Year holidays in Indonesia. 
  Adviser to the ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs Liu 
Tai-ying, who is accompanying the President on his trip along 
with 30 other government officials, also verified that there 
will a big businessmen tour group who will be investigating into 
the possibility of investing in the Indonesian industries in 
March. 
  Meanwhile, international news agency REUTER reported the 
President's trip to Indonesia as one that is shrouded in 
secrecy. President Li, making his second overseas trip since 
assuming office in 1988, arrived on the resort island of Bali on 
Wednesday [9 February] for a five-day visit after a brief 
stopover in the Philippines. 
  Beijing on Thursday protested Li's trip to the Philippines 
and his meeting with Filipino President Fidel Ramos and other 
Philippine officials. 
  Indonesia was President Li's second stop on the 
three-country 
tour which prompted Mainland China to warn the Philippines, 
Indonesia, and Thailand that their relations with Beijing would 
be harmed if the visits went ahead. 
  An official in Bali said Li, who is likely to have dinner 
with President Suharto on Friday, flew to Bantam on Thursday 
with his host Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie. 
At the state-run IPTN aircraft factories in Bantam, southeast 
of Jakarta, visitors were denied entry, and security appeared to 
have been stepped up, REUTER reported. 
  Taipei said last month it was studying possible aviation 
tie-up with Indonesia and Mainland China [as received] after 
failing to form joint ventures with Western aerospace companies. 
The Indonesian aircraft factory IPTN's centerpiece is its 
70-seat N-250 medium-haul turboprop communter plane due to enter 
service in 1996. 
  The Indonesian aircraft company also produces under license 
French-designed Puma and U.S. Bell helicopters as well as parts 
for U.S.-designed F-16 fighters and British-developed Rapier 
missiles. 
  Indonesia has formal diplomatic ties with Beijing and 
Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas has said a private visit by Li will not 
change Jakarta's one-China policy. Indonesian officials have 
stressed that senior officials meeting President Li would do so 
in their private capacity.
