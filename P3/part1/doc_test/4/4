ruling party is slowly cutting links with Chiang era

Statues of Chiang Kai-shek, the generalissimo who fled China in 1949 and set
up a nationalist government in Taiwan, are gradually being taken down or
moved to less visible locations as the Chiang family influence wanes.
Over the last decade, Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), once dominated by
General Chiang and then by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, has steered the island
from a backwater military dictatorship into an industrial powerhouse and
arguably the most democratic state in east Asia.
The party is moving to weaken the Chiang connections, but has stopped short
of repudiating Gen Chiang whose often brutal rule ended at his death in
1975. However, the political landscape has changed markedly since, shortly
before his death in January 1988, Chiang Ching-kuo set reforms in motion by
lifting martial law and a ban on the formation of new parties.
Debate in the parliament has become so tempestuous that brawls are the norm,
prompting Shanghai's Liberation Daily on Thursday to accuse Taiwanese
lawmakers of making themselves an international laughing-stock and behaving
like 'monkeys'.
In another sign of change, eight high-ranking generals were impeached
earlier this month by the Control Yuan, a government watchdog, for wasting
taxpayers' money in an arms deal from the mid-1980s. This public humiliation
of the military would have been unthinkable in the Chiang era.
Nonetheless, the generalissimo's stern visage still looks down from the
walls of government offices, banks, companies, and post offices. An
estimated 30,000 statues remain in place across the island, in traffic
circles, school grounds and other public places. But one statue of Chiang on
horseback, a target of vandalism by opposition protesters, was spirited away
this month at night under heavy police guard by the city government,
ostensibly to ease a traffic bottleneck.
The KMT is now run by Taiwan-born civilians, the military-linked Chinese
mainland faction having been decisively shoved off the political stage in
early 1993. But its present leadership remains reluctant to complete a
reassessment of history which would inevitably tarnish the former first
family's image.
This is not only because many senior government officials, including
President Lee Teng-hui, owe their political advancement to the family, but
because to reject Chiang would be to jettison his vision of reunification
with mainland China - tantamount to declaring Taiwan's independence, which
in turn might provoke Beijing into the use of force.
In an unusually frank interview with a Japanese scholar published a few
months ago, President Lee actually referred to the KMT as a 'foreign regime'
and termed Beijing's inclusion of Taiwan as a province of China a 'strange
dream'. Earlier this week a Chinese news agency for the first time attacked
President Lee by name, accusing him of trying to 'split the motherland'.
There are limits to change. 'The KMT is trying to de-emphasise the
connection between the present government and the past regime in what is
part of the 'indigenisation' of the party,' said Mr Lu Ya-li, a professor at
National Taiwan University.
'They've made several concessions to the demands of the opposition, but
they're afraid of sparking a conservative backlash if they go too far.'
In particular, the KMT refuses to release documents locked in military
archives which might shed light on events surrounding a massacre of
Taiwanese in the early months of 1947, known as the '2-28 incident' for the
February day on which it is said to have begun.
An estimated 15,000-30,000 people were either killed or disappeared at the
hands of KMT forces quashing Taiwanese rebels. Most of those killed,
scholars say, were from Taiwan's intellectual class.
While the genesis of the 2-28 incident has yet to be fully clarified, many
scholars believe the withheld documents would reveal what has long been
suspected: Chiang himself was behind the crackdown which took place two
years after Japan ceded rule of the island to the then Nanjing-based
Nationalist Chinese government.
Opening the archives would also unmask the names of military personnel who
carried out orders, possibly sparking a hunt for those still alive. 'There
are a lot of skeletons in the closet,' said Prof Lu.
On Wednesday, relatives of victims in the 2-28 incident demonstrated before
the KMT headquarters, calling the KMT a 'bandit' party. Protesters demanded
a formal government apology, compensation of NTDollars 10m (Pounds 240,000)
per victim and a public holiday for February 28 to commemorate the tragedy.
The KMT early this week agreed to pay families up to NTDollars 6m for each
person killed, although it declined to use the term 'compensation',
preferring the word 'arrangement'. But it rejected demands to apologise, to
declare a national holiday, and to force military commanders responsible to
face trial.
There are some concessions to the truth, although the KMT is still reluctant
to confront its past and that of Gen Chiang. In the last year, textbooks
have inserted for the first time a brief mention of the 2-28 incident.
'There will gradually be a more objective evaluation of Chiang Kai-shek's
place in Taiwan's history,' said Prof Lu. 'On the one hand he was
responsible for land reform here, and he maintained the economic stability
Taiwan needed to develop. But he has also been criticised for rigidity in
foreign policy and disregard for human rights, even brutality.'
