  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday played 
down Taiwan's threat to halt importing Thai labour, saying 
Thailand has been seriously tackling the problems of illegal 
Thai workers in that country. 
  On Sunday the Taiwanese Council of Labour Affairs chairman 
accused Bangkok of being insincere on solving the problem of 
Thai workers in Taiwan and warned that his country would halt 
the labour import from Thailand. 
  Prasong said the Foreign Ministry was ready to help deal 
with 
the council's complaints but insisted that the Thai Public and 
Social Welfare Ministry was the responsible agency. "I don't 
know why it [the issue] has been brought up just now. The 
problem has long existed. Why are they talking about it now?'' 
he said. 
  Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Council of Labour Affairs, 
warned Thailand that Taipei might have to suspend the import of 
Thai workers unless Bangkok tackles problems such as exorbitant 
commissions charged by Thai job placement agencies. Chao blamed 
the Thai government for "lacking application" in curbing such 
unfair practices. His attack was released just over a week 
after a three day-to Thailand trip by Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui. 
  Prasong said if Thai workers illegally entered Taiwan they 
have broken the law and should be penalized accordingly. "We 
cannot blame a country which takes legal action against those 
who illegally enter its territory," Prasong said. 
  Job Replacement Department Director Sinchai Riantrakul, 
meanwhile, said that Thailand had done its best to solve the 
problem. He said the department had issued warnings in early 
February to at least 47 employment agencies to strictly comply 
wlth Thai law. He added that the department would take legal 
action against any company known to have collected exorbitant 
fees from Thai workers. "Yesterday was the deadline for job 
recruitment agencies to abide by the laws," he said. 
  Thai workers have to pay Bt80,000 to a job replacement 
agency 
before they are able to work in Taiwan. 
  Sinchai denied a report that there were 2,500 Thai workers 
illegally working in Taiwan, adding that he thought the flow of 
illegal workers to the island state was decreasing. He also said 
he did not how many job placement firms had contravened the law. 
Commenting on exorbitant fees, he said Taiwanese employment 
agencies were also to blame over the practice and Taiwan should 
help tackle the problem. "They [Taiwanese brokers] demand 
Bt20,000-Bt30,000 for each worker," he said.
