  [Excerpt] As was customary, the provincial government held 
a cocktail party yesterday in Taichung to commemorate the Taiwan 
Recovery Day. When non-Taiwanese Provincial Governor Sung 
Ch'u-yu [1345 2806 2404, James Soong] delivered his remarks, he 
spoke quite a bit of Taiwanese. When President Li, who also 
attended the cocktail party made his remarks, he emphasized the 
unconquerable spirit born of the special circumstances and the 
vitality shaped by the "Taiwan experience." He expressed the 
hope that all Taiwanese will further develop this spirit, and 
strive for even more glorious achievements. 
  On the same day, the "Taiwan People's Federation" was 
established in Taipei. Invited to deliver remarks at that 
meeting, professor P'eng Ming-min [1756 2494 2404], noting that 
Taiwan had relations with Mainland China in only four out the 
past 100 years, called upon all Taiwanese to sever any emotional 
ties to China and strive to achieve the dream of a Taiwan that 
is stable, prosperous, and democratic, with freedom and respect 
for human rights. 
  Also on the same day, a "Republic of Taiwan National 
Assembly" jointly sponsored by four organizations -- the 
"Foundation for Establishing Taiwan as a State," the "Taiwan 
Sung-Chu Association," the "Association for Supporting Taiwan in 
the United Nations," and the "Taiwan Cultural Advancement 
Association" -- held its first meeting outside the west gate of 
the Taipei Railway Station. The members demanded that Li 
Teng-hui dissolve the Republic of China and the Kuomintang 
[KMT], transfer the KMT properties into a fund for establishing 
Taiwan as a nation, and truly recover or liberate Taiwan. 
  In the past, commemoration of the Taiwan Recovery Day was 
never quite so enthusiastic. In observing the Taiwan Recovery 
Day this year, one can sense there were different connotations 
in the commemorations held at different quarters. 
  Why is it that for the first time in 21 years a 
non-Taiwanese 
was appointed Governor? Why is it that this non-native Governor 
spoke in Taiwanese? This is because the KMT may possibly be 
trying to promote harmony among the peoples and groups. To use 
President Li Teng-hui's own phrase, the KMT is "re-opening an 
old store." 
  Why is it that P'eng Ming-min once again emphasized the 
"sovereignty of Taiwan?" This is because a large number of 
people have spontaneously reacted adversely to what they 
perceived to be covetous designs of the Chinese Communists. 
  Why is it that in establishing the "Taiwan People's 
Federation," no attempt was made to sort out the non-Taiwanese 
from among the sponsors and supporters? This is because the 
concept of Taiwan as a "living community" for every one is 
gaining widely popular, though still complex responses. 
  The issue of reunification versus independence is still to 
be 
fully debated, but on Taiwanese soil, the cries of "Taiwan, 
Taiwan!" are becoming louder and louder. [passage omitted]
