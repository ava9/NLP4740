  [Text] President Li Teng-hui began an eight-day Southeast 
Asian tour Wednesday [9 February] despite a warning against the 
trip by Beijing. The diplomatically sensitive trip, which takes 
Li to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, is designed to 
strengthen Taiwan's economic and political ties with the three 
countries in the absence of formal diplomatic relations. 
  An official statement released by the presidential office 
Wednesday said the main purpose of the president's unofficial 
visit is to learn from other's experience as the reference for 
the ROC economic development in the 21st century, adding that Li 
will have unofficial contacts with leaders in the region 
touching [on] views on regional economic cooperation and matters 
of major concern. 
  Li arrived at the former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay in the 
Philippines at 1045 where he made a three-hour visit and held 
informal talks with the Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a 
luncheon, the semiofficial CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  The tour is Li's second overseas trip since assuming office 
in 1988. He visited Singapore in 1989, the first time a 
president of the Republic of China had gone abroad in 12 years. 
  After leaving the Philippines, the president's chartered 
plane landed in Indonesia's resort island of Bali Wednesday 
evening where he planned to discuss the development of natural 
gas and oil reserves. Among other projects was President 
Suharto of Indonesia and tour Indonesia's aerospace center. 
[sentence as received] During his visit in Indonesia, he will 
also meet with Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister 
Habibie for talks focusing on the development of Bantam, an 
island south of Singapore which Jakarta is developing as an 
industrial zone, the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY reported. Li was 
accompanied by the ROC First Lady Tseng Wen-hui and about 40 
officials including Frederick Chien, minister of foreign 
affairs; Vincent Siew, chairman of the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development; Raymond Tai, presidential spokesman; 
Jeffrey Wu, an adviser to the Executive Yuan; and Liu Ta-yi, an 
adviser to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to 
officials. 
  The presidential delegation will then travel to Phuket, in 
Thailand, on 14th February to meet with Thai prime minister, the 
local press reported. 
  Taiwan is already one of the biggest foreign investors in 
Southeast Asia, pouring in more than $10 billion so far. Li's 
trip is also seen by local analysts as a part of the 
government's recently-announced southward policy designed to 
promote economic and trade ties with ASEAN countries in order to 
release Taiwan's dependence on Mainland China. 
  The Philippine President Fidel Ramos said Thursday that 
meeting with the ROC President Li Teng-hui does not violate the 
one-China principle practiced by his country, and the meeting 
with President Li was a very valuable time when the ideas and 
issues were discussed informally in the meeting, he said, and 
they were able to discuss further proceedings for the ROC 
investment in the Philippines. Ramos was also able to verify 
the date for the construction work to begin in the Taiwanese 
industrial zone within the Subic Bay. Ramos emphasized this 
project is of great importance to the development of the Subic 
Bay. The two sides have also consented to have the third 
economic cooperation meeting taking place in Subic Bay in June 
this year. 
  Meanwhile, as President Li arrived in Bali island in 
Indonesia, great interest was also aroused among the local 
media. Indonesia's newspapers quoted words from Indonesia's 
Foreign Minister Alatas that the ROC President Li Teng-hui as a 
Ph.D. in agricultural economy and not representing his official 
position as the president of the Republic of China. [sentence as 
received] Indonesia therefore is not violating the one-China 
policy with the Mainland China.
