Taiwan: Not Anxious To Seek Reunification"] 
  [Text] After a comprehensive assessment of Taiwan's 
political situation, the mainland has decided on its policy 
toward Taiwan, and has defined the following three principles -- 
insisting on one China, denying international political space to 
Taiwan, and refusing to make the commitment of not using force 
against Taiwan. Under these three principles the mainland's 
overall policy toward Taiwan this year will be -- holding it 
back economically, pushing it down militarily, and restricting 
its space internationally. As to reunification, the mainland 
can take its time. When the economy on the mainland is 
developed or even surpasses that of Taiwan in 30 to 40 years, 
that will be the right time for a trial of strength. 
  The mainland's new policy toward Taiwan was discussed and 
determined at the national meeting of directors of Taiwan 
affairs offices held in Xiamen in December. At the meeting, 
participants summed up the year's work toward Taiwan performed 
by the Office for Taiwan Affairs and its affiliated departments 
and studied the work for further pushing forward the development 
of relations across the Taiwan Strait. Qian Qichen, deputy head 
of Taiwan Working Group of the CPC Central Committee and vice 
premier of the State Council, and Wang Zhaoguo, director of the 
Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, delivered important speeches 
at the meeting. Their speeches, together with mainland's 
assessment of the Taiwan situation and the work orientation 
toward Taiwan in the new year, were collated into a document and 
transmitted to the Taiwan affairs offices in various localities 
level by level. 
  The document covers several issues, including Taiwan's 
political situation, Taiwan's foreign activities, the assessment 
of the situation across the strait, the work toward Taiwan, and 
so on. In the area of Taiwan's political situation, the 
mainland holds that since last year, political developments in 
Taiwan have added some unfavorable factors to the reunification 
of the motherland. This development is manifested in: 1) the 
Taiwanization of the Kuomintang [KMT]; 2) the consolidation of 
Li Teng-hui's position; 3) the development of the strength of 
the KMT, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP], the New Party, 
personalities of no party affiliation, and so on; and 4) the 
increase of the DPP's strength. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The future situation across the 
strait is highly variable along with the completion of the KMT's 
Taiwanization process and the fulfillment of its reform program 
at this stage. Originally, the CPC placed the hope of achieving 
the cause of reunification on the Taiwan authorities, but this 
should be changed now. We must place more hopes on the Taiwan 
people rather than on the Taiwan authorities. 
  In the analysis of Taiwan's foreign activities, the CPC must 
stick to the stand regarding Taiwan's international space for 
survival. That is, it is permissible for Taiwan to engage in 
economic activities, but Taiwan must be completely excluded from 
any political activities. In assessing Taiwan's attempt to 
reenter the UN last year, the document stated that "the CPC won 
the struggle against Taiwan's entry into the UN," which 
indicated that the CPC had a good grasp of Taiwan's strategy in 
its analyses. Taiwan intended to rope the Central and South 
American countries in with money. Actually, it did not exert 
good effects, nor did it yield remarkable results, as some 
countries accepted its money on one hand and revealed its doing 
to the mainland on the other. 
  The document mentioned that the talk between the CPC's 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in 
Seattle last November meant that the Sino-U.S. relationship had 
come out of the blind alley since the 4 June Incident, which 
would have a bearing on the mainland's future work toward 
Taiwan. Jiang Zemin told Mr. Clinton that China insists on the 
stand of one China, and that Taiwan cannot act as a political 
entity, only as an economic entity. The document stressed: The 
CPC will definitely insist that "there is only one China in the 
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China" as stated in 
the White Paper on Taiwan. 
  According to the comprehensive analysis of the document, 
although the situation in Taiwan this year is more complicated 
than last year, and the CPC is particularly worried about the 
adoption of the direct polls for presidential election and the 
voting law for the people, still there are some favorable 
factors to the development of relations across the strait as a 
whole. These are: The economic growth on the mainland gathered 
pace, the CPC's foreign environment took a turn for the better, 
there were louder and louder voices for "peaceful contacts" 
between the island and the mainland, Taiwan's attitude toward 
the "three exchanges" was a bit relaxed, and the "Ku-Wang talks" 
were a success. 
  Besides, Wang Zhaoguo pointed out at the meeting of the 
Taiwan affairs office directors: It is necessary to further 
step up preparations in various aspects regarding the work 
toward Taiwan in the new year, particularly the work toward the 
mainstream faction headed by Li Teng-hui. We will absolutely 
make no concessions on the issue of the three principles -- 
insisting on one China, denying international political space to 
Taiwan, and refusing give up the use of force. At present, the 
conditions of immediately working for political contacts and 
"three exchanges" between the two sides of the strait do not 
exist. Therefore, what can be done is to hold Taiwan up 
economically, improve the mainland's investment climate for 
Taiwan investors, make practical preparations for the "three 
exchanges," and hold routine discussions to implement the 
"Ku-Wang talks." Meanwhile, it is necessary to push Taiwan down 
economically while restricting its space internationally.
