<F P=106> [Article by Li Ming-yang (2621 0682 2254): "The Fuzzy </F>
Nature of the CPC's Taiwan Policy as Viewed From Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] Following the conclusion of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, a leading Hong Kong businessman who is also a member 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, published a full-page advertisement in 
the party's organ, lauding Deng Xiaoping and describing him as a 
"founder of the `Manifesto of the Communist Party' leading to 
the 21st century" and a "great master of communism who carries 
forward the cause and forges ahead into the future." After 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was 
published last October, a RENMIN RIBAO editorial said that "the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
founded by Deng Xiaoping is a powerful ideological weapon which 
guides China to become prosperous and strong and is the 
embodiment of Marxism in contemporary China." At the meeting to 
mark the centennial of Mao Zedong's birth, Jiang Zemin pointed 
out that Deng Xiaoping's theory is the "spiritual pillar and 
scientific guide for us to advance triumphantly." All this 
shows that the CPC's worship of Deng Xiaoping today has far 
exceeded its worship of Mao Zedong in the 1960's. 
  As Deng Xiaoping's thought is the pillar and guide for all 
trades, the CPC's approach to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao 
affairs is no exception. In Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, six essays are related to Taiwan. 
1) The main points of Deng's talk with Professor Winston Yang 
of Seton Hall University of New Jersey on 26 June 1983, entitled 
"Ideas About Peaceful Reunification Between the Chinese Mainland 
and Taiwan;" 2) Deng's speech at the third plenary session of 
the CPC Central Advisory Commission on 22 October 1984; 3) the 
main points of Deng's talk with Burmese President U Shan Yu on 
31 October 1984, entitled "The Principle of Peaceful Coexistence 
Has Strong Vitality;" 4) Deng's talk while being interviewed by 
CBS reporter Michael Wallace for the news program "60 Minutes 
Plus" on 2 September 1986; 5) part of Deng's talk with 
Gorbachev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on 
16 May 1989, entitled "Terminating the Past, Opening Up the 
Future;" and 6) part of Deng's talk with Gwok Hok-nin, a rich 
Chinese businessman from Malaysia, on 15 September 1990, and 
this item is entitled "Making Joint Efforts To Realize the 
Reunification of the Motherland." 
  Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Taiwan work include 
secret and open instructions. If the instructions are put in 
chronological order people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy 
was rather inconsistent and elusive, and this showed the 
character of rule of man. 
  On 1 September 1982, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in the 
opening 
speech to the 12th CPC National Congress: "Intensively working 
for socialist modernization, striving for the reunification of 
the whole country, including Taiwan, and opposing hegemonism and 
safeguarding world peace are the three major task for the 
Chinese people in the 1980's." (Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 3) In mid- January 1991, when 
listening to reports by Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Wang 
Zhaoguo, and Ding Guangan about Taiwan affairs, Deng gave the 
following instruction: "In the period of the Eighth Five- Year 
Plan (between 1991 and 1995), we should consistently carry out 
the three major tasks. The first is to develop the economy; the 
second is to persistently maintain stability; and the third is 
to solve the Taiwan issue. Although these three items were not 
explicitly and completely spelled out in the communique, we 
should keep them in mind. None of the three is dispensable." A 
casual remark uttered by Deng determined that the major tasks of 
the 1980's were extended to the 1990's. 
  Readers who take notice of current affairs may still 
remember 
that, when Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, then-Singapore Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who rushed to mourn the death of Chiang, 
predicted that the Republic of China would last for another five 
years only, but three five-year spans have passed, and the 
Republic of China is still standing firm and has the world's 
second largest foreign exchange reserves. 
  When foreign politicians or political commentators commented 
on China's political situation, they often failed to hit home. 
In fact, their erroneous remarks did not matter very much. 
However, being the general architect of mainland China's 
reform, opening, and modernization, the time validity of Deng 
Xiaoping's remarks on resolving the Taiwan issue had to be 
changed quite often, and this seemed rather haphazard. 
  The key to the CPC's Taiwan policy lies in its time 
validity. 
Not only will the 20 million troops and civilians in Taiwan, 
Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu have to worry about this, but the 
American, West European, and Japanese corporations will also 
have to take it seriously. On 16 May 1989, Deng Xiaoping told 
Soviet party and government leader Gorbachev: "In my life, only 
one thing has not been solved. That is the Taiwan issue. It 
seems that I will not be able to see its settlement." Deng was 
85 years that year, and he revealed a sense of helplessness with 
his remarks. These might have been words coming from the bottom 
of his heart. Being a great man, he should be able to know his 
own limitations. 
  However, six months after that, shortly before Deng 
resigned from the chairmanship of the Central Military 
Commission, he told the members of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and the principal responsible officials of the Taiwan 
Affairs Office and the United Front Work Department: "The 
settlement of the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed indefinitely. 
The longer this is delayed, the heavier the burdens will 
become! It seems that the Taiwan authorities will never calmly 
sit down to talk. We should make dual preparations. 
Preparations cannot be made only in one aspect! You should 
work out some methods and resolve this issue within five years. 
You should not be able to sleep if this issue is not resolved!" 
He set forth a five-year time limit, and this was related to 
his desire to "live a number of years longer" and to see 
reunification with Taiwan. 
  After the 4 June incident, the CPC maintained that Taiwan 
remained the largest anticommunist base and even condemned the 
Kuomintang for having its hand in creating "turmoil" in the 
mainland. Therefore, the CPC leaders would not be able to set 
their minds at rest as long as the Taiwan issue remained 
unsettled. They had differences over economic issues, but Deng 
Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Yang Shangkun shared the same opinion on 
Taiwan work. They all considered Li Teng-hui the largest 
champion of Taiwan independence and maintained that the 
separatist forces in Taiwan must not be allowed to succeed and 
that preparations should also be made for using force to solve 
the problem within three to five years. In Beijing alone, the 
cadres engaged in Taiwan work number over 1,000. 
  The anxiousness to realize reunification also found 
expression in Deng Xiaoping's unusual talk with Deng Wen-yi, his 
schoolmate of the same age, on 19 May 1990 (after the 4 June 
incident, he even refused to meet with Japanese Deputy Prime 
Minister Shin Kanemaru and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan 
Yew). Deng Wen-yi was the director of the Political Work 
Department of the National Defense Ministry of the Nanjing 
Government in 1949 when the Communist troops fought across the 
Chang Jiang, and he was also a senior intelligence officer in 
the Kuomintang regime. He lost power in his later years, but he 
was not willing to live in silence. At the invitation of Hou 
Jingru, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, he returned to the mainland to visit 
his old friends and relatives. In Taiwan, he was denounced by 
the Democratic Progressive Party as an "old thief." In the 
mainland, he was treated as an honorable guest of the 
government. The purpose of his mainland visit was to recover 
two houses in Nanjing. Deng Xiaoping took this opportunity to 
brainwash him and said: "Both of us share the same surname, and 
we are also old friends. We can discuss anything except Taiwan 
independence. The CPC and the Kuomintang cooperated very well 
on two occasions in the past, and we can carry out the third 
round of cooperation. In the future, Taiwan and the mainland 
must be reunified. This may take another two or three years. 
At most, reunification will be effected within three years." 
  Deng Xiaoping also told Deng Wen-yi: "We are all people from 
the same family. There should be no war between us, as war is 
unfavorable to both sides. We may discuss this more seriously." 
However, on 10 October of the same year, after watching the 
video tape about Taipei's celebrations of the "Double 10 
Festival," Deng Xiaoping told Yang Shangkun and Ding Guangen: 
"They are still putting on grand airs! Li Teng-hui's words are 
unreliable. They use three hands to deal with us overtly and 
covertly. On one hand, they talk big and utter high-sounding 
words; on the other, they secretly support the Democratic 
Progress Party which seeks Taiwan independence and continue to 
carry out subversive activities against the mainland. Although 
we have already talked too much, they still refuse to accept any 
of our proposals and advice and even regard us as being weak and 
timid!" Then there was the airborne troops' 12 October combat 
exercise on an island with jungles, beaches, and marshlands. 
This was a rehearsal for the attack on Taiwan. 
  On 1 July 1991, Deng Xiaoping told Jiang Zemin and other 
leaders that the Doctors had told him that he would continue to 
be healthy for another eight to 10 years, so it was not as 
urgent to use force against Taiwan. He said: "In the 1980's, 
we planned the first step for realizing reunification. Young 
Chiang died too early, so we did not act in time. Can we now 
make a breakthrough in a period of more than eight years?" He 
added: "If China is not reunified, the people of our generation 
will not be able to close their eyes when they die, and they 
have no face when they see Marx. We hope to use peaceful means 
and solve the issue through negotiations, but we should also 
consider other methods at the same time!" 
  In August of the same year, Deng Xiaoping circled his name 
to 
endorse the Taiwan work program drafted by the State Council's 
Taiwan Affairs Office for the remaining years of this century. 
The program fixed the deadline for settling the Taiwan issue 
around the turn of century. 
  In January 1991, Deng Xiaoping said: "Li Teng-hui is a 
person full of ideas. You should first study him in order to 
discover the right method for dealing with him." Deng Xiaoping 
maintained that Li Teng-hui's statements about one China were 
unreliable. In actual practice, however, the CPC never took Li 
Teng-hui lightly. For example, Wang Daohang, chairman of the 
mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, 
told Huang Chao-sung, editor- in-chief of Taiwan's LIEN HO PAO 
on 14 December 1993: "When formulating the Taiwan policy and 
handling the work related to Taiwan, we took Mr Li Teng-hui as 
our principal counterpart, because he represents Taiwan's ruling 
authorities." 
  To sum up, people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy has 
always been characterized by the "rule of man" -- it changes 
according to the mood and health of an old man of 90 years. In 
mainland China, where the one-party dictatorship is still in 
force, policies outweigh laws. Policies are the administrative 
guidelines for the state and the party. If the policies are 
inconsistent and elusive, however, they will not be effective. 
The cadres responsible for Taiwan affairs at all levels will 
not know what course to take, nor will the enemies on the other 
side of the straits fear various bluffs and blusters.
