send in troops

Inauspicious celestial patterns and China's desire to reclaim the island of
Taiwan have combined in a newly published best-seller to prompt the most
severe bout of invasion fever to afflict the Taiwanese since the early
1980s.
Entitled 'T-Day August 1995: The Warning of the Taiwan Strait War,' the book
constructs in blunt terms an elaborate scenario whereby China retakes the
island while the world stands by.
According to the Book, on T-Day an attack will be led by elite paratroops,
who will land on the golf courses ringing the otherwise cluttered capital of
Taipei.
Improbable? Yes. Impossible? Not necessarily.
China refuses to renounce the use of force to retake Taiwan and frequently
reiterates its claim to sovereignty over the island. Ominous warnings from
Beijing about military intervention have accompanied the growth of a
Taiwanese independence movement, which does not want to be 'reunited with
the motherland', as China puts it.
Critics dismiss the book as politically motivated scaremongering. They
charge that its publication in August was backed by right-wing elements in
the ruling Kuomintang party and timed to dissuade Taiwan's middle-class from
The cover of the book warning of an invasion by China
voting for pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party candidates in key
December elections.
But Taiwanese are genuinely concerned, as evidenced by a sharp rise in
inquiries over emigration to western countries. And the hold over the
Taiwanese imagination of all things superstitious cannot be underestimated.
According to the lunar calendar, next year will have an extra eighth month.
Chinese believe that the insertion of a month portends either blessing or
calamity, usually the latter. Previous leap-months coincided with the
invasion of China by western powers in 1900, a bloody purge in China in
1956-57, and struggles following Mao's death in 1976.
'In Chinese history, the reason for starting a war is always face, not
economic advantage,' said Mr James Chin, publisher of Business Weekly
magazine, which published the book.
'The mentality of Chinese leaders is, 'If you don't respect me, I will teach
you a lesson'. This has nothing to do with rational behaviour.'
When Deng Xiaoping took power in the late 1970s, he is said to have outlined
three dreams: China's economic reform; the return of Hong Kong; and
reunification with Taiwan. The first has been largely achieved, the second
is well in hand but the last is slipping away.
Mr Lu Yali, politics professor at National Taiwan University, said 'tension
has built up across the Taiwan Strait', as Taipei's pursuit of an
international role for Taiwan has 'created speculation that the leaders in
China are not happy'. He doesn't think China will invade, but understands
the growing fears as part of the 'psychology' of Taiwan.
With each election in recent years, the opposition parties sap power from
the KMT which has ruled the island since 1949. Direct presidential elections
scheduled for early 1996 will consolidate the democratic legitimacy of a
government which has been transformed from a military dictatorship since
1987.
The policies of the KMT are converging with those of the DPP, and it is
becoming clear that regardless of who wins the presidential elections it
will essentially be on a platform of independence.
This could be an excuse for China to invade.
China's domestic turmoil will also be a catalyst for an attack, the book
argues.
An external conflict, whether successful or otherwise, will serve to
distract from problems at home and consolidate the power of Deng's
successors.
