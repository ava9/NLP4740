0208): "On Li Denghui's Certain Remarks"] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- This year, Mr. Li 
Denghui [Li Teng-hui], the preeminent power-holder of the Taiwan 
authorities, has made a great deal of unusual remarks inside and 
outside the island of Taiwan, and these remarks have quite 
flagrantly betrayed his inclination toward "Taiwan 
independence." This has triggered serious concern at home and 
abroad. People commonly maintain it is imperative to keep a 
close watch on Li Denghui's moves from now on and also refute 
his strange talk and comments. 
  Some of Li Denghui's remarks were blatant, and some were 
ambiguous; and more often than not they were self-contradictory 
and logically confusing. Moreover, soon after he made certain 
mind-boggling remarks, he would amend them to alleviate 
questioning by the media. But whenever there was an 
opportunity, he would give a different explanation. Despite his 
changeability, he was helplessly "revealing his true intenis 
true." What, then, is Mr. Li Denghui's true intent? 
  People may have discovered that, within the island of 
Taiwan, 
Mr. Li Denghui has disseminated the seed of discord by 
occasionally provoking contradictions between Taiwanese people 
and those from the mainland. On cross-strait relations, he has 
denied that there is but one China, thus separating Taiwan from 
the mainland and pitting Taiwan against the mainland. He has 
also, time and again, been wantonly critical of the CPC, and the 
language he has used has been so vile that it appeared he had 
lost his head. In this way he has exposed himself step by step. 
  Among Li Denghui's pronouncements is the demagogic phrase 
of "the sorrows of being born a Taiwanese." Whenever he uses 
this phrase, he invariably makes reference to "Exodus" in the 
Bible. In other words, he is distressed by the invasions and 
suffering in the history of Taiwan and it is his ambition to 
lead the Taiwanese in building a new nation. What Li Denghui 
tries to do here is to separate Taiwan from China, and Taiwanese 
from Chinese. Yes, the corrupt government in the later years of 
the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan following the 1894-95 
Sino-Japanese War, and the Taiwanese people suffered enslavement 
for half a century. That episode of history is, however, a 
tragic chapter for China and the Chinese nation as a whole. 
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the concessions in Shanghai and 
other parts of China are all symbols of the tragic fate of China 
due to aggression by the big powers, a Chinese nation in 
humiliation. For many long years people on both sides of the 
strait suffered, and their sufferings were those of the Chinese 
nation as a whole. It should also be pointed out that from the 
day the Qing Government decided to cede Taiwan, Taiwanese, one 
stepping into the breach as another fell, fought and laid down 
their lives in their struggle against the ceding and the 
aggression of Japanese imperialism. Numerous national heroes 
emerged among the Taiwanese. Their wish that Taiwan be returned 
to China was realized 50 years later after the Chinese people 
fought eight years of bloody war. Although all their struggles 
ended in failure, their heroism will be immortalized in history. 
How could Li Denghui, who prates about "the sorrows of being a 
Taiwanese" and "Exodus" and claims to be most knowledgeable 
about modern Chinese history, be so ignorant of the history of 
his own country? 
  We must also point out that only a unified and strong China 
can prevent tragedy from falling on the Chinese people. Being 
born a Taiwanese is being born a Chinese. Only by working for 
the great cause of motherland reunification will we be able to 
prevent the historical tragedy from repeating itself. We are 
convinced that Taiwan compatriots will, instead of being swayed 
by Li Denghui's demagogy, obtain a more profound understanding 
of this. 
  Li Denghui claimed that cross-strait relations should not 
develop into a relationship between father and son but into a 
relationship between brother and brother. He also asserted that 
the inclusion of Taiwan as a province of the People's Republic 
of China by the CPC constitutes a "strange dream," adding 
"Taiwan and the mainland are under different governments. This 
is all I can say." This is another ill-intentioned attempt by 
him to sow discord among and incite the compatriots in Taiwan 
regarding cross-strait relations. This is him trying to confuse 
people about cross-strait relations. It should be said that the 
people of both sides of the strait are kinsfolk to each other; 
as far as the country is concerned, both sides of the strait are 
one entity, each forming a part of China. Like 30 other 
provincial-level administrative regions of China, Taiwan is also 
a provincial-level administrative region. In the future there 
will be Hong Kong and Macao. All these provincial-level 
administrative regions form the great People's Republic of 
China. How can one distinguish between father and son in a 
unified body? Moreover, when the two sides of the strait are 
reunified peacefully in the future, it will not be one side 
swallowing up the other side or vice versa; Taiwan will become a 
province or a provincial-level special administrative region of 
the People's Republic of China; the central government will 
reserve a certain number of leading positions for Taiwan. As 
for the question of "different governments," we have always 
advocated one country, two systems. When peaceful reunification 
is achieved in the future, Taiwan can practice a system 
different from that on the mainland. Taiwan's party, government, 
and military will be managed by Taiwan itself. These policies 
of ours were made known to the world long ago. They cannot be 
obliterated by a few ambiguous utterances by Mr. Li Denghui. 
However, this does in no way mean that China is permitting the 
promotion of two political entities of equal standing. If Mr. 
Li Denghui stubbornly clings to his aim of a political entity of 
equal standing, he is dreaming of something strange, but when he 
wakes up he will find that everything is empty. Mr. Li Denghui 
should know this. 
  Recently Li Denghui also hawked the so-called "Republic of 
China on Taiwan" everywhere in an attempt to use these ambiguous 
words to create "two Chinas" internationally, and to stand up to 
the People's Republic of China as an equal. His attempt will be 
doomed to run into a wall. Interestingly, he, despite flaunting 
the signboard of "the Republic of China," does not take great 
interest in "the Republic of China" and claimed that it is "a 
regime from the outside." The fact that he does not value the 
general interests of the Chinese nation above everything else 
makes Mr. Li Denghui a very confused person. 
  Lately, sovereignty also has become one of the pet topics of 
Li Denghui. At one time he would say "sovereignty is a 
dangerous word." At another time he would toy with such pretty 
slogans as "sovereignty rests with the people." He scolded the 
Communist Chinese, saying "they lack the qualification to talk 
about sovereignty." Recently he changed his mind, saying that 
it would be better not to talk about the issue of sovereignty 
and that mainland leaders "are ossified." The whole thing is 
deadlocked over the issue of "sovereignty rests with the people 
and let's set aside the problem of sovereignty for the moment." 
His babblings are just mind-boggling. Very few people in the 
world can understand why "sovereignty" is "a dangerous word," 
because all they know is that sovereignty is sacred and 
inviolable. As regards Li Denghui's so- called "sovereignty 
rests with the people," this is nothing but his attempt to make 
use of an empty concept to evade the issue of who owns the 
sovereignty of Taiwan. "Let's set aside the issue of 
sovereignty for the moment" is another stalling tactic to gain 
time. Li Denghui's aim, in the final analysis, is to split 
Taiwan away from China. But, to borrow Mr. Li Denghui's own 
words: It is nothing but babblings in dreams. 
  Li Denghui has repeatedly emphasized the present divide and 
separate rule on both sides of the strait. He failed to speak 
about the historical reasons which lead to this situation. He 
refrained from speaking on the efforts needed to achieve 
reunification. Therefore, people cannot help thinking that he is 
trying to fan up a separation consciousness from that side of 
the strait. There is a saying that to judge a person, one needs 
not only to listen to his remarks but also to observe his deeds. 
Mr. Li Denghui is just the sort of person who is obsessed with 
his own small calculations. 
  On several occasions this year, Li Denghui has let loose a 
torrent of abuse against the Chinese Communists. His muddle 
headedness has even surprised the people on the island. Because 
the Chinese Communists did not deem to heed his curses, he 
became so conceited that he even said, "When I get tough, the 
other side blinks." People are simply amazed at the degree of 
his lack of self-knowledge. He also repeatedly claimed that 
before he reached the age of 22 (that is in 1945, before the 
retrocession of Taiwan to China) he had been a Japanese. If one 
understands that he is not ashamed of, but even proud of his 
country being conquered by Japan, then it will be easy to 
understand on what kind of ideological basis he has based his 
various fallacies of today. Of course, what makes the people 
most concerned now is how far this person, with such an 
ideological basis, will go on the erroneous path.
