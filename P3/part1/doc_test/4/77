  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui and his 40-member 
delegation will visit Thailand as tourists and are scheduled to 
hold talks with Thai business people during their vacation in 
Phuket Province from 14 to 16 February. In this regard, Sutchit 
Nimitkun, governor of Phuket Province, held a closed-door 
meeting with some 20 officials at Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel on 
13 February to map out reception for the Taiwanese leader and 
his delegation. 
  The Dusit refused to answer any questions, saying the 
meeting 
is a regular event. However, it was reported that the meeting 
discussed the reception and security measures for the Taiwanese 
delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan will also come 
to meet the president during his stay in Phuket. It was 
stressed during the meeting that officials concerned must avoid 
giving any news about the visit to the mass media for fear of 
affecting the good relations between Thailand and China. 
  A source revealed that Amnuai Wirawan arrived in Phuket on 
12 
February and has been staying at the Dusit Lagoona Resort Hotel. 
However, the place where the Taiwan delegation will stay has 
been kept secret. Amnuai was seen at Thai Muang Golf Course in 
Phang-nga Province, presumably inspecting the readiness of the 
golf course, where the Taiwanese visitors and Thai businessmen 
will play friendship matches.
