  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui and Indonesian President Suharto discussed economic 
relations between the two countries, which have no diplomatic 
ties, a newspaper here said Saturday. The daily JAKARTA POST 
said that Taiwanese Presidential Office spokesman Kramer Ting 
told journalists that Li and Suharto agreed that Indonesia and 
Taiwan should improve economic cooperation. 
  Suharto also expressed appreciation for Taiwanese investment 
in Indonesia, the spokesman said. The two presidents met for 90 
minutes at the Tampaksiring summer palace on the Indonesian 
resort island of Bali Friday. Despite the absence of diplomatic 
relations, Taiwan is the third largest investor in Indonesia, 
committing nearly four billion dollars over the past 25 years in 
the archipelago. Two-way trade was 1.42 billion dollars in the 
first half of 1993 and was a total of 2.62 billion dollars in 
1992. 
  The tightly guarded and closed meeting between Li and 
Suharto 
took place after a lunch attended by the presidents and the 
first ladies, a source here said. [passage omitted] 
  Suharto arrived in Bali late Thursday, officially to visit 
the newly renovated state-owned Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which 
had burned down in January 1992. [passage omitted] 
  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that Li's visit 
would not change Indonesia's One-China policy. He said that any 
meeting between Li and Indonesian officials, including Suharto, 
would be private capacities and should not be "exaggerated."
