'Will smiling Siew take off the white gloves?' asks a headline in
yesterday's Independence Evening Post in Taiwan.
The respected liberal daily refers to the island's intricate arm's-length
pas de deux with China. Mr Vincent Siew, renowned for his ever-present grin,
was put in charge of shaping the island's policy toward its giant neighbour
and ostensible rival in a cabinet reshuffle last week.
The question embodies both the hopes and dreads of Taiwanese, who find
themselves variously fearing an invasion by the People's Liberation Army,
dreaming of a return to the ancestral fold and planning how to plunder the
El Dorado of the orient.
It also reflects the chief fear of many ordinary Taiwanese: that of being
involuntarily absorbed by China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province
and threatens to use force if the island should formally declare
independence. Most countries accept Beijing's view and do not accord
diplomatic recognition to Taipei.
'Given Siew Wan-chang's background in trade and economics, in the future,
cross-strait commerce will take precedence over politics, and some people
find this disturbing,' the article says. During his previous brief as
economic planning minister, Mr Siew drafted a plan to transform the island
into a regional business hub. Press reports suggest that he has been brought
in to head the Mainland Affairs Council to carry out that plan.
The missing link - literally - in Taiwan's grand ambition to become a
regional centre for business, finance and transport is direct shipping and
flights to China, banned by Taipei since the Kuomintang government fled to
the island after losing China's civil war in 1949. Businessmen who have
investments in China and are forced to travel back and forth via Hong Kong
see things differently from the average Taiwanese.
In a Sunday editorial, the Commercial Times, a financial daily which broadly
supports government policy,wrote in favour of the Economic Planning
Ministry's suggestion to create an 'offshore transport centre' which would
be used to establish direct shipping and air links with China.
'From an economic point of view, direct cross-strait transport would save
time and money and promote development of two-way trade and economic
development on both sides,' the paper argued.
The pro-government China Times, in an editorial published yesterday, said
the ruling Kuomintang would be likely to step up economic ties with China,
possibly opening direct links, in order to gain support in crucial
legislative elections late next year and first-time presidential elections
slated for early 1996.
'The iron votes have rusted,' the paper said in a reference to the loss of
once loyal supporters to opposition parties. 'Faced with upcoming elections.
. . what other more effective card does the ruling party have to play?'
But in a letter published last week in the United Daily News, which is seen
as being more closely aligned with the Kuomintang faction whose members came
from China in 1949, a Shanghai-based Taiwanese businessman wrote: 'Many
people believe that Taiwanese businessmen support direct links, but actually
that is not so. If direct links were opened tomorrow. . . like a magnetic
force, Taiwan would be swallowed alive.'
But the issue of direct links will become, in practical terms, a moot point
in 2 1/2 years in any case, as the Economic Daily News hinted in an
editorial last week. 'The 1997 deadline for Hong Kong is forcing us closer
by the day. In the past we could avoid dealing with the direct links issue.
. . but soon we will be compelled to face (China) directly,' the paper
warned. The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
