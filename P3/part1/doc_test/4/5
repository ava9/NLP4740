elections due in December, Angus Foster looks at politics

TAIWAN takes a significant step towards democracy in December with the first
fully representative elections to the Legislative Yuan, or parliament.
Constitutionally, this body approves the government budget and has authority
over a range of government bills. But its powers have rarely been used and
its credibility was undermined until last year because more than half its
members were elected in mainland China in 1947-48, before the Nationalist
government fled to Taiwan.
The old guard retired last December, paving the way for the direct election
on December 19 of 125 legislators, six representatives of overseas Chinese
communities and 30 'at large' seats decided by each party's vote in
constituency elections.
The new status likely to be accorded to legislators suggests the Yuan will
become more like a western parliament with questioning and debate of
government policy. Social issues could become more prominent.
Division on these and other issues could emerge within the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) party. A struggle for supremacy is also possible between the Yuan and
the National Assembly, which elects the president and adopts constitutional
amendments.
But Taiwan's progress towards full democracy, initiated with the lifting of
martial law in 1987, has so far been relatively smooth and the KMT is
expected to easily win a majority of the seats on offer in December. The
party will stress the island's economic success, steady moves to democracy
and stable relations with China as reasons to support the government.
'The great majority of voters are, economically speaking, doing well and
they are happy,' said James Chu, KMT spokesman.
The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, has been muted
since it campaigned on an independent Taiwan ticket in last year's elections
for the National Assembly. Although most Taiwanese support the existing
state of de facto independence, the campaign frightened people who believe
China's threat to use military force to reunify Taiwan if it seeks formal
independence. China, of course, still regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
The DPP polled only 24 per cent of votes and has decided to campaign on
other issues this time. It will attack the government's USDollars 306bn
infrastructure spending plans for being inflationary and likely to lead to
tax increases.
Mr Hsu Hsin-liang, DPP chairman, says he hopes his party will win 30 per
cent of the vote. He complained, justifiably, that in spite of moves to
democracy, elections are not fair. The KMT controls Taiwan's three
television stations and, because candidates need to spend Dollars 1m or more
getting elected, the KMT's links with business ensure it ample backing and
an in-built majority.
The DPP is seeking to tone down its popular image as a group of firebrand
radicals. Fist fights in the legislature, which were mainly designed for
show and reflected the opposition's frustration at being in such a minority,
are likely to die away. But the DPP's poor internal organisation suggests it
will take time for the party to decide whether it should be a responsible
opposition in a dominant party system, or return to merely a protest
movement.
The independence issue has not been resolved either, although it has been
temporarily shelved. According to opinion polls, most Taiwanese are happy
with their present state of de facto independence and would welcome eventual
reunification with a democratic China. But younger Taiwanese are less sure
and are frustrated by Taiwan's lack of international recognition. Taiwanese
also resent the continuing grip on power held by descendants of mainlanders
who fled to Taiwan in 1949 but make up less than 15 per cent of the
population.
Although Mr Lee Teng-hui is the island's first Taiwanese president, Mr Hau
Pei-tsun, who as premier has effective day-to-day control over the island,
and most of his senior cabinet are mainlanders. 'The line between Taiwanese
and mainlanders is still very clear,' said Mr Lin Yu-siong, a Taiwanese KMT
legislator.
This division is likely to come to the fore again next year in the lead up
to the KMT's party congress and is symbolised by a simmering dispute over
the method of election for the next presidential elections, due in 1996.
President Lee and his supporters are believed to be in favour of direct
elections while conservatives within the administration, many of them
mainlanders, would prefer elections through a form of electoral college to
limit the popular appeal of the president's office. The issue is further
complicated because elected members of the National Assembly fear their most
important function would be redundant if direct elections took place.
A heated debate on the issue within the KMT reached impasse in March and the
question has been put on hold. In a terse statement, the KMT said an
extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly will be held by May 1995 'to
select the method of electing the president and vice-president according to
public opinion'.
