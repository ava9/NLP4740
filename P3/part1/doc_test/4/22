  [Excerpt] The private visit of Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui has triggered strong reaction from the Chinese 
Government. On 16 February, the Chinese Government reportedly 
issued a protest note, accusing Thailand of violating the 
agreement and understanding between each other on the one-China 
policy and emphasizing its strong regret on the matter. 
  The note was issued after the Taiwanese president's visit to 
Thailand, which took place between 14 and 16 February during 
which the Thai Government organized a reception in Phuket. 
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai was at the reception, played golf, 
as well as discussed economic cooperation with the visitor. 
  Thailand was the last leg of President Li's visit to the 
region. He was in the Philippines and Indonesia and was received 
by Presidents Fidel Ramos and Suharto despite the Chinese 
Government's charge that the visit would affect its relations 
with those countries. The Chinese Government issued two protest 
notes to the two countries and canceled a visit of Chinese 
parliamentary foreign affairs committee to those countries. 
  The Chinese Government resorted to the same two practices 
vis 
a vis Thailand. There was a reminder from the Chinese foreign 
minister. The Thai Government, however, viewed the Taiwanese 
president's visit as private to "rest for three days to play 
golf." 
  In any event, China has made an initial protest by canceling 
indefinitely an official visit by an NPC foreign affairs 
delegation, originally scheduled for 23 February-1 March. A 
protest note also followed. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters that 
Thailand firmly abided by its one-China policy and that the 
Taiwanese president's visit would not affect that policy. He 
said the Thai Government should be able to practice a basic 
principle in the conduct of its fully independent foreign policy. 
  China and Thailand established diplomatic relations in 1975, 
and Thailand ceased diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which 
China regards as one of its provinces. 
  In any event, it was reported that on 16 February the king 
hosted a dinner for the Taiwanese president at Phuphing Palace, 
Chiang Mai Province. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai was present 
at the dinner. [passage omitted]
