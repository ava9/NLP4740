has to make the switch from low-cost to high-tech industry

A DECADE of growth at more than 8 per cent a year turned Taiwan into one of
the richest places in Asia. Helped by rising trade surpluses, the island's
central bank has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 88bn, the
largest in the world. And, this year, despite the world recession, growth is
likely to reach 7 per cent and unemployment remain below 2 per cent.
However, growing wealth has led to new problems.
As the economy has matured, the pillars which supported rapid industrial
growth have been undermined. Strong, centralised government has had to make
way to popular calls for more democracy. Once low-cost manufacturing is no
longer competitive. And budgetary restraint has been overlooked as the
island embarks on a Dollars 306bn six-year National Development plan to
improve its infrastructure and quality of life. There is a consensus that
these policy changes were needed, but their implementation will decide
whether Taiwan can successfully move to the next stage of industrial
development.
Political reform, instigated by President Lee Teng-hui since 1987, has so
far been relatively smooth. In December Taiwan holds its first fully
representative election for the Legislative Yuan, or parliament. The ruling
Kuomintang party (KMT) is expected to win a comfortable majority. It has
been prepared to adopt populist platforms espoused by its poorly organised
opposition, the Democratic Progressive Party. KMT control of the media,
Taiwan's rising wages, low unemployment and a generally egalitarian
education system have helped stability.
But the greatest test for Taiwan lies in upgrading its industry. Since the
late 1980s rising land costs and annual wage increases of 10 per cent,
combined with a 50 per cent appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against
its US counterpart between 1986 and 1989, have undermined profits for
capital intensive industries and forced many low cost manufacturers overseas
or out of business.
Heavy industrial output fell from double to single digit growth from 1988
and was almost flat in 1990. Light industrial output fell for three
successive years, before recovering in 1991. According to government
figures, manufacturing profit margins fell to below 4 per cent in 1989.
Declining profitability seems to have contributed to an 8 per cent fall in
private investment in 1990.
Export growth was also constrained, but has risen again since last year as
exchange rates stabilised. But imports have grown even faster, fuelled by
consumer demand and machinery purchases for infrastructure spending.
Worried by these trends, the government has been urging companies to upgrade
technology, invest in automation, research and design. In strategic
industries like aerospace, it has been willing to help finance acquisitions
of advanced foreign technology.
Most of these initiatives have been inserted into the government's six-year
National Development plan, launched last year. The plan's budget will
largely be spent on infrastructure projects, such as transport, energy and
environmental improvements, which were neglected during the 1980s. Although
the plan is widely criticised for being poorly researched and leading to
inflation, set to rise to 4-5 per cent, it will guarantee growth.
Mr Jiang Ping-kun, vice minister of economics, said:
'Taiwan depends on industrial development. We have to upgrade from relying
on labour intensive industries to high-tech, and that needs investment both
by the government and the private sector.
Results have been mixed so far, although some of the measures have only just
taken effect. The government claims this year's increase in exports shows
companies are becoming more competitive.
But critics argue that the rise in exports is temporary and manufacturers
will again face squeezed margins if, as expected, the currency continues to
appreciate next year.
Companies being asked to upgrade have one good reason, and one good excuse,
not to do so. The good reason is China. By moving across the Taiwan Straits,
light industrial companies, which still account for more than 40 per cent of
exports, can take advantage of the low wages and land prices they used to
enjoy in Taiwan.
Restrictions on investing in China started to ease in 1987. Since then
Taiwanese companies are estimated to have invested at least Dollars 3bn in
the mainland, and anecdotal evidence suggests the trend is rising. However,
there are no precise figures because companies hide their identities for
political reasons.
Taiwan's trade with China through Hong Kong has grown rapidly since 1987 and
increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn for the first seven months of
the year. If other indirect trade and smuggling is included, total trade
could near Dollars 10bn this year. Exports from Taiwan are mostly destined
for processing in new Taiwanese factories on the mainland.
The good excuse is that most Taiwan companies are small, and often family
run, so lack resources to upgrade technology. Nearly 70 per cent of the
island's manufacturing companies employ less than 20 people. Taiwan has 352
pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, for example, but less than
30 have capital bases of Dollars 4m or more. Growth through acquisition is
difficult because owners are unwilling to sell family businesses.
