  [Text] Taipei, April 28 KYODO--Taiwan's Transportation and 
Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun on Thursday [28 April] 
said that the government will instruct China Airlines to 
sufficiently improve its safety measures in the wake of its 
jetliner crash at Nagoya airport in central Japan, which killed 
263 people. 
  Liu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said if the national 
flag 
carrier fails to implement the instruction demand within a 
specific period, the government may suspend some of its routes. 
  Li also said the government will take some disciplinary 
measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday 
crash. 
  Earlier in the day, President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a 
meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist 
Party (Kuomintang) that a special committee has been set up 
within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to 
supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines 
in the aftermath of the crash. 
  All but eight of the aircraft's 271 passengers and crew, 
mostly Japanese and Taiwanese, were killed in the crash of the 
Airbus A300- 600R, arriving in Nagoya from Taipei. Two of the 
survivors are Taiwanese. 
  It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 
11th 
since 1969, giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of 
crashes per flight hours than the world average. 
  Many of the crashes, in which a total of 410 people have 
died, involved human error.
