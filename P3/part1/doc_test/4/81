  [Text] Fujian, China's frontline province with Taiwan, is 
hoping to penetrate Taipei's "white glove" mainland policy by 
opening her harbour resources to Taiwan businesses. The 
invitation by the newly-elected Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi is a 
tempting offer because Taiwan which has achieved impressive 
economic growth over the past decade, has been under great 
pressure to expand its already saturated harbours. Taiwan's two 
largest ports, Keelung and Kaohsiung, have been so heavily 
congested in recent years that seagoing vessels often face 
lengthy delays. 
  According to Mr Chen, Taiwan's petrochemical and shipping 
business could reap impressive economic benefits if they made 
use of port facilities on Fujian's 3,300-kilometre coastline. 
For example, Mr Chen said Fujian was ready to open the Meizhou 
Bay and a military port at Sandouao to Taiwan. They are ideal 
for the construction of deep-water port facilities. Mr Chen 
believed these two ports not only provided a solution to the 
congestion problems at Taiwan's Keelung and Kaohsiung, they 
could also serve as entrepot to Taiwan. Furthermore, economic 
co-operation between Fujian and Taiwan could also cover joint 
development of petroleum resources in the Taiwan Strait, 
meteorological studies and agriculture, Mr Chen said. 
  According to another Fujian official, Communist Party 
Secretary Jia Qinglin, Beijing has already earmarked Zhangzhou 
in southern Fujian as a "priority development zone" and promised 
to allocate 20 million yuan (HK$17.76 million) every year for 
its development. The last attraction was considered a direct 
response by Beijing to an earlier suggestion by Taiwan President 
Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan farmers might consider joining hands 
with their mainland counterparts. 
  Plagued by rising land cost and serious environmental 
pollution, Taiwan farmers have been pressuring the Government 
for assistance to maintain their market competitiveness. In 
addition, Mr Jia, who is also the chairman of the province's 
legislature, said Xiamen, which was opposite to Taiwan's Quemoy 
island would soon introduce new laws to guarantee the protection 
of Taiwanese investors' interest there. 
  Fujian's eagerness to lure Taiwan business was also evident 
from the fact the Government was ready to invest billions of 
yuan in energy projects including a US$4 billion (HK$30.88 
billion) nuclear plant in a small town called Shanqian. 
  Although the Kuomintang Government in Taiwan still 
officially 
maintained its "one China" policy, it has steadfastly resisted 
pressure from her business community to open direct 
communication and transport link with the mainland. This "white 
glove" policy by Taipei was a major obstacle to large Taiwan 
businesses investing in China.
