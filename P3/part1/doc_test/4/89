<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column written by Jen Hui-wen </F>
(0117 1979 2429) on 30 March 1994 in Beijing: "Why Liu Huaqing 
Does Not Renounce the Use of Force Against Taiwan"] 
  [Text] Premier Li Peng delivered his "Government Work 
Report" at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] on 10 March. When talking about the Taiwan 
issue, Li pointed out: In the new year, we should continue to 
unswervingly follow the policy of "peaceful reunification and 
one country, two systems" and work actively to promote the great 
cause of reunifying the country. It is necessary to uphold the 
principle of one country and solve differences between the two 
sides of the strait through increased contacts and 
consultations. Moreover, at the Second Session of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] in March, Guo Pingtan, vice 
president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, 
stressed that "an awareness of Taiwan is not tantamount to an 
awareness of Taiwan independence" and that "the aspiration of 
Taiwan compatriots to become masters in administering Taiwan is 
fair, reasonable, and just and is different from "Taiwan 
independence." Consequently, some media maintain that communist 
China has recently toned down the Taiwan issue, most likely in 
an effort to find a mutually-acceptable breakthrough point in 
the peace talks as quickly as possible. In fact, what Li Peng 
and Guo Pingtan said were reaffirmations of the basic stand of 
the White Paper entitled "The Taiwan Issue and the Reunification 
of China," which was issued by the State Council on 1 September 
1992, and this basic stand had its origin with General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin's report before the 14th party congress on 12 
October 1992. 
<H5>  The Circumstances Under Which China Will Use Force Against </H5>
Taiwan 
  If there should be new moves in communist China's Taiwan 
policy, it is, as this writer pointed out in this column on 4 
March, that the impact of Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's 
"holiday diplomacy" has forced communist China to review its 
tactics toward reunification with Taiwan. Specifically, it 
should be prepared for both eventualities. While basing itself 
on "peaceful reunification," it should also prepare for 
"reunification by force." In the view of communist China, 
without preparing for "reunification by force" it will be hard 
to realize "peaceful reunification"; after the possibility of 
"peaceful reunification" is ruled out, "reunification by force" 
will become necessary. 
  According to a source in Beijing, it was reported in the 19 
March TONGXUN JIANBAO [News Dispatches in Brief] of the CPC 
Central Committee's General Office that, when talking with 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] delegates attending the NPC and 
CPPCC sessions on 18 March, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, specifically stressed the need to 
be prepared for "reunification by force." 
  Liu pointed out: The question of whether there will be war 
between the two sides of the strait depends on the Taiwan 
authorities. He said: "Reunification of the motherland through 
peaceful means is the common aspiration of all Chinese. The 
people on both sides are Chinese. It would be extremely 
unfortunate if the compatriots on both sides should resort to 
arms and kill one another due to a split in China's sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. This is something that we are very 
reluctant to see, but it cannot be determined by our subjective 
desire. Li Teng-hui's basic strategy is to work for Taiwan 
independence. If Taiwan declares independence, this should be 
resolved by war. We stand firm on matters of principle. Why do 
our troops retain the two characters meaning `liberation'? 
Because our country has yet to be fully reunified, and it is 
probably necessary to safeguard state sovereignty and 
territorial integrity through military means." 
  Liu added: "We put forward the principle of `peaceful 
reunification and one country, two systems,' i.e. achieving 
reunification under the principle of `I will not eat you up nor 
should you eat me up.' This expresses our greatest sincerity for 
peace. So far, however, we have not seen such sincerity on the 
part of Li Teng-hui. If the senior Chiang (Chiang Kai-shek) and 
the junior Chiang (Chiang Ching-kuo) were still alive, they 
would not tolerate `Taiwan independence,' `one China, one 
Taiwan,' and `two Chinas.' Why do we say that Li Teng-hui does 
not have sincerity for the peace talks? He himself knows the 
answer very well. He openly pushes forward international 
activities for `Taiwan independence,' supports the Democratic 
Progressive Party, and squeezes out and attacks the backbone 
forces in the Kuomintang who uphold one China. This is known to 
all. Precisely because of this, we cannot but prepare for the 
worst and make preparations for `reunification by force.'" 
  According to an expert on the Taiwan issue at the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Liu Huqing did not 
advocate "reunification by force." His original intention was 
that the Taiwan people would urge the Taiwan authorities to set 
store by the righteous cause of the nation and strive for the 
peaceful reunification of the two sides. 
<H5>  Liu Huaqing Cites 10 Facts To Show That Li Teng-hui Is </H5>
Working for Taiwan Independence 
  The source said: In his talk, Liu cited 10 facts to show 
that Li Teng-hui has persisted in working for "Taiwan 
independence" since he took office as Taiwan president. 
  1. The roping in of and collusion with anti-China and 
anti-communist congressmen and political forces in the congress 
in supporting the practice of "Taiwan independence," "one China, 
one Taiwan," and "two Chinas." 
  2. Collusion with the anti-China, anti-communist 
political forces in Japan in supporting "Taiwan independence" 
and engaging in the long-standing activities of being 
antagonistic to the mainland. 
  3. Acceleration of the expansion of military strength, 
incitement of hostile sentiments among Taiwan compatriots 
against the mainland, and moving toward the goal of Taiwan 
independence. 
  4. Creation of the so-called "theory of military 
expansion" to sow dissension between Southeast Asian countries 
and China. 
  5. Continued dispatch of hostile elements to the mainland 
to steal intelligence on the party, government, Army, and 
economy. 
  6. Continued provision of economic aid under various 
names to overseas and outside-the-border organizations hostile 
to the mainland. 
  7. Collusion with the Tibetan separatist, the Dalai Lama, 
in conducting separatist activities. 
  8. Support for the British Hong Kong authorities' acts of 
violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements 
between the two countries. 
  9. Creation of numerous incidents of shooting and killing 
mainland compatriots (fishermen in the coastal areas) on the 
Taiwan Strait. 
  10. When the Olympic Committee decided on the country to 
host the 2000 Olympics last year, a major issue of principle 
which had a bearing on national dignity, Taiwan voted for 
Australia instead of the Chinese mainland. 
  As pointed out by the aforesaid expert in the Taiwan issue, 
Liu Huaqing cited the fact that Li Teng-hui engages in "Taiwan 
independence" activities to enable PLA officers and men to 
clearly understand Li Teng-hui's true colors and to warn Li not 
to go further down the path of "Taiwan independence" or even 
count on the involvement of the United States and other Western 
countries in supporting "Taiwan independence." Otherwise, a war 
to liberate Taiwan will become inevitable.

Economic Links 
  The source added: To work for peaceful reunification with 
Taiwan, communist China has adopted a series of measures to 
boost development in cross-strait relations. On the political 
front, those going to Taiwan will no longer be held accountable 
for the crimes they committed before the founding of the PRC. 
On the military front, the shelling of Jinmen and other islands 
have been suspended, and some forward positions and observation 
posts in the coastal areas of Fujian are being turned into 
economic development zones or tourist spots. On the economic 
front, the mainland has opened the door wide to promote 
exchanges. Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in the 
mainland or carry out trade activities; in fact, the mainland 
has given them preferential terms and legal guarantees. On 
other fronts, such as personnel contacts, post and 
telecommunications, communications, science and technology, 
culture, sports, academic research, and news, the mainland is 
also vigorously encouraging exchanges and cooperation. The 
mainland has set up the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait, a government-sanctioned nongovernmental 
organization, to establish contacts with the Straits Exchange 
Foundation and other relevant nongovernmental organizations in 
Taiwan to boost development in cross-strait relations. The 
Wang-Koo meeting held in April 1993, during which four 
agreements were signed, represents an important step of 
historical significance in cross-strait relations. An 
atmosphere of relaxation, which has never been seen in the past 
40 years and more, has emerged in the Taiwan Strait. This is 
favorable to peaceful reunification. 
  Of the numerous measures, Deng Xiaoping reportedly puts 
particular emphasis on the need to increase cross-strait 
economic links. He said: "By closely linking the economy of 
the two sides we can curb `Taiwan independence' to a maximum 
degree." To this end, the communist Chinese authorities 
recently approved the establishment of several Taiwan investment 
zones in the coastal areas to suit the situation of Taiwan 
investments on the mainland. Meanwhile, at its sixth meeting in 
March this year, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee approved the 
"Law of the PRC on Protecting Investments by Taiwan 
Compatriots." The protection of Taiwan investments in terms of 
a law will further promote cross-strait economic cooperation. 
  However, as the Kuomintang and the CPC have many 
long-standing grievances against one another, plus the fact that 
the international forces support "Taiwan independence" by every 
possible means, people dare not be optimistic about the prospect 
of the two sides burying the hatchet.
