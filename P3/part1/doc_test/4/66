  [Text] Indonesia threw a blanket of secrecy over a planned 
meeting between visiting ROC [Republic of China] President Li 
Teng-hui and Indonesian President Suharto on the resort island 
of Bali on Friday [11 February]. 
  Officials in Jakarta, who are being tight-lipped ever since 
Li arrived in Bali on Wednesday on a three-country trip that has 
raised the ire of Mainland China, declined to give details, but 
said they expected that the two leaders had already met in 
Taipei. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan Television Enterprise, or TTV, confirmed 
Friday night that Li after having met Friday [as received] 
before Suharto flew back to Jakarta in the late afternoon. 
Although no video or still pictures of Li and Suharto together 
were featured on the television newscast, the vehicles used by 
both Li and Suharto were shown arriving at the Bali meeting site. 
  According to TTV, Suharto reportedly expressed his 
admiration 
for impressive achievements of Taiwan small and medium 
enterprises. Meanwhile, Li reportedly said the ROC wanted to 
boost its role as a partner in international and regional 
economic groupings, as well as work to help insure the 
maintenance of peace in the region. 
  In Indonesia, the official ANTARA news agency said: Suharto, 
accompanied by State Secretary Murdiono and Tourism and 
Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave, was to visit Bali on 
Friday to see the Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which was devastated 
by fire one year ago. 
  Official sources said: Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had also 
traveled to Bali on Friday. Suharto's movements were off limit 
to all journalists. 
  President Li's tour of Southeast Asia, billed as a private 
trip, has angered Mainland China, which regards Taiwan as a 
renegade province. Beijing warned the Philippines, Indonesia, 
and Thailand their relations with Mainland China could be 
damaged if they allowed Li's trip to proceed. 
  Indonesia, current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement and 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has formal diplomatic 
ties with Beijing. Foreign Minister Alatas has said a private 
visit by Li will not change Jakarta's one-China policy. Quote, 
Li Teng-hui's visit to Bali is only an informal one. He is on 
vacation in Bali. There is no deviation from Indonesia's stand 
of having only trade relations with Taiwan, unquote. 
  In the aftermath of ROC President Li Teng-hui's lunch with 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos this week, Mainland China said 
the meeting sabotaged friendly relations between Beijing and 
Manila. But Ramos immediately countered that he had not violated 
Manila's one-China policy. Beijing's embassy in Manila said it 
will lodge a formal protest over Wednesday's luncheon meeting 
between Li and Ramos. A copy of the embassy's statement was 
sent to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. 
In the statement, the embassy accused Taiwan of pursuing a 
southward policy aimed at developing substantive relations with 
some nations and creating a two-China situation. Beijing 
officially regards Taiwan as a renegade province. 
  Before Li flew into Subic Bay, northwest of Manila, on the 
first leg of a three-nation private trip, Beijing told the 
Philippines the visit would harm relations. 
  The Ramos government tried to throw a veil of secrecy over 
the meeting. Once news leaked out, Ramos acknowledged that it 
took place, but said it did not violate Manila's one-China 
policy under which the Philippines officially recognizes 
Mainland China. 
  In a live interview on Philippine television Thursday night, 
Ramos said he and Li had not talked about political matters. 
Ramos said they only discussed trade and economic cooperation 
which is allowed under the one-China policy. Under the term of 
its one-China policy, the Philippine Government officially 
recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China, 
of which Taiwan is an integral part. Ramos said that Taiwan is 
today the biggest investor in Subic Bay. Taiwan-based 
enterprises are investing in a 300 hectre industrial estate 
which will be the site of 150 factories which is scheduled to be 
inaugurated on 20 February. Ramos added that Taiwan has 
arranged for soft loans amounting to $23 million for the 
development of Subic Bay. This could be expanded to $100 
million in the next couple of years depending on the need, he 
added. Ramos also said that he and Li discussed joint ventures 
in agriculture-based businesses. Li reportedly told Ramos that 
he would like to see the Philippines supply Taiwan's sugar 
reguirements since sugar production on the island has dropped 
significantly due to land use changes. Ramos hosted a luncheon 
meeting at the Admiral's House in Subic for Li and his entourage 
of 60 businessmen and officials, including Foreign Minister 
Federick Chien and Council for Economic and Planning Development 
Chairman Vincent Hsiao. 
  Philippine officials said Beijing's reaction was largely 
what 
had already been expected. They said the Phillipines has to 
balance its desire for good relations with Beijing against its 
urgent need for investment from Taiwan.
