  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui is making use of 
the Chinese New Year break to tour Indonesia and Thailand. 
Although the trip is announced as private, the PRC is certain 
to react unfavorably because Beijing will try to impose its "One 
China" policy on the countries with which it maintains relations. 
  Indonesia does not appear to pay much attention to China, as 
evidenced by the reception accorded by President Suharto to the 
Taiwanese president. By contrast, the Thai Government will not 
have any official part in the Taiwanese president's visit. 
  On behalf of the Thai Government, Foreign Minister Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri stated that Thailand firmly maintained 
the "One China" policy and that the government had nothing to do 
with the Taiwanese president's visit. He said Li's visit 
concerned trade and investment matters and did not involve 
international political activities. [passage omitted] 
  Thailand has been a good friend of China. It has graciously 
implemented correct policies regarding China and Taiwan. 
However, taking into account the national interests, there is 
no reason for Thailand to neglect economic relations which could 
grow as result of the Taiwanese president's private visit. This 
is the way every country in the world operates. 
  We are confident that the Thai foreign ministry will be able 
to explain and gain China's understanding. We also are 
confident that China will be broadminded enough to accept the 
undeniable reality.
