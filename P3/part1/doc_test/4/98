<F P=106> [Report on a news conference held by Taiwan President Li </F>
Teng-hui with unidentified correspondents at Taoyuan Chiang 
Kai-shek International Airport on 16 February; from the "Hookup" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted containing reporter's summary 
of Li Teng-hui comments] At present, after the end of the Cold 
War, the international situation, especially the international 
economic situation, has gradually shifted toward regional 
cooperation. The further establishment of regional economic 
relations under these circumstances is a matter of great 
importance. There should be an exchange of views between the 
leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of 
China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and 
their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will 
be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there 
were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic 
relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and 
hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the 
three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded 
fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to 
further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation 
in the Asian region in the future. 
  Through our current visit, we can see that all countries' 
views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more 
than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing. 
Although we met with many unnecessary interferences in the 
course of our visit to the three countries, we handled those 
matters in a very serious manner. We are convinced that the 
whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a 
progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and 
a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different 
opinions toward any region or country, including Communist 
China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our 
efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia 
are all the same. Further development of our country [women 
guojia] must be separated from the ideological field. We should 
continue to make greater efforts in the three directions, namely 
peace, cooperation, and prosperity. [passage omitted containing 
reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments] 
  The benefits to foreign relations through the current visit 
cannot be seen in the short term. We must patiently make 
contacts with many countries step by step. By doing this, we 
will achieve genuine results. However, we do not have a 
political agenda. Everyone should realize that the ROC on Taiwan 
must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a country of a 
divided China [zhonghua minguo keyi shuo shi zhongguo fenlie 
zhong de yige guojia]. The whole world should realize that a 
unified China is a goal we will attain in the future. However, 
at present the reality is that China is divided. As a divided 
country under separate rule, we should set the direction for our 
own development. This will produce greater benefits for China 
when it achieves unification. The Chinese of the world should 
not approach this unofficial visit from a political point of 
view, regarding it as something that was intended to create one 
China, one Taiwan, or two China's. There is no need to see the 
visit in this way, and quite obviously, that was impossible. 
This may be a year the ROC will develop a new direction for its 
international relations. I will visit countries with which we 
have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we do not 
have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say which 
countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after every 
preparation has been made. The country I would like to visit 
most is the United States [Li and other people's laughter]. 
[passage omitted containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui 
comments] 
  All the countries in the world, including their leaders and 
officials, are very pragmatic. They have their own way of 
looking at economic growth and democracy. Therefore, we need 
not worry about this issue. Nor should we adopt an unfriendly 
attitude toward the mainland simply because of its attitude. We 
shall continue to maintain our existing ties with the mainland. 
What we are doing is trying to strengthen mutual trust. We 
should continue to do so. We should tell them: Your acting like 
this will do no good to yourselves. We should use this 
opportunity to let everyone know. We should help the countries 
concerned. These countries will gradually come to realize that 
the ROC can help them better than any other country. Once they 
realize this, they will change their attitude. [passage omitted 
containing reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments] 
  Whether it is an achievement or not, I will be very happy if 
anything I did is beneficial to the country. My state of mind 
has not changed as a result of the visit. I would feel very 
good if I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning 
candle, could help improve the life of ordinary citizens and 
enable them to live peacefully in the country and region. It is 
not appropriate to grade myself. Nobody has ever graded 
oneself. However, I am very happy. [passage omitted containing 
reporter's summary of Li Teng-hui comments].
