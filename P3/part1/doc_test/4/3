rubric: "Taking a Risk on `Holiday Diplomacy'" -- first 
paragraph is THE NATION introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui came to play golf, 
but those very unofficial, very private chats he had with top 
businessmen from three of China's regional allies certainly 
roiled the waters. Was it worth it? 
  The so-called "holiday diplomacy" trip to Thailand by 
Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, which ended on Wednesday, has 
prompted some tough questions here. 
  First, is the visit to be seen as a test of wills between 
those who uphold Thailand's One-China policy and those who are 
hearing Taiwan's money talk -- or was it aimed at garnering 
political support from economic partners throughout the world? 
Second, was the "one-metre march", as President Li described 
his Southeast Asia tour, a signal that the island nation is 
making a diplomatic move toward declaring itself a new state -- 
and will China use force to stop it? Third, what does Thailand 
stand to gain from the visit? [passage omitted] 
  Elsewhere in Asean or the Indochinese states newly recovered 
from wars and needing massive foreign investment, Taiwanese 
businessmen always come in force and are invariably given a warm 
welcome. 
  Save for promoting national identity to weld together the 
mainland's plethora of diverse ethnic minorities and autonomous 
regions, it seems pointless for China to try and stop her 
neighbours from doing business with Taiwan. At the same time, it 
is too early to say whether Taiwan will be able to successfully 
swing political support over to its side. 
  A senior security official says China and Taiwan's 
relationship will continue to be a classic display of diplomacy, 
until the two sides settle their differences either by peace or 
by force. "Taiwan's aspiration is to exist as a state separate 
from China, in much the same way as North Korea and South Korea 
co-exist." 
  At this point no country, not even the United States, which 
helped separate the Korean peninsula, would put money on the 
Taiwanese side. "The overriding interest of the United States, 
in maintaining a peaceful presence in this region, is to 
befriend China," said the expert. 
  Hypothetically, he said, if Li's provocative tour was a test 
of world support for Taiwan declaring itself a new state, the 
island's best hope would be that global support would prevent 
China from using military force in response. This hypothesis 
will have some basis in fact if what President Li told local 
reporters when he returned home is translated into action. Li 
jokingly said he needed to march a hundred metres in order to 
gain world support. [passage omitted] 
  The same official said things will be much clearer after 
Hong 
Kong is handed back to China in 1997. "How China treats Hong 
Kong will have far-reaching implications for Taiwan too." 
  Thai officials at the Foreign Ministry said the economic 
gains to be made in allowing Li's visit are not evident. In the 
Philippines, Taiwanese businessmen are keen to turn Subic Bay 
into an industrial zone, while Indonesia and Taiwanese investors 
are planning to build an aircraft factory in Bundung. A senior 
official said the visit to Thailand was a gain for the 
Taiwanese. "Taiwan can claim back home that it has surmounted 
the Southeast Asian wall," he said. 
  Thailand, the official noted, has had both good and bitter 
experiences with China in terms of history and culture. "Why 
didn't China make as much noise in Singapore as it did here?" he 
asked. [passage omitted] 
  It is true Taiwanese investment in Thailand appears to have 
reached the saturation point. The choice of the Philippines and 
Indonesia as the first two stops shows where the priorities of 
Taiwanese investors lie. Board of Investment figures show that 
Taiwanese investment here has dropped from Bt [baht] 6.4 billion 
in 1991 to Bt5.96 billion in 1993. The turn-down has 
contributed to the relocation of the investment market to China 
and Vietnam. 
  So there are good reasons to encourage additional investment 
and to welcome Li without "violating the understanding, reached 
on the Taiwan issue", as China claimed. Moreover, even if 
Taiwanese investment has peaked in Thailand itself, there is 
plenty of opportunity for the Taiwanese to play a key part in 
the newborn Growth Quadrangle and the yet-to-take off triangular 
economic cooperation involving Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is perhaps a bit unfortunate for Thailand to have been 
the 
last stop on Li's three-nation tour after so much propaganda 
from Taipei. [passage omitted] 
  As it turned out, the personal nature of the visit to 
Thailand was self-evident. The Chinese would only have to look 
at the people who received Li -- Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai 
Wirawan (known as Lin Ri Guang due to his business connections 
with Taiwan), his cousins and a few Thai businessmen including 
Utane Techaphaibun and Chatri Sophonphanit. They all had 
business reasons for talking with the visitors. [passage omitted]
