<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Zun Qi: "Li Teng-hui's Holiday Diplomacy"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Taiwan, known as the Republic of China, has 
behaved itself in the international community for over 20 years. 
After losing its United Nations seat in 1971, many countries, 
including Japan, ASEAN countries, and the United States, broke 
diplomatic relations to establish diplomatic relations with 
Beijing. Those countries, however, continue to maintain normal 
economic relations with Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  Now, Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with only 29 
countries, mostly small and poor countries in Africa or Latin 
America. No Asian countries have diplomatic relations with 
Taiwan, although they maintain good trade links with it. Taiwan 
leaders, especially President Li Teng-hui, want to improve 
Taiwan's position in the international arena. So they practice 
contructive diplomacy through informal visits or a "holiday" 
diplomacy. [passage omitted] 
  President Li Teng-Hui and his delegation arrived in Thailand 
on 14 February. In Phuket, President Li Teng-hui met some 
leading Thai businessmen such as rice exporter Hu Yulin [Thai 
name: Saman Ophatwong] and Li Guanglong [Thai name: Wisit 
Lilasithon]. He also played golf with Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan. Although President Li Teng-hui did not meet 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Squadron 
Leader Prasong Sunsiri, he had an unexpected audience with the 
king for 20 minutes before leaving for home. Taiwan's efforts 
were successful, but it spent a lot for the ASEAN tour. 
  China tried to prevent the "holiday diplomacy." The Chinese 
Foreign Ministry issued warnings, saying that any reception of 
President Li Teng-hui would be tantamount to the violation of 
the "one-China" policy and affect bilateral relations. 
Moreover, China also canceled a visit by a National People's 
Congress delegation to Thailand and the Philippines. [passage 
omitted] 
  Thailand upholds the "one-China" policy. The Thai leader 
also did not meet President Li Teng-hui. So, China should 
understand Thailand's stand. 
  Taiwan's "holiday diplomacy" is profoundly wise. It will not 
achieve concrete political achievements, however, unless China 
loses its wisdom. All in all, it is believed that China will 
wisely continue to maintain its relations with ASEAN countries.
