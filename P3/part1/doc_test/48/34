<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez; from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez has 
agreed to remain in his post and work in the government of Dr. 
Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, upon his arrival 
for a meeting with the National Police director, said he will 
not yet officially announce who will make up his cabinet, but 
said he will seek the desired national consensus. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] There is a positive 
atmosphere to achieve a consensus, which all Panamanians want 
and for which, I understand, the Panamanian people voted. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could this attempt at a consensus 
lead to some problems within the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
[PRD]? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, our party will be very well 
represented in the cabinet and in all government posts because 
it is also the party that obtained the most votes. The party 
has the political maturity to understand that to achieve a 
consensus it is necessary to allow other forces to participate, 
otherwise there will not be a consensus. We cannot speak of 
good intentions only. We have to put them into practice. [end 
recording] 
  The meeting, which was held in the office of National Police 
Director Oswaldo Fernandez, lasted over two hours. Some of 
Perez Balladares' top advisers participated. 
  As he was leaving, the Panamanian president-elect broke the 
tight security to greet the personnel working in this public 
security institution. 
  National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez said the meeting 
with the president-elect was to brief him on the Public Force, 
its organization, and the future support for this institution by 
the new government. Fernandez also talked about Perez 
Balladares' offer to have him remain as the institution's 
director. Fernandez said he accepted after President Guillermo 
Endara also asked him to stay. 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We decided to remain here. As 
I told your colleagues a moment ago, it was not an easy decision 
for an attorney who had already been nominated for a post in the 
Supreme Court. 
  [Reporter] What motivated you to stay? 
  [Fernandez] The primary reason was that both the incoming 
and 
outgoing presidents asked me to stay. In addition, I have also 
received requests from many people in the National Police, 
especially policemen, sergeants, and corporals, who asked me to 
stay with the institution. If both presidents thought I should 
remain as director, it was not because I was the best but 
because of the work accomplished by the National Police. The 
work has been carried out thanks to those people, who asked me 
to stay with them. [end recording]
