Are there a few new spirits flying out of Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts"? 
</P>
<P>
This 1881 drama has, at least on paper, acquired fresh relevance. Or so wrote 
Jack Shouse, head of Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts Theaterfest, 
in program notes about the new season, which shuttles shows between an indoor 
theater at Santa Maria and an outdoor stage in Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghosts" is about a man whose terrible venereal disease is apparently a product 
of his now-dead father's philandering -- and his mother's reluctance to defy 
convention by leaving the rake before conceiving a child with him. In the 
program, Shouse connected the play to such current issues as "the social stigma 
faced by those suffering from a deadly disease." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "Ghosts" was "once banned because it presented situations 
and ideas which were considered scandalous . . . In an era when censorship in 
the arts is hotly debated," the example of Ibsen's play supports "freedom of 
artistic expression . . . regardless of our feeling about one artist's specific 
subject or approach." 
</P>
<P>
In other, more explicit words, Shouse is suggesting that thoughts of AIDS and 
the National Endowment for the Arts and even 2 Live Crew might flit through the 
minds of audiences watching "Ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
This effort to create a little controversy out of "Ghosts" is encouraging, in a 
PCPA season that otherwise sticks to the tried and true: "A Chorus Line," 
"Little Shop of Horrors," "The Importance of Being Earnest," "Guys and Dolls" 
and yet another "Much Ado About Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy doesn't go very far in Roger DeLaurier's staging. Perhaps 
it's just as well, regarding the tenuous parallel to AIDS. The fact is that any 
"social stigma" suffered by the syphilitic son Oswald is a very minor concern 
in "Ghosts." His real problem is that he's going insane. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad, though, that this revival couldn't generate enough heat to evoke 
the current censorship battle, without the prompting of Shouse's program notes. 
Watching this generally bloodless production, it's difficult to imagine Ibsen 
as the Karen Finley of his day. 
</P>
<P>
The language in the new translation by Jerry Turner is no more raw than that of 
previous translations; the text still doesn't even mention the name of Oswald's 
disease (Shouse followed suit in his program notes by not specifying AIDS as 
today's "deadly disease"). 
</P>
<P>
There is no sexual chemistry between Frederic Barbour's Oswald and Lisa 
Paulsen's Regina, the maid whom Oswald later discovers is his half-sister. Nor 
is it easy to understand how Dee Maaske's Mrs. Alving could have been attracted 
to a younger version of Philip Stockton's wan, nattering Pastor Manders. 
</P>
<P>
We do sense the blood flowing beneath the skin of Maaske's Mrs. Alving. She 
speaks in dark, tart cadences that ring with authority, and her eyes reveal 
even more. In fact, she's so strong that it's hard to believe that Mrs. Alving 
was a self-destructive doormat during her marriage. But this is Ibsen's problem 
more than Maaske's. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen is a vibrant Regina, and Carl Palmer has amusing moments as Regina's 
purported father -- though his wild-man wig and beard make him look too 
eccentric to be such a successful con man. But Barbour's Oswald is nothing more 
than a wounded kid. 
</P>
<P>
D Martyn Bookwalter's set, Jerald R. Enos' lights and David C. Eakin's score 
add a touch of tragic grandeur to the more predictable gloom and doom. 
</P>
<P>
The scenic and lighting design and orchestral prowess of the Theaterfest's "A 
Chorus Line," which opened in Solvang while "Ghosts" opened in Santa Maria, 
were not nearly so accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors, which almost serve as a separate character in "A Chorus Line," 
looked cheap and pasted-on -- and they didn't move from the rear of the stage 
during Cassie's "Music and the Mirror" number, when they're supposed to give us 
five views of her at once. The number seemed long-winded, despite the 
professional efforts of Colette Bernal as Cassie. Nor could we see the 
footlights or the audience in these mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra needs to work on intonation, particularly during the staccato 
chords that punctuate the scene in which the dancers thrust their glossies at 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the actors are pretty good. Despite a few weak singers, the show 
still casts a spell. Veteran "Chorus Line" watchers may wonder why the 
character of Connie is no longer Chinese-American, but it's a nice touch to see 
the cast singing "point me toward tomorrow" in a formation that uses the 
Theaterfest's thrust stages to point out at the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows run in rotating repertory; information: (800) 221-9469.
