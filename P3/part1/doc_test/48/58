    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 25 
May. 
  On 11 May, 40 members of the Jaime Bateman Cayon column, a 
dissident group of the 19 April Movement, occupied for three and 
one-half hours a stretch of the Pan-American Highway between 
Ibague and Armenia, 10 km from La Linea. The guerrillas blew up 
the toll booth for the sixth time, stole 1.6 million pesos, and 
burned two vehicles in an action that left four people wounded. 
On 12 May, one guerrilla was killed and six arrested in 
Antioquia, Santander Department. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 13 May 94 p 8A) 
  On 14 May, Army of National Liberation (ELN) members 
belonging to the Camilo Torres Front killed Oswaldo Arturo 
Pajaro Garcia, president of the Municipal Council of Aguachica, 
Cesar Department, and kidnapped Alderman Elibardo Galvis 
Barrera. In another incident, guerrillas suspected of belonging 
to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia burned a Colombian 
Air Force plane which had made an emergency landing in Caqueta 
Department. The plane was attacked while the crew members were 
seeking assistance. Meanwhile, 40 ELN guerrillas kidnapped 
Sucre Mayor Juan Carlos Cure Ramirez, releasing him three hours 
later after having forced him to give them a financial report.

  On 20 May, Colombian police rescued industrialist Joaquin 
Prada San Miguel, who was kidnapped 10 days earlier by ELN 
guerrillas in Santander Department. Five rebels were killed and 
several weapons were confiscasted during the operation. (Mexico
