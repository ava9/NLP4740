DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN GETS 11 YEARS FOR ROLE IN MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Van Nuys woman was sentenced Friday to state prison for at least 
11 years for her role in the murder of a Pacoima man who was gunned down as he 
sat in a car with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Argott, who police say is a gang member, was convicted by a Superior 
Court jury of second-degree murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police said she drove the car Jan. 17 while her boyfriend, Walter Oswaldo 
Barillas, 22, fired at least 11 shots into the victim's car. 
</P>
<P>
Barillas remains at large, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the gunfire was Odilon Gonzalez, 33. But police said the bullets 
missed Gonzalez's fiancee, Irma Ortega, 21, who apparently was saved because 
Gonzalez pushed her to the floor just before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said Argott will remain in prison at least 11 years under the sentence 
of 16 years to life imposed by Judge Darlene E. Schempp.
