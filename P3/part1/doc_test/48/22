  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The night before he was murdered, 
Oswaldo Cruz Junior, president of the ABC [Sao Paulo's 
industrial belt] Highways Driver Union, granted an interview to 
the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC in which he accuses Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva, the virtual PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate, of heading a scheme to transfer union funds to the 
party. 
  He told the newspaper: "Sometimes Lula personally asked us, 
the labor leaders, to collect money from members." 
  Oswaldo Cruz Junior was murdered by Jose Benedito de Souza 
on 
6 January. Souza was a supporter of his uncle, union secretary 
general Cicero Bezerra da Silva, who recently accused Cruz of 
illegal enrichment. From the moment he returned to his post, 
Cruz [who returned as part of a deal to leave his post to 
Bezerra and run for president at the drivers federation] 
reported the irregular transfer of union funds to the PT. 
During the interview, Oswaldo Cruz Junior revealed that the 
transfer of funds to the PT was systematic and that the 
operation was carried out in three different ways. One way was 
to label the transfer of funds as special union expenses. 
  "The drivers union spend 15 million cruzeiros in special 
union expenses during 1993 alone," Oswaldo Cruz Junior said. 
  Cruz reported that the second way to transfer funds to the 
PT 
was to increase union contributions, authorized by ghost 
assemblies. 
  "Sometimes we published edicts convening assemblies to 
authorize discounts of up to 6 percent. The trick was that the 
edicts were not distributed, no one came to the assembly, and 
the discounts were approved," Cruz said. 
  Oswaldo Cruz Junior's interview in the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER 
ABC states that the third mechanism for transferring union funds 
to the PT was the manipulation of deposits held for social 
security contributions and monthly contributions by companies, 
which were directly sent to the unions as of 1988. 
  "If you were to audit the ABC Metallurgical Union you would 
see that the union almost went bankrupt in 1989," Cruz stressed. 
  Oswaldo Cruz said that the union contracted Cotrigal 
Graphics 
of San Andres to print Lula's presidential campaign material in 
1989, but the material was printed in the workers' newspaper 
CHAPEU DE BICO which increased its number of issues from 10,000 
to 300,000 in a single month. 
  "He will not be able to deny it after I show you what was 
published," the union leader said in a challenging manner. 
  Cruz added that in February 1992 5 million cruzeiros was 
transferred to the Santo Andre branch of the PT. The union 
money was to have been used to purchase of the party 
headquarters. Cruz said that the PT Municipal Building was to 
be purchased by the drivers, the chemical, and the metallurgical 
unions. During the interview Cruz said that he received several 
calls from Deputy Arlindo Chinaglia, the PT state president, 
proposing a deal to stop denouncing Lula's party. 
  Cruz said he had proof, adding that he had a meeting 
scheduled with Senators Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive 
Renewal Party-Para] and Esperidian Amim (PPR-SC) [PPR-Santa 
Catarina] for 11 January to talk about the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] on the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. 
During the interview with NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC, the labor 
leader produced a box of video tapes which, he said, contained 
proof of th? transfer of union funds to the PT. 
  Antonio Carlos Monico, former Santo Andre PT president, 
yesterday denied allegations that ABC unions had ever 
transferred money to the PT for the electoral campaign of party 
candidates. Monico was named by union leader Oswaldo Cruz 
Junior, who was murdered on 6 January, as a witness of the PT 
use of union funds in electoral campaigns.
