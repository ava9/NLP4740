The pilgrimage is over. The long march of the West's "progressive" 
intellectuals has come to a bedraggled end in Nicaragua, a peasant nation about 
as far, socially, as a nation can be from the conditions where the revolt 
against modernity was supposed to take root. 
</P>
<P>
Marxism has been just that revolt for those who look upon it sympathetically 
(usually from a safe distance, in modern "bourgeois societies"). The revolt -- 
romanticism in drag, dressed up as science -- was against the supposed cold 
rationality and soulless banality of a capitalist, industrial, commercial 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt was supposed to succeed first where the Industrial Revolution came 
first, in Europe, probably in Germany, with its large proletariat. But the 
supposed engine of history, the industrial workers of the world, would have 
none of it, preferring material progress and freedom, and understanding the 
connection of the two. 
</P>
<P>
So intellectuals in fatigues (Castro, Ortega) foisted Marxism on peasants who 
were perceived as "unspoiled" by the "false consciousness" of capitalism. But 
given a chance, the peasants say, "Please, spoil us." 
</P>
<P>
To the non-Marxist left, including many church groups, the charm of the 
Sandinista regime was its anti-Americanism. How galling for those people that 
the regime has been toppled by a candidate known in Nicaragua to be backed by 
the United States. Where now can the glazed gaze of the last political pilgrims 
turn? To North Korea? Meanwhile, so high have been the stakes of American 
politics, and so mistaken have been the stances of one faction, that in victory 
we have a surfeit of what normally accompanies defeat -- recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet system under the pressure of Western military 
preparedness has elicited, from those who fought that preparedness, the 
preposterous thought that the collapse proves that the preparedness was 
disproportionate to the task. Now the alibi industry on the left, which did not 
quite kill aid to the Contras soon enough to save the Sandinistas, must deal 
with this truth: Without Ronald Reagan, there would have been no Contras to put 
pressure on the regime, pressure that eventually led to elections. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing attempt to make Reagan a figure of fun, an attempt now entering its 
second quarter-century, founders on a huge fact: The world is going his way, in 
no small measure because it was his way. From Eastern Europe to Central 
America, "the evil empire" has collapsed because Moscow lost its nerve and 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
The reputations of many people and the interpretations of many events are 
undergoing revision. The U.S. effort in Vietnam looks more worthwhile in light 
of the subsequent blood baths and waves of boat people. They discredit those 
who, in their zeal to see America defeated, professed to see humanitarianism on 
the other side. 
</P>
<P>
One can now see why the overthrow of Allende's incipient Leninism in Chile, 
coming just as Vietnam was being conquered, was such an unnerving event in 
Moscow and throughout the international left. It shattered the myth of 
inevitability. The leftward ratchet of history was broken: All movement in that 
direction was not irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
Another crack in the left's confidence (confidence was everything, material 
accomplishments being paltry) came when communism crested short of power in 
post-Salazar Portugal. Can it be just 15 years since "Eurocommunism" was "the 
wave of the future"? 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of people who a year ago were suffering under communism's 
cruel stupidities are today suffering even more. They are Chinese -- and, lest 
we forget, Tibetans, who are under China's grinding heel. We know that all the 
nations of the world are now porous to news. (Turn up those American 
transmitters!) Our friends -- if such they still are -- in China, the 
democratic forces, knew what happened in Nicaragua as soon as it happened. Now 
is the time for the Bush Administration to acknowledge the futility of its 
gentle policy toward China and turn up the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The change of regimes is cause for joy in two communities in Miami. Many 
Nicaraguans can now go home. And the Cuban Americans, for whom America is home 
and Cuba is an imprisoned family member, know that Castro is next. Moscow 
should be told that all cooperation with the United States is now contingent on 
the ending of all aid to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
One of the creations of "progressive" political pilgrims was the pro-Castro 
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (which attracted Lee Harvey Oswald). Now, this 
instant, we need a fair-play-for-Cubans policy.
