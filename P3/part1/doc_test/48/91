DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER CONVICTED IN MAN'S SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Friday found a 19-year-old Arleta woman guilty 
of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder for driving a car 
used in a drive-by shooting in which a man was killed and his girlfriend 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated nearly three days before finding Karen Argott guilty in 
the death of Odilon Gonzalez, 23, of Pacoima and the attempted shooting of his 
girlfriend, Irma Ortega, 21, of Van Nuys, on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Argott of a felony charge of shooting into an occupied 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven to 16 shots were fired at Gonzalez and Ortega as they drove west on 
Oxnard Street near Van Nuys Boulevard, police said. Ortega was cut by flying 
glass but escaped serious injury when Gonzalez pushed her to the floor of the 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who previously had been identified by authorities as Odilon 
Navarette, was shot in the back, both arms and head, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Shellie Samuels, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant was issued for Walter Oswaldo Barillas, 23, of Sepulveda, who 
prosecutors allege fired the shots at Argott's behest. Barillas remains at 
large, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said Argott asked Barillas to shoot at the couple in retaliation for an 
earlier incident in which her windshield was broken by bottles outside a 
birthday party for Ortega's sister. Samuels said Ortega did not take part in 
the bottle-throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual drive-by-shooting where it's not the shooter who had the 
motives. It's the driver," Samuels said. "But I think she was as culpable as 
the shooter in the case. The driver had the motive and the driver went and got 
the shooter and brought him to the scene." 
</P>
<P>
Argott's defense attorney, Ralph Peretz, contended that there was no proof that 
his client was driving the car.
