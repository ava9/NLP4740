Eriq LaSalle, the young black actor who played Eddie Murphy's rival for the 
hand of Shari Headley in "Coming to America," will replace Denzel Washington in 
Sanford/Pillsbury's "Love Field." Washington dropped out last week, expressing 
dissatisfaction with the development of his character. The film, written by Don 
Roos and starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Kerwin and 6-year-old Stephanie 
McFadden (who plays LaSalle's daughter), begins filming in North Carolina 
Monday under Jonathan Kaplan's direction. Orion will distribute.

Meanwhile, Propaganda Films is about to launch its own "Love Field." Both 
titles refer to the Dallas airfield where President John Kennedy landed that 
fatal day, Nov. 22, 1963. While the Sanford/Pillsbury production concerns the 
relationships a woman forms on a bus trip in the days following the 
assassination, Propaganda's film focuses on Jack Ruby and his relationship with 
Candy Barr, a stripper in his Dallas nightclub. English playwright Stephen 
Davis is currently polishing his script for director David Fincher, a director 
of music videos who will make his feature debut. Yoni Sighvatsson and Steven 
Golin will produce. No production date is set.

Glenn Ford, who received the French Legion of Honor eight months ago, returns 
to France to star opposite Alain Delon in the English-language political 
thriller, "Black Sky." He plays the American ambassador to France in this 
Italian-French co-production. Director Flavio Mogherini rolls cameras for 
producer Gianni Massaro in Paris April 23.

River Phoenix will star in Warners' "Dog Fight," a tale of young Vietnam-era 
enlistees whose wager over who will bring the ugliest girl to their favorite 
bar on a Saturday night leads to unexpected consequences. Once on George Roy 
Hill's calendar, the film will now be directed by Nancy Savoca, director of 
last year's cult hit, "True Love." The film, written by Bob Comfort, begins 
filming early May in Seattle.
