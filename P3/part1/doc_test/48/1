</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gun, the infernal gun, has been sitting in a safety deposit box for 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The old man who has kept it all these years goes to the bank every now and then 
to check on it. Sometimes he takes other people who just want to have a look at 
the black .38-caliber Colt Cobra pistol that killed Lee Harvey Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ruby used the gun to kill the man who assassinated President John F. 
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. And America watched it all on television. There he 
was, the stocky guy with the Cavanagh hat, lunging toward Oswald in the 
basement of the Dallas police department. Then came the shot, the looks of 
horror on the faces of the policemen who surrounded Oswald. It is a scene 
seared into the memories of Americans old enough to have watched it on that 
Sunday long ago. 
</P>
<P>
The man who has had the gun all this time is Jules Mayer, who was appointed 
executor of Ruby's estate after the one-time strip joint owner died of cancer 
in 1967. Now Ruby's brother, Earl, wants the gun -- which Mayer says could be 
worth $250,000 -- and has filed suit to get it. A hearing on the case will be 
held Friday in a Dallas probate court. 
</P>
<P>
And what this all really seems to be about is two men who dislike each other a 
great deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they hate each other," said James Simons, the lawyer for the Ruby 
family. "I think it's a contest of wills between two old men. Nobody wants to 
give any ground. It's a stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Jack Ruby's gun, as well as the few other things he left behind, 
dates back to 1950. It was in that year that Ruby, whose life ran to the seamy 
side, decided to write a will. And in it, he named Mayer the executor and his 
sisters and nephew the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Roll forward to 1961, when Ruby bought the Colt Cobra in a Dallas pawn shop for 
$75. Roll forward again to Nov. 24, 1963, when Ruby muscled his way through the 
crowd at the Dallas police station and left his grim mark on history. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby died three years later in a Dallas hospital -- the same one at which 
Kennedy and Oswald also died -- and it is at this point that the stories begin 
to diverge. As Earl Ruby tells the story, his brother decided to change the 
will two months before his death. Earl said he was to be appointed the executor 
of the estate and that Jack had called Mayer and told him to tear up the old 
will. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. Jack Ruby lapsed into a coma before the will could be 
properly signed. And Mayer, whether he was told to or not, did not tear up the 
old will. 
</P>
<P>
What Ruby had left behind could be put into a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
There was the gun, of course, and the hat. There was the suit he wore on the 
day he killed Oswald, a diamond-studded watch, a silver and diamond ring, two 
pairs of swim trunks, a shower cap, an athletic supporter and a letter written 
to a woman. Other than that, Ruby left behind only his 1960 model car, which is 
said to be in storage somewhere in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
After Ruby died, Mayer took possession of the estate. William Alexander, the 
deputy district attorney who prosecuted Ruby, turned the gun over to Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mayer) said he thought he could sell that gun to pay off debts and wind up 
the estate," said Alexander in a recent interview. "It should have been settled 
a year or two after the time the will was probated. Realistically, the estate 
should have been closed." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't. The years drifted by and, despite several attempts by Earl Ruby 
to settle the estate, Mayer kept control of it. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bargmann, Mayer's attorney, said the Rubys had so clouded the issue of 
ownership that Mayer couldn't have sold the gun if he wanted to because 
potential buyers are fearful of not having clear title to the pistol. But to 
discover why Mayer didn't attempt to settle the dispute and the estate, "you 
will have to ask Mr. Mayer," Bargmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Mayer, who is at least 80 years old, is not returning calls 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Ruby is, though, and he uses words like "shyster" to describe Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack was in jail for more than three years and Mayer never called, never 
visited and he was only a few blocks away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Earl Ruby filed suit, only to be further enraged by the fact 
that Mayer was claiming in excess of $50,000 in legal fees for his work since 
Jack Ruby died. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do anything in 25 years," said Ruby. And as for fees Mayer is 
asking, Ruby said the amount is more than was paid for the lawyers and 
psychiatrists at his brother's original trial. Included in that were the 
services of famed, and expensive, trial lawyer Melvin Belli. Bargmann said his 
client is entitled to a reasonable fee. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Internal Revenue Service has demanded $96,000 from the Ruby 
estate, though Simons said no claim was made until news reports circulated that 
the gun used to kill Oswald might bring a handsome price from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first position is that it's too late, that the statute of limitations has 
run out and that the IRS is not entitled to anything," Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
The actual value of the gun and other things is a matter of conjecture. Mayer 
has claimed in the past that the gun is worth $250,000, but Bargmann also said 
that while several people had expressed an interest in the gun, they weren't 
exactly knocking down doors to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Alexander to sum up the irony of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This big fight is over a gun that is worth more than Jack Ruby ever had in his 
life."

old enough to have watched it that November day in 1963: Jack Ruby firing his 
.38-caliber Colt Cobra, above, at Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who had 
assassinated President John F. Kennedy two days earlier. Now, the gun is at the 
center of a dispute between the executor of Ruby's estate and Ruby's brother.
