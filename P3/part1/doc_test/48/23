JAIL ESCAPEE ACCEPTS EXTRADITION FROM S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected jewel thief who masterminded an escape from County Jail in Santa 
Ana last year agreed Wednesday to drop his fight against extradition and return 
for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Taylor appeared in court in Rapid City, S.D., and agreed to the 
extradition on the condition that California officials be advised of his fear 
that he will be harmed or killed if he is returned to the state's correctional 
system, Assistant State's Atty. Rod Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
Oswald added that he has relayed the message to California officials, who told 
him they would ensure Taylor's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 36, was arrested in May for allegedly trying to sell a large number of 
loose diamonds at a Rapid City pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
He faces charges of robbery, kidnaping, rape, grand theft and escape. At the 
time of the breakout from the recreation area of the men's jail in Santa Ana, 
Taylor was being held in connection with the theft of more than $2 million in 
jewels from Southern California stores over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Two accomplices arrested with him in South Dakota have been sent to Iowa to 
stand trial on charges of robbing a jewelry store there.
