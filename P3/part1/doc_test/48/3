A Dallas probate judge gave the Internal Revenue Service until Jan. 15 to prove 
its claim to proceeds from the sale of the gun Jack Ruby used to kill Lee 
Harvey Oswald after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Ruby's brother, 
Earl, has until Dec. 22 to prove his and other heirs' contention that they have 
a better claim to profits from the estate, the judge said. Jack Ruby owed the 
IRS $17,000 in taxes when he died in 1967, and the IRS says penalties and 
interest have pushed the amount to $86,010. Earl Ruby long has contested 
executor Jules Mayer's right to the gun, which Mayer says might bring $250,000.
