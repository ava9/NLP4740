Raymond Buckey walked into court today a free man for the first time in nearly 
five years, smiling but refusing to discuss the mass molestation charges 
against him in the McMartin Pre-School case. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was released on $1.5-million bail Wednesday night as reporters and 
photographers swarmed around him. Today Superior Court Judge William Pounders 
likened Buckey's jail exit to the televised slaying of President John F. 
Kennedy's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly a circus," said Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the jurors, who have been admonished to avoid all news coverage of the 
2-year-old trial, if they had seen the release on late-night television news 
shows. They assured that him they had not. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the presence of the jury, Pounders deplored the fact that word of 
Buckey's release had leaked out and said he had tried to keep it a secret for 
Buckey's protection.
