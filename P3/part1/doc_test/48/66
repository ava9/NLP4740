<F P=106> [Interview with Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar by Felipe </F>
Saldivia; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Saldivia] You had not planned to devote yourself to 
politics, but you now find yourself the governor-elect. Was all 
of this an accident? 
  [Aniyar] Yes, these are the pitfalls of life. It was not in 
my plans for it to end this way. I did indeed engage in politics 
when I was very young. At the end of the dictatorship, I served 
for three years in the Legislative Assembly of the State of 
Zulia, but this was so many years ago that, practically 
speaking, it is no longer a part of my life--just a memory. I 
have devoted all of my time to the university. Almost without 
realizing it, I found myself involved in the world of politics, 
because if one feels one is in direct contact with the problems 
of the country, as one should be, the time comes when one cannot 
abstain from setting his hand to the possible solution of those 
problems. And one day, I realized that, almost without knowing 
how, I had accepted the government candidacy, and now I find 
myself the governor-elect. All of these things continue to 
surprise me, because in my political life, I have always been a 
spectator. I watched myself and what was happening to me as if I 
were observing it all from the outside. 
  [Saldivia] You still do not see from within? 
  [Aniyar] I know that I am on the inside, but I have a 
strange 
ability to see myself from the outside. 
  [Saldivia] And how do you see yourself? 
  [Aniyar] As an individual attempting to battle for the 
things 
in which she believes, in a political world in which almost no 
one believes in these things. The proof that this is so is that 
despite the fact that there have been very clear victories in 
these elections, and the people have indicated that they still 
see a potential in democracy, I am currently witnessing actions 
by the traditional old politicians who do not know how to lose, 
and who are trying to muddy a process that was clear and honest. 
And thus one wonders if there are still participants in this old 
political story who are finding it hard to accept defeat, who 
are clinging to the old procedures, and who do not see what is 
happening in the country. 
  [Saldivia] What is happening in Zulia? 
  [Aniyar] The same thing that is happening all over the 
country. There is a great sense of weariness with the 
corruption, the omnipotence, and the imported macroeconomic 
schemes that have nothing to do with the reality here, as well 
as rage at the total crisis. 
  [Saldivia] Why did the COPEI [Social Christian Party] lose, 
while a year ago, it won yet again? Was Oswaldo Alvarez Paz 
simply the winner? 
  [Aniyar] Zulia is a state that has always pursued a search 
for alternative leaderships, which were not always available to 
it. An opportunity came when Luis Homez ran as a candidate for 
government office, but it died at the end of the electoral 
campaign. From that time on, no alternative leadership was 
available until mine emerged. 
  [Saldivia] Who was the last MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] 
candidate? 
  [Aniyar] Juvencio Pulgar, of course, together with Oswaldo 
Alvarez Paz today. And I have the impression that he won the 
votes that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz still had away from him. 
  [Saldivia] What are the specific problems pertaining to your 
election today? 
  [Aniyar] The election results have been recognized by all 
the 
parties except the COPEI. The obstacle is the fact that Leonardo 
Ferrer does not want to admit he lost and came in third. He went 
to the CSE [Supreme Electoral Council] to demand that it impugn 
400 election certificates. This is very funny, because those who 
are challenging these documents are alleging electoral crimes 
committed by people in their own party. It was they who were the 
presidents and secretaries of the election boards--those who 
doubtless gave the orders to affix one more signature, or one 
less seal. This plot was organized well in advance, because they 
knew four months ago when I entered the contest that I was 
leading in the polls. Do you want me to tell you the truth? What 
is happening is that they are trying to put matters in order 
before I take government office. There is great concern because 
I have said that I am going to ask for an audit. I have had no 
input in the 1994 budget, which will cover a half of my term of 
office. It is made up of current and payroll expenditures, with 
a minimum amount for investment--and that, by the way, is being 
seriously threatened. This is very serious, because if I cannot 
express my views about the budget that is going to govern my 
administration, this will prevent me from resolving any of the 
problems of the state. They are working to ruin my 
administration. What we are seeing is a delaying maneuver. 
  [Saldivia] What do you mean by the phrase "putting matters 
in 
order"? Do you believe, then, that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz has 
embarked upon some peculiar manipulation process? 
  [Aniyar] Yes. This government in Zulia is known as the 
10-percent government. It turned into the 20-percent government 
as the campaign approached, thanks to the tribute exacted from 
the public works contractors. Incidentally, one of the elements 
in my electoral campaign, which was of course oriented toward 
explaining that it is possible to govern without corruption, was 
precisely a specific offer to resolve the problem of harassment 
and commissions on public projects. That, among other things. 
The payrolls here have been artificially inflated. The names of 
individuals who are not experts in their sectors have been 
added. For example, there are individuals on the orchestra 
payroll who are not musicians. They have just nervously sworn in 
more than 500 individuals who were allegedly hired some time 
ago. It must be presumed that the accounting processes were 
backdated. Officials are giving jobs to their friends, to their 
little party comrades. This is extremely serious. This 
phenomenon can be seen in other state governments as well, and 
it is very difficult to change because of this evil tradition of 
inflating the payrolls. Each governor brings in his own team and 
then, when he departs, leaves it behind. 
  [Saldivia] And with what team will you be working? That left 
behind by Oswaldo Alvarez Paz? 
  [Aniyar] With the decent team Oswaldo left behind and 
staffers other governors left in place. With the exception of 
the top segment of the payroll, which will be made up of my 
trusted advisers. But I will not allow anyone to be included on 
the official payroll who has been put there fraudulently, or who 
is not actually working. 
  [Saldivia] Do you plan to maintain some distance from the 
MAS 
in your work in the government, as Governor Tablante did? 
  [Aniyar] No, I have a staff already selected, and it is 
basically independent. There is one MAS member and one from the 
Convergence, while the others are independents. They are all 
people whose orientation in politics is similar to mine and to 
that of the MAS. Because it must be realized that they all have 
the same point of view about an alternative in politics. They 
are all individuals with a 21st-century mentality. I am an 
independent, but this does not mean that I will turn my back on 
the MAS in governing, because it has provided me with good 
support and an excellent apprenticeship in honesty and political 
commitment. All I have learned I learned in the MAS faction as a 
senator. Therefore, the counsel of the MAS continues to be 
welcomed, but my independence is not to be challenged. 
  [Saldivia] What mistakes that the MAS governors made do you 
plan to avoid repeating? 
  [Aniyar] I do not think there were errors. Each governor has 
his own way of doing things. I am not like Tablante, but I have 
seen that he developed a government with very effective social 
policies that I would like to understand fully so as to use them 
if they are suitable for Zulia. In the same way, the policies 
implemented by Andres Velasquez in Bolivar were effective. And I 
can also learn about some things done in the health sector in 
the states of Anzoategui and Carabobo, and about what has been 
done in education in Bolivar and Merida. 
  [Saldivia] Could it be said that you owe your place in 
government to Jaime Lusinchi, because of the role you played 
with regard to the accusations made? 
  [Aniyar] No, because this is not the only thing I have done 
in my political life. I did extraordinary work (and I do not 
feel immodest in saying so) in the health sector when I served 
as president of the Senate Health Commission for two years. We 
faced up to the need for a complete package in the health 
sector, a life-and-death issue. And that is the proper term for 
it. In this connection, I was able to make contact with the most 
dramatic reality--the life and death of the individual citizen. 
I believe that it was this--the possibility of having some 
impact in this sector--that led me to accept, deep within 
myself, the candidacy for government office. In addition, I have 
a long history as a university professor in the state of Zulia, 
and a 10-year career as a writer for the local daily newspapers. 
This has created for me a host of invisible friends, as Uslar 
Pietri has said. 
  [Saldivia] Are you the moral conscience of Zulia? 
  [Aniyar] I do not know. That seems a bit of an exaggeration. 
I am indeed seen as occupying a different position, from the 
point of view of stating and interpreting matters, and as a 
result I have succeeded in identifying with many citizens. 
  [Saldivia] Didn't Alvarez Paz do more good for Zulia than 
the 
personally appointed governors? 
  [Aniyar] Absolutely not. 
  [Saldivia] Do you mean that the process of direct election 
is 
only beginning to serve Zulia now? 
  [Aniyar] No. The situation in Zulia is very special. I say 
that Zulia is like a country. 
  [Saldivia] The people will think you are a separatist. 
  [Aniyar] Zulia has declared itself an independent republic 
three times in history. 
  [Saldivia] And do you advocate this? 
  [Aniyar] No, but that is what the history of Zulia shows, 
and 
the citizens of Zulia have always wanted to be different from 
the citizens of the rest of the country. Oswaldo discovered that 
this was an important thing for Zulia, and he greatly encouraged 
this state feeling. He exploited the sense of loyalty to Zulia, 
the feeling that Zulia has given everything and received 
nothing, because the country lives off the production of Zulia, 
its oil and farm output, while it only receives the same as any 
other sad state in the country. That is the truth, and at the 
present time, Zulia is one of the 10 poorest states in 
Venezuela. Oswaldo speculated with this situation, and said that 
he would make Zulia "the seat of Venezuela." However, what he 
did was to make it the poorest place in Venezuela, because the 
figures now reveal a catastrophic situation. He described 
himself as the first citizen of Zulia, which was quite offensive 
to the people of Zulia. He promulgated some ostentatious 
measures, for example his decree that the history and geography 
of Zulia would be studied in the schools. This was a plan, by 
the way, that was never realized. He created a state flag, and 
in the last electoral campaign, everything was based on the fact 
that Zulia would have a president. He speculated with this 
situation, and neglected the concrete real situation being 
experienced by the Zulian citizen, who saw that everything was 
catastrophic. The citizen of Zulia is a very emotional 
individual, and this was the reason for the voting support I had 
in Zulia. 
  [Saldivia] Are you planning on an administration of two or 
five years? 
  [Aniyar] My hope is for five, to parallel the five years of 
President Caldera's constitutional mandate. A two-year 
administration makes no sense, for one can only begin to work in 
that time. And so I hope that this confidence in me will last, 
despite the obstacles being placed in my way. I believe that it 
will last, because the vote of the Zulian citizen is very 
emotional, and those who voted for me were emotional as well. In 
fact, there were a number of Oswaldo-Lolita votes. The people do 
not vote a straight ticket. That has come to an end in 
Venezuela. There were also Claudio-Lolita and Andres 
Velasquez-Lolita votes, because Causa R instructed its 
supporters to vote for me. And, of course, there were many 
Caldera-Lolita votes.
