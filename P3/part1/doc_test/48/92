Johnny Ray's one-out double in the 11th inning Thursday scored Gary Disarcina 
with the winning run as the Angels rebounded from a disappointing ninth inning 
to edge the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Disarcina led off the 11th against Tom Henke (0-1) with a walk and moved to 
second on Devon White's sacrifice bunt. Ray's second hit in six at-bats drove 
in Disarcina with the run that gave the Angels a season-best four-game winning 
streak and their sixth victory in their past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey (2-1) was credited with the victory after blowing a save 
opportunity in the ninth. He entered the game with a 3-1 lead, as Angel Manager 
Doug Rader used Mark Eichhorn as a setup man for Harvey instead of as a closer. 
Rader has often said he wanted to get Harvey into more save situations, but 
Harvey squandered the chance he was given Thursday, yielding a single to Mookie 
Wilson, a double to Kelly Gruber and a sacrifice fly before throwing a wild 
pitch that tied the game on what was supposed to be an intentional walk to Fred 
McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to lob it in right to him," Harvey said. "I didn't have my 
mind-set right and I threw it too easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy we won, but I would have been happier if we won it in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner had another big game, going three for four to raise his average to 
.318. 
</P>
<P>
Although starting pitcher Kirk McCaskill was unable to get out of the fourth 
inning, a succession of relievers stifled Toronto's offense until Harvey came 
on. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, making his first start since May 10, left with the Blue Jays holding 
a 1-0 lead, built in the third on a walk, an error and a single by McGriff. The 
Angels overcame that deficit in the fourth on Joyner's single and Dante 
Bichette's forceout and added a run in the fifth on an infield single, a walk 
and Joyner's second single of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
California used three pitchers in the sixth alone: Mike Fetters began the 
inning, but was relieved by Scott Bailes after walking Manny Lee and allowing a 
double to Junior Felix. Bailes walked Tony Fernandez and got Mookie Wilson to 
pop up to short before being relieved, in turn, by Mark Eichhorn. The 
side-armer threw only one pitch, but the Angels' infield turned it into a 
double play that ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
As has become normal for him this season, McCaskill constantly worked with 
runners on base. He escaped a first-and-third situation in the first and a 
first-and-second jam in the second -- getting out of the latter trouble when 
left fielder Bichette leaped against the fence in left-center to rob Tony 
Fernandez of a home run. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, who had issued 18 walks in his previous 35 1/3 innings, put himself 
in trouble in the third when he walked Wilson leading off the inning. He got 
Kelly Gruber on a fly to right, but third baseman Rick Schu couldn't handle 
Bell's shot to third. Wilson went to second on the error and scored on 
McGriff's looping single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
An error and another walk in the fourth brought an end to McCaskill's outing. 
Fetters came in and defused the Blue Jays' threat. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's hot hitting helped the Angels come back and take a 2-1 lead in the 
bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Davis began the inning with a walk and moved to second on Dave Winfield's 
single to center. Davis scored on Joyner's sharply hit single and Winfield went 
to third. Bichette's force play scored Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Another RBI single by Joyner padded the Angels' lead to 3-1 in the fifth off 
John Cerutti. Davis reached on an infield single and Winfield walked. Davis was 
caught stealing third, but prolonged the rundown enough for Winfield to take 
second, and Winfield scored on Joyner's soft single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Rick Schu was recalled from triple-A Edmonton to replace injured Jack 
Howell, and started at third base Thursday. Howell was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list Wednesday because of a sprained left knee. Schu, who was optioned 
to Edmonton on May 19 when pitcher Mike Fetters was recalled, hit .286 in three 
games with the Trappers with one home run and three RBIs. . . . Gary Disarcina 
singled in the sixth for his first major league hit in 10 at-bats. The crowd of 
24,460 rewarded him with a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mark McLemore (sprained right wrist) was assigned to Edmonton for 
rehabilitation. Catcher Bill Schroeder (post-surgical elbow problems) was sent 
to Class-A Palm Springs, also for rehabilitation. . . . Shortstop Dick 
Schofield said his strained hamstring "feels real good," but wouldn't put a 
timetable on his return.
