FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Little prospect of an early recovery in
Vienna - A strong economy cannot offset high interest rates and a poor
corporate performance

DISCUSSION about the Austrian stock market these days tends to resemble that
about the British economy - few commentators can see any recovery taking
form in the near future.
Worse, as the ATX index of 18 leading shares plumbed new depths this week,
analysts were groping for ways to understand and explain what is happening.
'The market seems heavily oversold, but we have no support levels any more,'
says Mr Lukas Stipkovich, an analyst at GiroCredit Bank in Vienna.
The feeling is that only a showy, positive event - a drop in German interest
rates, a clear end to the war in the former Yugoslavia or a resolution of
the uncertainties over the Austrian government's messy privatisation
programme - would be enough to overcome the strong negative sentiment. But
few see such a watershed event coming soon.
'I do not think the market is going to collapse another 10 per cent, but it
is not going to go up in the near future either,' says Mr Andrew Thomson, an
analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London.
For those familiar with the Austrian economy, all this is more than a little
surprising. The economy has grownrapidly in recent years and remains one of
the best performers among the industrialised countries, with real growth of
between 2 and 3 per cent expected this year. The problem, analysts say, is
that the two most dynamic sectors, retailing and tourism, are scarcely
represented in the stock market, whereas banking and cyclical industries
dominate.
After a dizzying rise in 1989, the all-share index peaked in March, 1990 at
739.21. Since then, it has been all downhill, more or less, and by this week
it had shed more than 50 per cent of its value. The index ended at 354.14
yesterday, as the introduction of ATX stock index futures and options
trading unsettled the market.
No doubt a significant portion of the fall should be considered a correction
from excessive valuations at its peak. The average share was trading then at
more than 30 times prospective earnings. Now the average price-earnings
ratio is about 17. 'That is very close to the level in Germany and much
cheaper than in the US and in several other European markets,' Mr Stipkovich
says.
Since last summer, the war in the former Yugoslavia has driven away many
foreign investors who, apparently, fear that it will spill over into
Austria. Mr Joseph Oswald, head of research at Creditanstalt, says that he
was startled recently to find this view still prevalent among some German
investors. 'If Germans think like this, what must other foreigners think?,'
he asks. He estimates that foreigners now account for only a fifth of
trading volume compared with about 50 per cent in 1989 and 1990.
The downward trend stopped briefly in the first quarter of this year, but
then resumed in the spring when it became apparent that many leading
Austrian companies' profits would be affected adversely by the recessionary
economic conditions in other countries. Mr Stipkovich says that earnings of
quoted companies are likely to decline by 4 to 5 per cent this year on
average.
Some first-half results have indeed been disappointing. Z-Landerbank Bank
Austria, the largest, reported a 15.7 per cent slump in partial operating
profits to Sch867m (Dollars 83.4m) while those at Creditanstalt were off 9.5
per cent to Sch845m. Austrian Airlines' loss more than doubled and the group
is likely to cut its dividend.
OMV, the state-controlled oil group whose shares are one of the most
actively traded on the bourse, lost Sch500m in the first half and saw its
chairman resign. As if these developments were not shocking enough, the
shares dropped significantly in heavy trading in the days before the
announcement, prompting investigations of insider dealing.
OMV is also involved in the government's privatisation plans. Its troubled
parent, Austrian Industries, has proposed selling a large block of its OMV
holding to raise capital, but the prospect of such a sale in the current
anaemic market raises fears of further downward pressure on share prices in
general.
The latest blow to confidence has been the rise in German interest rates and
the warning by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank chairman, that no
easing of rates should be expected this year.
With the deterioration of sentiment has come a collapse in trading volume,
which now runs at only Sch150m a day compared with Sch1bn two years ago. 'In
these conditions, there is a severe reaction to even small sell orders. So
no one is willing to build up positions,' Mr Oswald says. 'Austrians still
have to learn that stocks rise again after falling,' he adds.
Slightly more optimistic opinions exist, depending on the timing of German
recovery or an end to bad domestic news. But for the moment, no one sees any
urgency to start buying Austrian shares. 'I do not think you are going to
miss anything. The risk of losing 10 per cent is greater than that of
gaining 5 per cent,' says Mr Stipkovich.
