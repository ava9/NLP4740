FT  18 JAN 94 / BBC Panorama libel case opens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday began hearing libel claims by US drugs company
Upjohn over allegations made in a 1991 BBC Panorama programme on the
marketing and side-effects of its sleeping drug Halcion.
Upjohn and its UK subsidiary are also claiming damages against Professor Ian
Oswald, former professor of psychiatry at Edinburgh University, over an
article published in the New York Times. Prof Oswald is counter-claiming
libel damages against Upjohn over what it has said in its defence.
