  [Text] Astonishment and excitement on Lerchenberg in 
Mainz. ZDF [German TV Two], one of the biggest European 
broadcasting stations, had concluded a cooperation agreement 
with the Iranian state television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the 
people in Mainz had to learn from French judicial circles that 
their partners are said to be involved in the state terrorism of 
the mullahs. 
  "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department 
for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about 
further cooperation." 
  The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by 
the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been 
secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with 
the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. 
Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French 
exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991. 
  Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are 
to be brought to trial in Paris. 
  After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among 
them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin 
"Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first 
time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to 
provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French 
investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments, 
and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with 
big European televisions stations, they enjoy hospitality in 
many places and can move unhindered everywhere. 
  In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the 
Rue de Liege 27: Mas'ud Hendi, 45, Paris bureau chief of the 
Persian television station, IRIB, and nephew of Ayatollah 
Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the two Iranian agents 
who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's murder. Hendi himself is 
also detained. 
  A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian 
Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other 
television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the 
assassination commands. 
  The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an 
agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted 
immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement 
will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG 
executive board. 
  Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday [20 January], 
Rudolf Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to 
the Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note 
from the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between 
Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time. 
  The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for 
Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri, 32. Together with 
others, they are said to have executed former UN diplomat Kazem 
Rajavi in his Geneva exile in April 1990. 
  The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event 
of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland, 
Tehran threatened a "fireworks of bombs" toward French mediator 
Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable 
terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran. 
  The German Federal Government was also well out of it 
because, before their trip to France, the presumed murderers had 
traveled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German security 
authorities. 
  On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmad Taheri and Sharif 
Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the RAJAVI 
murder case." 
  The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from 
their German colleagues.
