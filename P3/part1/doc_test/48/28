UPJOHN, the US drugs company, and its UK subsidiary, Upjohn Ltd, yesterday
served a series of writs for libel following allegations about the safety of
its sleeping pill Halcion.
Upjohn has served writs against the BBC - which broadcast a programme called
'The Halcion Nightmare' - and the programme's presenter, Mr Tom Mangold.
A second action has been started against the Sunday Express, Miss Eve
Pollard, the newspaper's editor, and Mr Neville Hodgkinson who wrote an
article about Halcion and its possible side-effects on October 6 1991.
A final action is being started against Dr Ian Oswald, a retired Scottish
professor, who, the company claims, made allegations against Upjohn in an
article published in the New York Times. The company said it had no
intention at present of taking action against the New York Times.
Dr Oswald, who was professor of psychiatry at Edinburgh university for seven
years, claimed in a letter to The Lancet this month that Upjohn had not
disclosed all of the side-effects of Halcion when it had applied to the US
Food and Drug Administration for the drug to be licenced.
Dr Oswald is due to speak next month at a public hearing in Berlin at the
German health ministry to discuss the safety of Halcion. The drug was banned
in the UK last October. The French and Spanish authorities have since
forbidden sales of Halcion in doses more than 0.125mg.
Upjohn said it was not prepared to allow allegations attacking the company's
integrity to be published without challenge. It had instructed its
solicitors, Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, to proceed vigorously to trial to
enable the company to clear its name.
Mr Mangold said last night that as far as he was aware Upjohn had not been
in contact with the BBC from the date of transmission or made any complaint.
The company had, however, walked out of an interview with the BBC when the
programme was being made, he claimed.
Mr Mangold said that the purpose of the programme was to look at a possible
relationship between Halcion and very serious mental illness, suicide and
even murders in the US. The programme also looked at how the drug was
marketed and how Upjohn dealt with complaints.
