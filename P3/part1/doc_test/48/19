FT  22 JAN 92 / Vow to resist lawsuit on Halcion drug claims

A RETIRED Scottish professor said yesterday he would continue to warn about
the dangers of Halcion, Upjohn's best-selling sleeping drug, in spite of the
US company's threat to bring a lawsuit against him before the end of the
week.
'I shall tell everything,' said Dr Ian Oswald, head of psychiatry at
Edinburgh University for seven years before retiring in 1989. His findings
were instrumental in the UK authorities' decision to ban Halcion in October
last year.
He said he planned to defy Upjohn's virtually unprecedented threat of legal
action and talk next month at a public meeting on Halcion's safety held by
the German Ministry of Health.
Dr Oswald claims Halcion's serious adverse side effects were discovered by
Upjohn as early as 1972 but were omitted in submissions to the US Food and
Drug Administration.
Dr Oswald spent more than 1,000 hours studying confidential Upjohn reports
on the drug as an expert witness in a US action against the company. Upjohn
settled the suit out of court.
It involved a woman, Mrs Ilo Grundberg, who had shot her mother eight times
while allegedly under the influence of Halcion. Dr Oswald was paid by Mrs
Grundberg's defence lawyers for his role as an expert witness.
Dr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and chief executive, said this week
that Dr Oswald's claims of fraudulent concealment were false and reckless.
He added: 'We've been caring for patients now for more than a century, and
it's not fair for our employees to continue to be smeared by Oswald or for
patients to be frightened and misled by this kind of junk science.'
The Committee on Safety of Medicines, the UK government's drug safety
watchdog, banned Halcion after Upjohn refused to withdraw the product
voluntarily. French and Spanish authorities subsequently insisted the drug
should be sold in 0.125mg pills rather than 0.25mg.
Dr Oswald, however, questions whether the drug is effective in such low
doses. An Upjohn submission to the FDA in 1985 said that only a 0.5mg dose
was effective in the treatment of insomnia in non-geriatric patients. Dr
Oswald said: 'It's incongruous that the only dose allowed in France and
Spain is in doses that are regarded by Upjohn as frequently ineffective.'
Although Halcion may not be effective as a sleeping treatment at low doses
for most patients, it may nevertheless still be dangerous, according to Dr
Oswald. He points out that in 1987, Upjohn told the FDA that adverse
psychiatric reactions with Halcion were of uniform frequency whatever the
size of the dose.
He added: 'This means Halcion is just as likely to induce mentally ill
effects in small doses as large. There is no dose dependency.'
An Upjohn executive argued in a US newspaper this week that Dr Oswald could
in no sense be considered an unbiased, neutral reviewer of the data.
Dr Oswald yesterday challenged Upjohn to make confidential data from
clinical trials public if it wanted to clear its name. 'I am an academic
medical research scientist,' said Dr Oswald. 'I am only interested in the
truth. That is my only concern.'
