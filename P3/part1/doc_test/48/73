questions raised by the move against Fujimori

DETAILS of last Friday's coup attempt in Peru, allegedly intended to
assassinate President Alberto Fujimori and kidnap the head of his joint
chiefs of staff, emerged over the weekend. But they leave key questions
unanswered.
With Peru's return to 'democratic institutionality' (via elections for a
constituent congress) less than a week away, opposition politicians are
demanding that Mr Fujimori clarify his claim that 'the black hand of
political interests' was behind the superficially tame attempt.
Some 25 retired and serving army officers and a handful of civilians are
under arrest. Trial will be by closed military court and proceedings have
already been opened against the ringleaders - who have had no access to
legal advice as yet.
But there are still no details of involvement of politicians. As Mr Fujimori
gave weekend interviews, journalists demanded evidence while retired
generals termed the plot 'absurd and unreal'. Even Mr Fujimori called it
'crazy'.
On the face of it, the conspiracy seems to have had faint chance of success.
It was hatched, says the official version, by three retired and two serving
army generals and led by General Jaime Salinas. He and the other two retired
generals, Palomino and Pastor, had all served as heads of the military
household in the government palace during the previous regime of President
Alan Garcia. According to Mr Fujimori, Gen Salinas attempted an unpublicised
coup in July 1990 to prevent him taking office.
The intention this time, Mr Fujimori claims, was to impede next Sunday's
elections. The plotters were to put themselves in key military and
ministerial positions and reinstate the Congress which Mr Fujimori dissolved
on April 5.
Mr Fujimori insisted the conspirators were bent on assassinating him. He
displayed on television a rifle fitted with telescopic sights captured
during the arrests 'similar to the one used to kill President Kennedy'.
His claim of attempted assassination was denied yesterday by Gen Salinas in
a jail interview published by a Peruvian magazine. Gen Salinas was reported
as saying that the intention had been only to remove Mr Fujimori and to
install vice-president Maximo San Roman as president. Mr San Roman broke
with Mr Fujimori after Congress was dissolved.
In the early hours of Friday, the president and his family were whisked from
government palace under heavy guard to a secret location. Tanks and troops
blockaded Lima's main square. But the only hostile movement seems to have
involved alleged assassin Captain Hugo Ormeno, who was arrested with five
other men several hundred yards from his objective.
The three generals accused of playing the leading role in the conspiracy
were all forced into early retirement when Mr Fujimori assumed the
presidency in July, 1990. In what he called an essential 'moralisation'
process, he sacked many high-ranking officers from the armed forces and
police.
Some middle and higher-ranking officers complain that all key promotions are
managed by retired captain Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr Fujimori's personal
adviser.
Lima is calm and and Mr Fujimori uncharacteristically jovial, apparently
enjoying his new role as defender of democracy. The coup attempt has moved
pre-election political debate still further to the sidelines and everything
looks set for a comfortable government victory in Sunday's elections.
