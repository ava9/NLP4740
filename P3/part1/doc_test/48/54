THE LAST BROTHER. THE RISE &amp; FALL OF TEDDY KENNEDY by Joe McGinniss Little,
Brown and Company Pounds 18.99,626 pages
Next bank holiday weekend (there are several to come) pick up this book, as
I did at Easter, and you will find it immensely hard to discard. There is
more drama in the Kennedy dynasty than in most works of fiction; more
corruption, too. Not much of the information is new, but The Last Brother is
an attempt to put it all together under the wrapping of a slightly
ruminative life of Teddy.
Teddy is the youngest and only surviving son of ambassador Joe Kennedy, the
man who was recalled from the American Embassy in London shortly after the
start of the second world war because of his sympathy for Nazi Germany.
Ambassador Joe is the main villain of the piece. At one stage he had visions
of becoming the US president himself. When he was rumbled by Roosevelt, he
set his sights on the presidency going to one of his sons. Joe John, the
eldest and favourite, was killed in a crazy bombing mission over Europe in
1944.
Jack, the next in line, suffered from a then mysterious and near fatal
disease, but was groomed for the job and made it to the White House in 1960
only to be assassinated in Dallas three years later. The mantle passed to
Bobby, who had been attorney-general under Jack and whose politics had
turned increasingly liberal.
Bobby is the nearest to a hero that the book has to offer, though even he
could be ruthless and manipulative. He was assassinated in Los Angeles while
campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 1968.
That left Teddy, the youngest son who had never been taken seriously by the
family. His mother had hoped that he might go into the priesthood: he was
the first American citizen to receive his first communion from the Pope. Yet
he had no obvious abilities and was found cheating at Harvard. His elder
brothers regarded him as a mixture of a liability and a joke. It was not so
much that his conduct was unbecoming; it was his tendency to get caught in
the act that mattered.
Still, after the death of Bobby, Teddy was the last of the brothers and
already the junior senator for Massachusetts. The pressures for him to run
for the White House at once were strong. When he declined, there was a
widespread assumption that the nomination would be his for the taking in
1972. Then came Chappaquiddick. Joe McGinniss's sometimes speculative
account is not unsympathetic. He thinks that Teddy was never fit to be a
presidential candidate, let alone president, in the first place. The thesis
is that he suffered from being the youngest son, not fully appreciated by
the family elders. Only after Jack's death was Teddy introduced to the
family secrets, by Bobby.
Some of those secrets were - and remain - horrendous. Not only did Joe
Kennedy have links with the Mafia, so had Jack. The abortive Bay of Pigs
invasion of Cuba may have been launched partly to repay debts to the Mafia
bosses.
Never abstemious with women or drink from the start, Teddy reacted by
becoming even wilder and more unpredictable, though there were also times
when he could pull himself together and speak, like Bobby, as the liberal
conscience of America.
As McGinniss comments: 'One of the most remarkable things about Teddy was
that no matter what he had been through the day or night before, he always
showed up for work in the morning.'
Apart from ambassador Joe, the real culprit was the American press which for
years allowed the Kennedys to get away with almost anything. Only
Chappaquiddick, and the inconsistencies in Teddy's stories about the
late-night drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne, woke up editors who should have
known better. No wonder the media subsequently went so hard for Richard
Nixon on Watergate and are looking so closely at President Clinton now.
After the Kennedys, the American press had a lot to live down.
