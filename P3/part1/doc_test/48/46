Jack Nicholson has been in London. Between dining at San Lorenzo, dancing at
Tramp and sleeping at The Connaught, the actor has been stocking up on a few
conversation-piece suits. Nicholson is not to be found on Savile Row but in
Soho, giving his high-profile custom to John Pearse of Meard Street.
Pearse must be a very successful man, for he does not regard politeness as a
tool of his trade. One imagines the sparring that takes place over the tape
measure as he calculates the jib of Nicholson and fellow celebrities Mick
Jagger, Tom Cruise, Malcolm McClaren, Nicole Kidman and Mariella Fostrupp,
for he subscribes to the tiresome 'it's-cool-to-be-rude' style of badinage
with customers, for fear, perhaps, that they will mistake his work for a
service.
His tailoring style is 'laddish'. While he can offer the full gamut of
classics - grey flannel, Prince of Wales check and Harris tweed - since his
days at 'Granny Takes a Trip' in the 1960s, he leans towards more
attention-seeking tailoring, such as changeant velvet, Hendrix suits,
pony-skin print shirts, horizontal pinstripes, and bookmaker checks.
But he finds today's rich rock stars of a certain age prefer his more
conventional offerings. 'You can get bored of being a fashion plate, and so
you dress down in a neutral uniform.' The greatest compliment that Pearse
can pay a customer is that 'I don't recognise one of my own suits on them,
it becomes part of them'. He has cited Richard Ingrams as a pleasing example
of this, in his signature, bashed-up corduroy suits.
While most of Pearse's clients fall into the 'performing arts and their
hangers-on' category, he also caters for the business community. So if you
can afford at least Pounds 700 for a suit, and like verbal jousting, Pearse
will oblige.
A similar counter-culture is served by the talented young tailor Oswald
Boateng. But, while cutting the sharpest suit in the trade, he will ply you
with old world courtesies. A tall, athletic client is best suited to the
Boateng treatment for he cuts suits with fork-prong narrow trousers and
high-waisted coats. Both his male and female customers emerge from his
Portabello Road studio looking like gloriously-coloured Daddy Longlegs.
David Chambers, a jovial tailor based in Hertfordshire, will come to your
home or office for fittings, and lists singer Bryan Ferry, designer Sir
Terence Conran, artist Patrick Hughes and gallery owner Tim Jeffries, among
his clients. Chambers has a keen eye and a sure hand. He is also flexible,
taking full advantage of the bartering school of business. Hamish McAlpine,
the film distributor, swopped his much-coveted Ferrari for 28 Chambers
suits. Prices start at Pounds 500.
Mark Powell, another Soho-based tailor, specialises in
nostalgically-inspired suits, such as the new Edwardian, four- button coat
favoured by musician Jools Holland and comedian Vic Reeves. He is not only
patronised by stars but also by stage companies requiring period costume.
His imposing frame, shaved head and Michael-Caine-in-Alfie manner belie a
courteous temperament.
