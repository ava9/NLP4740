report on Halcion sleeping pill

UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company that manufactures
Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleeping pill, yesterday denied
a report that for several years it concealed data from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) showing it caused serious psychiatric side effects.
The debate over Halcion, underway for the past two years, has been ignited
in recent months following the decision last October by UK health
authorities to ban sales in Britain.
Consumer activists in the US have been campaigning for the FDA to ban
Halcion in the US, but the FDA at present is merely reviewing the safety of
the drug. Halcion is sold in 89 countries.
Since the UK ban last October, Upjohn's share price has declined by more
than 11 per cent. Yesterday, trading in Upjohn stock was delayed after a
report in the New York Times quoted critics of the company claiming the
drug's side-effects had been concealed by the company. Upjohn's share price
closed yesterday down by Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 41 1/2 .
Halcion is Upjohn's second largest selling product, with estimated 1991
sales of Dollars 260m worldwide.
The company has taken an aggressive stance with its critics, an example of
which was its announcement yesterday that it planned to bring a lawsuit
against Dr Ian Oswald, a Scottish psychiatrist who alleged Upjohn failed to
adequately report all the side-effects it found with Halcion.
Dr Theodore Cooper, chairman of Upjohn, yesterday issued an angry statement,
saying: 'These repeated false and reckless charges of fraudulent concealment
by Dr Oswald cannot and will not be condoned.' The Upjohn chief claimed the
New York Times had been misled about Halcion, and said regulatory agencies
around the world had also been misled.
Apart from suing critics, Upjohn has lodged an appeal against the UK
decision to suspend sales.
Last November, the company tried to defuse criticism of Halcion by saying it
would package the drug in smaller quantities and include inserts advising
patients of side-effects. This was deemed insufficient by the Public Citizen
Health Research Group, which was founded by Mr Ralph Nader, America's most
prominent consumer rights advocate.
In December, French authorities suspended sales of the high-dose form of
Halcion, a decision Upjohn said it would appeal.
Earlier this month, Spain also suspended high dose sales of the drug.
Late last year, the European Community's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal
Products (CPMP) supported the Halcion labelling and packaging changes and
stressed the 'absolute importance' of short-term use of the drug.
In New York, Mr Viren Mehta, a drug industry analyst, said the Halcion
debate underscored the case of 'those who feel the FDA tends to take too
long to respond to possible health threats'.
