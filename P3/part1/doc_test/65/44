SUMMER HAS gone and taken with it the tourist trade. The onset of winter
means fewer visits from those who have second homes in the area. What do
restaurants, which have relied on these two sources of income, do to
generate cash-flow through the winter?
Some restaurateurs, such as Rick Stein of the Seafood Restaurant in Padstow,
Cornwall, open a delicatessen with a bakery and wine shop to feed the
locals. Those with smaller overheads lay off staff and hope to weather the
cash-flow crisis that will inevitably be at its worse from January to March.
At the Carved Angel in Dartmouth, Devon they wait for the Dart Regatta to
draw to a close at the end of August. Then they pull out a well-thumbed copy
of Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Familes, first published in
1855, a large Hobart mixer and a battered steamer and start making Christmas
puddings.
Their total production of 1,000 puddings with, on quiet nights in the
kitchen, two batches going through. Margins are smaller than in the
restaurant but the process does not involve extra overheads or expensive raw
ingredients. More importantly, the large cheques from the shops arrive early
in the New Year to keep the bank manager happy and allow Joyce Molyneaux,
the Carved Angel's widely respected chef-proprietor, to take off for six
weeks rest and relaxation.
Like so many good ideas in the restaurant trade, the making of these
puddings was born out of desperation. Molyneux opened the Carved Angel in
1974 with Tom Jaine, who is today editor of the Good Food Guide. Both had
worked at the Hole in the Wall in Bath, the most innovative British
restaurant in the 1960s and 1970s. She admits today that they displayed
their first menus with a touch of arrogance and merely sat back and waited
for the crowds.
The crowds came, looked but walked on. During the winter of 1974-75 the
restaurant's cash position was critical. It was Jaine who suggested the
puddings, primarily for local customers, and Molyneux who reached for Modern
Cookery.
They quickly found a good London outlet in the David Mellor kitchen shops.
The shops have remained loyal customers in spite of a mouldy pudding, opened
by Mellor, that had gone sour because someone had put too much apple in the
mixture.
The same year also saw the puddings' first export success. Devon is twinned
with Calvados and Jaine joined a delegation of local businessmen on a stand
for the two-week Caen agricultural fair armed with puddings, English fruit
cakes, preserves, lemon curd and Chewton Mendip Cheddar.
In spite of the fact that the French did not understand what was meant by
suet - an essential animal fat ingredient in this recipe - the puddings and
all things Devonian and edible were a success. The margins, however, were
not enough to justify Jaine's expenses - although he spent the two weeks
under canvas - and the people of Caen ate the Carved Angel's puddings only
once more, in 1977.
Molyneux has managed to fit the production of these puddings into the normal
working hours of her commercial kitchen because of the organisational
philosophy she implements. Although she hires cooks and waiting staff with
impeccable professional training, no one is allowed to remain in any one
job. All jobs are interchangeable. The biggest organisational barrier in any
restaurant - the perennial conflict between chef and waiter does not seem to
exist here - and to symbolise this the Carved Angel has no swing door
between the kitchen and the dining room.
So, from early September, as the evening service is coming to an end, one
member of the kitchen staff, possibly from the pastry section or the person
on the cold starters, will assemble all the 15 ingredients and make the
mixture.
Then, using a flavourless nut oil, they grease 12 plain 2lb pudding bowls
(with which, after Christmas, you can make steak and kidney puddings or
pigeon pies), and fill them with the mixture, finally wrapping them in foil.
The puddings are then loaded into two steamer trays and await the maestro's
touch.
This comes at about 5am or 6am the following morning when Molyneux goes
downstairs for a cup of tea. She then puts the steamer across two gas
burners and the puddings on to cook.
They are ready by midday, conveniently just before the lunch service. When
next there is a lull in the service these puddings will be checked, cleaned,
wrapped in calico, tied and labelled. They are stored upstairs until ordered
by shops.
Molyneux admits to one change from Acton's original recipe - the addition of
crystallized ginger, of which she is very fond.
Although the making of these puddings is now on such a scale that it could
not possibly permit the personal washing and pipping of dried fruit such as
muscatels or the grating of butcher's suet, they do retain the essential
ingredient which initially attracted Molyneux to the recipe - its lightness.
This is not generally thought of as a Victorian quality but, as Molyneux,
puts it: 'Bully for Eliza Acton]'

Mellor Shops London SW1 (tel: 071-730-4259), SE1 (407-7593) and in
