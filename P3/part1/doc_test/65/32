FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): George Trumbull touches down in
Australia

The US executive invasion of corporate Australia continues with the
appointment of George Trumbull as the next chief executive of Australia's
largest investment group, the AMP Society, writes Bruce Jacques.
Trumbull, scheduled to take over in September when Ian Salmon retires, has
been recruited from the CIGNA insurance group in the US.
A former American football player, 49-year-old Trumbull has a reputation for
toughness and change. He'll need to score some early touchdowns when he
arrives at the Sydney headquarters next month.
Trumbull's appointment departs from more than a century of promotion from
within AMP. Perhaps his most challenging task will be to modify the creaky
internal structures of one of Australia's oldest corporate cultures. But he
is not alone. A number of his compatriots, including Robert Joss at Westpac,
and Frank Blount at Telecom, face similar tasks.
Early items on Trumbull's agenda are likely to include whether the Society
should demutualise in favour of an equity-based structure and whether it
should again look to banking after recent disastrous flirtations.
Trumbull has already spent nearly a quarter of a century overhauling large
parts of the CIGNA group. An economist with a degree from Dartmouth in 1966,
he also obtained a Masters degree in Business Management in 1968 from the
Dartmouth School of Business.
