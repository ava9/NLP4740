Throughout the world the restaurant industry attracts more than its fair
share of personalities - men, and increasingly women, who are prepared to
put up with the anti-social hours and unpredictable financial reward to feed
their fellows.
In Britain we feel that most of these characters exist outside our shores.
The typical, unforgettable chef or restaurateur is French, Italian or
Spanish.
In fact, the British restaurant industry is replete with characters. And, in
many respects, their achievements are even more admirable because few have
inherited renowned family restaurants and many have had to labour for years
to convince the local population that the best-prepared meals come neither
instantly nor cheaply.
Around Britain a roll call of such individuals would include: Joyce Molyneux
at the Carved Angel, Dartmouth, Devon; Tessa Bramley at The Old Vicarage,
Ridgeway, Derbyshire; Rick Stein in Padstow, Cornwall; the McCoy brothers at
The Tontine, Staddle Bridge, North Yorkshire; Barry and Dorothea Phillips at
The White Horse Inn, Chilgrove, West Sussex and, in Scotland, David and
Patricia Wilson at the Peat Inn, St Andrews and Betty and Graeme Allen at
the Airds Hotel, Port Appin, Strathclyde. And for a good food and comedy
double act, Melvyn Popham and Dennis Hawkes at Pophams, Winkleigh, Devon.
Any such list should also mention Harry and Caroline Hallam.
Harry, from Lincolnshire, spent the first 20 years of his working life as a
baker. He has spent the last six climbing the culinary league tables winning
his first Michelin star earlier this year.
His wife, Caroline, has played an equally important role in Harry's Place,
their restaurant and home, opposite a pub and social club in Great Gonerby,
just outside Grantham, Lincolnshire. It seats no more than 10 diners and is
dedicated to quality. So why do they do it and does it pay?
Harry, 47, says: 'We do it because we want to create the kind of restaurant
we would love to go and eat in ourselves. Unfortunately, because we don't
employ anyone else, we can't. But for me, as a self-taught chef, the big
thing is that in this profession I never stop learning. That makes up for
the lack of money. We don't actually pay ourselves a wage. Everything is for
the business. We pay our bills and what's left over is for us.'
The pleasure of enjoying Harry's cooking and Caroline's service is enhanced
by the attention to detail: lilies, pot pourri and ivy on the tables; lace
table mats; bone handled knives from a canteen that belonged to Harry's
grandmother; and comfortable bergere chairs that would last no more than a
week in a more hectic setting.
Our lunchtime menu choice was taken from: fish soup with an anchovy rouille;
a pastry case filled with a poached egg gratineed with hollandaise; fillet
of sea trout with sorrel; Lincolnshire pigeon breasts with lentils; cheese;
hot apricot and cognac souffle; and caramel mousse brulee.
The bread, a malted wholemeal which Hallam bakes twice a day, and the ameuse
geule, emphasise Hallam's talents.
An essential factor in their early survival, the Hallams admit, was an
understanding bank manager. 'He was the most wonderful man who believed in
us and wanted us to succeed. After he retired he used to come in here and
help us with the washing up, unpaid of course. Later, when he was in
hospital we used to smuggle in Harry's lemon tart to him.' They add,
regretfully, that the new manager has yet to go and eat there.
'Although we had always dreamt of our own restaurant we didn't want to do it
until our daughters were in their teens. Looking after customers and small
children must be just too demanding. But now every week we get letters from
customers who say how much they have enjoyed coming here and talking to us.
They usually end by saying that they do hope they haven't kept us up too
late,' says Caroline.
After six years in Great Gonerby, the Hallam character and style are
beginning to be appreciated. One customer told me: 'I ate here on the day it
opened and I must have eaten here 70 or 80 times since. I have eaten all
over France and I reckon Harry is the equal of the best of them.' Praise
indeed.
