<P>
With the goal of sending every student to college, parents and public schools 
in Brentwood and Pacific Palisades have formed an educational partnership with 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Under the open-ended agreement, UCLA will try to fulfill a wish list school 
officials and parents are drafting. Some of the items the group would like to 
see included are high-tech instructional methods, role modeling, and advice on 
teacher training and student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to prepare kids to be college-ready," said Pam Bruns, co-chairwoman of 
the Palisades Complex, a group of parents who approached UCLA with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot partnership includes nine schools of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District: Palisades High School, Temescal Canyon (Continuation) High School, 
and the six neighborhood elementary schools and one junior high that feed into 
them. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of representatives from the Palisades Complex, UCLA and the schools 
will first tackle the needs of the high schools, said Gayle Byock, director of 
post-secondary programs at UCLA and a Palisades parent who helped set up the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades High School has its eye on a UCLA computer program that helps 
students improve their writing, Principal Gerald Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful we could initiate it with our own hardware and their software," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said he is also interested in having the university open its libraries and 
language laboratory to his students. 
</P>
<P>
Byock said she hopes contact between students will develop. "Some kids might 
benefit from tutoring or role modeling (by) college students -- especially 
(kids) who are not thinking of college, or not (thinking of it) as their first 
option," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As yet there is no budget for the arrangement, Byock said. Instead, UCLA hopes 
to encourage staff and students to donate time and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
That, university officials said, should not be a problem. Professors who have 
reared children, like other parents, are "prepared to be involved in the 
schools on a limited basis. We're not asking the faculty to go in (to the 
schools) every day," Byock said. 
</P>
<P>
And because public service is one consideration for promotion in the University 
of California system, many professors already volunteer at community colleges 
or other outside organizations, said Edward A. Alpers, dean of honors and 
undergraduate programs for the College of Letters and Science. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has tutors and student teachers working in the public schools, offers 
seminars for teachers and has other ad-hoc ties with various schools. The 
Palisades partnership, though, is more formal and structured, participants say. 
</P>
<P>
When the Palisades Complex proposed the plan to UCLA last fall, the university 
was attracted by the strong parental support and the chance to work with 
students from kindergarten through high school, Byock said. "Children have to 
start thinking of college in elementary grades. Junior high and high school is 
too late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership is not just helping wealthy parents get their kids into the Ivy 
League, Alpers said. About 60% of the students in the Palisades schools do not 
live on the Westside but are bused in from crowded areas of the city, he said; 
many are minorities and are not from rich homes. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades parents are concerned about "all the students" and think that UCLA's 
experiences with its ethnically, racially and economically mixed student body 
may be useful experiences to Palisades schools, he said. UCLA has changed 
curricula, hired faculty and launched programs to help students get into 
graduate school in response to its changing student population. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not intended to serve just some of the students in the schools," Alpers 
said of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership will be reviewed in November, Byock said. If it is working, 
UCLA may forge similar arrangements with other groups of schools, Alpers said.
