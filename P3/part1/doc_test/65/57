4. We will revise our LPTV application acceptance standards and adopt a ``substantially complete'' test. We agree
with the overwhelming majority of commenters that the strict acceptance standard is no longer necessary in light
of the reduced number of LPTV applications being filed with the Commission and in light of the improved quality of those
applications. We are persuaded by the comments and by our processing experience to favor the substantially complete
standard over a mid-level standard. We do not believe that the substantially complete standard will lead to a lessening
of the overall quality of LPTV application submissions, nor significantly delay the authorization of LPTV service.
Conversely, this standard will enable the authorization of more stations for each filing window. We believe that
this modification of our application acceptance standards will greatly benefit LPTV applicants, many of whom have
limited resources. We note that while we will give applicants an opportunity to cure defects in otherwise substantially
complete applications, the corrected application must adhere to the Commission's rules and policies. For instance,
if an amendment to an application eliminates predicted interference to one station but at the same time introduces
interference to another station, the amended application will not be accepted and will be returned. Similarly, an
application that is not substantially complete, that is not submitted with the proper fee, or that is not timely filed
cannot be cured via subsequent amendment.

5. The Commission has developed a body of case law over the years governing broadcast applications that were subject
to the substantially complete standard.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 From these decisions, certain criteria were established, even though each case turned on the particular facts involved.
In the cases where applications failed the test, it was found that many sections of the applications were deficient
to a significant degree or were omitted entirely, so as to lack sufficient information regarding the adequacy of the
proposals vis-a-vis the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Amendments were allowed to correct errors, unless the application, judged as a whole, was ``so patently violative
of the rules as to make its processing a futile gesture.''

, 67 FCC 2d 278 (1977), an FM application lacked substantial portions of the legal and financial sections and almost
all of the community ascertainment information. Characterizing the omissions as ``glaring'' and ``numerous,''
the Commission stated that they impaired its ability to evaluate the applicant's qualifications under the public
interest standard, and that conclusion was compelled by the cumulative impact of each uncompleted section. In

it omitted the entire engineering and EEO sections and significant portions of the legal, financial and ascertainment
sections. The Commission concluded that it lacked ``sufficient information to reach many of the necessary determinations
regarding the adequacy of the proposal *&blank;*&blank;*''
