When "The Mikado," Gilbert and Sullivan's look at Imperial Japan, came to the 
Claremont Colleges recently, it drew protests from scores of students and 
faculty members who considered it an example of the colleges' insensitivity to 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The show went on, but the protests didn't go unheard. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, about two weeks after the demonstrations outside the Claremont 
Colleges' Bridges Auditorium, Pomona College officials met with Asian 
professors and students to address the needs of that campus's largest and 
fastest-growing ethnic minority. Asians make up 14% of the student population 
of 1,350, while blacks are 5% and Latinos 12%. Two-thirds of the private 
campus, the largest of the Claremont Colleges' six schools, is white. 
</P>
<P>
However, Asians are far behind blacks and Latinos when it comes to special 
services and programs -- a discrepancy campus officials said they intend to 
correct. Although the Claremont Colleges have offered courses in 
African-American and Chicano history since the early 1970s and have 
professional counseling centers for black and Latino students, no such programs 
exist for Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a problem on campus that Asian-Americans are not feeling adequately 
recognized," said Associate Dean Elizabeth Crighton, who met with several Asian 
professors and student leaders Monday evening. " 'The Mikado' was a symptom of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona College history professor Sam Yamashita, one of the "Mikado" protesters, 
contended that the operetta promotes Asian stereotypes, through portrayals of 
"submissive . . . mindless" females and use of "racist" language. He argued 
that it should not have been performed on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 2 demonstration was the latest in a series of Claremont Colleges 
protests in the past several years, in which students and faculty members 
staged rallies, wrote letters to deans, and even wore yellow armbands at 
graduation ceremonies to demand courses in Asian-American history, counselors 
for Asian-American students, and more Asian faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Crighton said the college is considering the demands but she expects change to 
come gradually. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yamashita and Dorinne Kondo, another professor lobbying for the new 
programs, said the slow pace of change is causing students to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Ho, a senior at Pomona who coordinates The Re-View, an Asian women's 
publication, said college counselors have been insensitive to Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having problems with my parents," she said. "The counselor said, 'If 
your parents are such a problem, why don't you move out? Stand up to your 
father and tell him off.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ho said the counselor's response indicated a lack of knowledge about 
traditional Chinese families. "I looked at her in disbelief. If I moved out of 
my parents', I might as well declare that I'm breaking away from my family." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona officials contend that they never ignored the Asian community. 
Asian-American students at Pomona have become politically active only recently 
when compared with blacks and Latinos, said Scott Warren, acting dean of 
students. For years, he said, they were reluctant to view themselves as 
minorities with special problems and needs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is a proliferation of Asian student organizations on campus -- 
everything from an Asian women's group to a club for Southeast Asians to a 
student publication geared toward Asian-Americans. In response, Warren said, 
the college has hired Asian staff members and helped set up a student-run 
mentor program for Asian freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"The black and Chicano centers were created largely out of concerns of student 
movements" in the late 1960s, Warren said. "The consciousness of Asian-American 
students as a minority with particular common interests and needs is relatively 
recent compared to the civil rights movements of the 1960s. It's a matter of 
historical development."
