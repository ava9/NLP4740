No. 11-ranked Syracuse, committing three turnovers and having a punt blocked on 
its first four possessions, barely defeated Army, 10-7, Saturday at Syracuse, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-yard touchdown run by Michael Owens in the third quarter enabled the 
Orangemen to win their 16th straight in the Carrier Dome, where Syracuse 
celebrated its football centennial in front of 48,331. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (2-0) drove 71 yards for the winning touchdown, with Owens accounting 
for 48 of the yards in four carries. He scored by running down the right 
sideline with 2:33 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which hadn't had a scoreless first half in three years, trailed 7-0 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
On Syracuse's opening drive, fullback Duane Kinnon fumbled into the Army end 
zone. The next two drives were stopped by interceptions and then a blocked punt 
by outside linebacker John Nadolski set up Army's lone touchdown, which came on 
a one-yard run by Mike Mayweather in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 45, South Carolina 21 -- Major Harris completed 17 of 20 passes 
for 239 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Mountaineers 
over the Gamecocks in front of 66,015 at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers (3-0) extended the nation's longest regular-season winning 
streak to 14 games. South Carolina dropped to 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina quarterback Todd Ellis completed 21 of 37 for 256 yards and 
three touchdowns, but he was intercepted twice and sacked three times. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State 42, Temple 3 -- Blair Thomas rushed for 138 yards and two touchdowns 
and Tom Bill passed for 192 yards and a pair of scores as the Nittany Lions 
romped over the Owls at State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (1-1) extended its record over Temple (0-3) to 23-3-1 in a series 
that started in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who missed last season because of knee surgery, had 21 carries in 
recording his ninth 100-yard game. Bill's scoring passes both went to Dave 
Daniels and covered 75 and 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 9, Boston College 7 -- John Blanton blocked a punt to set up a 21-yard 
field goal by Doug Giesler with nine seconds left as the Scarlet Knights 
rallied to defeat the Eagles at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 7-6 with two minutes remaining, the Eagles had a fourth-and-nine at the 
Rutgers 46. Punter Brian Lowe fielded a low snap from center, avoided a rush 
and threw a pass to David Johnson for a gain to the Rutgers 16. 
</P>
<P>
But the play was nullified because of an illegal lineman downfield, and Lowe's 
next punt was blocked. Three plays later, Giesler kicked the winning field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers is now 1-0-1, Boston College 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
BYU 31, Navy 10 -- Quarterback Ty Detmer passed for 353 yards and Matt Bellini 
ran for two touchdowns and caught passes for two more as the Cougars beat the 
Midshipmen at Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer completed 26 of 35 passes for BYU (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Navy (0-1) ran for 155 yards in the first half and trailed only 14-10 at 
halftime. The Midshipmen had only 24 rushing yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 26, Columbia 10 -- The Crimson trailed 10-9 at halftime but Silas Myers 
scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns as Harvard pulled away to an Ivy League 
victory over Columbia at New York. The game was the first for Columbia under 
Coach Ray Tellier. He succeeded Larry McElreavy, who resigned at the end of 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Yale 12, Brown 3 -- Junior quarterback Darin Kehler ran for 112 yards, 87 in 
the first half, to lead the Elis over the Ivy League rival Bears on a rainy day 
at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn.
