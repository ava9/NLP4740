</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James L. Ash Jr., selected last week to be president of Whittier College, is 
described by colleagues as one of the brightest, most creative administrators 
in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Ash is now vice provost for student affairs at the University of Miami, a 
private university of 13,000 students in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old historian, an ordained Presbyterian minister, is credited with 
raising student enrollment in the university's honors program from 200 to 
1,300. He also drew praise for helping set up a residential dormitory program 
modeled after programs at America's Ivy League colleges, which borrowed the 
idea from England's Oxford and Cambridge universities. 
</P>
<P>
Ash will become Whittier's 12th president in July, succeeding Eugene S. Mills, 
63. Mills announced last fall that he will retire in June after a decade as 
president of the small but venerable college, which has been suffering from 
declining enrollment and chronic budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Was Unanimous 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the 101-year-old college and its 500-student law school voted 
unanimously at a special meeting Wednesday night to give the post to Ash. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was not looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I was minding my own business in Miami," he said, when he received a call 
asking if he would be interested. "And the more I discovered, the more I was 
convinced that Whittier College was an academic jewel." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview from Miami, Ash said: "The challenges are the 
same challenges that every liberal arts college faces in the next five years in 
this country." Two of the most important challenges, he said, are retaining a 
quality faculty and overcoming what he calls "unfavorable demographics," a 
shrinking pool of college-age youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The next three years, he said, represent a valley in college admissions because 
there will be fewer people turning 18 and starting college than in previous 
years. And, as the older academic generation retires and the Ph.D. glut that 
characterized the 1970s and '80s disappears, he said, there is fierce 
competition for bright young faculty members. Universities are raiding smaller 
colleges that hired the faculty members during the glut. 
</P>
<P>
Ash acknowledged, too, that Whittier, compared to many other private colleges, 
has a meager endowment. But the man who always takes a positive approach to 
problems, according to one Miami colleague, put a positive face on the 
fund-raising aspect of his new job. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my responsibility will be to give the Southern California community a 
chance to participate in the strengthening of one of their major resources," 
Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will maintain Whittier's generous scholarship policies, which some 
Whittier administrators have acknowledged contributed to the college's budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
At Miami, Ash teaches one class a semester and says he will do the same at 
Whittier, although maybe not the first year. Ash joined the university in 1977 
as an assistant professor of religious studies. He later served as chairman of 
the religious studies department. 
</P>
<P>
He holds a Ph.D. in American social, religious and intellectual history, a 
master's degree from the University of Chicago, and a master's degree in 
theology from Southern Methodist University. He is a native of Texas and did 
his undergraduate work at Abilene Christian University. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote "Protestantism in the American University," published by Southern 
Methodist University Press, and is finishing another book, "Primitivism in 
American Religion." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I do to keep intellectually alive and it's more like fun than 
work," Ash said of his writing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Has Dean's Job 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Patricia Bryan Ash, will give up her job as assistant dean at the 
University of Miami Law School, to move to California. The couple have two 
daughters, ages 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues and students who were contacted at Miami last week viewed Ash's 
impending departure with regret. 
</P>
<P>
"You run into people in your lifetime that have that kind of personality and 
seem to . . . inspire others," said David Kling, Ash's assistant at Miami. 
"That's why he's good for Whittier, because Whittier needs a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous gain for Whittier," said Deborah Perry, associate provost 
and dean of enrollments at Miami, where Ash is credited with transforming 
university enrollment by boosting the number of honors students, and with 
helping create the residential college system in which faculty families were 
moved into student living quarters, where seminars were held and learning labs 
were established. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than just being a place to sleep, (the dorm) became a place to live and 
learn," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright and Creative 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the brightest, most creative higher education administrators in 
the country today," she said. "With Jim's guidance," she said, "the university 
has been able to bring itself into a stable enrollment environment." 
</P>
<P>
To draw more honors students to the university, she said, Ash expanded the 
course offerings in the honors program and drew the best professors on campus 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, students have named him professor of the year, said Robert S. Marshall, 
assistant news editor of the university newspaper. "He's very respected by 
everyone on campus who comes in contact with him," Marshall said.
