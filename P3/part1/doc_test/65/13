The switch to unleaded gasoline may have saved large tracts of trees in 
Northeastern forests. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists a decade ago feared that the buildup in soil of lead, which is 
toxic, would damage and possibly kill trees. But 15 years after the Clean Air 
Act forced auto makers to market cars that burn unleaded gasoline, scientists 
say lead concentrations in the forest floor already are falling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful, the curve showing the decline of lead," said Thomas G. 
Siccama, a forest ecologist at the Yale University School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies. "It has left the forest floor faster than the general 
community of ecologists thought." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Siccama and two other scientists, William H. Smith of Yale and Donald 
L. Mader of the University of Massachusetts, documented that from 1962 to 1978, 
lead levels in surface soils in Massachusetts had jumped from 682 milligrams 
per square meter to 1,160 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Siccama, Smith and others, including Andrew J. Friedland of Dartmouth College 
and Arthur H. Johnson of the University of Pennsylvania, began looking more 
closely at the surface soil of forests, taking samples from Pennsylvania to New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, they and other researchers have begun to review the 
extensive data collected. 
</P>
<P>
At one test site, the Cathedral Pines forest in Cornwall, Penn., Julie 
Tritschler, a Yale graduate student, found lead has fallen since 1980 from 
1,275 milligrams per square meter to 940 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
At Hubbard Brook in West Thornton, N.H., lead levels in 1975 approached 1,100 
milligrams per square meter. By 1988, they had fallen to less than 800 
milligrams, Siccama said. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening, Siccama believes, is that over time the lead is being 
diluted in the underlying soil. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Kellett, Northeast regional director for the Wilderness Society, 
said the data is encouraging. But he cautioned that it is important to learn 
where the lead is going because it might be ending up in underground water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Siccama and others say the decline in lead levels in soil is almost certainly 
due to the mandated use of unleaded gasoline in new cars beginning in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the whole point of the law," Siccama said. "It is a one-on-one 
connection. We know it has gone down in the rain, and we've followed it going 
down in the soil where we knew it was accumulating."
