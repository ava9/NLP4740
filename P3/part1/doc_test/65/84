TAKING STOCK OF WALL STREET; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: THE CRISIS-INSPIRED STOCK PLUNGE MATTERS, BUT STOCKS ARE AN UNRELIABLE 
ECONOMIC BAROMETER. WHEN THEY CRASHED IN OCTOBER, 1987, NOT MUCH HAPPENED.

<P>
Fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis has drifted thousands of miles to Wall 
Street, where the summer's rally has fizzled like a Roman candle. 
</P>
<P>
As energy prices have soared, stock prices have plunged, capturing headlines, 
spooking investors and fanning fears of recession. Overall, the market has lost 
more than $324 billion in value since Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait, 
according to Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the clamor, does the general public have reason to care? 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market is just not that important -- particularly in its day-to-day 
and week-to-week changes," argues David I. Levine, a professor of economics at 
UC Berkeley's Walter A. Haas School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention lavished on Wall Street, its significance in the grand 
economic scheme remains unclear. Four out of five U.S. households own no stock 
or mutual funds, excluding pension plans, according to studies at the 
University of Michigan. Widespread forecasts that the crash of October, 1987, 
would trigger an economic slump proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss today's financial turmoil as unrelated to 
the rest of the nation, some analysts say. Unlike the 1987 crash, it reflects 
genuine economic problems that the public understands well: the damage that 
higher energy costs can wreak in the form of inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not as wealthy as we were, there's no question about that," said Frank 
C. Wykoff, an economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont. "(Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein has done that to us, whether he meant to or not." 
</P>
<P>
Economists pay attention to the stock market for a few reasons. Its changes 
often mirror the public mood, as jittery stock movements seem to be doing right 
now. A prolonged rise or fall may point the way to the future course of the 
U.S. economy. Moreover, the skittish market has important, albeit indirect, 
effects on the more plodding economy of industrial America. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an economy of work and production, and there is an economy of 
financial transactions," observed Robert L. Heilbroner, an economist at the New 
School of Social Research in New York. "They are certainly bound together, but 
they are certainly loosely bound together." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the market's connection to things outside the financial world is tricky 
to measure. Its record as economic seer, for instance, is decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials consider the stock market important enough to include in 
their index of leading economic indicators, along with such weather vanes as 
building permits and orders for business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after the October, 1987, market debacle, the U.S. economy continued to 
grow, with the help of lower interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve 
Board. Similarly, a 190-point dive by the Dow Jones industrial index in 
October, 1989, amounted to a blip on an analyst's computer screen, an economic 
non-event. 
</P>
<P>
"You pick any recession you want and you'd find the stock market started to 
decline before it," said Edward E. Yardeni, director of economics at 
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "But the stock market has also 
predicted a few we haven't had." 
</P>
<P>
The market also is an unreliable barometer of spending in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Economists teach that declines in wealth translate to declines in spending, 
perhaps a cutback of a few cents for each $1 lost. Yet the link is not easy to 
establish after short-term market swings -- even huge ones. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the 1987 slide. Between August and late October, more than $1 trillion 
in "paper" wealth was erased, according to calculations by Wilshire Associates. 
But to pinpoint a spending decline that is caused by short-term market swings 
is like looking for "a needle in a haystack," Wykoff said. 
</P>
<P>
A whole range of factors, including real estate values and job skills -- what 
economists call human capital -- can affect a person's sense of affluence and 
willingness to spend. A momentary jump in the stock market doesn't set off a 
stampede of luxury purchases, and a temporary fall doesn't create widespread 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
For people to view stock market declines as more than ephemeral shifts on 
paper, "I think people have to really begin to believe that it's a permanent 
downward adjustment," said Dennis E. Logue, a financial economist at the Amos 
Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
"If the stock market blips up or blips down around some normal, long-run rate 
of return, I'm not sure those blips matter very much." 
</P>
<P>
What may matter more is the way that weakness in the market can dampen the 
plans of business executives to spend and invest. When values are high, issuing 
new stock can be a painless way for companies to raise investment money. When 
values are low, by contrast, companies are forced to issue a larger number of 
shares to raise the desired amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
But executives may not want to issue too many shares, in part because that 
dilutes each shareholder's ownership stake in the company, said Richard J. 
Sweeney, a professor of finance at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, rank-and-file workers may suffer because their wage prospects 
ultimately depend on investments that will boost their productivity. "If I'm a 
worker in that company, I'm not going to be getting more wages for being more 
productive," said Sweeney. "That's not attractive." 
</P>
<P>
The market also can affect some 43 million Americans who may own stock through 
their private pension plans. Barring a financial cataclysm, however, the 
effects are limited. 
</P>
<P>
Most pensioners rely on a type of plan that provides a guaranteed benefit that 
is not linked to market swings. Despite the October, 1987, crash, most pension 
plans finished the year with more assets than they had at the beginning, 
according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for retirees: Even most of those who took a hit in late 1987 
finished the year better off than they were before the vast run-up earlier in 
the year, EBRI found. 
</P>
<P>
For workers and pensioners, a potential downside of prolonged weakness in the 
stock market is that that their employer might be less likely to institute new, 
improved benefits, said Joseph S. Piacentini, a research associate at the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
"When the market is strong, it makes it cheaper to maintain a generous pension 
plan," Piacentini said. "In the long run, with weaker markets you'd expect some 
downward pressure on benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the least tangible way the stock market affects the overall economy is 
the role it plays in shaping Americans' sense of financial security. The public 
mood is important: Consumer spending amounts to two-thirds of all spending in 
the economy and is tracked closely by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts that the 1987 crash would cause a recession assumed that 
nerve-wracked consumers would hold off on major purchases, dragging down the 
economy. In fact, auto sales fell after Black Monday, and there were other 
warning signs of a broad slowdown. But when the crash was not followed by 
ominous developments, such as a rise in unemployment, business picked up and 
the economy continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Today's worries are different, economists say, because they arise from 
potentially serious economic problems that have nothing to do with the 
spectacle on Wall Street. The current concerns also hit home in a way that the 
1987 crash did not, because many adults retain distasteful memories of past oil 
shocks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, "People said this is just some funny gyration in the stock market, and 
it doesn't affect me," observed F. Thomas Juster, a professor of economics at 
the University of Michigan. "But everybody understands the effect of oil prices 
on inflation. Now people say this is a real event." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, overall consumer confidence in August plunged to its lowest level 
in more than seven years, according to a survey by the Conference Board in New 
York. Expectations about job availability and business conditions are the 
gloomiest they have been in years. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be wrong to cite the mercurial stock market as the main cause of 
such doubts, said Jason D. Bram, an economist with the business research 
organization. Job security, inflation and, to a lesser extent, interest rates 
and real estate values, all influence the public's sense of well-being more 
than the stock market does, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus some experts would rank the latest sparks in the financial world way down 
the list of what's really important to America's long-term prosperity. "If 
you're worried about the future, you should be worried about infrastructure and 
schools -- not the stock market and Iraq," counsels Berkeley's Levine. 
</P>
<P>
THE VOLATILE STOCK MARKET 
</P>
<P>
The crash of Black Monday, 1987, was part of a much larger slide that began in 
late August and continued until late October. After a huge rally earlier in the 
year, the market peaked on Aug. 25. The crash took place on Oct. 19, but the 
market didn't hit bottom until Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
This summer's rally came to an abrupt finale in mid-July, two weeks before the 
Persian Gulf crisis. The recent peak was on July 16. But the slide didn't 
accelerate until Iraq invaded Kuwait at the beginning of August. Stocks hit 
their recent bottom on Aug. 23 and have recovered only partially. 
</P>
