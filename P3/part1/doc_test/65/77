A proposal to kick military training programs off the Cal State Northridge 
campus appeared to have widespread support among faculty members Thursday, but 
when the issue was to be voted on the Faculty Senate did not have a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
If the Reserve Officer Training Corps is ousted from CSUN at the senate's March 
meeting, it would be the first time the program has been barred from an 
American college campus since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students urged an end to ROTC programs as 
part of a groundswell of anti-military sentiment. But this time the issue is 
discrimination, specifically the U.S. Department of Defense's continued refusal 
to allow homosexuals to join the military. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about that discrimination, faculty Secretary/Treasurer John 
Clendenning said: "We cannot have it. . . . If it exists anywhere in our 
university, we must ferret it out and stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two students participate in Air Force, Navy or Army ROTC programs at 
CSUN, according to spokesmen for the three branches. Eleven students have ROTC 
scholarships that cover tuition and books. 
</P>
<P>
Although homosexuals may take ROTC classes, they may not serve in the armed 
forces after graduation, which Air Force Capt. Robert Feliz said is required 
for those who receive ROTC scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three service branches, only the Air Force sent a representative -- 
Feliz -- to speak against the proposed policy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"By throwing ROTC off the campus, the policy is not going to change," said 
Feliz, an ROTC instructor. "What will change is the community's access to the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is the only branch that actually teaches ROTC classes -- such as 
American Defense Policy and Development of Air Power -- on the CSUN campus. The 
Army and Navy ROTC participants must travel to the UCLA campus in Westwood for 
similar courses. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Lesbian and Gay Alliance objected to the expansion of ROTC last year, 
prompting a review of the entire program by a subcommittee of the faculty's 
Educational Policies Committee. Before studying the expansion request, the 
subcommittee determined that the program violates campus anti-discrimination 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other issues concerning ROTC were considered moot at that point," said 
Prof. Lawrence Littwin, subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The policy considered by the senate Thursday would allow current students to 
complete their studies. But the military program would not be mentioned in the 
next printing of the college catalogue, and no new students would be allowed to 
enroll. 
</P>
<P>
Navy and Army ROTC representatives at UCLA, contacted by telephone, declined to 
comment on Thursday's faculty discussion, which ended when a roll call counted 
54 members, one short of a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students are important to us, of course," said Maj. Jay Farrar of the Navy 
ROTC. "But until it's an issue that has to be addressed, we're not involved." 
</P>
<P>
The ROTC runs 37 programs on 15 California State University campuses, said Anne 
Ambrose, a spokeswoman for the university system. Ambrose said she knew of no 
similar anti-ROTC movements at the other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a general move toward offering military training at high 
schools and colleges, several campuses nationwide have become increasingly 
concerned about the military's policy on homosexuals. A special faculty 
congress at the University of Wisconsin voted in December to bar ROTC, but that 
vote was overturned earlier this month by university regents.
