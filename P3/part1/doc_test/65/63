STRIPPER PARTY SPURS FORUM AT CHAPMAN

A campuswide forum on morals will be held today at Chapman College in response 
to an incident last month in which a stripper was hired to entertain at an 
off-campus fraternity party. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, entitled "A Question of Values," is set for 11 a.m. in Hashinger 
Hall on campus and will feature a discussion among students and faculty on 
values that Chapman College "stands for and should uphold," Pamela Ezell, the 
school's spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Bolger, director of residence life at the 2,200-student college, said the 
stripper incident involving members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity "raised 
a larger issue of values on the campus." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get together and discuss how we determine values," Bolger said 
Monday. "This is an issue across the country. Many campuses are wrestling with 
the issue of values." 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Chapman College's largest, invited 
the topless stripper to a party at their off-campus apartment on Sept. 28, 
according to the fraternity's president. About 50 students, many of them 
fraternity members, attended. 
</P>
<P>
The school earlier this month punished the fraternity with a one-year 
suspension and a second year's probation. But Chapman officials decided to set 
the suspension aside and allow a student "Greek Judicial Board" review the 
incident and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Bolger said the board decided last Thursday to place the fraternity on 
probation for one year and to require its members to become involved in three 
educational projects on campus, such as holding a forum on the dangers of 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
The student board consists of members from all the school's fraternities and 
sororities. JIM CARLTON
