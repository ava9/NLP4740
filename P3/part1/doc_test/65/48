IN THE 500th anniversary year of Columbus's voyage to America, another
extraordinary trans-Atlantic tale can be told. By chance, the log of the
slave ship Daniel and Henry, which sailed from Dartmouth in 1700, was found
on a London bookstall. The discovery has led to a vivid reconstruction* of a
remarkable trip to Africa's Guinea coast and the West Indies. It is the
shameful story of a trade in which the British always claimed an
abolitionist role.
CHRISTMAS: quite the worst time of year for a journey, and the most
difficult at which to put together a crew. It would take Roger Mathew, an
experienced Devonian captain, several weeks to find the 44 men he needed for
his gruelling voyage.
For several reasons, the complement of a slave ship had to be more than
double that of a normal merchant vessel: its financial backers feared slave
revolt, against which they could not insure; the barter process was
labour-intensive; guarding the slaves took many man-hours, and the death
rate among the crew was high. Of the Daniel and Henry's company, 10 were to
die and five to run away; others married or were bundled into the Royal
Navy. Only 24 returned. But the fate of the slaves was far worse.
Roger Mathew's ship would sail for the African coast to collect men, women
and children in exchange for cloth and weapons. Months later, the slaves who
survived would be delivered to rich plantation owners in the West Indies in
hard bargaining for sugar. It was a brutally simple equation: barter equals
slaves equals sugar.
In 1683, Mathew had delivered 123 slaves to Barbados as an unlicenced
trader, returning to Dartmouth with, among other things, two tons of Guinea
redwood. It was clear to the boat's merchant backers, Daniel Ivy and Henry
Arthur, that he was the man for the job.
be With him would be Walter Prideaux, his 23-year-old nephew, who came from
a well-known Quaker family. Nearly 300 years later, it is Prideaux's
meticulous record of the voyage that serves as an epitaph for this trade in
human beings.
Like a good seaman, Prideaux records the ship's position dutifully. As
conditions worsen, so his sympathy for the slaves grows. An uneasiness and a
strong whiff of superstition creep into his log. Repeatedly, he describes a
flaming sword (suggesting divine retribution) and his record becomes a
catalogue of slave deaths.
When Prideaux set sail for Africa, in February 1700, there were no
restrictions on involvement by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in the slave
trade. William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania and a devout Quaker, had
owned slaves in the 1690s. Indeed, during its journey to Jamaica the Daniel
and Henry fell in with the Society, a Quaker slave ship. The Friends did not
act on their involvement in slavery until 1757 - the year Prideaux died -
when alarm was expressed at their yearly meeting in London.
The Daniel and Henry was a merchantman typical of the period: broad-beamed,
apple-cheeked at the bow and made entirely of wood: oak, elm, beech, pine,
mahogany or teak were all in use as planking, baulks, keels, masts and
spars. It carried between 25 and 30 sails. As it left Dartmouth, Prideaux's
hopes were running high; but he was already suffering:
'5th March, 1700: The wind at topgallant gale: being not all well myself,
having my head in raging pain.'
Even before taking the slaves on board, life for the crew below decks was
cramped and chaotic: 'A mass of humanity in which each man was permitted
approximately 14 inches (35 cm) breadth to sling his hammock.' It was dark
and cold and the air was foul.
'The Daniel and Henry, fully laden, rode deep in the green waters of the
Western Approaches . . . the risk of fire on a timber ship, caulked and
coated with combustible oakum and tar pitch, carrying 80 barrels of
gunpowder and hogsheads of highly inflammable spirits, constantly occupied
the minds of her officers . . . into these cramped quarters, already alive
with vermin, came the flower of England's merchant marine. They had but the
haziest idea of whence they were bound, little idea of basic hygiene, only
the most meagre of bedding and few clothes.'
What lay ahead was the prospect of protracted negotiations with caboceers
(village headmen) as bolts of woollen cloth, sets of knives or Guinea coast
gold (often fake) were traded for slaves. The English were sustained by the
then-fashionable notion that Africa was so overcrowded that the slave ships
were doing the continent a favour. Another seafarer, Captain Nathaniel
Uring, wrote in 1726: 'The country is full of people, as may be supposed by
every man's being allowed as many wives as he has the ability to maintain;
and if it were not for these wars among themselves, and the Europeans
carrying such great numbers of slaves from thence, it is highly probable
that they would grow so numerous at last that the country would not contain
them.'
Almost all the slaves destined for the hold of the Daniel and Henry were
from what is now Ghana. Slaves of Coromantine (Ghanaian) origin were the
most highly-prized as strong, long-living and healthy specimens. Caboceers
were always on the look-out for novice traders: the headmen were past
masters at dressing mutton as lamb. Grey hair would be dyed, bodies shaved
smooth and oiled to give the appearance of health.
Bartering was a long, tiresome process with a complex set of rules entirely
of the Africans' making and liable to change at any time. A selection of
goods from the Daniel and Henry would be demanded and inspected. Plenty of
gifts - dashee - to headmen also changed hands. When both sides were
satisfied, slaves were marked with the initial letters of the ship's name
and consigned to minor caboceers until the goods were ferried ashore.
Mathew and Prideaux found themselves in fierce competition with other
traders on the Guinea coast. Negotiations began at daybreak and continued
until sunset. Several trips by longboat had to be made from the Daniel and
Henry, which was moored well offshore for added security. Prideaux
negotiated from the longboat, Mathew from the ship. Their first slave was
bought in Dix Cove on April 11 but progress for several weeks after that was
desperately slow:
'7th April, 1700: We seeing at Caotre several canoes on shore and many
negroes on the sand and we had one canoe which came off to us . . . but got
nothing but a few limes.'
Then, mooring at Poinyon, the Daniel and Henry took on 452 slaves, mostly
women and girls. But within 30 days of leaving Africa, Prideaux records on
October 6, 1700, that 153 slaves had already died and been jettisoned. In
the end, the number sold in Jamaica was 246 out of the 452 loaded in Guinea.
Ruthless captains could trade on the basis of losing up to 80 per cent of
their slaves en route.
Disease and overcrowding were among the main culprits on the so-called
'middle passage' between Africa and Jamaica. So was despair. Dysentery was
rife, with slaves who had been used to high-fibre food reduced to eating
beans boiled in lard and salt beef. The Africans, it was noted by many
seafarers, cared little for salt. It was impossible to conceal the poor
physical condition of many of Mathew's slaves, and the predominance of women
was to depress further the price merchants were prepared to bid.
Few captains can have felt at ease during the middle passage. Perhaps their
very discomfort is caught by the 18th century writer Thomas Aubrey: 'What a
devil makes these plaguey toads die so fast? To which I answer: 'Tis
inhumanity, barbarity and the greatest cruelty of their commander and his
crew'.'
The four-month run to Jamaica tested Prideaux sorely. He had been writing
his log diligently in a vellum-bound ledger bearing his coat of arms and the
legend Walter Prideaux - His Booke - Anno Domini 1688. It had been his 12th
birthday present.
'As in the first stage, Prideaux opens his account with the ritual entreaty
of God's blessing upon the voyage,' writes Nigel Tattersfield in The
Forgotten Trade. 'This is no empty supplication, for nowhere was man more at
the mercy of the elements than at sea. And, beneath the everyday
navigational conventions of the log book, there arises a suggestion that
Prideaux is far from easy about being employed on a slave ship . . . He
grows more and more fearful; five prayers are invoked on this passage.'
Even sighting Barbados gives him no cause for joy. To him, the Daniel and
Henry has become a ship of death. Prideaux has become acutely conscious of
his own mortality. The devil seems to sail with him. On October 22 he
writes: 'Saw a star shoot which continued like a flaming sword for three
minutes.' Jamaica was reached in November.
For the first time in nine months, the ship's scuttles and gunports could be
opened, the foul air released and the hold scrubbed out. Pitch was burned
like incense in a bid to fumigate the area. Wood was washed down with
vinegar, a makeshift disinfectant. The huge accumulation of sewage made
cleaning the bilges a hideous task. Rats roamed freely; cockroaches and mice
were everywhere. The sails had been ruined by a year of verminous attack.
There was much to be done before the Daniel and Henry could change from
slave ship to merchantman.
By the following summer, 1701, some 18 months after starting its voyage, the
crew of the Daniel and Henry was back in Devon. For the captain, the balance
sheet was not healthy. The slaves had generated perhaps Pounds 3,800,
although this was largely in bills of exchange and promissory notes likely
to be discounted heavily by London bankers. He had also brought back five
tons of muscovado sugar worth less than Pounds 300. His outgoings were about
Pounds 5,300. His hazardous and often horrific voyage had not made him or
his backers rich.
None of the crew ever worked the slave routes again. Mathew went back to
ordinary merchantmen and never returned to Africa. Prideaux, who married and
produced 13 children, became a maltster. Several of his descendants were
important figures in the Society of Friends, well into this century. But,
chiefly, he left us his log, which hints at horrors almost beyond
comprehension.
