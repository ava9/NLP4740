A DETAILED analysis of Labour's dismal general election performance in the
south-east offered a warning last night that the opposition cannot rely on
the government's problems to bring a decisive change in its electoral
fortunes, Philip Stephens writes.
The study, published by the Fabian Society, indicates that Mr John Smith
must oversee a radical shift in his party's policies and values if it is to
achieve the breakthrough in the south-east needed to defeat the
Conservatives.
Written by Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, and based on
research in five marginal constituencies in the south-east, it argues that
the election result demonstrated that Labour had lost touch with the
'aspirant' working class whose support is vital to ensure election
victories.
It confirms other post-election research showing that Labour's tax and
spending policies proved a fatal weakness in the 177 southern England seats
outside London. It won only 10 of those seats.
Labour was seen as the party of uniformity, which would stifle the ambitions
of home and share owners, while the Conservatives successfully cultivated
their image as that of 'opportunity' and 'choice'.
As a move towards change, Mr Radice suggests abandonment of the Clause 4
commitment to public ownership.
