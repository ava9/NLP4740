Unipalm, a Cambridge-based computer communications company, is coming to
market by way of a placing to raise approximately Pounds 5.5m net of
expenses. Sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, it is expected to
value the company at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m.
Unipalm, now eight years old, is a leading UK specialist in methods of
attaching commercial organisations to a global computer network known as the
Internet. The potential of the Internet remains comparatively untapped in
the UK, but interest is growing rapidly in the US.
Unipalm has two principal operating companies. One distributes
interconnection software while the other, Pipex, founded in January 1992,
specialises in Internet connection. Pipex is under contract to the BBC to
provide a low cost Internet connection to accompany a new series 'The Net',
scheduled for April.
In the year to April 30, 1993 the distribution business made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 897,000 on Pounds 8m sales. In the first half of the current year,
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 461,000 on sales of Pounds 4.35m.
Pipex, however, incurred Pounds 308,000 losses on sales of Pounds 381,000 in
its first year and a further Pounds 313,000 on sales of Pounds 592,000 in
the first half of the current year. Overall, the group made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 148,000 on sales of Pounds 4.94m.
The company has some 200 customers including Dixons and Pilkington
representing 70 per cent of the UK commercial Internet market. Recurrent
revenues from these customers are running at Pounds 1.5m a year.
Mr Peter Dawe, a Unipalm co-founder and now Pipex managing director, said
funds were being raised to expand the Internet interconnection business,
currently expanding at 100 per cent a year. He believed growth rates of
treble that amount a year were possible, admittedly from a low base point.
The Internet is not a single system but a self-regulating collection of over
14,000 networks across the globe. It has its origins in academic and defence
networks in the US and has been seen principally as a low cost electronic
mail system for hobbyists.
During the 1991 Soviet coup it was credited with providing a reliable path
for information in and out of Moscow.
