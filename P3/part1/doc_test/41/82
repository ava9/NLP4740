Access to international stock market quotes, financial data and business
news is now available via the Internet at considerably lower cost than most
online services.
Quote. Com, a service established by a Nevada company of the same name,
lists 23 exchanges in Europe and North America. Users can access quotes for
stocks, mutual funds, commodities, futures and precious metals.
As part of the basic service offered by Quote. Com for Dollars 9.95 (Pounds
6.40) per month, users can store a portfolio of up to 50 listed financial
instruments and will receive, via E-Mail, a close-of-trading day report.
During the day, they may receive E-Mail alerts if their set price limit
alarms are triggered.
Access to London exchanges or European exchanges costs Dollars 19.95 per
month.
'The Internet gives companies the ability to reach the world market with
very little difficulty,' says Chris Cooper, president of Quote. Com. While
taking advantage of the extensive reach of the Internet, Quote. Com has
avoided the infrastructure and software costs generally associated with
creating a new online service.
Quote. Com's Internet server can be accessed using four connection methods:
telnet (telnet quote. com), E-Mail (info@quote. com), direct Internet
connection on a World Wide Web browser (http://www. quote. com) or via file
transfer protocol (ftp. quote. com).
Voice of America, the international radio broadcasting system funded by the
US government, this week began digital audio newscasts via the Internet. The
10-minute newscasts are available in 15 languages to computer users
worldwide, 24 hours a day. The digitised signals can be converted into sound
by most PCs.
