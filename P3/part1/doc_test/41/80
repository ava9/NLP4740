UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, will
recapitalise its Banque Worms subsidiary, Reuter reports from Paris. The
insurer also announced that the bank's managing director, Mr Didier
Renaudin, is to step down.
The insurance group said that Worms would get an injection of between
FFr500m (Dollars 100m) and FFr700m, but declined to comment on the figures.
Banque Worms posted a net loss of FFr179m in 1991, including a FFr310m
provision against property risks. This year property provisions are expected
to be smaller.
