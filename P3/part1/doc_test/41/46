FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Expansionist mood for Gerard
Worms

Wheeling and dealing is part and parcel of corporate life at Suez, the
sprawling French holding company; yet Gerard Worms, its chairman, can have
greeted few deals with quite so much relief as last week's sale of Abeille
Re, the reinsurance business, to the SCOR group, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The deal marked the end of three years of arduous negotiations over the
disposal of Victoire, the French insurer that owned Abeille Re and was
recently sold to the UK's Commercial Union. It also marked a turning point
for Worms himself who, having spent his first four years as chairman
embroiled in disposals, is now free to indulge in expansion.
Worms, 57, is an easy man to underestimate, as his fellow French financiers
now realise. His genial air and mild manner prompted some to dismiss him as
a paler shadow of Jean Peyrelevade, his former boss who is now chairman of
the Credit Lyonnais banking group.
He did little to confound his critics during his first few years at Suez
when tussling with the task of instilling some sort of strategic direction
into its vast and varied interests. But he soon showed his mettle by
fiercely resisting the attempts of Peyrelevade (then head of Union des
Assurances de Paris) to achieve an easy - and cheap - takeover of Colonia,
the German insurer controlled by Victoire.
The two men finally struck a deal late last year but Worms was generally
seen as having struck the better bargain. He then went on to auction off
Victoire and, having completed that task, can now settle down to convincing
his critics that he is as good at buying as he was at selling.
