FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Europe to lead Warp attack - Sales of early
version have beaten US levels

European computer users are expected to be in the vanguard of IBM's attack
on Microsoft and the Windows operating software. Traditionally, European
customers have lagged two years or more behind their US contemporaries, but
Hermann Lamberti, head of IBM's personal software division in Europe, says
this situation has already been reversed for OS/2, the early version of
Warp.
In 1992, about 500,000 copies of OS/2 were sold in Europe; in 1993 annual
sales were running at more than 1m and this year Mr Lamberti expects to sell
more than 2.5m. US customers are expected to buy slightly more than 2m
copies in 1994.
There seem to be two principal reasons for this. First, while US computer
users have tended to adopt each new generation of software in turn,
Europeans seem to move in jumps. Lamberti argues that users in countries
such as Spain and Portugal, where the PC revolution has been slower to
develop than elsewhere in Europe, are moving from a first generation PC to
the latest Intel 486 or Pentium based system in one step, and are ready for
advanced operating software.
Second, Europe is ahead of the US in some of the key networking
technologies, including the digital telephony standard Integrated Services
Digital Network, and is well-equipped to make use of an advanced
network-based operating system.
Lamberti expects that the tools built into Warp to gain access to the
Internet will appeal particularly to European users. Only about 8-9m
European users regularly dial into the Internet compared with 15m or so in
the US, but interest has been growing rapidly.
The software will have a number of built-in features including simple word
processing, database and spreadsheet software for people who make use of
only a few of the facilities available in proprietary packages. Lamberti
says that nobody should give up a program which suits them in favour of a
Warp version, but many users would welcome a simple, built-in alternative.
Warp anticipates the demise of the keyboard and mouse by handling speech and
pen-based input, but it may be a few years before there is much call for
these features. Warp's list price in the UK will be Pounds 70.
