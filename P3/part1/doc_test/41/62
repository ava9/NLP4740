The Data Protection Registrar has called for talks with British
Telecommunications over a breach of security that has resulted in the leak
of some of the UK's most sensitive security telephone numbers.
BT began its own inquiry as doubts grew last night over the existence of a
hacker supposed to have penetrated the computers, removed sensitive
telephone numbers and addresses and transmitted them over the Internet, the
international computer network.
The Independent newspaper yesterday said the hacker had sent thousands of
confidential records including telephone numbers for MI5, MI6, Downing
Street and Buckingham Palace to Mr Stephen Fleming, described as a freelance
journalist.
The Independent said Mr Fleming had worked without pay for only three days
at BT, to check the veracity of the information he was receiving. The
information, it was said, was sent over the Internet from someone who
claimed to have penetrated BT security.
The telephone company said last night that Mr Fleming had been an employee
of the organisation for two months during the summer.
It accepted that there had been a genuine breach of security and that
sensitive numbers had been taken from the database but said there was no
evidence of hacking - jargon for defeating computer security devices. It
said last night that its Customer Service System was secure and
exceptionally robust. It added: 'Despite an extensive and on-going search,
BT has found no evidence that the confidential information has ever been
available on the Internet.'
Internet experts said last night the volume of traffic travelling across the
Internet was so great that it would be unlikely for anyone to have been able
to track the transmission.
Mr Fleming is a former pharmaceutical salesman who has recently worked for
United Artists cable networks in Edinburgh.
Mr Ian Hargreaves, Independent editor, said last night that the story had
been thoroughly researched over several weeks. Mr Fleming had not been paid
for his story.
The breach highlights a lack of awareness of computer security endemic
across British business. Professor Henry Becker of Zergo, a security
consultancy which works for public and private-sector organisations, said
computer security at BT was better than at most commercial companies.
