"But why are you pouring worms on the lawn?" asked my wife from a great 
distance, as I was trying to describe what nematodes are. One of the more 
fascinating of the new organic controls employs tiny (make that microscopic) 
worm-like nematodes that find, attack and kill larvae living underground, or 
close to the ground, such as cutworms, root maggots, wireworms, the 
helmet-headed larva of June beetles (which chomp on lawn grass roots and which 
were my intended target) and a host of other creatures that attack vegetables, 
flowers and lawns.

Biosys, a biological pest control company in Palo Alto, California makes this 
product, called BioSafe Lawn and Garden Insect Control. What you get in the 
large box is a plastic bottle with what looks like window screening inside, 
plus a package of "activator." 
</P>
<P>
The screening is coated with a gel that contains the dormant nematodes (which 
can be stored refrigerated for up to six months). You add water and the 
activator to release the nematodes and then put this mixture is a watering can 
or hose-end sprayer and apply it to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Each box contains enough of the little creatures (probably billions) to treat 
an area 22.5 feet by 10 feet, or 225 square feet. Because it is not a poison, 
it is not harmful to the environment, people or pets. It is not yet commonly 
available at nurseries but is becoming available. Scanmask is a similar 
nematode product available through the mail, from Ringer, 9959 Valley View 
Road, Eden Prairie, Minn., 55344-3585, (800) 654-1047. One pint sells for 
$14.98. It treats 200 to 370 square feet depending on pest type. ROBERT SMAUS
