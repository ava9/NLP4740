FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (17): Students log on
 -Education at home and in the office is available all over the world, on a
study programme run from Wolsey Hall, Oxford / Long-distance tutorials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MBA is much sought-after qualification, but its popularity comes at a
time when companies find it difficult to release staff for studies. Wolsey
Hall, Oxford, is a Distance Education centre and is helping Oxford Brookes
University to run a long-distance MBA programme for students all over the
world.
According to Peter Newell, chairman of Open Learning Centre, Wolsey Hall,
students come from every conceivable background, with ages ranging from
27-45, and one in 10 living outside the UK.
Although Newell hesitates to call this teleworking, long-distance computer
conferencing is an important part of the teaching structure, connecting the
tutor with a group of students who can log on for the cost of a local phone
call.
'With the tutor as moderator, a valuable interaction takes place, not
instantaneously, but perhaps over 24-36 hours,' he says.
The mechanism for connecting the students is supplied by CECOMM, which
provides each student with a 'conference connection' pack, which enables
them to connect a PC via a modem to the MBA host computer, using EUnet's
Internet services.
The host runs electronic mail and conferencing software, and via Internet
students can take part in the discussion groups or send private messages to
the tutors, course administrators, or other students.
Newell uses the system to connect 15 outworkers, (editors and proof readers
for the courseware) and 200 authors and tutors. 'The system is a good way of
communicating for people who learn to use it well,' says Newell.
'Electronic mail is not good for the autocratic manager because it's an
equaliser. It's not a substitute for conversation but it's a remarkably
powerful form of communication for quality, speed and efficiency: it enables
communications to fly around the business very fast indeed.'
EUnet GB pioneered the exchange of information between computers on public
access networks in 1979. Now it supports the communications networks of
hundreds of UK corporations.
CECOMM, an EUnet user, was set up in the 1980s to develop telematics in the
educational field and is currently developing the teleworking methodologies
used by such organisations as Wolsey Hall and the Oxford Business School.
'We train tutors and co-ordinate people using the systems who can be
corporate managers, part-timers - anyone using long-distance telecom
tutoring,' explains Charles Jennings, CECOMM consultant on Telematic
systems.
Providing a simple interface is part of the job, especially as users cannot
always have the standard Macintosh or DOS equipment.
'People just want a nice simple pipe that works,' says Jennings.
When sitting alone at the screen, getting lost in the system is a danger. To
help navigate, and answer the 'Where am I?' question, CECOMM has devised a
way of visualising the system with a 'map' using a floor layout which looks
like a faculty building, including administration (reception), conference
hall, cubicles for study, seminar rooms and even ja cafe.
In Jennings' experience, distance-learning by teleworking can suit all
sorts.
'Some of the people with the least technical experience, who work with
non-technical subjects, have produced some of the highest-quality work as
teletutors.'
