  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- Japan's top computer maker 
Fujitsu Ltd. said Saturday [28 May] it will launch Wednesday a 
new service for Internet, the world's largest computer on-line 
network. 
  The Tokyo-based company said it will establish access points 
in Tokyo and Osaka initially, which will be expanded to six 
other major cities such as Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and Fukuoka 
in July. 
  Internet is an on-line network for computers with common 
protocol and address architecture. It is linked to about 5,000 
government and academic networks in more than 140 countries 
around the world. 
  Customers will have access to a huge volume of information 
through electronic mail. 
  Fujitsu said it plans to further expand its Internet access 
service using its own value-added network to cover 52 cities 
across Japan in three years. 
  Company officials said universities and enterprises in local 
areas will be able to have access to internet by calling access 
points in major cities. 
  About 43,000 host computers with access to Internet were in 
operation in Japan as of October last year, according to 
industry sources. 
  Fujitsu said the initiation fee for subscribers using 
telephones or the integrated service digital network will be 
30,000 yen, plus 30 yen per minute for access to Internet. 
  For those with leased closed circuits, the initial cost will 
be 50,000 yen, plus monthly charges of ranging from 150,000 yen 
depending on transmission speeds.
