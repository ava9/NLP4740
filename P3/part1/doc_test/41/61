holding company

Among the cerebral ranks of the French financial elite, Mr Gerard Worms,
chairman of Suez, one of France's largest financial and industrial holding
companies, is noted for his cheerful temperament and unflappable air.
Mr Worms has, over the past few months, needed every ounce of cheerfulness
as Suez has been hit by crisis after crisis. Its banking, insurance and
property interests have been badly affected by France's economic slowdown.
It has had to spend FFr2.4bn (Pounds 279m) to recapitalise Indosuez and La
Henin, its banking subsidiaries. Suez has also clashed with Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), one of its largest shareholders.
The outlook for 1993 looks little better. Mr Worms faces a bracing 12 months
in which he must get to grips with Suez' operational problems and make the
peace with UAP, while trying to complete the long-term restructuring of the
group.
'This is the first time in our history that every area of the business has
hit the bottom of the cycle,' said Mr Worms. 'The worst is probably behind
us, but 1993 will still be tough.'
The economic squeeze came just as Suez was absorbing the motley assortment
of industrial interests it acquired in the bruising battle for Societe
Generale de Belgique. The integration of La Generale has been unexpectedly
difficult, not least because Suez was a classic French holding company with
stakes in dozens of different companies.
Mr Worms' main objective since becoming chairman in 1990 has been to
streamline the group by selling peripheral interests. By last autumn Suez
had made FFr11bn of disposals, FFr5.5bn of which came from SGB. In theory it
should now be nearing the end of its restructuring. Instead Suez is
struggling to adjust to the depressed state of its investment banking and
insurance interests and to the crisis in the Paris property market where
average rentals have fallen 20 per cent over the past three years.
Suez has already announced a steep fall in 1992 interim net income from
FFr1.8bn to FFr500m. Indosuez and La Henin have had to be recapitalised
after making hefty property provisions. Indosuez last week raised around
FFr400m from the sale and leaseback of its Paris headquarters. However
Paribas, the French bank, still predicts a fall in net profits from FFr3.8bn
in 1991 to FFr1.4bn in 1992.
Mr Worms expects to reduce the level of provisions this year, but does not
anticipate any improvement in the property market. However he does hope for
a modest recovery in insurance, and possibly investment banking, in the
second half.
In the meantime the cost cutting and disposals will continue. Suez has
already made FFr1.5bn of disposals since last autumn and Mr Worms plans to
raise another FFr3.5bn over the next 12 months. By the end of 1993 he hopes
to have finished the restructuring. 'We will be less like a conglomerate of
independent companies, I want to see more co-operation,' he said. 'Suez must
operate as a group.'
Paribas expects Suez' profits to settle at FFr2bn in 1993 before
strengthening in 1994. 'The restructuring has been very complicated,' said
Mr Pierre Flabbee, an analyst with Paribas in Paris. 'But the management is
sound. They have been very honest about their problems and have the right
strategy for the future.'
However Suez still has to resolve the row with UAP. The two groups fell out
late last year when Suez broke off negotiations to sell control of Colonia,
a German insurer, to UAP. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP chairman and one of Mr
Worms' predecessors at Suez, had refused to pay the extra FFr1.5bn that Suez
wanted for the controlling stake.
So far Suez has held a winning hand. UAP has made no secret of its eagerness
to control Colonia, but Suez has no real need to sell. The affair has also
helped Mr Worms to show he can stand up to his old boss.
Mr Peyrelevade is now putting pressure on Suez. UAP recently invested in
Nordstern, the most profitable part of Colonia. It could now step up the
pressure through its stake in Suez itself, 6.3 per cent of the shares and 10
per cent of the votes.
Mr Worms is unflappable. 'There is no real problem with UAP,' he said. 'Jean
Peyrelevade and I understand each other' he said. 'The only difference
between us is price - and isn't that always the case in business?'
