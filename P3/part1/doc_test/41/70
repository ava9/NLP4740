<F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by Alfred Worm: </F>
place and date not given: "Departing From the Rule in Special 
Cases"] 
  [Text] [Worm] Mr. President, we ask you for an authentic 
interpretation. According to Article 65 of the Constitution, 
the president represents the republic internationally. 
  [Klestil] The article also states: He signs state treaties. 
However, I have never left any doubt that I will delegate this 
authority. 
  [Worm] The Constitution says: According to the proposal of 
the president. 
  [Klestil] That is right. This is the power to sign state 
treaties. After all, the Constitution is the basis of our 
democracy. I have sworn an oath on it. 
  [Worm] Your predecessors have never stressed this aspect of 
the Constitution. 
  [Klestil] I know that the practices of my predecessors are a 
strong element in the assessment of a political situation. I 
have always made it clear that I will delegate this power. I 
have already done that. All other details were discussed with 
the chancellor. 
  [Worm] Why was there so much wrangling among the political 
parties after the referendum? 
  [Klestil] During the campaign for the vote, I stressed that 
I 
would assume a nonpartisan role. This is what I would like to 
signal to the European Union [EU] with my trip to Corfu. My 
presence is designed to underline the historic significance of 
the signing of this treaty. 
  [Worm] You will not sign the treaty in Corfu but you will 
make a speech. 
  [Klestil] That has been agreed. 
  [Worm] What about the European Council? 
  [Klestil] Everything that is to be implemented politically 
must be done by the government. Thus, it is quite natural for 
the chancellor and the foreign minister to represent the 
government in this body. 
  [Worm] The European Council will convene in Germany in 
December. Will you participate in this meeting? 
  [Klestil] No, I will not. 
  [Worm] Can you think of an event that might induce you to 
attend a meeting of the European Council in 1996 when the new 
security structures are adopted and when you might act as the 
supreme commander of the Austrian Army, for example? 
  [Klestil] Let me repeat once more: Basically, this will be 
the task of the government because it must implement the 
decisions. However, there might be very special occasions 
permitting a departure from the rule. 
  [Worm] What will be the "rule?" 
  [Klestil] That the chancellor and the foreign minister 
represent Austria. 
  [Worm] Are you annoyed about the refusal of the Austrian 
People's Party to allow State Secretary Brigitte Ederer to sign 
the treaty? 
  [Klestil] I have left no doubt that I will delegate the 
authority to sign the treaty. Theoretically, I would have 
considered it possible to suggest the signing of the treaty by 
two persons -- the chancellor and the foreign minister. Bearing 
in mind that Leopold Figl was the only person to sign the State 
Treaty, one could have asked only Foreign Minister Mock to sign 
the treaty with the EU. However, the government submitted a 
different proposal. 
  [Worm] Did you express surprise? 
  [Klestil] I talked with the chancellor to avoid any 
friction. 
One should not inform the other side via the Austrian Press 
Agency. 
  [Worm] Do you understand Ms. Ederer's situation? 
  [Klestil] During a discussion with her, I did not have the 
impression that she was upset. She showed great commitment 
during the negotiations. Thus, it would have been normal for 
her to sign the treaty as well. However, the parties made a 
different decision. In my view, a smaller group of persons who 
held the talks would have corresponded to the weight of the 
occasion.
