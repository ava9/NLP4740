Judging from the rash of newspaper and magazine articles about the Internet
recently, it seems as if almost everyone with a personal computer is
dialling up, logging on and 'surfing the net'.
In the UK alone, three new magazines dealing with the Internet - the
informal system of computer networks which connects databases and computers
across the globe - have been launched in the past two months.
Subscriptions to organisations which provide Internet access are rising by
more than 10 per cent a month and sales of modems, the electronic devices
that enable personal computers to communicate over a telephone line, are
soaring. But, for many owners of personal computers, the online world
remains a mysterious and intimidating environment of technobabble and
acronyms. The first step to entering this world is selecting a modem.
There are two forms of modem - internal and external. Internal modems plug
into one of the spare card slots found inside most PCs, while external
modems are connected to the PC's communications or serial port by a cable.
Both need to be plugged into a spare telephone socket.
For anyone buying a new computer and intending to explore the online world
it makes sense to buy a machine with an internal modem already installed.
If you are planning to add a modem to an existing PC set-up the conventional
wisdom is that external modems are easier to install and monitor because
they are more accessible. Installing an internal modem means opening up the
PC and plugging in the card.
But the advantages of an internal modem are that it does not take up extra
desk space and it will include the high-speed chips that handle
communications between the latest high-speed modems and the microprocessor
'brain' of the PC. Some fast external modems may still need a special
high-speed serial card installed inside the PC.
The other crucial decision for would-be PC communicators is how fast a modem
to buy. One simple answer is the fastest one you can afford.
Modems are rated according to how quickly they can exchange data over a
telephone line. A modem's speed is expressed either in terms of its baud
rate - which, at lower speeds, is roughly equivalent to bits (of data) per
second - or by reference to the V series standards which have been set by
the international telecommunications authorities.
The most common modem speeds are: V22 or 1,200 baud, V22bis or 2,400 baud,
V32 or 9,600 baud, V32bis or 14,400 baud and the latest standard, V34 or
28,800 baud. Each step up effectively doubles the modem speed and therefore
halves the amount of time it takes to send a particular message across a
telephone wire.
Faster speed means less waiting for files to be transfered and, in most
places, other than the US where local telephone calls are free, cheaper
telephone bills.
Until recently, many modems - and most online databases - only operated at a
speed of 1,200 baud or 2,400 baud. However the current business standard is
for data transmission at 14,400bps and the modem purchaser today should aim
to buy a modem capable of this speed.
Modems used to be expensive, partly because telecommunications authorities
in many countries insisted on their own testing procedures before they would
allow equipment to be connected to their networks.
In the UK, modem designs must be tested. Approved modems carry a green
British Approvals Board for Telecommunications (Babt) sticker. In the past,
many modem manufacturers used this requirement as an excuse to charge
premium prices.
However a flood of 'illegal' imports from overseas which did not carry the
Babt sticker but nevertheless worked perfectly well, forced modem
manufacturers to reasses their pricing policies.
As a result, Babt-approved modem prices in Britain have fallen sharply over
the past year and a fast 14,400 baud modem from a mainstream manufacturer
such as US Robotics, Zoom, Dataflex, MultiTech or Pace can now be bought
through a magazine advertisement for Pounds 150 or less.
Once you have bought a modem, the next task is to connect it to your PC.
Most modems are factory pre-set to respond to signals sent by the
microprocessor to the Coms 2 port of the PC - on many PCs the mouse is
connected to the Coms 1 port.
If, however, the modem is pre-set for a different port, or the Coms 2 port
is already occupied by another device, it may be necessary to reset tiny
switches on the modem called 'jumpers'. The documentation that comes with
the modem you buy will explain how to do this.
The communications software - which determines how the two modems talk to
each other - will also need to be set up for the correct communications
port.
Any PC owner running Microsoft Windows already owns a basic PC
communications software package called Terminal which enables a modem
connection to be established and governs the communications 'protocol'
between two computers.
For the more ambitious, software suites such as Microsoft Works also include
communications software. Even more sophisticated software packages such as
Mirror III, Procomm Plus or Hayes Smartcom are also available, at a cost of
about Pounds 50. Many modems are now sold with communications software, and
sometimes with introductory membership to an online service such as
Compuserve or Delphi.
Compuserve, one of the largest online services, like most of the other
US-based online service providers, supplies its own dedicated Windows
communications software. Compuserve's is called WinCim.
However a standard communications package is all that is needed to log on to
many of the hundreds of private or commercial bulletin board systems. For
full access to the Internet, additional communications software, available
from most Internet service providers, may also be needed.
