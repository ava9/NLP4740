WORMS, the French holding company with interests in insurance, shipping and
luxury goods, sustained a sharp fall in first-half net profits to FFr379m
(Dollars 75.3m) from FFr1.11bn a year earlier, because of the downturn in
the property market.
Despite the profits downturn, Worms is pressing ahead with expanding its
insurance business by concluding a cross-shareholding agreement between
Athena, its insurance subsidiary, and Wurttembergische, a German insurer.
Under the deal Athena will hold 5 per cent of Wurttembergische which will
take 5 per cent of the French company.
The Wurttembergische deal is the latest in a series of alliances between
French and German insurance groups. Assurances Generales de France has built
up a sizeable holding in Aachener &amp; Munchener, while Union des Assurances de
Paris is in talks with France's Suez group to acquire an interest in
Colonia, another German insurer.
