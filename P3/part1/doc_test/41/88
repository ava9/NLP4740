Internet to display paintings

Technology is an unlikely ally of art, but two private organisations in
Ireland hope to change this. They aim to promote Irish art abroad by using
digital technology to display paintings over the Internet, the international
information network.
Toppsi is a Dublin-based bulletin board system, which has its roots in
providing information systems for social services. Its founder, Martin
Maguire, wants to hold an international art exhibition over the Internet. It
will be initially targeted to 15 EU capitals and extended to include
Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles, featuring local artists from each city.
Fifty paintings will be scanned in at each site, stored on a central server
in Dublin, and then relayed over the Internet to art galleries and museums
in each city. Each site will have a high-quality printer and prints will be
sold for around Pounds 35 each.
Internet users will later be able to dial into the server in Dublin and
download images of the paintings. Maguire also plans to publish the
exhibition on CD.
Another Internet provider based in Galway on the west cost has already taken
steps to bring Irish art to the rest of the world. Ireland On-line is
running a pilot scheme for Kennys book shop and art gallery.
Kennys is well known in academic circles as a provider of Irish-interest
books. Its customers include US universities and libraries.
Kennys is also famous among the artistic community for its exhibitions of
Irish artists. Driven by the need to communicate with its US customers and a
desire to promote its art exhibitions, Kennys will put a database of all its
books on the Internet and offer a free service for people who want to go
on-line and get a sneak preview of the next exhibition. The service provides
biographies of the artists and examples of their work.
One of the artists whose work is displayed on the system is Kenneth Webb,
known for his watercolours and depictions of rural Ireland.
'In the early '60s and '70s I travelled a lot between Ireland, New York,
Paris, London and even Africa, but now I am not interested in all that. I
have my painting and my interests here so I think this is a great
opportunity to display my paintings. The beauty is that this is a visual
medium. I have never read anything that has done justice to my or anybody
else's paintings, but with this people can see for themselves.'
Webb believes there are further advantages in the concept of exhibiting
paintings on an international network. 'International art has become very
sterile; there is a sameness between paintings from almost anywhere in the
world. It's made up of the sort of paintings that architects like. I see
myself as more of an ethnic painter. I like to express the peculiarity of
the landscape around me. This (Internet) will allow painters from anywhere
in the world to be exhibited internationally.'
Barry Flannigan, head of Ireland On-Line, sees a trade-off between the
quality of the image exhibited and the cost of downloading that image. 'It's
a balance really; most computer screens have a resolution of about 75 dots
per inch but we provide 150 dots per inch and include about 250 colours,
which is a long way off being good enough to print lithographically. It's
just a taster, if the user likes the painting then they can buy it.'
Maguire has approached the problem from a different perspective, mainly
because as well as providing the images over the Internet, he plans to
produce CDs of the paintings. 'The solution is so simple and already tried
and tested. It's share ware. If people like the images then they can pay a
licence fee to the artist.'
Maguire has teamed up with the artist Paddy Graham, who says the potential
of the Internet for artists is staggering.
'The question is whether technology will inhibit the intuitive process of an
artist or simply expand it.'
