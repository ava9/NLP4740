The BBC opens its Networking Club for business today, offering what it
describes as low-cost, user-friendly access to the global computer networks
of the Internet.
Mr Eurfron Gwynne Jones, BBC director of education, believes the BBC is the
world's first media organisation 'to open up mass access to the
communications revolution.' Echoing the launch of the 1980s BBC micro
computer, membership, with starter kit, will be from Pounds 25 plus VAT,
with a monthly fee of Pounds 12 plus VAT.
As well as Internet access there will be an information and conferencing
service, Auntie, with information about BBC radio and tv programmes, and
transcripts and fact sheets. The network backbone will be provided by Pipex.
