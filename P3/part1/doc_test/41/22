How do businesses get on the Internet? The answer to this FAQ (frequently
asked question, in 'netspeak') depends to a great extent on the size of an
organisation, the number of people who will be using the Internet and how
much use they plan to make of it.
The basic requirements are simply a personal computer, with a modem, and an
account with one of the numerous companies that offer Internet access. Two
that offer their services internationally are ANS (313 663 7610) and
SprintLink (703 904 2230), both of the US.
To take advantage of the latest software, such as Mosaic, which makes access
to Internet resources relatively simple, a high-powered PC such as those
based on Intel's 486DX or Pentium chips is recommended. The modem should be
designed to send and receive data at 14.4 kilobauds. Slower modems, although
cheaper, will keep you waiting interminably if you attempt to access any
document containing graphics.
Also, to use Mosaic you must have a direct link to the Internet, known as a
PPP or Slip account. This enables your computer to exchange data in
'packets' directly with other computers on the Internet. Prices vary, but in
the US they are typically about Dollars 20 per month plus Dollars 2 per hour
connect time.
Businesses with several users tapping into the Internet may choose to
install a dedicated, high-speed telephone line, which makes access more
efficient. Routing equipment is needed to link local area networks to the
Internet. Security systems may also be desirable.
There are numerous books about the Internet. Most, however, are aimed
primarily at individual users. An exception is Mary Cronin's Doing Business
on the Internet; How the Electronic Highway is transforming American
Companies, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold at Dollars 29.95. Written for
business managers, rather than computer experts, it offers a readable
introduction to the Internet's business potential.
