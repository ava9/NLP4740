Modern thieves can steal more with a computer than with a gun, and America's 
"luck" in avoiding a major computer disaster way soon run out unless security 
is tightened, an expert panel warned today. 
</P>
<P>
A National Research Council committee concluded the United States has grown to 
rely on computers for everything from banking to health care without ensuring 
that such information is secure from accident or deliberate attack. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, failures of computer system security, safety and reliability 
appear to be increasing in number and severity, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the examples cited were: the much-publicized 1988 incident in which a 
reproducing computer program, called a worm, snarled as many as 6,000 computer 
systems; a nearly successful attempt to use thousands of phony automatic teller 
machine cards with identification numbers pirated from a computer, and a bid to 
defraud the Pennsylvania Lottery of $15.2 million by using a data base of 
unclaimed ticket numbers to produce a fake winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Poor quality control also can make computer systems untrustworthy, the panel 
said. It cited an error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy 
machine that resulted in at least three patient deaths, and the scrambling of 
patient records at one hospital by a rogue program, or virus, that was 
accidentally introduced into its computer system. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, we have been remarkably lucky. . . . As far as we can tell, there has 
been no successful systematic attempt to subvert any of our critical computing 
systems. Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that our luck will soon run 
out," the 16-member panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a gun. Tomorrow's 
terrorist may be able to do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Finding that no existing public or private organization is "positioned 
adequately to address the nation's needs" in computer security, the experts 
called for creation of an Information Security Foundation funded by member 
subscriptions and fees for security evaluation and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two agencies traditionally assigned with overseeing technology 
-- the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security 
Agency -- appears prepared to tackle such a task, the panel said in its 
303-page report entitled "Computers at Risk." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "the market does not work well enough to raise the security of 
computer systems at a rate fast enough to match the apparent growth in threats 
to systems," said the panel, headed by David Clark of Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology in Cambridge.
