Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;J. Minimization. Minimization is the design and operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment systems in order that any incidental release is a de minimis release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;K. Pathogen. A pathogen is any microbiological agent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eukaryotic cell containing sufficient genetic information, which upon expression of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such information, is capable of producing disease in healthy people, plants, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;L. Physical Barrier. A physical barrier is considered any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, facilities, or devices (e.g., fermentors, factories, filters, thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxidizers) which are designed to achieve containment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;M. Release. Release is the discharge of a microbiological agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or eukaryotic cell from a containment system. Discharges can be incidental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental. Incidental releases are de minimis in nature; accidental releases may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de minimis in nature.

Appendix L&hyph;I. General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix L specifies conditions under which certain plants as specified below, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be approved for release into the environment. Experiments in this category cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiment to NIH, review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee, and specific approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the NIH Director. Such experiments also require the approval of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional Biosafety Committee before initiation.

Appendix L&hyph;II. Criteria Allowing Review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee Without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Requirement for Full RAC Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consultation with the RAC Plant Subcommittee and without the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full RAC review (Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary), NIH/ORDA may approve the growing of plants containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recombinant DNA in the field under the following conditions: (i) The plant species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a cultivated crop of a genus that has no species known to be a noxious weed; (ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the introduced DNA consists of well-characterized genes containing no sequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmful to humans, animals, or plants; (iii) the vector consists of DNA from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C), from plants of the same or closely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related species, from nonpathogenic prokaryotes or nonpathogenic lower eukaryotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants, from plants pathogens only if sequences resulting in production of disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms have been deleted, or chimeric vectors constructed from sequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C) or from sequences from plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens in which the disease symptoms have been deleted. The DNA may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced by any suitable method. If sequences resulting in production of disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms are retained for purposes of introducing the DNA into the plant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greenhouse-grown plants must be shown to be free of such sequences before such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants, their derivatives, or seed can be used in field tests; (iv) plants are grown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled access fields under specified conditions appropriate for the plant under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study and the geographical location. Such conditions should include provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using good cultural and pest control practices, for physical isolation from plants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same species outside of the experimental plot in accordance with pollination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of the species, and the prevention of plants containing recombinant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DNA from becoming established in the environment. Review by the Institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biosafety Committee should include an appraisal by scientists knowledgeable of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crop, its production practices, and the local geographical conditions. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for assessing alterations in and the spread of organisms containing recombinant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DNA must be developed. The results of the outlined tests must be submitted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Copies of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results must be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix M. Points to Consider in the Design and Submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Protocols for the Transfer of Recombinant DNA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Molecules Into the Genome of One or More Human Subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix M applies to research conducted at or sponsored by an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives any support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH. Researchers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recombinant DNA is introduced into one or more human subjects with the intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of stably modifying his/her genome are covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III&hyph;B&hyph;3 (see Section V&hyph;U). Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RNA derived from recombinant DNA and that are not covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III&hyph;B&hyph;2, or III&hyph;B&hyph;3 and that are not considered exempt under Section V&hyph;U, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document is intended to provide guidance in preparing proposals for NIH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2. Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 addresses
Major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) contain information determined to require further public review. Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 will be reviewed by the RAC and approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NIH Director. RAC review of experiments considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will follow publication of a precis of the proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for public comment. Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2 addresses Minor Actions involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary, to qualify for the Accelerated Review process. Proposals considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2 will be on a case-by-case basis. A list of actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2 involving the transfer of recombinant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
496&hyph;9838. The list of actions to the NIH Guidelines involving the transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more human subjects does not include experiments considered to be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RAC and NIH/ORDA review under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be confined following transfer to one or more human subjects, no risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to public health or to the environment is expected. Nevertheless, Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;b specifically
asks the researchers to address this point.
