  [Abstract] The environmental and economic tasks of 
industrial enterprise waste water treatment with the help of 
various microorganism strains and the urgency of finding 
off-chromosomal genetic determinants of the biological 
degradation process prompted the screening of plasmid DNA in the 
strains separated from industrial enterprise waste water. To 
this end, Ps. putida, Ps. alcaligenes, B. subtilis 
strains from the collection of the Voodoobrabotka Research 
center are used. The microorganisms were grown a salt medium. 
The study demonstrates that the strains capable of utilizing 
surface active substances contain plasmid DNA yet with respect 
to urea, this property does not correlate with the presence of 
plasmids. It is speculated that it is coded by chromosomal 
genes. The findings open the possibility of developing vector 
molecules for B. subtilis on the basis of the pMA9 
and pMA10 plasmid genomes. A comparison to published data makes 
it possible to note that plasmids DNA participating in the 
biodegradation of ampholytic surfactants are detected in a 
number of Ps. putida strains. The importance of 
separating the direct genes which determine biodegradation of 
syntanol is stressed. Figures 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1
