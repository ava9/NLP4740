Experiments for the first time have reproduced a form of human arthritis in 
genetically altered rats and confirmed a previously established link between a 
gene involved in regulating the immune system and this form of arthritis, 
researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement means researchers now have a reliable animal model to aid 
studies of ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis and 
related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The rats carry the human genes for a tissue type found in many patients with 
these diseases, which are collectively known as spondyloarthropathies. 
</P>
<P>
These forms of arthritis are believed to affect about 200,000 Americans, 
primarily young adults. Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and osteoarthritis, are more common. 
</P>
<P>
The advances, reported by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center in Dallas, may eventually lead to better treatments and 
prevention strategies. Their findings are being published today in the journal 
Cell. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas researchers injected a solution containing DNA fragments of the two 
genes that encode for the tissue type into fertilized one-cell rat eggs. They 
then performed experiments that confirmed that the genes had been incorporated 
into the genetic material of the rats and that the rats produced protein 
molecules encoded by the genes. 
</P>
<P>
Several months after birth, the rats develop symptoms similar to those found in 
the human arthritic diseases, such as arthritis of the spine and large joints, 
and inflammation of the bowel, skin and nails. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very pleased with this remarkable scientific advance," said Dr. 
Lawrence E. Shulman, director of the National Institute of Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which was one of the sponsors of the 
research. "The discovery clearly shows that genetic factors participate 
directly in causing (the diseases)." 
</P>
<P>
Shulman added: "Now they need to find out how these genes act and work to 
produce the arthritic changes, and what, if any, co-factors are involved in 
this process." 
</P>
<P>
The development of an animal model "allows us to examine the development of the 
disease from its very earliest stages," said Dr. Joel D. Taurog, one of the 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
About 7% or 8% of Americans are believed to carry genes for the tissue type 
HLA-B27. This tissue type is also present in the vast majority of individuals 
who develop spondyloarthropathies, an association that was first noted in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers seeking to understand these diseases have been puzzled by the fact 
that only a minority of individuals -- estimates vary from 1% to 20% -- with 
the HLA-B27 tissue type become ill. One theory is that the diseases are 
triggered by exposure to certain types of intestinal bacteria. Another is that 
some individuals with the HLA-B27 tissue type make a protein encoded by the 
genes, and therefore become ill, while others do not make the protein and 
remain well. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings provide strong evidence that the B-27 gene is directly involved 
in causing the disease," Taurog said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Texas researchers and others had previously conducted similar 
experiments in mice, but the animals did not become ill. They now hope to study 
the effects of various drugs on the development of arthritis in the rats and 
try to learn more about the changes in the rats which initiate the development 
of disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTHRITIC DISEASES 
</P>
<P>
 These are major forms of the group of arthritic diseases known as 
spondyloarthropathies. An estimated 7% of Americans have a genetic 
predisposition to developing these diseases, but only a minority of these 
individuals do so. 
</P>
<P>
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: This ailment causes pain and stiffness in the joints of 
the body's trunk, including the back, neck, hips, shoulders and ribs. In severe 
cases, a stiff and inflexible spine can develop, as well as eye, heart and 
other complications. 
</P>
<P>
ARTHRITIS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Some patients with the bowel disorders 
ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease develop arthritis, primarily in the hands 
and feet. 
</P>
<P>
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS: Individuals who have the skin disease psoriasis sometimes 
have an accompanying joint inflammation, especially in the knees and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
REITER'S SYNDROME: A type of arthritis transmitted by sexual contact that is 
the most common cause of arthritis in young men. Features include pain in the 
joints, eye inflammation, skin rash and a penile discharge.
