the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - is revolutionising research in
molecular biology while creating a market that is likely to be worth Dollars
1bn (Pounds 500m) a year by 1996.
Commercialisation of PCR had been delayed by disagreements over the
ownership and rights to license the technology. Now, after several
protracted legal wrangles, it rests securely in the hands of Roche, the
Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group.
PCR is probably the most important development in genetics research since
the discovery of gene-slicing in 1973. It enables geneticists to identify a
particular gene or part of a gene and then make multiple copies at an
exponential rate, so they can obtain enough material for analysis.
Prior to PCR, every time a gene was studied it had to be inserted into
bacteria or other cells - a process called cloning - and then grown in a
culture. Now any gene can be studied without cloning, even if it is present
in quantities that are too small to be detected or analysed directly. Until
now, DNA testing methods have not been sensitive, fast or cheap enough to be
generally useful.
'The potential of PCR boggles the mind,' says Werner Zolg, a Roche PCR
specialist. Applications cover basic research, medical diagnosis,
environmental protection, archaeology and forensic medicine.
It enables scientists to analyse minute traces of genetic material from
diverse sources such as fossilised leaves and frozen mammoths, rape and
murder scenes, and bacteria and viruses. Roche scientists like to describe
PCR as a method by which scientists can 'find a needle in a haystack and
then build a stack of needles'.
Dozens of new experiments using PCR are published in scientific journals
every week. A recent example from Nature is a project to analyse the genetic
diversity and feeding habits of an endangered population of brown bears in
northern Italy by amplifying DNA sequences from their droppings.
But tests to diagnose human diseases are likely to represent the largest
market.
PCR was first made public in 1985 by Cetus, a Californian biotechnology
company. One of its researchers, Kary Mullis, came up with the idea of
exponentially increasing gene pieces. After making sure it worked, he had to
persuade Cetus the project was worth pursuing.
The technique is based on natural enzymes which cut and amplify the genetic
chemical DNA. Initial attempts used an enzyme which broke down when heated.
Since heating is an essential part of the PCR process, more enzyme had to be
added at the end of each of the 30 or so cycles - a labour-intensive
process. Cetus researchers solved the problem by isolating a heat-stable
version of the enzyme from a microbe which thrives in hot water springs.
This was an important advance because it allowed the technique to be
automated.
Cetus then acquired a partner, the US scientific instrument maker Perkin
Elmer, which took responsibility for producing and marketing an automated
PCR machine. It also entered into an agreement with Eastman Kodak to develop
diagnostic systems.
In 1989 Cetus ended this association with Eastman Kodak in favour of another
with Roche, permitting Roche to administer licences for diagnostic uses of
PCR and to prosecute those using the technique without a Perkin Elmer
machine. Eastman Kodak claimed exclusive rights over certain applications
and was worried that a deal with Roche might lead to a conflict of
interests. Negotiations between the two did not lead to an amicable
agreement.
Roche then refused to grant the US chemical group Du Pont a licence to
supply PCR-based diagnostic kits and equipment. In an attempt to break the
monopoly held by Cetus and Roche, Du Pont alleged that Cetus's claim to the
PCR patent was void. It took until March 1991 for Cetus to show that its
patents were valid. The Eastman Kodak dispute was also resolved that year.
Roche eventually paid Cetus Dollars 300m for exclusive rights to its PCR
technology with the possibility of a further Dollars 30m in royalties. Cetus
then merged with Chiron.
Under the agreement, Cetus sold back its 49 per cent holding in Perkin
Elmer, which formed a strategic partnership with Roche and gained rights to
develop systems for non-diagnostic applications. Roche now effectively owns
the entire PCR market.
Since acquiring the full rights to the technology, Roche has liberalised the
draconian licensing regime that had been instituted during the company's
acquisition of Cetus - after some discussion with the scientific community
in the US.
The new worldwide policy 'will provide all laboratories offering human
in-vitro diagnostic testing with the freedom to use PCR for all human
diagnostic testing services', said Agnieszka Junosza-Jankowski, PCR
licensing manager at Roche headquarters in Basle.
'If the licensee makes any improvements or inventions related to PCR, the
licensee has the option to license back these improvements to Roche.' The
royalties payable range from 9 to 18 per cent, depending on the type of
testing service offered.
Outside the field of diagnostic testing, the position is not so clear-cut.
Roche says licences for environmental, food testing, research, forensic and
industrial applications will be handled in the context of the strategic
alliance with Perkin-Elmer.
The strong demand for PCR is inevitably causing delays, as Roche's licensing
department negotiates with dozens of would-be commercial users.
Junosza-Jankowski says the company has already signed agreements with
providers of diagnostic testing services in the US, Japan, Australia,
Switzerland and Spain.
Roche has not yet signed any licensing agreements in the UK. But an
agreement with Cellmark Diagnostics, ICI's genetic testing subsidiary, is
expected shortly.
For most users who want to amplify small amounts of DNA, there is no viable
alternative. Other techniques for copying genes are in development but no
one has come up with anything as simple, wide-ranging and convenient as PCR.
