THE LANGUAGE OF THE GENES by Steve Jones HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 251
pages
IF ALL the people in the world were boiled down into a soup, Steve Jones
tells us, they would just about fill Lake Windermere. The interesting thing
is that the genetic diversity discernible in such a soup would be very
small: all humans are closely related because their evolution is such a
recent event.
Seen through the lens of genetic science, humankind's nature and history
appear fascinating, extraordinary, and sometimes terrifying. The lens is
focused for us by Steve Jones, Professor of Genetics at University College
London. He demonstrated his remarkable gifts as a communicator in the Reith
Lectures of 1991, from which this book stems. In literate and highly
readable style he explains genetics and uses it to take us on a tour of
human existence.
One of Jones's aims is to rescue genetics from its doubtful past, when Nazis
and others sought to pervert it into eugenics. A second aim is to suggest
what can and cannot be expected from genetics, especially in its medical
applications. But his chief aim is to demonstrate genetics in action as an
instrument of self-knowledge, revealing 'an extraordinary picture of what we
are, what we were, and what we may become.'
Jones works at University College's Galton Laboratory, named after the
eccentric polymath Francis Galton, whose interests were amazingly diverse:
they included an attempt to measure the size of African women's buttocks
from a distance by means of 'a sextant and the principles of surveying'.
Galton was the first theorist of human eugenics, whose aim, he announced,
was 'to check the birth rate of the Unfit and to improve the race by
furthering the productivity of the fit.' His ideas, together with those of
Charles Darwin, had a powerful effect on the 19th and 20th centuries, with
appalling consequences as we too well know. But the science of genetics,
Jones says, despite having the shadow of eugenics still lying across it, has
at last come of age.
Genetics is the investigation of how individuals inherit physical and
behavioural traits from their ancestors. Central to this enquiry is the
concept of the gene, the basic unit of heredity. A gene is a packet of
chemical information consisting of DNA. The collection of all such packets
in an individual is called his 'genome'; the data it contains is equivalent
in amount to a billion-page telephone directory. Geneticists are close to
being able to 'read' the entire genome, and when they can they will not only
know which ancestors gave us our coloration, height and other
characteristics, but they will be able to tell us something of our fate also
(for example, what diseases we are prone to suffer).
Jones shows that genetics has already taught us much. After explaining the
nature and functioning of genes, and how our genetic past lingers in our
present, he takes us through an unfolding series of topics, a chapter on
each. They include human evolutionary history; the development of language,
agriculture and urbanisation; the effects of disease; the question of race;
the promise and danger of genetic engineering; and the genetic prospects for
humanity's future. Each is utterly absorbing.
Take the problem of disease, the 'unremitting enemy' as Jones calls it. It
is one of the most potent agents for genetic change. Plagues come - the
Black Death, AIDS - and go when immunity develops; but sometimes at a high
cost, as with sickle-cell anaemia, prevalent among Africans whose red blood
cells mutated to resist malaria. Some diseases had to wait until populations
grew sufficiently large; measles, for example, needs a base of half a
million people to survive. New strains of some diseases periodically migrate
to humans from animals; novel strains of Asiatic flu start with ducks on
Chinese farms and reach people via pigs every few years.
One surprising lesson Jones teaches is that the evolution of agriculture
seems to have been, at best, a mixed blessing. Before it happened people had
a much more diverse diet and lived in healthier places. With agriculture
came private property and taxes. Hunter-gatherers have it easier than
farmers and urbanites; bushmen spend only 15 hours a week getting sustenance
for their families, much less than half the time spent by agricultural and
industrial workers. God's remark to Adam about eating his bread in the sweat
of his brow seems prescient.
Jones performs a useful service in demolishing myths about race. Humans
share 98 per cent of their genes with their closest ape relatives. But all
humans are genetically closer to one another than are, for example,
orangutans living on neighbouring islands. Human differences in eye shape,
hair type and skin pigment are strictly superficial. 'I have always felt a
certain compassion,' Jones drily remarks, 'for those whose ability to
despise their fellow men is limited by the colour of their victim's skin.'
But it is humanity's newly-acquired control over its genetic destiny which
makes us mistrust the future. Scientists dislike prognostication, but Jones
bravely asks: how will our genetic destiny be affected by our increased
knowledge, our younger reproductive ages, our dramatically increased
'outbreeding' or population mixing, our ageing populations, our pollution
problems, and much besides? As you would expect, his answers are both
fascinating and startling.
