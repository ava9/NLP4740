might bring; (C) has required the recipient to (1) establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the record, (2) remove or destroy the information that identifies
the individual at the earliest time at which removal or destruction can be accomplished consistent with the purpose
of the research project, unless the recipient has presented adequate justification of a research or health nature
for retaining such information, and (3) make no further use or disclosure of the record except (a) in emergency circumstances
affecting the health or safety of any individual, (b) for use in another research project, under these same conditions,
and with written authorization of the Department, (c) for disclosure to a properly identified person for the purpose
of an audit related to the research project, if information that would enable research subjects to be identified is
removed or destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the purpose of the audit, or (d) when required by
