<F P=106> [Speech by UK Science Minister William Waldegrave on 11 </F>
February 94, place not given: "Withdrawal of Gene Patents Good 
For the UK"] 
  [Text] The withdrawal of patents for cDNA sequences for 
unknown functions will encourage further research into this 
important area, separating the exploratory research phase from 
the exploration phase, Mr Waldegrave said today. 
  He was speaking following today's decision by the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) and the US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) to withdraw their patent applications for cDNA sequences 
of unknown function, filed in 1991. 
<H5>  Mr Waldegrave said: </H5>
  "The MRC and NIH patent applications were filed in order to 
protect the interests of the UK and US taxpayers, with least 
damage to the international research effort in genome mapping 
which requires the free flow of information. 
  "However, The Medical Research Council, with the support of 
the Government, has always argued that these applications should 
not be granted. I welcome the co-operation between the UK and 
the US on this important issue and look forward to further 
developments in this important area of research." 
  This announcement backs up MRC's decision in October 1993 
not 
to file any further patent application on newly-obtained cDNA 
sequences of unknown function unless accompanied by knowledge of 
the gene function. 
<H5>  Sir Dai Rees, Secretary to the MRC said: </H5>
  "We feel this withdrawal of the patents is a correct step, 
and we are delighted to be able to co-ordinate our actions with 
those of the NIH."
