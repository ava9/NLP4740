The single gene that makes an embryo turn into a boy rather than a girl has
been identified conclusively.
In this week's Nature, scientists from the National Institute for Medical
Research and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund publish the proof that SRY
(which stands for Sex-determining Region on the Y chromosome) - one of
100,000 human genes - is the male gene.
They created a male mouse simply by injecting Sry genes (the murine version
of SRY) into a female embryo. The animal grew up with normal male sex organs
and mated with female mice, although he was infertile.
The British scientists said last July they were nearly certain that SRY was
the male gene, after studying those rare individuals whose 'biological' sex
was different from their 'genetic' sex. They found that SRY was missing from
women who had a Y (male) chromosome; in men who had no Y chromosome SRY was
transposed to another chromosome.
The experiment reported this week is a milestone in academic genetics - not
a recipe for producing boy babies. The scientists say that it would not only
be illegal and unethical to do human genetic engineering in this way but
also completely impractical.
The technique of injecting genes into a newly fertilised egg is not
reliable. Only three of 11 female mouse embryos with Sry genes actually
developed as males; the others stayed female because Sry ended up on
chromosomes where it could not work properly. And even when it does work,
the male is infertile because he still has two X (female) chromosomes and
sperm cannot survive in mammals with two X chromosomes.
The challenge now is to find out what switches SRY on in a embryo 10 to 12
days after conception - the period when sex is determined - and to discover
how it in turn regulates the 'cascade' of other genes which control the
development of male features.
