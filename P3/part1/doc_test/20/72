Gene therapy in the UK received approval last week from a government
committee chaired by Sir Cecil Clothier, a distinguished lawyer.
The procedure, pioneered in the US, involves correcting genetic defects by
adding new genes to the cells where they are needed. It is expected to be a
more effective and longer-lasting treatment than conventional drugs which
merely alleviate some of the symptoms.
Several research groups in the UK are preparing trials of gene therapy for
diseases including cancer and thalassaemia (a severe blood disorder) as well
as cystic fibrosis. Most patients are likely to be children.
The first gene therapy patient was a four-year-old American girl suffering
from a rare inherited disorder of the immune system. The treatment in
September 1990 has brought about a dramatic improvement in her condition.
Since then, half a dozen other gene therapy studies have started in the US.
The treatment approved by the Clothier committee is 'somatic gene therapy'.
It corrects the defect by adding new genes to certain cells - for example in
the lungs or bone marrow - but the genetic change is not passed on to the
patient's offspring.
The committee decided that on moral and ethical grounds this type of gene
therapy is not fundamentally different from other advanced medical
procedures such as organ transplants or blood transfusion.
In contrast 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future generations,
is generally regarded today as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It is unlikely to be approved anywhere in the world, at least
for a few years.
A procedure equivalent to germ line therapy is now used to make 'transgenic'
animals - for example sheep which produce valuable human proteins in their
milk - by inserting genes into newly fertilised embryos. But, as the
Clothier report points out, 'little is known about the possible consequences
and hazards (of human germ line therapy) and any harm to future generations
would take a long time to discover and deal with.'
Even somatic gene therapy has possible dangers, but these would only affect
the individual patient. The present technology, which uses disabled viruses
to carry new genes into human cells, inserts the DNA almost at random. There
is therefore a risk that it could cause a new mutation by disrupting some
other gene or its means of control - possibly even switching on a dormant
cancer-causing gene.
However, in comparison with the severity of the inherited diseases they are
intended to treat, the risks of gene therapy are generally thought to be
acceptable. After publishing the Clothier report, the Department of Health
said there would be a four-month consultation period before the government
decides on permanent arrangements for regulating gene therapy. Any proposals
for UK gene therapy trials made before then will be considered by Sir
Cecil's Committee on the Ethics of Gene Therapy.
