Life does not have to end at 85, or 100, or even 120. So says a small but elite 
group of researchers exploring the possibility of increasing our life span. 
</P>
<P>
"Aging is no longer regarded as a monolith; an unmovable frontier," says USC 
biologist Caleb E. Finch. Finch believes in using common good-health practices 
like eating right and exercising to control our environment and exploit the 
"plasticity" of life span. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably, with existing technology, don't have to invent anything new to 
get to the heart of biological aging," he says. "I'm highly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rose of UC Irvine suggests the key to longer life lies in evolution and 
is studying a link between delayed reproduction and increased longevity in 
fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all the basic science to postpone human aging right now," he says. 
"And I have a plan for doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The two researchers are old friends and colleagues who take very different 
approaches to the problem but reach the same conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy is not capped by some unyielding force. 
</P>
<P>
Their beliefs ignore the traditional consensus among researchers that life 
expectancy is controlled by an inevitable breakdown of body processes. In a 
recent article in Science magazine, scientists suggest that natural 
degeneration caps our life span at about 85 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no one knows how to dramatically increase how long we can live. But in 
recent years, scientists have moved away from believing that aging is the 
result of a single gene that goes awry late in life. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they believe theories that suggest aging is the result of many 
processes, linked to genes and the environment, working to wear down the body. 
These newer theories raise the possibility of intervening to stop the chain of 
events that cause aging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now a question of whether people want to (pursue) this," Rose says. 
</P>
<P>
Finch and Rose have produced some of the most powerful evidence of the 
potential to extend the life span. And each has a new book that makes a strong 
case for going after the fountain of youth. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, an evolutionary biologist, is the leading proponent of a theory of aging 
based on evolution. 
</P>
<P>
With a youthful face and punk hair, Rose looks as if he would be more at home 
on MTV than on the seventh floor of the UCI Engineering Building. But he has 
turned many skeptics into supporters in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his book, "Evolutionary Biology of Aging" (1991, Oxford 
University Press), "is to argue that aging can now be regarded as a problem 
that is well on its way toward a scientific solution." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are more interested than ever in the longevity question because of 
recent success by Rose and others with experiments that have shown the life 
span can be extended in lab animals. 
</P>
<P>
In experiments on fruit flies, worms and mice, it's "very easy for us to . . . 
postpone aging so that life span can be doubled or the pattern of deterioration 
with aging can be vastly slower," Rose says. 
</P>
<P>
The experiments focus on finding which genes are important to the aging process 
in order to manipulate them. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, for instance, is studying whether aging can be influenced by manipulating 
the process of natural selection -- the force of nature that favors the young 
(who can reproduce) far more than the old. 
</P>
<P>
Rose says his studies show that the age at which a species reaches maturity -- 
and is able to reproduce -- is linked to the onset of aging. That means that 
the way to keep natural selection working later in life is to postpone 
reproduction until a relatively advanced age. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, Rose has bred fruit flies at later and later ages -- 
increasing their life span by 80%. He is selecting as parents only older flies 
that can pass on longevity genes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have delayed reproduction and increased life span in other species, 
and are now trying to understand why the process works. They want to know which 
genes that affect life span are inherited or eliminated by postponing 
reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
For the fruit fly, Rose has shown that at least 100 genes may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the research will contribute little to the understanding of human aging, 
Rose says, unless the same experiments can be tried on mammals, such as mice. 
That is where his "plan" for expanding life span comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can use a mouse to postpone aging, than we will begin to find out how to 
do that in man," he says. Ten years of work on mice, he suggests, could 
probably reveal the genes, processes and cell biology involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we can try out direct interventions to postpone aging," he says, first on 
mice, then on humans. 
</P>
<P>
Finch also believes that plenty of evidence challenges the assumption that our 
life span has a limit. But he believes that study of common health practices -- 
such as exercising and hormone treatments to reduce the risk of osteoporosis -- 
will contribute significantly to the understanding of aging. 
</P>
<P>
A professor of gerontology, Finch is a tall, thin Northeasterner who likes to 
joke about the way aging has left him balding. But beneath the congeniality is 
the kind of dedicated, no-nonsense scientist who would turn out a 842-page book 
called "Longevity, Senescence, and the Genome," (1991, the University of 
Chicago Press). The title refers to the study of aging and the role of genes in 
that process. 
</P>
<P>
Also an expert on Alzheimer's disease, Finch says the potential to thwart 
disease and disability in old age is the force behind the research to extend 
our life span. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason money is being put into research is in the belief . . . that we'll 
be able to define, treat and prevent many disabilities of aging by medical 
practice," Finch says. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of people living beyond 80 is increasing and this has enormous 
implications for health programs and society in general. We can't not do it." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Finch has catalogued a lot of examples that show certain species 
have manipulated their environment to live longer. He calls this the 
"plasticity" of life span. 
</P>
<P>
Finch said he sees no biological limits that predict a maximum life span in any 
species. However, he says, manipulating genes can affect how long we can live. 
"It's a matter of programming genes in different sets of ways." 
</P>
<P>
For example, although queen bees and worker bees have the same genetic 
structure, queens live from five to 15 years while workers are lucky to live 
out a year. The difference, Finch says, is in their environment. Workers wear 
out from flying around while queens are pampered. 
</P>
<P>
Some species apparently don't age, Finch says. Scientists are studying a 
species of rock fish that are 100 years old and show no signs of aging, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Under some circumstances, aging may not occur in the natural world," he says. 
"There are a lot of species of fish and other invertebrates that don't seem to 
have an increased risk of disease or death." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Finch suggests that people who are careful about their diet 
and exercise might live longer and healthier -- and contribute to the 
advancement of science. After all, research showed that rats who receive 
special diets and hormone supplements live longer. 
</P>
<P>
All of this means that such "interventions" can work in humans, Finch says. 
"Enough is now known to believe that (diseases of old age) are . . . not 
inevitable."

Drawing, The Aging Process -- Aging involves more than gray hair and wrinkles. 
Aging involves a breakdown of several systems within the body that alter the 
cells' ability to function. When enough cells are altered, death results. But 
scientists hope that these changes can be corrected or avoided so that life 
expectancy can be expanded.; PAUL GONZALES / Los Angeles Times ; Chart, Trend
