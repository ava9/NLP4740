Genetically engineered cells were injected into a human patient for the first 
time Monday, in a federally approved experiment designed to enhance an already 
novel cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
This first round of gene transfer experiments, in which a gene was inserted 
into a patient's white blood cells, is not expected to directly benefit an 
individual patient. Instead, the inserted gene is being used to track the 
movement in the body of the cancer-fighting white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the technique of "gene insertion (could) produce therapeutic 
results in a wide range of diseases," National Institutes of Health Director 
James B. Wyngaarden said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's experiment was designed to track special, laboratory-grown white blood 
cells known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The TILs in turn attack 
the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Using gene transfer technology developed by W. French Anderson of the National 
Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute's R. Michael 
Blaese, the NIH team inserted into the TIL cells a bacterial gene that 
inactivates the drug neomycin. This will allow them to track the cells in the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
The bacterial gene acts as a marker for the affected cells, giving them the 
ability to resist a version of neomycin, called G418, that poisons human cells. 
The researchers can then routinely take blood samples and biopsies from the 
patients and either treat the white blood cells with G418 to kill all but the 
genetically changed TIL cells or probe the DNA of white blood cells to find the 
genetic marker. 
</P>
<P>
Inserting human genes to repair defects may one day help with a host of 
inherited disorders, including cystic fibrosis or Duchenne's muscular 
dystrophy. Gene insertion might also help brain disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease or other illnesses, such as growth disorders, heart disease caused by 
alterations in the way cholesterol is metabolized and defects of the immune 
system.
