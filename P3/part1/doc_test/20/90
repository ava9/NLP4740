The amended version of Section V&hyph;U reads as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V&hyph;U. Human studies in which the induction or enhancement of an immune response to a vector-encoded microbial
immunogen is the major goal, such an immune response has been demonstrated in model systems, and the persistence of
the vector-encoded immunogen is not expected, are not covered under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2,
or III&hyph;B&hyph;3. Such studies may be initiated without RAC review and NIH approval if approved by another Federal
agency.''

The following new footnote, V&hyph;W is added to Section V: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V&hyph;W. In accordance with accepted scientific and regulatory practices of the discipline of plant pathology,
an exotic plant pathogen (e.g., virus, bacteria, or fungus) is one that is unknown to occur within the U.S. (see Section
V&hyph;R). Determination of whether a pathogen has a potential for serious detrimental impact on managed (agricultural,
forest, grassland) or natural ecosystems should be made by the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Biosafety
Committee, in consultation with scientists knowledgeable of plant diseases, crops, and ecosystems in the geographic
area of the research.

The amended version of Appendix C&hyph;I reads as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix C&hyph;I. Recombinant DNA in Tissue Culture
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recombinant DNA molecules containing less than one-half of any eukaryotic viral genome (all viruses from a single
family (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;D) being considered identical (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;E), that are
propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture are exempt from these NIH Guidelines with the exceptions listed
in Appendix C&hyph;I&hyph;A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) Experiments described in Section III&hyph;A
which require specific RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (ii)
experiments described in Section III&hyph;B which require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
before initiation, (iii) experiments involving DNA from Class 3, 4, or 5 organisms (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;A)
or cells known to be infected with these agents, (iv) experiments involving the deliberate introduction of genes
coding for the biosynthesis of molecules that are toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F), and (v) whole plants regenerated
from plant cells and tissue cultures are covered by the exemption provided they remain axenic cultures even though
they differentiate into embryonic tissue and regenerate into plantlets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix G through G&hyph;I is amended to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix G specifies physical containment for standard laboratory experiments and defines Biosafety Level 1 through
Biosafety Level 4. For large scale (over 10 liters) research or production, Appendix K supersedes Appendix G. Appendix
K defines Good Large Scale Practice through Biosafety Level 3_Large Scale. For certain work with plants, Appendix
P supersedes Appendix G. Appendix P defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Plants. For certain work with animals, Appendix
Q supersedes Appendix G. Appendix Q defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Animals.
