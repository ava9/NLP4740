PHS invites interested parties to submit comments on the proposed internal and routine uses on or before May 13, 1994.
PHS has sent a report of a New System to the Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on March 30, 1994.
This system of records will be effective 40 days from the date of publication unless PHS receives comments on the routine
uses which would result in a contrary determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to establish a new system of records: 09&hyph;25&hyph;0172, ``Clinical
Research: National Center for Human Genome Research, HHS/NIH/NCHGR.'' Established as of October 1, 1989, the National
Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) is the focal point within the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services
for the development of research policy and long-range planning for the NIH component of the Human Genome Project.
NCHGR's Division of Extramural Research funds research in laboratories throughout the country in chromosome mapping,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, database development, technology development, and studies of the ethical,
legal, and social implications of genetics research. NCHGR's newly established Division of Intramural Research
plans to focus on technologies for finding disease genes, developing DNA diagnostics and gene therapies. The Division
will serve as a hub for NIH-wide human genetics research and enhance the work of investigators in other Institutes
who are searching for specific genes and studying their function in health and disease. This system of records will
be used by NIH to support clinical research aimed at understanding the genetic basis of human disease, its diagnosis
and treatment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The system will comprise records that contain information identifying participants (such as name, address, Social
Security number), medical records (including psychosocial evaluations), progress reports, correspondence,
epidemiological data, research findings, and records on biological specimens, (e.g., blood, urine, and genetic
materials). Provision of the Social Security number is voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purpose
of the system. The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use.
NIH and contractor staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act Regulations.
The System Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of
such information will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees, and contractors
responsible for implementing the clinical research. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biological
specimens will have access to the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals
with records in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records will be stored in file folders, computer tapes, computer diskettes, microfiche, and file cards. Manual and
computerized records will be maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45&hyph;13 of the HHS General
Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf:
45&hyph;13, the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data stored in computers will be accessed through the use of keywords known only to authorized users. Rooms where records
are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked but are controlled by on-site
personnel. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard measures are employed.
