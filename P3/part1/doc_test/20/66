The RAC will not at present entertain proposals for germ-line alterations but will consider for approval protocols
involving somatic cell gene transfer. The purpose of somatic cell gene therapy is to treat an individual patient,
e.g., by inserting a properly functioning gene into a patient's somatic cells. In germ-line alterations, a specific
attempt is made to introduce genetic changes into the germ (reproductive) cells of an individual, with the aim of changing
the set of genes passed on to the individual's offspring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acceptability of human somatic cell gene therapy has been addressed in several public documents as well as in numerous
academic studies. In November 1982, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and
Biomedical and Behavioral Research published a report, Splicing Life, which resulted from a two-year process of
public deliberations and hearing. Upon release of that report, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee held
three days of public hearings with witnesses from a wide range of fields from the biomedical and social sciences to
theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984, the Office of Technology Assessment released a background paper,
Human Gene Therapy, which concluded: civic, religious, scientific, and medical groups have all accepted, in principle,
the appropriateness of gene therapy of somatic cells in humans for specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell gene therapy
is seen as an extension of present methods of therapy that might be preferable to other technologies. In light of this
public support, the RAC is prepared to consider proposals for somatic cell gene therapy.

In its evaluation of proposals involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA
into one or more human subjects, the RAC will consider whether the design of such experiments offers adequate assurance
that their consequences will not go beyond their purpose, which is the same as the traditional purpose of clinical
investigations, namely, to protect the health and well-being of one or more human subjects being treated while at
the same time gathering generalizable knowledge. Two possible undesirable consequences of the transfer of recombinant
DNA would be unintentional: (i) vertical transmission of genetic changes from an individual to his/her offspring,
or (ii) horizontal transmission of viral infection to other persons with whom the individual comes in contact. Accordingly,
this document requests information that will enable the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA to assess the possibility that the proposed
experiments will inadvertently affect reproductive cells or lead to infection of other people (e.g., medical personnel
or relatives). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the social concern that surrounds the subject of gene transfer, the RAC and NIH/ORDA will cooperate
with other groups in assessing the possible long-term consequences of the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA
derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects and related laboratory and animal experiments in order
to define appropriate human applications of this emerging technology.

Responses to Appendix M should be provided in the form of either written answers or references to specific sections
of the protocol or its appendices. Principal Investigators should indicate points which are not applicable with
a brief explanation. Principal Investigators submitting proposals that employ essentially the same vector systems
(or with minor variations), and/or that are based on the same preclinical testing as proposals previously reviewed
by the RAC, may refer to preceding documents without having to rewrite such material.

For research in which recombinant DNA is transferred in order to treat a disease or disorder (e.g., genetic diseases,
cancer, and metabolic diseases), the following questions should be addressed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a. Why is the disease selected for treatment by means of gene therapy a good
candidate for such treatment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;b. Describe the natural history and range of expression of the disease selected
for treatment. What objective and/or quantitative measures of disease activity are available? In your view, are
the usual effects of the disease predictable enough to allow for meaningful assessment of the results of gene therapy?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;c. Is the protocol designed to prevent all manifestations of the disease,
to halt the progression of the disease after symptoms have begun to appear, or to reverse manifestations of the disease
in seriously ill victims? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;d. What alternative therapies exist? In what groups of patients are these
therapies effective? What are their relative advantages and disadvantages as compared with the proposed gene therapy?
