FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Threats posed by the patenting of genes

Sir, You correctly state in your editorial: 'Don't patent human genes'
(April 24). The current mess over patents with no proof of gene function is
extremely dangerous. We sympathise with the position that the Medical
Research Council has been forced to take and note that it is easy for other
countries to take the moral high ground when they have not yet done any
scientific work in this area.
It is, however, our observation that this is a dispute that has occurred too
soon in the genome project: it will generate heat but little light on a
critical area for industry. Such National Institutes of Health or MRC
patents, even if granted (possible in the US, very unlikely in Europe), are
not likely to protect subsequent inventions. Attempts to claim anything but
token royalties and fees will certainly result in the NIH being sued by
major US drug companies.
CEST's real worry is that these issues are hampering industrial investment
in genome research. This is the subject of a CEST lead project involving EC,
MRC and European industry.
The dispute may also stir up further 'green' political pressure. By 2000,
this could result in a Europe devoid of a significant biotechnology industry
and dependent for advanced healthcare products on the US.
Genome technologies offer the first real hope of tackling the diseases of
old age, like cancer and arthritis, that will be endemic in the greying
Europe of 2010. That is the real tragedy of this unfortunate international
protectionism by the US government. James Watson is to be applauded as one
of the few Americans to speak out against this policy.
