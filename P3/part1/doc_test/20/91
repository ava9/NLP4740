Debate focuses on how best to develop drugs

The conventional wisdom on biotechnology - at least the one propagated by
the biotechnology industry - is that the technology will provide the next
generation of blockbuster drugs. Not all pharmaceuticals groups' research
directors are convinced.
'There is a bright future for biotechnology, but not as bright as you might
think,' says Dr Pierre Simon, director of Elf Sanofi, the French
pharmaceuticals group. 'If you look at what the industry was promising 10
years ago, it's a long way behind.'
Dr Simon, who says his company does not intend any more close links with
biotech boutiques, says: 'It's clear that in the future some clear progress
will be made in medicine through biotechnology. But biotechnology compounds
are often too big and fragile. The drugs developed through biotechnology are
so huge that they often have to be rejected - they won't cross the
blood/brain barrier. They have to be developed to be injected. The most
successful compounds are once a day oral drugs - with these drugs there's no
chance of developing them for that.'
In any case, argues Dr Simon, the pharmaceuticals industry is making rapid
progress in the field of drug design and, using computers, can screen as
many chemicals in a day as it used to be able to test in a year.
'Why produce drugs through biotechnology, when you can make the compounds
through classical chemistry?' he asks. 'For the next few years we will try
to mimic the products of biotechnology through classical chemistry. Through
biotechnology you can identify a receptor, then the chemists can find
cheaper, simpler alternatives to the biotech drug.'
Although Dr Simon's non-conformist views are shared by many research chiefs
in Japan, few in the western world subscribe to his views, at least in
public. Many disagree.
Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery
research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making
better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time most
genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the
molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.'
X:'Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the
cell are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons,' says Sir
Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group.
'The basic biology of cellular Mechanisms is becoming more and more
understood. That biological understanding is coming mainly from outside the
company, from university collaborations and small biotechnology start-ups.'
However, he adds: 'Medicinal chemistry will still have an important role to
play 10 years from now.'
But in spite of the opportunities offered by biotechnology, considerable
divergences remain among research directors and their chief executives over
how best to access the new science.
A few groups, such as Roche of Switzerland and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the
Franco-American company, have acquired substantial stakes in biotechnology
groups. Roche spent Dollars 2.1bn in 1990 on a majority stake in Genentech,
while RPR acquired a 37 per cent per cent Dollars 113m stake last June in
Applied Immune Systems, to gain access to its cell therapy technology.
Most recently Corange signed two large deals, acquiring stakes in Protein
Design Labs for Dollars 206m and CellPro for Dollars 220m. Meanwhile,
Wellcome linked up with Centocor in an alliance potentially worth Dollars
100m, and SmithKline Beecham invested Dollars 125m in Human Genome Sciences.
Others have set up a portfolio of small stakes or alliances in particular
therapeutic areas, or even individual projects. The balance of bargaining
between drugs groups and biotechnology companies has shifted markedly over
the past 12 months. The collapse in the share prices of Synergen and
Centocor after the US Food and Drug Administration turned down their
products frightened many investors who had not realised the risks involved
in biotechnology.
The harshening healthcare environment has made initial public offerings more
difficult for the biotechnology boutiques. In particular, the provision in
President Bill Clinton's proposed healthcare reforms to control the price of
new drugs has hit the biotechnology sector hard, says Bill Steere, chairman
and chief executive of Pfizer of the US, and outgoing chairman of the US
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
'Often a biotech company is based on the development of a single product.
When it comes to the market, that product not only has to pay past research
expenses but also generate enough income for the future. The biotech groups
are risky enough anyway. If we end up with price controls, then private
investors are naturally reluctant to make that investment,' says Mr Steere.
Some pharmaceuticals groups believe they can create innovative biotechnology
groups internally. Their research directors are clearly irked by the
propaganda pushed by some biotechnology companies that the drugs companies
are lumbering giants incapable of harnessing the revolution proffered by
biotechnology. 'We've built one of the best biotech groups in the industry,'
says Dr Scott at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
This, he hastens to add, does not mean the company is not looking at forming
alliances with biotech groups or even buying them out, but it does provide a
level of expertise that allows him to make good calls when negotiating with
the boutiques.
