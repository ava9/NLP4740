  [Text] President Guillermo Endara is not opposed to the 
return of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's former civilian and 
military collaborators who left the country in 1990, but he 
added that they must settle pending court matters if they return. 
  Endara said: "As far as I am concerned, all Panamanians who 
left -- from former Government and Justice Minister Rodolfo 
"Popito" Chiari on down -- may return, but, if they have any 
problems with the Judicial Branch or the Attorney General's 
Office, I will not get involved in that." 
  Following Noriega's ouster, his main collaborators abandoned 
the country, and since then, some have expressed a desire to 
return, but they must face charges linked to freedom of speech 
violations, embezzlement, and even murder. 
  The president argued: "They are not in exile because of me," 
which is very different from what the former military government 
did when it exiled many of its opponents. 
  "I sympathize with all Panamanians in exile, because I was 
once forced to leave the country. As far as I am concerned, 
they can return, but if they have any cases pending with the 
Judicial Branch, I will not get involved in that," he added. 
  Those in exile include Chiari, who is accused of freedom of 
speech violations; banker Rafael Arosemena, accused of 
embezzling $6.7 million from the National Bank of Panama; and 
various military officers accused of murder and various crimes 
against the state. 
  The Democratic Revolutionary Party has said most people 
still 
in exile are being persecuted by the Endara administration. 
  Endara denies this, however, by saying, "I have sent no one 
into exile," as was done by the dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
who was sentenced to 40 years in the United States for drug 
trafficking.
