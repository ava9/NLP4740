U.S. MUST HELP PANAMA'S RECOVERY, ENDARA WARNS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Guillermo Endara warned Tuesday that if the United States fails to 
provide sufficient economic aid for his government, all of the effort put into 
deposing dictator Manuel A. Noriega will have been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"People will probably seek solutions outside the democratic process; they will 
think that Noriega's times were better times," he told senior editors and 
correspondents of The Times in an hourlong interview. 
</P>
<P>
"All our efforts will be lost . . . all will be shattered," including the gains 
made from the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion, Endara cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "for us, the United States' reaction is slow, very slow," Endara 
said he plans to make a personal appeal to President Bush in Washington before 
Bush's State of the Union address Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government is seeking $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to help it 
recover not only from the damage of the invasion but also from the economic 
wreckage left by the two-year American effort to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"If things do not start to happen within two or three months, the people will 
start getting mad and disillusioned with democracy and the U.S.," Endara said. 
He said he believes that "in as soon as a year, they will see a very different 
situation than there is right now -- probably worse than Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Panama's economic problems, Endara said he is still trying to develop a 
policy that will purge the government of vestiges of the Dignity Battalions, 
paramilitary units that Noriega used to intimidate political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged political and security risks in creating a new military 
composed mostly of remnants of Noriega's 16,000-member Panama Defense Forces -- 
led by officers "who were not angels." 
</P>
<P>
But in an evident effort to play on American sensitivity about the prospect of 
a resurgent leftist movement that might jeopardize American influence over the 
Panama Canal, he stressed that the principal threat to his new government comes 
not from the old military but from the now-dormant left. 
</P>
<P>
"They would gain a lot of power and popularity if things don't start to 
happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The usually good-natured former lawyer was somber as he told his audience that 
"things are so bad, so explosive . . . that all that the United States has done 
-- its big effort, all our efforts -- will be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Although Endara acknowledged that his country has some responsibility for 
rebuilding its economy, his bleak warnings were aimed clearly at Washington. 
"This help has to come mostly from the United States," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a small but comfortable office in the Presidencia, a government 
building just renovated after its use as a barracks by American troops, Endara 
outlined a recovery package that included $40 million to rebuild El Chorrillo, 
a slum neighborhood severely damaged by the American attack, and a $200-million 
public works program to combat widespread unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Panama will need $700 million program in grants and loans 
channeled through private banks to businesses for the repair and restocking of 
stores victimized by the widespread looting and destruction that followed the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said he has not yet stressed his concern to the White House; his last 
conversation with Bush was Dec. 21, the day after the invasion. But he said 
that visiting U.S. congressmen have encouraged him to seek immediate action on 
the aid request, warning that "American memories are very short." 
</P>
<P>
He said they reminded him that some other world crisis will develop and "people 
will forget what is happening in Panama and what the needs of Panama are." 
</P>
<P>
Endara, first laughing and then turning serious when asked about the extent of 
American influence over his government, said, "I'm not a puppet of the United 
States, and I think the Panamanian people know that." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that other nations in the region have questioned the legitimacy 
of his U.S.-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with the people of Panama," he said. "I guess my 
problem is with the people of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
While repeating that "the United States has been very respectful of our 
independence," Endara went on to acknowledge that the very existence of his 
government is the result of the American invasion and occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Panamanian people have come to the conclusion that without U.S. help, we 
could never have gotten rid of Noriega," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Endara volunteered that he originally believed Panamanians could have 
"autonomously" ousted the dictator. But he said new indications of the extent 
of Noriega's power had persuaded him that "we could not have possibly gotten 
rid of Noriega alone." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success in toppling the head of the regime, Endara said government 
ministries remain infected by Dignity Battalion members still holding key 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably have not thrown everybody out," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Juan Chevalier, minister of commerce and industry, 
said his staff had confronted dozens of Dignity Battalion members after finding 
a computerized list showing his department riddled with more than 100 such 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
As the Noriega loyalists were called in, most would insist that "they did 
nothing," he said -- "until you present them with the photograph of the AK-47 
in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
He described scenes in which men who had once terrorized their colleagues 
pleaded tearfully in hopes of salvaging their reputations, if not their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had participated in the interrogations, Chevalier, who had been 
imprisoned by Noriega, replied: "By all means. You think I was going to miss 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Endara said he is satisfied that the process of rooting out the Dignity 
Battalion members is going well, although he expressed some concern about 
overzealous pursuit of suspected Noriega supporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said he knows of "two or three cases where injustice has been done" but 
added that the wrongs have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Endara defended his government's policy of creating a new 
Panamanian Public Force almost entirely from former officers and soldiers of 
the PDF. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government had denied the thousands of trained soldiers a 
place in the new military, "they would certainly have formed the backbone of a 
new armed resistance." 
</P>
<P>
All top-level PDF officers "have been thrown out" of the armed forces, he said. 
And, although the past records of those now given command are far from 
spotless, "we have to work with somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Although other senior government members have urged that the new security force 
be limited to about 3,500 men restricted largely to police work, Endara said in 
the interview that he expects its final size to reach about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
This force, although smaller than Noriega's PDF, would still include as many as 
four combat units of professional soldiers performing traditional military 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
The president expressed confidence that tight fiscal control could go far 
toward blocking any attempt by the new security force to reclaim the powers 
held by the PDF. He said he also plans to fragment its structure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to divide them," Endara said. He said he planned to establish 
separate units for immigration, criminal investigation and presidential 
security, duties previously kept under central military control. 
</P>
<P>
Endara also expressed confidence that another reputed hallmark of the Noriega 
regime -- the use of Panama by narcotics traffickers for money laundering -- 
will be eliminated by his government. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to play any role in narco-traffic or the laundering of 
narco-dollars," he said. But he indicated he sees no need to eliminate current 
bank regulations that permit accounts to remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he touched on the problems of the military and drugs, the president was 
clearly determined to send a message to the Bush Administration about the need 
for immediate economic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope that the United States will help us now get over the problems we 
have," he said in concluding the interview, "because if the United States 
doesn't help us, all our efforts will go down the drain."
