</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navy Lt. Pete Pedrozo squealed his jeep to a dusty halt and strode into what 
serves for a jail these days in this small provincial town. With pistol 
strapped firmly to his side, the judge had come. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind bars had reportedly stabbed his wife in a drunken rage. But the 
acting local magistrate, a schoolteacher, had refused to rule on the case for 
fear that any decision might invite bloody retribution. 
</P>
<P>
And so judgment was left to Pedrozo, whose new judicial circuit covers more 
than 200 square miles on the west bank of the Panama Canal. The Navy lieutenant 
deliberated, and he ruled: Jose Arauz would be bound over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation in which violence and political fragility in the aftermath of the 
American invasion have posed severe tests on those attempting to rebuild the 
judicial system, Pedrozo and others who represent the temporary U.S. solution 
see themselves in the role of Wild West magistrates such as Judge Roy Bean, who 
rode a circuit to enforce the law when no one else would. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frontier justice," said Marine Corps Capt. Barry Cronin, the military 
governor, in effect, of the region in which Pedrozo acts as chief judge. "But 
it's a start." 
</P>
<P>
The circuit-riding scheme is part of a larger U.S. military effort to impose a 
semblance of order on Panama while working gradually to restore full power to 
civilian authorities. For now, while lightly armed Panamanian police join U.S. 
machine-gunners on joint patrols and night courts have begun to take on 
misdemeanor cases, the establishment of a full-scale Panamanian legal system 
seems unlikely to occur very soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a tall order for them," Army Gen. Joseph Kinzer, the incoming 
deputy commander of U.S. Army South, said in an interview. "What occurred in 
the whole operation was that you just neutralized the whole infrastructure. 
There isn't much left to grab hold of." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, crime ran rampant in many parts of Panama in the first days after the 
Dec. 20 invasion. Even after the looting stopped, the American soldiers 
guarding the streets gave top priority to pursuing suspected members of the 
Panama Defense Forces, and for more than a week paid scant attention to the 
slew of reported robberies and other street crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of progress since has varied, with the familiar trappings of justice 
most visible in the capital, whose return to normalcy was given top priority by 
the United States. Members of the newly constituted Panamanian police work 
closely with U.S. military police, while some Panamanian courts have begun to 
hear minor cases on their own. In a further step, chief prosecutor Rogelio Cruz 
said last week that he had issued formal criminal complaints against more than 
50 former associates of ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But in the zone of Arraijan, on the far side of the canal from the metropolis, 
the visage of justice more often bears smears of camouflage paint, and its 
bearing remains unmistakably that of the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
It is Marines, not MPs, who patrol the region, peering coolly from their jeeps 
and trucks through Vuarnet sunglasses. Although they are joined by members of 
the newly renamed Panamanian Public Force, that group's near-universal PDF 
heritage breeds wariness among the populace and relegates its members to a 
secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
And it is Lt. Pedrozo, and not temporary magistrates like Juana de Gonzales, 
who decides at least the immediate fate of suspected criminals like Arauz, the 
accused wife-stabber. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, a middle-aged woman who before the U.S. invasion worked for 29 years 
as an elementary schoolteacher and now is filling in for a Noriega-era judge 
who fled and another who has been jailed, said she simply felt uncomfortable 
deciding a case as grave as a stabbing. But Panamanian and U.S. authorities 
said they believe fear was a factor as well, given the instability of her 
authority in a town that has not yet even settled on a mayor to run the city 
under the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
"Old hatreds are a problem," said Capt. Milton Castillo, who had been 
imprisoned for 21 months at the time of the invasion for his role in a failed 
March, 1988, coup attempt against Noriega and was appointed last week as the 
Panamanian Public Force's commander in the Arraijan region. "There is a lot 
that remains unsettled here." 
</P>
<P>
Echoes of that apprehension raise the very real possibility that Panamanian 
leaders might be the last to accept the complete withdrawal of American troops 
back to the United States and back inside U.S. bases that were here before the 
invasion and will remain, with their primary mission being the defense of the 
Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will want them out sooner than the Panamanians," U.S. Ambassador 
Deane R. Hinton told reporters Saturday. "I hear more people saying keep the 
troops than get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem that limits Panamanian autonomy is reflected in a situation in 
this region west of the canal: The regional jail adjoining Castillo's 
headquarters in La Chorrera, the area's largest town, was destroyed in the U.S. 
attack. Left with the prospect of housing prisoners in makeshift facilities, 
such as a small shed that serves as a holding tank in Arraijan, U.S. 
authorities have opted to dispatch them to a central detention area on Empire 
Range, a U.S. military area outside Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
That facility is the same one that processed about 4,300 suspected former PDF 
members in the aftermath of the invasion, permitting nearly all of them to 
return to active duty. About 400 of the prisoners of war remain behind bars, 
100 of them in secure cells at Ft. Clayton, a U.S. Army base near Panama City. 
Only a few of the latter have been permitted to see visitors, an Army lawyer 
said last week. They face continued interrogation by military intelligence 
experts before being turned over to Panamanian prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the common criminals also will face Panamanian justice; there are 
no plans for U.S. military magistrates to conduct proceedings more extensive 
than pretrial hearings. But both U.S. and Panamanian authorities concede that 
it could be months before that process is fully under way. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, U.S. military commanders are prepared for a time to continue 
acting as police and prosecutor and judge. "Right now, it's just holding down 
the fort," said Capt. David de Silva, a Green Beret assigned to oversee the 
transition in La Chorrera. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lt. Pedrozo -- who owes his incarnation as circuit judge in the 
tropics to his Ohio State law degree and the fact that he is the only Navy 
lawyer in Panama -- says he is eager to see the Panamanian magistrates take his 
job away from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed it," he said. "But I'm ready to get out of this business just as 
soon as they're ready to do the job."
