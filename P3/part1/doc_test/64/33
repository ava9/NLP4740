PANAMA: LIBERALS WERE SURE U.S. INTERVENTION WOULD AROUSE PANAMANIAN

The storming of Panama that overthrew Manuel Noriega battered some cherished 
liberal myths in the process. Among the minor casualties was the notion that 
George Bush had too much to fear from Noriega to bring him here for trial. The 
major casuality was the belief that a U.S. intervention anywhere in Latin 
America must be repudiated by the local population. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Noriega's escape into the Vatican embassy, a leading exponent of 
this view, former Ambassador Robert White, warned in a television interview 
that the invasion "arouses the nationalism of the people." Popular nationalism, 
said this diplomat with a distinguished record of service in the region, would 
enable Noriega to "remain at large and lead a guerrilla operation against 
American troops," leaving the United States "bogged down, with . . . much loss 
of life from guerrilla operations and street-to-street fighting." Similar 
expectations were widely voiced by news correspondents, media pundits and Latin 
American experts. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, Panamanian nationalism was expressed in demonstrations against 
Noriega, not the United States. "There's nothing we can do to hold back these 
people," said a U.S. soldier standing guard outside the Vatican embassy 
Wednesday as tens of thousands of Panamanians massed to demand that Noriega be 
turned over to the U.S. Army. It was word of this menacing crowd that persuaded 
Noriega to stop imposing on the Pope's hospitality. On hearing of his 
surrender, the gleeful demonstrators spread across the city, forcing U.S. 
troops to give up trying to enforce the nightly curfew that had been in place 
since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the media and the professors still insist on calling the new 
Panamanian regime led by President Guillermo Endara a creature of the U.S. 
government. They ignore the fact that Panamanians elected the Endara ticket by 
a 3-1 majority despite Noriega's goons. The people then sustained an opposition 
that braved bloody beatings and torture by Noriega's so-called Dignity 
Battalions. 
</P>
<P>
Is the history of popular resistance to Noriega ignored because it was sparked 
in September, 1985, by one Hugo Spadafora? A former Panamanian vice minister of 
health, he joined the Sandinistas to fight Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio 
Somoza. When the Sandinistas won and then suppressed their democratic allies, 
Spadafora joined other ex-Sandinistas and Miskito Indians to fight the new 
Nicaraguan dictatorship. When Spadafora returned to Panama and denounced Gen. 
Noriega's corruption, he was tortured and beheaded. The slaughter of the 
popular hero sent thousands of Panamanians into the streets calling for justice 
in what eventually became the anti-Noriega electoral movement. 
</P>
<P>
The popular movement was reborn Wednesday in the mass demonstration outside the 
Vatican embassy. It was not only against Noriega; it also demanded an end to 
the repressive militarism of the Panamanian Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The PDF, as Noriega had renamed the National Guard, was created by the United 
States in the 1960s to help defend the canal, was backed morally and 
politically in the 1970s by American liberal champions of the "progressive and 
nationalist military" in places like Panama and Peru, and turned into a monster 
fed by Colombian drug money in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Noriega's main allies have been the Sandinistas and the Cubans, who 
sent teams of advisers to carry out such glorious tasks as organizing the 
notorious Dignity Battalions. These confederations of ex-cons and self-styled 
revolutionaries terrorized the population during the Noriega years, and in 
response to the U.S. invasion looted and burned whole neighborhoods. They are 
modeled on the Sandinista turbas, who are even now bullying Nicaragua's 
democratic opposition with Noriega-style tactics. Domestically, a fundamental 
mainstay of Noriega's rule was the Communist People's Party, which supplied 
leadership for the Dignity Battalions. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that most Latin leaders condemned the invasion, at least publicly. 
Anti-Americanism remains a handy if worn demagogic tool for elites needing a 
whipping boy on which to pin their own fiascoes. But even the Organization of 
American States rejected Cuba and Nicaragua's bid to condemn the United States 
in favor of a much milder reproach. That reproach was itself reproached 
overwhelmingly by those Latins most affected and most entitled to speak, the 
Panamanians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
None of this justifies a return to the bad old days when the United States felt 
entitled to intervene in the region at will. History -- the U.S. building of 
the canal, our presence in the Canal Zone, our creation of the National Guard 
and of Panama itself -- makes this a special case. But it is time that some 
liberals pulled their heads out of the rubble long enough to notice that their 
Imperial Myth is walking around naked. They could start by thinking through the 
concept of "U.S. intervention" from the point of view of the people involved. 
Grenada today is a functioning democracy and enjoys sufficient independence 
from the United States to have voted with the Latin bloc in U.N. and OAS 
resolutions against the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference between an intervention that imposes a dictator and one 
that removes one. A patron saint of true modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill, 
wrote: "The doctrine of non-intervention, to be a legitimate principle of 
morality, must be accepted by all governments. The despots must consent to be 
bound by it as well as the free States. Unless they do, the profession of it by 
free countries comes but to this miserable issue, that the wrong side may help 
the wrong, but the right must not help the right." It would be a sad irony if a 
perverse tenacity leads liberals to become the new apologists for the tyrannies 
that liberalism was created to oppose.
