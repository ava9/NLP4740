The Bush Administration, pledging help to restore Panama's ravaged economy, 
turned over to the U.S.-backed regime of President Guillermo Endara $70 million 
in government funds that had been frozen during the dictatorship of Manuel A. 
Noriega, the State Department announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Administration soon will take 
additional steps, including restoration of another $300 million in blocked 
assets, to repair the damage to the economy caused by the two-week-old American 
invasion and more than two years of U.S. economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making the frozen Panamanian assets available to the new government of 
Panama in an orderly manner," Boucher said. "Some $70 million in blocked funds 
was transferred back to the Endara government over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working to restore Panama's access to programs of the 
U.S. Agriculture Department, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. He added that the United States will resume buying sugar from 
Panama and restore Panama's status as a favored trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said a delegation headed by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson will meet today with 
Endara and other top Panamanian officials to determine that nation's economic 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation will determine the level and the nature of a new U.S. 
aid program intended "to restore democratic institutions and processes and to 
promote sustained private-sector-led growth," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Although other officials said that Eagleburger has been deeply involved in 
negotiations to bring Noriega to the United States for trial on 
drug-trafficking charges, Boucher said the focus of the delegation will be on 
economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of their visit is to learn firsthand from the Panamanian 
leadership about their plans for economic recovery and to make recommendations 
to President Bush on ways in which the United States can be of assistance to 
Panamanian recovery efforts," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Eagleburger and Robson will return to Washington late today but that 
other members of their delegation will remain in Panama for at least a week to 
continue to study the nation's economic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Endara, apparent winner of last year's Panamanian election before it was 
nullified by Noriega, was installed as chief of state after the U.S. invasion. 
Although the Panamanian election commission certified Endara's victory last 
week, only about 10 nations have joined the United States in recognizing his 
government.
