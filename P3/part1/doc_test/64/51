U.S. forces detained two senior Panamanian military officers as they left the 
Vatican Embassy in Panama City where their former commander, Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, remains holed up, a U.S. military spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
They are navy commander Col. Arnulfo Castrejon and armed forces chaplain Lt. 
Col. Carlos Velardes, Southern Command spokesman Col. Jerry Murgia told a news 
conference. "They remain in U.S. custody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Panama Archbishop Marcus McGrath said about half a dozen other fugitives remain 
in the embassy with Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious intention is to arrive at a moment where he will be the only 
person living inside the Vatican Embassy. It should happen today or tomorrow," 
he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers who left the nunciature were on the armed forces general staff 
and Castrejon was a member of the Military Strategic Council, a select group of 
officers close to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Murgia said the two had been arrested in the last 24 hours but did not say how 
long they had been in the nunciature. Castrejon was previously reported to have 
surrendered to the U.S. Army and Murgia did not explain the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
He said that another member of Noriega's general staff, Lt. Col. Rafael Cedeno, 
the deputy director of military intelligence, had surrendered in the last 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish state radio said today that two senior Panamanian officers who took 
refuge inside the nunciature with Noriega have asked for political asylum in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
It identified them as the former director of the National Department of 
Investigation, Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, and Noriega's personal security 
chief, Capt. Eliecer Gaitan. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez told the radio that if no 
lawsuit is pending against the officers there should not be any problem for 
them to settle in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
But he said their biggest difficulty would be whether U.S. troops surrounding 
the mission would allow them to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff at the Vatican Embassy, where Noriega took refuge from invading 
U.S. troops on Christmas Eve, continued with troops and tanks ringing the 
building in the seaside Paitilla district of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops, adopting a novel way of reminding the fugitive of their presence, 
play rock music and news reports on the standoff at high volume over a 
loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to seize Noriega and send him to the United States to 
face drug charges if he sets foot outside the sanctuary of the embassy. But the 
White House acknowledged today that the resolution to the standoff is in the 
Vatican's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican has ruled out turning Noriega over to the United States and 
diplomats say it is seeking to hand him over to Panama or a third country. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said a solution to the Noriega problem would have to satisfy the 
minimum positions of all parties involved. "Whatever time needs to be taken 
should be taken, otherwise the decision will be hasty and destructive," he 
said.
