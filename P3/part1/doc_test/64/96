<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a year after the U.S. military invasion that toppled strongman Manuel 
Noriega, only 37% of Panamanians believe the invasion brought more benefits 
than problems, according to a poll published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, in the daily La Prensa, also showed that only 43% are in favor of the 
U.S. military presence in their country. About 10,000 U.S. troops are stationed 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
A separate poll conducted in January had shown 89% were in favor of the Dec. 
20, 1989, U.S. invasion that ousted Noriega, now in a Miami prison awaiting 
trial on drug and racketeering charges.
