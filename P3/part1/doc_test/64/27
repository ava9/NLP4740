The Vatican's representative in Panama City has granted authority to the U.S. 
Army to free any embassy employees who might be taken hostage by former 
Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega or others who have taken refuge in the 
Vatican's embassy there, according to a document obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official interpreted the authorization as an invitation to the U.S. 
military to seize Noriega, who took refuge in the embassy on Christmas Eve. 
Another official, however, said: "It doesn't mean we can just walk in any time 
we want." 
</P>
<P>
The document declares: 
</P>
<P>
"In the case that the suscriber (apparently a reference to the memo's author) 
or any member of the personnel of this Embassy be taken as hostage by any 
person or group of persons, I hereby authorize the United States of America 
Army to take all the steps that it may deem necessary to set the hostages free. 
</P>
<P>
"Any harm to the hostages must be avoided." 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was addressed "to whom it may concern" and was signed by 
Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio in Panama City. It is dated 
Dec. 26, two days after Noriega, accompanied by several loyalists, took refuge 
in the embassy after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the letter and its contents were confirmed by three senior 
Bush Administration officials. A State Department spokesman refused to confirm 
or deny the existence of such an authorization. An Administration official, 
however, said that the State Department learned of the memorandum for the first 
time Wednesday night and added that officials there reacted with shock at the 
document's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that, when Noriega took refuge in the mission, 
the United States warned that it could not be responsible for the safety of the 
mission's employees. That might have led Laboa to provide the advance 
authorization for U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. government official declared that the memorandum could also be 
used as rationale for the Army to seize Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go in unless they invite you in," he said, "and this sounds like an 
invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. officials said that Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. 
Southern Command, which has overseen the American military operation in Panama, 
apparently discussed the writing of such a memo with Laboa before the envoy 
wrote it. The memo was dated Tuesday, the day the ambassador talked at length 
with Thurman in front of the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Noriega loyalists at the papal embassy brought their families 
with them, according to U.S. officials. In addition, four Basque terrorists, 
deported from Spain to Panama in 1987 and fearing for their freedom, took 
refuge in the mission on the day of the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources said that officials of the mission took the firearms of the 
Noriega loyalists when they were admitted. But a senior U.S. government 
official added: "You can't be sure they've given them all up." 
</P>
<P>
According to one Administration official, Laboa raised with U.S. officials as 
early as Christmas Day the possibility that a hostage situation was in progress 
or could develop. Laboa reportedly said that he would want the United States to 
attempt a rescue if such a hostage-taking were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
American military officials were concerned that Laboa's oral expression of his 
wishes would not constitute sufficient authority for action by U.S. forces and 
asked him to put his wishes in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good going up against the Catholic Church," said a government 
official in Washington. "It looks great, though, to come to its rescue." 
</P>
<P>
As the diplomatic mission of the Vatican, the "apostolic nunciature" is 
considered under international law to be the territory of a sovereign entity. 
Without a formal "invitation" to U.S. forces to intervene, any action by U.S. 
forces would be a clear contravention of international law, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not carte blanche," said one Administration official. "The language is 
pretty specific. It doesn't mean we can just walk in any time we want." 
</P>
<P>
A second Administration official took pains to distinguish between Laboa's 
written "authority" and the necessary presidential authority that U.S. forces 
would need to make a rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not authority," the official said. "It's a lot less than meets the 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
The official said there are no grounds for concluding that a hostage-taking 
incident already has occurred and added that neither a hostage seizure nor a 
U.S. rescue is a "likely outcome." 
</P>
<P>
"But he (Noriega) might do something stupid," the official said. "And we're 
prepared for everything." 
</P>
<P>
While officials denied that U.S. military authorities dictated the contents of 
Laboa's memorandum, they said U.S. officials were eager to have Laboa's wishes 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were he, and I were the slightest bit worried I might be taken hostage 
and that at that time it would be too late, I would set it to writing, too," 
one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior government official, however, said Thurman is likely to have 
encouraged Laboa to offer the United States a formal invitation to intervene. 
Such an action could produce one of the goals of the U.S. invasion -- the 
capture of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Thurman is impatient and would like to do something about the situation 
at the embassy," the official said. "He is a devout Catholic, and he finds the 
situation very troubling." 
</P>
<P>
American tanks and troops had the Vatican's embassy in Panama City surrounded 
Wednesday as the U.S. operation entered its eighth day. Government officials in 
Washington acknowledged that the encirclement might raise pressure on Noriega 
and his loyalists and provoke the hostage-taking that could lead to a U.S. 
rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of confining," said one official. "He's not allowed to communicate, 
although he can see that whatever he had is slowly but surely crumbling. He 
could become fairly desperate." 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official said the U.S. forces surrounding the embassy would 
be careful not to provoke a hostage-taking. At the same time, officials said 
that it still is not clear how the U.S. forces surrounding the nunciature would 
know whether hostages had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have worked out some signals," said one official, who added jokingly, 
"Maybe if you see all the shades go down, you'll know." 
</P>
<P>
There is only one recent precedent for a country to storm the diplomatic 
mission of another nation in an attempt to free hostages. In May, 1980, British 
commandos mounted a rescue attempt on Iran's embassy in London, where Iranians 
held 20 hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, requested Britain's 
help in freeing the hostages. In a letter of thanks following the commando 
raid, Bani-Sadr observed that "each and every government (must) look after the 
safety of diplomats on their territory."

The Quest for Noriega 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said it will not turn deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega, who has 
taken refuge in its embassy in Panama City, over to the United States. However, 
the Vatican's representative in Panama City has granted authority to the U.S. 
Army to free any embassy employee taken hostage by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, still hoping to change Pope John Paul II's mind, may send a 
special envoy to Rome to argue the case. 
</P>
<P>
Panama's new president, Guillermo Endara, demanded that the Vatican revoke the 
sanctuary given Noriega in the papal embassy. 
</P>

The Endara government estimated that damage from the U.S. invasion and the 
looting that followed will total $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Money Trail 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities turned over $5 million to Panama from one of several bundles 
of cash that American soldiers found in Noriega's headquarters. Also, France 
froze Noriega deposits in French banks totaling between $3.4 million and $4.3 
million. Washington filed similar requests with Switzerland, Luxembourg and 
Britain.
