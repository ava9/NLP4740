<P>
The Panama Defense Forces accused the United States on Friday of intimidation 
and treaty violations, and the foreign minister said that Panama is "an 
invasion site in which only the order to fire is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
After three days of U.S. Army maneuvers and confrontations with Panamanian 
soldiers, the military issued a statement saying that the defense forces are 
facing "situations of intimidation and aggression by forces belonging to the 
Southern Command of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the defense forces commander who effectively rules 
Panama as a military dictator, reiterated that he would not yield to U.S. 
demands that he step down. He marks six years as commander today. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians from the north, 
their (Panamanian) lackeys and tame politicians are trying to impose," and will 
not "grovel" before the United States, he said in a speech to retired military 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that President 
Bush "would not rule out" seizing Noriega to face charges in Florida in a 
federal narcotics case but that the United States is not contemplating such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's comments were his first public reaction to several confrontations 
between his forces and U.S. troops, which have included arrests on both sides 
and a blockade by American soldiers of Ft. Amador, a military base here shared 
by U.S. and Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they have the right to conduct exercises under the 1977 
Panama Canal treaties to assure canal security. Noriega accuses the United 
States of seeking to abrogate the treaties and recover the canal. Under the 
treaties, all U.S. roles in the operation and defense of the waterway cease 
Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter, asked the U.N. Security 
Council to send military observers to Panama to prevent the U.S. Army from 
provoking confrontations "as a pretext for armed intervention." 
</P>
<P>
"What the situation in Panama calls for is the presence of military observers, 
which we hope would be able to go as early as next Monday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Panama has become "an invasion site in which only the order to 
fire is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert S. Okun, acting U.S. representative at the United Nations, said that 
all U.S. military activities in Panama are conducted "in complete accord with 
the Panama Canal treaties" and that recent exercises were a "response to the 
hostile actions of the Noriega regime." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has been trying to force Noriega out since two federal grand juries 
in Florida indicted him early last year on drug trafficking and money 
laundering charges. Noriega denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions have failed to budge the general. 
His regime annulled presidential elections in May after what international 
observers called a clear victory by the opposition ticket over the 
Noriega-backed slate.
