<P>
The Bush Administration is seeking to increase pressure on the Vatican to turn 
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega over to the United States and 
plans to present new evidence of his alleged crimes to papal authorities in 
Rome, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Army officials are gathering documents and other evidence from the 
Panamanian general's many homes in Panama, and Justice Department investigators 
are questioning a former Noriega aide in Miami, all with a view to "building a 
stronger case" that might persuade Pope John Paul II to expel the deposed 
dictator from the Vatican embassy, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said they also are exploring possible terms for a deal under which the 
Vatican could deliver Noriega formally into the hands of the new government of 
Panama and the Panamanian regime would immediately turn the general over to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega spent his fifth day Thursday inside the Vatican's embassy, where he 
took refuge from invading U.S. troops on Christmas Eve. The United States has 
asked the Vatican to turn him over for trial in the United States on 
drug-trafficking charges, but Wednesday the Pope's official spokesman rejected 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have a strong case, and it may get stronger as time goes on," a 
senior U.S. official involved with the case said. "A common criminal is not 
entitled to diplomatic sanctuary. If we get more evidence to present to the 
Vatican that he's wanted for ordinary crimes -- that this is not a political 
case -- it will strengthen our position." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the evidence being prepared, he said, is testimony from Lt. Col. 
Luis del Cid, a former Noriega aide who surrendered to the U.S. Army after the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials said that the strain of playing host to Noriega may 
prompt the papal nuncio in Panama, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, to appeal 
to the pontiff for a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Noriega) is a very unwelcome guest," said one official. "Just look at the 
letter," he added. The reference was to a letter Laboa wrote authorizing the 
U.S. Army to intervene if any Vatican embassy employees were taken hostage by 
Noriega or others who have taken refuge there. 
</P>
<P>
As further evidence that the Vatican may be persuaded to change its mind, 
officials also noted that the Roman Catholic primate of Panama, Archbishop 
Marcos G. McGrath, has recommended that Noriega be turned over to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
May Tire of Embassy 
</P>
<P>
Besides, one official added, Noriega -- known to be a bon vivant and raconteur 
-- may tire of the church's hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
"Does he really want to be stuck in a monastery for two months?" 
</P>
<P>
There is some hope, he said, for "an unexpected event" -- like Noriega suddenly 
deciding either to give up or to attempt to escape on his own. One reason U.S. 
forces outside the nunciature in Panama have been playing rock music at high 
volume, he noted, is to increase Noriega's discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, emphasized 
that the Administration is sticking to its position of demanding Noriega's 
release to U.S. authorities, and the issue may take weeks to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not near any quick breakthrough," a senior official said. ". . . We're 
nowhere near the end game." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater appeared to harden the 
Administration's position Thursday, saying that the United States could not 
accept a deal that would give Noriega refuge in another country because of the 
heavy price the United States has paid for his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, as U.S. officials despaired of deposing Noriega, the Panamanian 
leader was encouraged to voluntarily leave Panama for a third country, with the 
understanding that he would not be extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Such an offer is no longer on the table, said Fitzwater, who is traveling with 
the vacationing President Bush in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are confident that the Panamanian government would find a 
way to turn Noriega over to the United States if the Vatican decides to deliver 
the general to local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama has been pretty flexible," said one. "There are many ways of bringing 
this to a resolution. He can be turned over or surrendered or declared a 
detainee of U.S. forces. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Panama's constitution prohibits the extradition of a Panamanian citizen to a 
foreign country. But officials said that the government there could hand 
Noriega over without formally invoking the extradition process, thus 
sidestepping the constitutional issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's diplomatic missions around the world, like other embassies, have 
long been sanctuaries for those fleeing political or religious persecution. 
Under accepted international law, foreign embassies cannot be entered by police 
or armed forces seeking to seize refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Thursday, however, that Laboa, the Vatican's diplomatic 
representative in Panama City, had granted authority to the U.S. Army to take 
the necessary steps to free any Vatican embassy personnel taken hostage by 
Noriega or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Administration sees a serious threat of hostage-taking, 
Fitzwater said: "We have no indication there is trouble within the nunciature. 
There are no hostages we are aware of." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he assumed that the letter granting the unusual authority to the 
Army had been written because "when you have people of the ilk of Mr. Noriega 
and his cronies, there certainly is reason to be concerned. If there is any 
danger there, we would be prepared to offer assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added that Bush had not spoken with the Pope about Noriega. "We think 
it's appropriate that we not try to intervene in a way not appropriate to the 
decision-making process," he said.
