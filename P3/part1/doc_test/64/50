PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 days after being overthrown in a U.S. military invasion and taking 
refuge in the Vatican embassy, Manuel A. Noriega lived a secluded, Spartan 
life, sealed off from the outside world by the reluctant host of his diplomatic 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a day, the deposed dictator of Panama opened the door to his 
sweltering second-floor room in the Vatican nunciature, accepted a meal on a 
tray and shut himself in again, according to visitors to the embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks tired, pale and depressed," a Roman Catholic Church official said 
before Noriega surrendered himself to U.S. authorities late Wednesday. "He 
hardly speaks." 
</P>
<P>
For those 10 days, however, as the Vatican, the Bush Administration and the 
U.S.-installed Panamanian government negotiated his fate, the 54-year-old 
Noriega apparently remained as stubborn and secretive in captivity as he was 
during the seven years he ruled Panama as military commander. 
</P>
<P>
After narrowly escaping capture by American troops who invaded Panama on Dec. 
20 and put a $1-million bounty on his head, an exhausted Noriega slipped into 
the nunciature on Christmas Eve and surrendered an Uzi submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like a hunted fox," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega slept through three days of ear-splitting rock music blared toward the 
embassy from loudspeakers by American troops surrounding the place -- 
harassment that kept awake his host, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, and was 
shut off only after Laboa's repeated complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday night, Noriega resisted Laboa's own campaign to pressure him to 
leave voluntarily by shutting off the air conditioning in his quarters, thus 
allowing the room temperature to rise into the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously missing from the life of Panama's former self-proclaimed "maximum 
leader" in this period were the pornographic photos and large quantities of 
cocaine that American officials say they found in his many homes. The nuns at 
the nunciature even took care to remove the wine from the guest wing where 
Noriega was left free to roam. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his stay, Noriega had no access to radio or newspapers. Everything 
he learned from the outside was filtered through brief daily conversations with 
Laboa, a 66-year-old Spanish Basque who, as Vatican nuncio since 1982, is the 
dean of Panama's foreign diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
"Laboa has been trying to get him to see that he cannot stay there for the rest 
of his life," said a European diplomat before the surrender. 
</P>
<P>
But each time Laboa asked him to go, said a church official, Noriega gave the 
same answer: "I am not ready." 
</P>
<P>
From his window in the three-story embassy, in the seaside Punta Paitilla 
neighborhood, Noriega looked out on rolls of concertina wire, U.S. tanks, 
armored vehicles and elite Delta Force troops surrounding the place, waiting 
for him to step outside. He could hear U.S. army helicopters hovering overhead 
or landing in a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican, following diplomatic precedent, agreed to give Noriega temporary 
refuge while it determined whether he was being pursued for criminal or 
political activity. He was indicted in the United States on drug charges, and 
Panama said last week that it planned to charge him with murder in connection 
with a failed coup against him last October. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Noriega decided to leave the nunciature voluntarily, church 
officials said the Vatican had classified him as an accused criminal and was 
therefore willing to end his sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic precedent inhibited the Vatican from handing Noriega 
directly over to the Americans as a foreign occupying power. And the Panamanian 
government said it did not want such a problem prisoner in its own disorganized 
legal system. The new Panamanian government also pointed out that the 
Panamanian constitution bars the extradition of one of its own citizens to 
another country for trial. 
</P>
<P>
As pro-Noriega resistance to the American invasion died out, Panamanians who 
struggled for years against the dictator turned their ire against the Vatican 
for harboring Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 citizens signed a letter urging Pope John Paul II to end his 
"ambivalent attitude" and turn Noriega over to "authorities with immediate 
capacity to bring him to justice" for "horrendous crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Within earshot of Noriega, about 10,000 Panamanians gathered Wednesday 
afternoon, in the first major demonstration since his downfall, to demand his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as diplomatic cars and light armored vehicles moved back and 
forth between the nunciature and the high school across the street where the 
American, Vatican and Panamanian negotiators were meeting, Noriega became "very 
nervous," according to a church official who saw him. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Laboa, a jovial, extroverted man, say he has been wounded by 
criticism against the Vatican. They say he believes he spared Panama much 
bloodshed by giving sanctuary to Noriega, under the same principle of 
diplomatic immunity that protected foes of the dictatorship who were running 
for their lives. Laboa's defenders have noted that Noriega had never violated 
the Vatican sanctuary to arrest anyone. 
</P>
<P>
According to several accounts, Laboa got a Christmas Eve phone call from 
Noriega in a house somewhere nearby. Having dealt with Noriega over the asylum 
of at least a dozen political figures who fled into the nunciature to escape 
his repression, the nuncio instantly recognized Noriega's voice. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega asked Laboa for refuge, saying that otherwise he would go into the 
jungle and lead a prolonged guerrilla war, a friend of the nuncio said. After 
quick reflection, the nuncio agreed. Shortly thereafter, Noriega drove his own 
car to the nunciature's ornate iron gate, rang the bell and was escorted 
through the mansion's yellow wall. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, several hundred members of Noriega's Defense Forces and Dignity 
Battalions were fighting a sporadic war of resistance on Noriega's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I accepted him, I knew that his people would decide that he was a 
bloody coward and stop fighting," a diplomatic colleague quoted Laboa as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the nuncio tried to get Noriega to tape a message instructing his 
followers to surrender. The former dictator refused, then fell into an 18-hour 
slumber. By the time he woke up, resistance to the new regime had dwindled.
