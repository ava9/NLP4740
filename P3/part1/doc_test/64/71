A federal judge, acknowledging the complexity of the case, Monday postponed for 
almost nine months the trial of Manuel A. Noriega as attorneys for the ousted 
dictator prepared a defense that they said would probably include Noriega's 
taking the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Our principal objective is to have everybody ready for trial in a fair 
manner," said U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, setting the new trial 
date for Nov. 30. The trial had been scheduled to begin March 5. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney David Lewis complained that even late November was "not 
feasible, not possible" for trial on 11 counts alleging international drug 
smuggling. He said defense lawyers must still obtain and study thousands of 
secret U.S. documents that may relate to Noriega's past involvement as an 
undercover informant for the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and 
perhaps other intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The former Panamanian strongman is expected to claim that U.S. agents 
authorized or at least condoned his cooperation with Colombian drug gangs as 
long as he furnished valuable information on many of their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Taking note of Lewis' objections, Hoeveler said that "if expansion is needed, 
expansion will be granted . . . but in no event will this trial start later 
than January, 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned that federal prosecutors are stepping up efforts to 
persuade Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, a former confidant and military aide to 
Noriega, to plead guilty in the drug-conspiracy case and become a witness for 
the government against his former commander. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid is among five co-defendants in U.S. custody who are seeking a separate 
trial from Noriega. Talks with Del Cid's Miami lawyer, Samuel I. Burstyn, began 
shortly after Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities on Jan. 3. But, in recent 
days, "they're offering Del Cid the moon," according to a source familiar with 
the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn acknowledged some progress but said that no plea agreement had been 
reached. Del Cid could be a crucial witness for the government because, 
according to the 1988 federal indictment, he was an intermediary who received 
cash payoffs for Noriega from leaders of the Medellin drug cartel who wished to 
use Panama as a transshipment point for U.S.-bound cocaine deliveries. The 
cartel also established cocaine-processing laboratories in Panama with 
Noriega's blessing, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on reports of a possible deal, Noriega attorney Steve Kollin 
said: "We'll wait to see if there's a plea before we worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, in discussing possible testimony by Noriega, said the general had 
received substantial "foreign intelligence" over the years from countries other 
than the United States, including Israel and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
But James McAdams, a Justice Department attorney, told the court that such 
intelligence would be subject to U.S. review before Noriega could use it at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
McAdams asked Hoeveler to mandate such a review in an order he is preparing on 
measures to prevent disclosure of secret materials at the trial. But Lewis 
objected that such a directive would go beyond provisions of the federal 
Classified Information Procedures Act, which Congress enacted 10 years ago to 
govern the use of top-secret documents in criminal trials. Hoeveler took the 
arguments under advisement.
