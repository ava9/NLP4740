PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hardening determination by the Bush Administration to apprehend Manuel A. 
Noriega left the self-proclaimed "maximum leader" of Panama isolated inside the 
Vatican embassy on Monday, even as American troops used stringent measures to 
underline the tough U.S. stance. 
</P>
<P>
While delicate diplomatic negotiations were taking place on Noriega's fate, 
heavily armed American troops in effect created a one-man prison for the 
54-year-old former strongman, who sought sanctuary Sunday and has indicated he 
seeks long-term political asylum in Spain or Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks, armored personnel carriers and U.S. soldiers, their faces camouflaged 
with lime-green paint, blocked off one of the city's major roads near the 
ornate Vatican outpost. The French ambassador, the Spanish envoy and the German 
charge d'affaires all had their cars stopped and searched from engine to trunk 
-- and even beneath the carriage. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Spanish ambassador goes out of the Vatican embassy with Noriega bundled 
in the trunk of his car, we're going to stop them and take him out," one 
American official declared. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, a specially equipped, four-engine AC-130 gunship circled slowly and 
endlessly, ready to open fire with an array of weapons "that could level this 
whole damn city," in the words of one U.S. source. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, American troops surrounded the Cuban ambassador's residence 
and bunkers bristling with assault rifles, rocket launchers and cannon were 
outside the closed Cuban Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban political counselor Luis Delfin Perez, who said he was quoting a U.S. 
military official, charged in a telephone interview that "the American troops 
say they have orders to arrest all who come in here or leave here, including 
the ambassador and me." 
</P>
<P>
He said the heavily armed troops are "showing a very aggressive attitude in 
pointing their arms in here." 
</P>
<P>
Spanish diplomats reported that American troops Sunday night strung razor wire 
across their embassy's front door, aimed weapons at the building and for a time 
prevented anyone, including the ambassador, from entering or leaving. Although 
access finally was allowed, anyone trying to enter the building Monday, 
including Panamanian citizens, could approach the embassy only with an armed 
American escort. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of soldiers stationed around the diplomatic facilities are 
explained by American officials as necessary to prevent Noriega's escape. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Noriega is being restricted to small, sparse quarters inside the 
Vatican embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no dirty pictures, drugs or women," said one source, referring to 
the pornographic photos and large quantities of cocaine that the Americans said 
they found in raids last week on Noriega's homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his less-than-gilded existence could go on for some time, according 
to American and other diplomatic officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see him out in a day, a week or even years," Javier Herrera, first 
secretary at the Spanish Embassy here, declared. "It could be like the 
Mindszenty case," he said, referring to the circumstances of Cardinal Josef 
Mindszenty, the anti-Communist Roman Catholic Church leader from Hungary who 
spent nearly 15 years in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest after seeking political 
asylum in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, a similar fate faces 30 other Panamanian supporters and allies 
of Noriega, including his one-time puppet president, Manuel Solis Palma, who 
also are in the Vatican embassy under papal protection. About 10 to 20 
Panamanians also are inside the Cuban ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Military roadblocks are everywhere. Panamanians walking along the streets are 
frequently startled by loud commands from hidden bullhorns ordering them to 
stop and retrace their steps. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans took near-total control of Panama City's streets, U.S. forces 
also steadily moved into the Panamanian countryside and occupied areas where 
there have been no riots, no resistance and no loss of public order. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia, chief of current operations at the U.S. Southern 
Command, cited the "touchy situation" concerning Noriega and the Vatican as a 
primary reason for the moves and noted that "there is still a lot of military 
work to do." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
No incidents of combat have occurred for about a day and a half, and all 
significant resistance from pro-Noriega forces seems to have dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
But if U.S. soldiers are not actually engaged in combat any more, American 
officials acknowledged, they are still carrying out tasks usually not assigned 
to foreign troops in a so-called friendly country. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the security for a news conference held this week by President 
Guillermo Endara was provided by Defense Department agents in civilian clothing 
as well as uniformed American soldiers, although members of Panama's new police 
force were available. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. military is searching for and arresting civilian 
political supporters of Noriega even though they do not face American or 
Panamanian criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Runione, a one-time minister of industry and a leader of Noriega's 
political party, was taken into custody Monday by American soldiers at the 
request of the Endara government. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
This followed the forceable break-in by U.S. troops Sunday at the house of 
Orville Goodin, a radical leftist backer of Noriega. He too was arrested by 
American units, although he faces no criminal charges in Panama or the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official acknowledged that the American military's apparent 
willingness to pursue what may be only political vengeance on behalf of the new 
Panamanian government is "a serious problem." It is difficult to sort out 
legitimate requests to apprehend real criminals from those seeking to punish 
old political foes, this source said.
