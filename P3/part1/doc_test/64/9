President Bush said Sunday that he is pleased that Manuel A. Noriega sought 
refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama, declaring that it means that the 
dictator's "reign of terror is over." But the wily general's move poses 
potentially awkward problems for his pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
In a worst-case scenario, officials said, it could produce a long and 
embarrassing diplomatic stalemate that might result in his escape to another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the general is now under the control of diplomatic 
authorities. His reign of terror is over," Bush said in a statement released by 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "As we work to help return law and 
order to Panama City, and as the government of President (Guillermo) Endara 
begins its work, the demise of Gen. Noriega sends a strong signal that freedom 
and democracy in Panama are on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the Administration is asking the Vatican to turn Noriega over to 
U.S. or Panamanian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States will continue to pursue avenues to bringing Gen. Noriega, 
now located, to justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said officials are discussing how best to obtain the Vatican's agreement. 
"That's what we're considering right now," he said. ". . . We have been in 
touch with a number of officials relevant to this." 
</P>
<P>
Under international law, embassies and other diplomatic missions have the right 
to grant asylum to dissidents or others who seek refuge; U.S. forces cannot 
pursue Noriega onto the embassy's premises. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vatican's response was far from certain. According to an Italian news 
agency report from Panama, the papal nuncio in Panama City, Bishop Jose 
Sebastian Laboa, had already refused to turn Noriega over to the U.S. armed 
forces who invaded the country last week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a night of many questions and no answers," a weary White 
House official said. "Everything remains open. We just want to bring him to 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been contacts on (several) levels between the U.S. and Vatican 
officials in Washington as well as in Rome," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect a third country deal (under which Noriega would find refuge in 
another country) to emerge," he said. "We expect that the Pope may have to be 
in on the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Administration will try to persuade the pontiff that 
Noriega's case "is different from other cases because it is not political, he 
is not being persecuted for political reasons. He is a criminal just out to 
save his skin." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope himself did not hear the news of Noriega's arrival on his doorstep 
until after celebrating Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to say. Later today, we shall see," said Vatican spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition might sway the Vatican to allow Noriega to escape. Vatican and other 
foreign embassies in Latin America have been confronted by dozens of asylum 
requests during the wars and revolutions of the past decade, and their most 
frequent response has been to arrange safe passage out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has already been offered asylum in two countries, the Dominican 
Republic and Spain, although those offers were made before the U.S. invasion of 
Panama last week. In 1988, the Reagan Administration offered the general safe 
passage to one of those countries if he would voluntarily relinquish power, an 
offer Noriega walked away from. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is complicated by the fact that the United States is asking for 
Noriega to be handed over to U.S. authorities for trial before a federal court 
in Florida -- not to Panamanian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear exactly what the situation is, either diplomatically or 
legally, at this time," said David Runkel, a special assistant to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. "Our interest remains the same -- bringing this man to trial 
in the United States if that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
However, earlier Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the possibility 
that the United States might agree to allow Noriega to be prosecuted in Panama 
instead. Panama normally does not allow its citizens to be extradited to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were to be captured in Panama and arrested, then I suppose we'd have to 
sit down at that point and decide whether he was going to be brought back to 
the United States, extradited if you will, or whether he would be prosecuted in 
Panama," Cheney said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Much will depend on the attitude of the Endara government, officials said. The 
Vatican was one of the first countries to extend tacit recognition to the 
Endara government; the papal nuncio, Bishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, met with 
Endara last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Endara himself took refuge at the nuncio's residence until shortly 
before the U.S. invasion last week. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Noriega settles in for a long stay, some State Department officials 
consoled themselves with the thought that it might be better than the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," said one. "It's not the worst-case scenario. He could be 
out in the hills, leading a guerrilla movement of resistance against the U.S. 
occupation. This way, at least he's admitted that he's a fugitive from 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
A group of senior State Department officials was meeting Sunday evening to 
consider the Administration's legal and diplomatic options, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials reportedly included Undersecretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt, 
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard W. Aronson and Legal Adviser Abraham 
Sofaer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Christmas holiday, President Bush and his senior advisers were 
out of Washington, with Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., 
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III visiting his family in Houston. 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was visiting American troops in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has frequently extended asylum in its embassies to prominent 
dissidents in Communist countries -- sometimes for long periods. Chinese 
dissident Fang Lizhi has been living in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since June, 
although Chinese authorities seek him for treason. In the 1950s, the U.S. 
Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, sheltered Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, the Catholic 
primate of Hungary, for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of diplomatic asylum is different from the sanctuary that churches 
provided to fugitives in medieval days. Asylum in embassies in generally 
provided solely to political dissidents. "The ancient concept is that a church 
provides sanctuary." said the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal 
Church in Pasadena, who has been active in the modern sanctuary movement, 
providing shelter to emigrants from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"It usually is not sanctuary for someone fleeing from the law as it is for 
someone who is obeying a higher law out of conscience. Noriega does not fit 
that bill, I don't think. So the church would have to decide on what grounds it 
would give sanctuary. It's a very complicated legal issue."
