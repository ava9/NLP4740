A lawyer for the Panamanian government told a federal judge Wednesday that 
Panama soon will file a $5.3-billion racketeering lawsuit against Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that the civil suit will accuse the deposed dictator of being 
responsible for the murders of three of his opponents, including a priest and a 
leader of an ill-fated coup last October. He said Panama will also accuse 
Noriega of extortion, fraud and theft schemes that deprived the country of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise announcement was made after federal prosecutors met with Noriega's 
lawyers and agreed to try to unfreeze $4.5 million to $6 million being held in 
the general's accounts in European banks. The money is to be placed in an 
escrow account and dispensed by a federal judge to pay for Noriega's defense. 
</P>
<P>
The former Panamanian leader has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering charges in U.S. District Court here. His trial is expected to 
begin early next year. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the U.S. government, banks in several European countries 
froze accounts holding an estimated $20 million linked to Noriega. U.S. 
authorities said the money was tainted because it was earned through 
drug-dealing and money-laundering activities. 
</P>
<P>
The accounts were frozen after Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities 
following last December's invasion of Panama. Noriega's four defense attorneys 
have said that they have spent $1 million already. They threatened to withdraw 
from the case unless they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to unfreeze the bank accounts was worked out after Judge William 
M. Hoeveler rejected a prosecution proposal that the United States pay for 
Noriega's defense and then be reimbursed from the frozen funds after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Sullivan said in court that the deal had been 
approved "at the highest levels of the Justice Department." He said it requires 
the U.S. government to ask the foreign banks to release the money but does not 
guarantee that they will do so. 
</P>
<P>
After Hoeveler approved the agreement, attorney Gregory Craig told the judge 
that he represented the Panamanian government and that it objected to the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Any assets that lawfully belong to the people of Panama should not be used to 
fund Noriega's defense," Craig said. His Washington law firm, Williams &amp; 
Connolly, recently represented Oliver L. North, the former White House national 
security adviser who once used Noriega to help mount operations against the 
Sandinista government in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Craig told the court that Panama intends to file a lawsuit accusing Noriega of 
racketeering through a series of illegal schemes and acts. He said that the 
lawsuit will seek $300 million in compensatory damages and $5 billion in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Craig told reporters that Panama's suit will accuse 
Noriega of being responsible for the deaths of a Colombian priest, a political 
opponent and a leader of the unsuccessful October, 1989, coup. He said that the 
lawsuit will be filed in a U.S. court within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The priest, Father Hector Gallegos, was thrown out of a helicopter over the 
ocean in 1972. He had been organizing opposition to the regime of Gen. Omar 
Torrijos, Noriega's predecessor and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
The second slaying was that of Hugo Spadafora, a one-time Noriega ally who had 
become his most vocal political opponent. He was killed in 1985 near the 
Panama-Costa Rica border and his body was found in a U.S. mail bag on the Costa 
Rican side. His head was never found and the case was never investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the suit also will accuse Noriega of ordering the execution of Capt. 
Moises Giroldi, who was in charge of security troops at Noriega's headquarters 
until he led the failed coup last year and was later shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said he would deal with the Panama's objections to the use of 
Noriega's money after the lawsuit is filed.
