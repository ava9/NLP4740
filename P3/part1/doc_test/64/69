The first newspaper to appear on Panama's streets since the U.S. invasion 
called on citizens Wednesday to rally behind the new U.S.-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
The violence put newspapers out of action for nearly a week. La Estrella de 
Panama is the only one to resume publishing so far. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the paper generally supported the ousted government of Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega, though it did report on activities by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Panama is in the most desperate economic, moral and social 
situation in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Looting and violence that swept the country after the invasion have exhausted 
Panama's resources and commercial and industrial activity, it said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions, all Panamanians have to make common cause with the new 
governors in their leading role of democratizing the nation, uniting the 
family, formalizing respect for human rights and fostering real liberty of 
expression," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's managing director, Tomas Duque, was proposed as administrator 
of the Panama Canal by the Noriega-backed government but was rejected by the 
United States, who felt he was close to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Its deputy director is Dr. Carlos Ozores Typaldos, the country's provisional 
vice president until last week's invasion.
