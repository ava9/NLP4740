</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Combing through the ruins of Manuel A. Noriega's dictatorship, Panamanian 
investigators have prepared more than 300 cases of corruption against former 
officials accused of bleeding the treasury through padded payrolls, illegal 
procurements and other embezzlement schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from the records that escaped systematic destruction by Noriega's 
fleeing supporters suggests that at least one-fifth of Panama's national budget 
was pilfered on salaries of political appointees who showed up at work only to 
collect paychecks, according to officials of the new U.S.-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
With Noriega in American custody and out of the country, Panamanians are 
turning their attention to the mess he left behind and how to clean it up. 
Officials looking into the files say they are finding the scale of corruption 
far greater than they imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't congratulate me," Mayor Guillermo Cochez told a well-wisher Thursday, 
the morning after invading U.S. troops took Noriega prisoner. "It's all 
craziness here. The public administration of the Noriega regime was based only 
on seeing how much they could steal. And what they stole was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
After a week at City Hall, Cochez has asked the new prosecutor to file charges 
in two corruption cases against his predecessor, Mayor Jilma Noriega, who once 
claimed to be a relative of Gen. Noriega but no longer does. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, she is accused of leasing a municipally-owned gasoline station to 
the Shell Oil Co. for 1/30th of the rent required by law, on the condition that 
Shell sublease it at a similar rate to a local company owned by one of her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The other alleged scheme was more brazen. For the past four years, Cochez 
charged, Mayor Noriega personally raked off half the municipal tax payments 
delivered to City Hall each January -- about $10,000 per day for each day of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with photos and newly discovered lists of people in Noriega's 
paramilitary Dignity Battalions, the new mayor has begun to fire potential 
troublemakers from the municipal payroll. In addition, he is working to 
identify and eliminate phantom workers who drew salaries while doing no work. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden purges, also under way in 12 government ministries, have put 
President Guillermo Endara's administration at odds with union leaders once 
supportive of Noriega. The conflict is already poisoning the wave of relief 
felt generally in Panama after Noriega's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Panama's justice system, corrupted during 21 years of military rule, is being 
revamped to settle such disputes and to try the growing docket of corruption 
cases. But judicial reform has been delayed, and complicated, by the sabotage 
of Supreme Court records the day after Noriega's ouster in the Dec. 20 U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Court workers have told Panamanian investigators that they saw one or more 
Supreme Court magistrates setting fire to their own files. A blaze swept 
through the court offices, on the top floor of the four-story Justice Ministry 
headquarters, destroying most of the case records. 
</P>
<P>
"What the fire didn't destroy the fire hoses did," said Cesar Quintero, one of 
eight newly appointed magistrates on the nine-member court. "This wasn't the 
work of common looters but high-level officials. They did this to make the new 
court's work difficult and to destroy old cases of justice being rigged and 
sold out." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the white colonial justice building, now abandoned, are computers, 
photocopiers, fax machines and filing cabinets methodically smashed with axes 
and iron bars. The new Supreme Court magistrates, who are to name lower court 
judges, are still looking for new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Three other badly damaged agencies have been unable to reopen, including the 
Finance Ministry, where Noriega supporters mined the elevators with explosives 
before leaving. Col. Pasqual Gonzalez, the head of civil aviation, 
booby-trapped his own desk. 
</P>
<P>
"The order to the Dignity Battalions was to level the land, like Attila the 
Hun, destroy everything," said an investigator for the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said, about 40 tons of files salvaged from government offices and 
homes of Noriega supporters have been taken to American military bases in 
Panama for scrutiny by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
American troops are also holding more than 50 top Panamanian military and 
civilian officials at a high-security jail on one of the bases. They are being 
questioned for information to bolster the federal drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering indictments against Noriega in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 criminal cases being prepared by Panamanian authorities are based on 
evidence gathered by the controller general, Panama's chief fiscal 
investigator, and sent to the attorney general. Both men were named by 
President Endara. 
</P>
<P>
The controller's oceanfront skyscraper headquarters sustained more than $1 
million in damage when rocket-firing U.S. helicopters tried to blow up the 
National Radio studios, lodged on a high floor. The building's rooftop power 
plant was destroyed instead, but the ground-floor computer room, a treasure 
chest of financial information, survived. 
</P>
<P>
Officials there said that about half the cases sent to the prosecutor's office 
last week had been investigated during Noriega's seven years in power but 
shelved on orders of his Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases center on the growing economic power of the now-disbanded 
Defense Forces, which took profits out of everything from vehicle registration 
to import-export trade and became even wealthier as U.S. economic sanctions 
against Noriega drove the rest of the country into a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
"There's everything in those files," an investigator said. "Widespread 
corruption, money laundering, contraband, graft, payola. . . . It was a big 
business!" 
</P>
<P>
While such practices had become well-publicized political grievances against 
Noriega, Panamanian officials said they are no less stunned by what they have 
found. They said it has deepened their conviction that the U.S. intervention 
was justified. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of the corruption was more than we thought," Controller General 
Ruben Carles said in an interview. "We didn't know how deeply the military was 
involved (in the economy). Now we are seeing this monstrosity from the inside. 
The possibilities of getting these people out (of power) except by force would 
have been zero." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Defense Forces used the National Bank of Panama, which is now 
under investigation, to conceal their financial dealings "with overdrawn 
accounts, phony loans, destroying of documents that were backing up loans and 
concessions." 
</P>
<P>
In the first major embarrassment for the new administration, Col. Roberto 
Armijo was forced to resign last week as chief of Panama's new Capital Public 
Security Force after auditors discovered that he and members of his family had 
more than $1.2 million in certificates of deposit in that bank. 
</P>
<P>
Another entity under investigation is Transit S.A., a private company managed 
by Carlos Duque, Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate in the elections 
of last May. 
</P>
<P>
Transit was authorized to impose a "service fee" on most trade through the 
Colon Free Zone (a merchandise transshipment facility, free of customs duties) 
and turned the revenues -- $275 million a year, according to U.S. sources -- 
over to Noriega's family and a few high-ranking military officers. The company 
has been taken over by the state and the fee has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
While Duque remains at large, new information on Transit is coming from Rafael 
Ceballos, his top deputy at the company for 18 years. In an interview two weeks 
ago, before surrendering to U.S. and Panamanian authorities in Colon, Ceballos 
said that he kept records of "every single check" and is willing to spill the 
company's secrets. 
</P>
<P>
While a full picture of corruption under Noriega will take months to emerge, 
several government officials said it was far more costly to Panama than the 
U.S. sanctions aimed at getting rid of him. The total value of Panama's economy 
shrank 40% in 1988 and 1989, after the sanctions were imposed, and unemployment 
climbed to at least 30%. 
</P>
<P>
As it seeks $1.2 billion in emergency aid from the United States, the Endara 
government is scrambling to eliminate phantom employees and thus save hundreds 
of millions of dollars in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Such an employee is known here as a botella, or bottle. Some Panamanians say 
the term is meant to suggest an empty bottle, something that has outlived its 
usefulness; others say it stems from the image of a bum drinking booze from a 
bottle instead of working. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace payroll, at the time of the American invasion, was 
top-heavy with bottles, according to Miguel Batista, the new vice minister 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Of 360 employees, he said, the first 47 below Noriega's handpicked president, 
Francisco Rodriguez, did not work in the palace. All earned between $1,500 and 
$3,000 per month and held such titles as "coordinator of planning" and 
"executive assistant." Some were union leaders who really worked elsewhere and 
drew two or more salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the only ones we've discovered so far in this ministry because they 
are notorious cases," Batista said, studying a computer printout of the 
payroll. "We are going to keep investigating, and surely more botellas will 
appear. In all government institutions, we've found this phenomenon."
