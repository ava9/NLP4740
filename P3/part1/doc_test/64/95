Former President Manuel Sols Palma, Panama's figurehead leader while General
Manuel Noriega called the shots as defence chief, has pleaded not guilty to
charges of abusing his authority, AP reports from Panama City.
Mr Sols Palma fled to Venezuela and is not attending the trial. He is
accused of using paramilitary groups to help suppress street protests.
He and three men already in jail - Arturo Marguines, Enrique Thompson and
Benjamin Colamarco - are charged with attempting to undermine state security
and Panama's standing in the world.
If convicted, each faces up to three years' imprisonment on the first count
and three to six years' on the second.
