<TEXT>
<P>
A top Administration official said Sunday that President Bush's critics in 
Congress share responsibility for the United States' reluctance to use American 
military personnel to assist in a coup attempt against Panamanian leader Manuel 
A. Noriega last week. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said that Congress, through 
"micromanagement of the Executive Branch," has historically discouraged 
Presidents from using military force to topple unpopular leaders of other 
countries. He referred specifically to an executive order prohibiting 
assassinations by agents of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has, by its actions and its demeanor, certainly leaned us against the 
kinds of things now they're saying we should have done," Scowcroft said on 
ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Host of Critics 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, members of both parties in Congress -- virtually everyone 
except the most liberal members -- have criticized Bush for failing to provide 
the mutineers with the military assistance that would have enabled their coup 
against Noriega to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft was reacting to their criticism as well as a statement by Senate 
Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) that the Bush 
Administration has never been denied any request for congressional approval of 
covert activity in Panama designed to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Boren, also appearing on ABC, said: "Since George Bush became President, every 
single word of authority that he had requested from the Intelligence Committee 
and every single penny that he has requested from the Intelligence Committee 
relating to Panama, he has gotten and gotten with my support." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft replied that he was "astonished" by Boren's statement, adding, "We 
did not get everything we had wanted." But after the television show ended, and 
after he discused the matter privately with Boren, according to a White House 
spokesman, Scowcroft acknowledged that the senator's statement was not 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to sources, the Senate Intelligence Committee discouraged 
then-President Ronald Reagan from carrying out a covert plan that he had 
authorized to foment dissent against Noriega among his own forces. Scowcroft 
appeared to be alluding to that dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Scowcroft's comments reflected a widespread view within the 
Administration that the President's critics would have been equally -- if not 
more -- upset had the White House authorized U.S. military support for the 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen so many bloodthirsty people as I've experienced over the 
last week . . . who say we should have used force," said Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Monday Morning Quarterbacks' 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on. There are 
more Monday morning quarterbacks per square mile in Washington than any other 
city in the nation. The fact of the matter is, given what we knew then, and 
what we know now, I still think we made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have acknowledged that their decision-making during the 
crisis was not as efficient as it might have been, but Bush has declared that 
he still feels he made the right decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, told ABC that he doubts members of Congress are speaking for their 
constituents when they call for the use of U.S. military force to oust Noriega. 
"My judgment is the American people do not want that, nor do the Latin American 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft, Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, all of whom 
appeared on television Sunday in an effort to counter congressional criticism, 
said the President last Tuesday authorized the commander of U.S forces in 
Panama to capture Noriega without the use of military force, if possible. Bush 
also instructed him to devise a plan for using troops to seize Noriega in the 
event such an action was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these two options were ever pursued by American forces in Panama, 
however, because the rebels said they were unwilling to surrender Noriega to 
the United States and because the coup collapsed shortly after Bush issued the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We never made the decision to use military force," said Cheney. "That would 
have involved going in against the rebels and taking Noriega from them. I never 
thought that was a very good idea, but we told him (the U.S. commander) to be 
prepared in case he got the order to do so. And then, shortly after that, the 
coup fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney characterized the position of U.S. troops in Panama last Tuesday as 
follows: "We were leaning forward in case the President made the decision to 
intervene militarily." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker Against U.S. Action 
</P>
<P>
Baker, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," said it would have been a mistake 
for the President to commit troops to assist the Panamanian rebels under the 
circumstances. "You do not commit American lives on somebody else's plan and 
somebody else's schedule," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what order went from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the 
American command in Panama regarding the seizure of Noriega, Baker said, "I 
think the message that was sent was that, if there were an opportunity to do 
this without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life and to do 
so without open military involvement, then he was free to go ahead -- the 
commander on the ground was free to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Although Noriega succeeded in putting down the coup attempt, Baker said that 
the Panamanian leader continues to be weakened by his loss of support among 
other Latin American nations and among the officers in his own Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"He is isolated," said Baker. "We are seeing his sole base of support -- the 
Panama Defense Forces -- come unglued, engage in insurrections against him, and 
I think frankly that this is moving in the right direction. I would argue that 
there's a very good possibility that Gen. Noriega is a lot weaker after this 
unfortunately unsuccessful attempt than he was before." 
</P>
<P>
Boren has criticized the President for failing to bring U.S. intelligence 
officials into the decision-making last Tuesday, and Cheney acknowledged that 
the CIA was not represented at two key meetings between the President and his 
advisers in the White House situation room. But he insisted the President did 
receive intelligence reports from CIA officials in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that somehow the President did not convene his advisers and 
seek their advice is garbage," Cheney said. "It's not true."
