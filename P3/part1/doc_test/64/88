Latin America's major democracies Thursday condemned the Panamanian 
government's nullification of its election as a step that moves Panama "even 
further from the democratic community of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
The seven countries reiterated, however, their commitment to "nonintervention 
and self-determination" in Panama, an apparent reference to intense U.S. 
efforts to drive Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, from power. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Group of Eight, now composed of just seven countries since 
Panama's suspension in February, 1988, issued a joint communique that said, in 
part: 
</P>
<P>
"We declare our profound consternation at a situation that can distance the 
government of Panama even further from the democratic community of Latin 
America at a historic moment when free, popular expression advances in an 
unprecedented manner in our region." 
</P>
<P>
Although the seven nations remain sensitive to U.S. intervention in domestic 
political issues, they also are wary, based on long experience, of attempts by 
the region's armed forces to interfere in politics. Argentina, which has 
presidential elections Sunday, has weathered three military uprisings in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who heads the Panama Defense Forces, is the de facto ruler of Panama. 
His regime nullified Sunday's election after international observers accused it 
of widespread voting fraud on behalf of Noriega's favored presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The group of Latin American nations, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, 
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, has emerged as a significant regional 
voice. Four of the seven -- Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay -- returned to 
democratic rule in the 1980s after military dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latin American officials had criticized the United States for failing to 
consult and seek joint action last year after Noriega, in effect, deposed 
then-President Eric A. Delvalle. President Bush phoned several Latin American 
leaders Wednesday to consult with them on the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disastrous and a Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, the current president 
of the U.N. General Assembly, declared bluntly to reporters that the Panamanian 
election was "disastrous and a disgrace. I hope the new (electoral) process, 
which should be initiated as soon as possible, will have the necessary 
guarantees to allow (democracy) to be consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
"What has occurred in Panama seems impossible and unacceptable, to the point 
where the Panamanian authorities have seen themselves obligated to annul these 
elections,". 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine election will bring the nation's first transition from one 
elected leader to another in 61 years. With civil liberties entrenched since 
the restoration of democracy in 1983, there are no concerns about fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Andres Perez, the recently elected Venezuelan president, said he feels 
profound concern over developments in Panama, and he expressed Venezuela's 
"solidarity with the legitimate election results, which represent the majority 
will of the Panamanian people." 
</P>
<P>
Perez criticized the interference of the Panamanian armed forces in the vote 
count and "altering" of the results. He said Latin American countries are 
consulting on possible options, and he called for an emergency meeting of the 
Organization of American States to consider possible action. An OAS statement 
in Washington said the meeting will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
In Havana, the Cuban Foreign Ministry denounced any possible U.S. military 
intervention in Panama, saying such an action would create "an inevitable and 
explosive reaction among the people of our (Latin) America." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the European Community condemned the annulment of the 
election, saying the move implied "the non-acceptance of the sovereign will of 
the Panamanian people," Reuters news agency reported from Brussels.
