In the mind of America, Manuel Antonio Noriega has become the stuff of myth, 
one of a select few foreign demons (Kadafi and Khomeini are others) who menace 
the civilized world with boundless evil. Against such demons, any sanction is 
justified, including last December's invasion of Panama by the United States 
Army and Marines -- an unprecedented use of American military power to 
overthrow and capture a single villain. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Noriega is a nasty man: a tyrant, a murderer and a drug profiteer 
(not to mention, as did one U.S. general in Panama, a devotee of voodoo and a 
wearer of red undershorts). But today, with benefit of hindsight, it is 
astonishing that President Bush -- or anyone else in the U.S. government -- 
could have condemned the crimes of Manuel Antonio Noriega with a completely 
straight face. For, as these two admirably reported books on Noriega show, the 
Panamanian dictator was known to U.S. officials as a bad apple for 30 years -- 
three decades during which the same officials consistently elected to ignore 
the evidence and continue using Noriega as an intelligence source and sometime 
drug-enforcement ally. 
</P>
<P>
When then-Vice President Bush protested during his 1988 campaign that he was 
unfairly tagged as Noriega's friend -- that seven administrations, beginning 
with Eisenhower, had dealt with the man -- it turns out he was right. But Bush 
drew the wrong lesson (or, more precisely, no lesson at all) from his own 
history. The wonder is not that Noriega hid his evil nature from so many 
Presidents and CIA directors, but that so many administrations had at least 
fragmentary evidence of his nastiness and chose not to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The record, set forth more clearly in these detailed accounts than ever before, 
is an infuriating cycle of sin and bureaucratic redemption. For 30 years, the 
wily Panamanian plotter engaged in nearly every variety of corruption, but 
until 1988, he always made himself just useful enough to the United States to 
win official absolution. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1960, according to Frederick Kempe, Noriega's U.S. intelligence 
contact learned that his new Panamanian agent had been arrested for raping and 
beating a prostitute; Noriega stayed on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, both John Dinges and Kempe note, the Nixon Administration's Bureau of 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs compiled a strong case against Noriega for 
protecting a marijuana pipeline through Panama. But by then, Noriega was 
already Panama's chief of military intelligence, and no conclusive action was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the U.S. attorney in Miami was ready to indict Noriega for gunrunning, 
but the Carter Administration blocked the case -- in part because Noriega had 
been helpful in sheltering the outcast shah of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Noriega directed the Panama Defense Force's flagrant theft of a 
presidential election for a candidate owned by the military; a pair of 
hard-working U.S. diplomats even documented the fraud. But the Reagan 
Administration favored the military's candidate, too, and ignored its own 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Not until 1987, when the cumulative outrage of Noriega's rule drove many 
normally placid Panamanians into the streets -- and, perhaps more important, 
when the cocaine epidemic suddenly became a potent political issue in the 
United States -- did the Reagan Administration turn against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
There are two mysterious characters in this story. One is Noriega, the 
endlessly crafty abandoned child of Panama City's slums, ugly protege of the 
charismatic strongman Omar Torrijos, master dealer in information, political 
manipulator extraordinaire -- but, all in all, a trivial figure on the stage of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The other, more important character is ourselves. Noriega may have been a 
devil, but the United States government was the Faust that somehow found itself 
drawn to bargain with him time and time again. And, in a sense, our deals with 
Noriega mirror every ugly little trade-off U.S. foreign policy makes in the 
Third World; most of them simply never go quite this horribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Noriega is colorful, exotic and, thanks to Panama's luxurious 
profusion of lurid rumors, easy to tell. The story of our own vulnerabilities 
is more complicated and subtle, harder to get, but surely more important. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these books are built, irresistibly, around the Noriega saga. But 
Kempe, a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, seems to have been the one 
more seduced by the devil Noriega; Dinges, a reporter for National Public 
Radio, does a better job of focusing on the United States as a confused and 
inattentive Faust. 
</P>
<P>
Both have unearthed considerable new information. Kempe provides a wealth of 
detail, especially, on the painful (and abortive) U.S.-Noriega negotiations 
over the past two years, as well as the unsuccessful anti-Noriega coup of 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Dinges has done some admirable investigative work, often using the Freedom of 
Information Act, as when he reveals a secret State Department report that 
showed conclusively that Noriega's men stole Panama's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
And he has a provocative new thesis: that Noriega, far from being a drug 
kingpin, actually disengaged from active complicity in cocaine trafficking 
beginning in 1984, when he realized that the issue might endanger his 
relationship with the United States. (The "cocaine" seized from his office 
refrigerator by U.S. troops last December, for example, turned out to be frozen 
tamales.) 
</P>
<P>
The final irony, in Dinges' view, is that the U.S. decision to oust Noriega was 
as incoherent as the earlier decisions to coddle him. The Reagan Administration 
allowed two federal prosecutors in Florida to go ahead and indict the general 
even though some aides warned the action would be a foreign-policy disaster. 
Why? Because, Dinges argues persuasively, in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra 
affair -- and with drugs becoming a major issue in the 1988 campaign -- no one 
dared to suggest blocking the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of massive military force in December, 1989, that brought Noriega's 
rule to an end was the final proof of the failure of American foreign policy in 
Panama," Kempe writes. 
</P>
<P>
But the failure may go one step further. In part because Bush has quite deftly 
turned his sad experience in Panama into a 24-hour military triumph, it is not 
at all clear that the lessons of the previous 30 years of failure have been 
learned.
