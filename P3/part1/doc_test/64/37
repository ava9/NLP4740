<P>
U.S. authorities are preparing to set up prisoner of war camps where the 1,500 
members of the Panama Defense Forces now in custody can be screened to 
determine who might help form a new Panamanian army and who might be prosecuted 
as drug traffickers, Administration sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are providing POW protection for each one until the precise status of each 
individual soldier can be ascertained," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those believed to be in custody are a number of men with close ties to 
ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega, four of whom have been indicted in the 
United States on drug charges along with Noriega, a Justice Department official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"Those four clearly are people we want to take custody of, and we will be 
interviewing others that we have outstanding cases against -- people who figure 
in ongoing investigations," said David Runkel, a special assistant to U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The task of restructuring the PDF -- including rooting out corruption -- is 
among the foremost challenges confronting the Bush Administration. With about 
14,000 members, the PDF has served not only as Panama's army but also as its 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the plan to set up prisoner of war camps conceded Friday 
that the Administration harbors few illusions about the difficulties of trying 
screen the Panamanian soldiers in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a delicate procedure if we're trying to restore the Panamanian 
government," one Administration source said. He said the soldiers probably will 
break down into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
"One, there may have been some good soldiers who did nothing. They will be 
released to the new government as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, if the government believes some are Noriega loyalists, they may be kept 
for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"The third group are those who may have been involved in the drug business. We 
have to determine whether we want to bring them back to the U.S. for 
prosecution or turn them over for prosecution in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
But, the source continued, "we don't want to run a camp for a lot of people for 
a prolonged period. No one wants the U.S. to be seen running a concentration 
camp." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the process could take "months and months." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon source said that it may not be easy for authorities to decipher a 
Panamanian soldier's true sympathies. "An awful lot of people are going to 
claim to have seen the light. Do we believe those who claim to have seen the 
light? It's going to be hard to tell who's really trustworthy and who's not." 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration source declared: "It's going to be an arduous and 
prolonged process." 
</P>
<P>
David Isenberg, a research analyst at the Center for Defense Information here, 
agreed that the plan could take many weeks. Until a new PDF is reconstituted, 
he said, a peacekeeping force from either the United Nations or the 
Organization of American States might be a palatable alternative to the 
continued large presence of U.S. forces in Panama.
