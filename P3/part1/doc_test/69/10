SERIES OF ERRORS ON TANKER LED TO SPILL, PANEL IS TOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Exxon Valdez approached a hazardous midnight passage between rock reefs 
and floating icebergs in Prince William Sound, a series of errors aboard the 
supertanker began compounding, leading to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, 
a federal board of inquiry was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the captain away from the bridge, there was no lookout stationed 
on the bow, the depth alarm was not working and the ship was increasing -- 
rather than reducing -- speed. At times the ship was on automatic pilot, a 
condition normally reserved for operations in the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures came on the opening day of a five-day hearing by the National 
Transportation Safety Board on the causes and immediate aftermath of the March 
24 tanker grounding, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing also focused on a mystery: Did the ship's crew fail to realize 
trouble lay ahead, or did the ship somehow not respond to its frantic efforts 
to avoid Bligh Reef? 
</P>
<P>
The ship's third mate, Gregory T. Cousins, told the panel that Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood left the bridge to do some paper work in his cabin after first 
ordering the tanker outside normal traffic lanes to avoid floating ice. 
According to Cousins' testimony, Hazelwood asked if the third mate was 
comfortable handling the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, unlicensed to operate the vessel in the sound, said "yes, I was." 
</P>
<P>
According to reports filed by NTSB investigators Tuesday, Hazelwood made a 
series of decisions before leaving the bridge, however. He ordered the lookout 
stationed on the bow to take a position on the bridge wing, 800 feet from the 
bow. And he told Cousins to steer back into the traffic lanes just beyond Busby 
Island, where a buoy light warns of dangerous shoals. 
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes before the accident, just after passing Busby Island, Cousins 
said he ordered a right rudder correction of 10 degrees. Two minutes later, 
detecting no response, he said he made a more insistent 20-degree right rudder 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Minute Delay 
</P>
<P>
But the ship's mechanical course recorder said no course change began until 
five minutes after Cousins said he issued his first order. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly cannot pinpoint the reason" for the discrepancy, Cousins said. 
</P>
<P>
As the ship steamed at 11 knots toward the reef, Cousins said he called 
Hazelwood in his cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'I think we're in serious trouble,' " Cousins said. Then the 
987-foot tanker hit the reef. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said in a panic that he grabbed the wheel and spun it left but by that 
time, "I believe we were hard aground." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he shined a light on the water but could not see oil because it 
was too dark. But he said he could smell oil. 
</P>
<P>
Telling his story for the first time to an intent crowd in a downtown hotel 
ballroom, the Tampa, Fla., seaman said that after the first hit there was 
another jolt every 10 seconds for a minute, six jolts in all. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood returned to the bridge and spent about 20 minutes trying to rock the 
ship free. He called the Coast Guard at 12:26. At 12:35, he made another futile 
12-minute attempt to free the tanker -- actions that authorities believe might 
have further jeopardized the ship's already precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, fired from Exxon and facing state criminal charges of drunk driving, 
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil, refused to testify at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, who is free on $50,000 bail, goes on trial June 20. He has pleaded 
innocent to the charges. He faces two years, three months in jail and $11,000 
in fines if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he smelled no alcohol on Hazelwood's breath. The captain failed a 
blood alcohol test 10 hours later and investigators said Hazelwood was drinking 
before sailing his tanker out of Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
However, Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl told United Press International on 
Tuesday that company interviews indicate Hazelwood was not drunk prior to the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney's View 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, said Tuesday that the testimony showed 
"an accident happened and it was the fault of the third mate and the helmsman. 
You can talk about the captain's judgment, but it doesn't rise to a crime." 
</P>
<P>
In a dozen trips on Exxon vessels out of Valdez, Cousins said, he had not seen 
"growlers," small icebergs, worse than on the night the ship left port, but he 
said he saw them only on radar. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he was surprised to find the tanker on automatic pilot when he 
took over because autopilot was used in open water and not during maneuvers, 
such as the detour away from ice. He said he did not know who put the ship on 
autopilot but that he took it off before trying to make critical turns prior to 
running aground. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins also testified that at no time while the ship was lunging into shallow 
water did the alarm on the ship's fathometer sound. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said the distance between the ice and Bligh Reef was nine-tenths of a 
mile. The Exxon Valdez was heading east, toward lighted and charted reefs and 
islands, when he ordered the series of right turns. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB questioning focused on ice conditions, tanker-turning capabilities and 
crew decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is trying to determine why the tanker strayed far from the shipping 
lane on a clear night, whether Hazelwood was drunk and why Cousins was in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
28 Witnesses Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
The panel will question more than two dozen witnesses, including Coast Guard 
personnel and Exxon executives, and try to determine whether the Coast Guard, 
the oil industry and the state reacted as promptly as possible to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry is scheduled to hear 28 witnesses, including eight Exxon crewmen, 
representatives from the state, Exxon, the Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline 
Service Co., a consortium of oil companies that runs the 800-mile Alaskan 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to a year to 
complete, NTSB spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins' testimony, delivered in a monotone, seemed to take on an air of 
despair when he revealed that he was not supposed to be on duty when the ship 
ran into trouble. Cousins reported telling his replacement, the second mate, to 
take his time coming up to bridge to start his shift because he, Cousins, was 
feeling fine.
