A federal judge on Friday upheld the government's indictment of Exxon and 
rejected a plea to throw out criminal charges stemming from last year's massive 
Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I deny all motions to dismiss," U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland said 
after a two-hour hearing in which Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. sought to 
have the charges against them thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, to be followed by a written opinion later, was welcomed by Justice 
Department lawyers, who are prosecuting the two Exxon companies for the 
nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The indictment is proper and fairly puts the defendants on notice of what they 
have to defend against," Holland said in a brief statement. Exxon lawyers at 
the hearing voiced disappointment over their defeat but said there would be no 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has been set for April 10, more than two years after the tanker Exxon 
Valdez rammed into Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil into pristine waters, fouling rich fishing grounds and wildlife 
habitat.
