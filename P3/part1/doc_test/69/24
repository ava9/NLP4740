Top Exxon executives contradicted government witnesses Monday, insisting they 
repeatedly urged the quick use of chemicals to disperse the nation's largest 
oil spill but that federal authorities turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
Their testimony before a five-member subcommittee of the House Interior 
Committee went against earlier statements by both the Coast Guard and the 
state's top environmental official, who said the oil company did not seek 
widespread use of dispersant chemicals to break down the oil. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon executives also disclosed for the first time that the cleanup has cost 
the oil giant $95 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to Alaska to use dispersants," Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank 
Iarossi told the panel. "I was pleading on my part to begin dispersal use . . . 
we were very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
He said opposition from the state Department of Environmental Conservation and 
the Coast Guard blocked the chemicals' use or limited them to tests or only 
small-scale use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that had we obtained prompt permission to use the dispersant, 
the environmental damage (of the spill) would have been mitigated," said Exxon 
USA President William D. Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said early use of dispersants or early burning would have broken up 
large amounts of spilled oil. Iarossi said the chemicals would have dispersed 
perhaps 40% of the Alaskan crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of Alaska's Department of Environmental 
Conservation, rebutted that testimony and described Exxon's account Monday as a 
"fabrication." Dispersants in parts of Prince William Sound had been 
preapproved by the state even before the oil spill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dispersants were not used extensively in the three days following the tanker 
accident because the winds and seas were too calm to provide the turbulence 
necessary to mix them with oil," Kelso said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee held two days of hearings to investigate the oil spill, which 
occurred March 24 when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside normal shipping 
channels in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the No. 2 Coast Guard official involved in the spill 
cleanup, also testified Monday that the oil industry did not seek permission to 
use large amounts of dispersants immediately after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and the Coast Guard's Valdez commander both said Exxon and Alyeska, its 
pipeline service company, did not urge the use of dispersants.
