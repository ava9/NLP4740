<P>
An Alaska judge today upheld state criminal charges against Joseph Hazelwood, 
skipper of the Exxon Valdez supertanker responsible for the nation's worst oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone ruled at a pretrial hearing that the 
43-year-old Hazelwood is not entitled to immunity under a federal law designed 
to protect those who report oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnstone has yet to rule on other defense motions to dismiss up to 
six felony and misdemeanor charges filed against the fired master of the 
987-foot tanker that ran aground March 24 in Prince William Sound.
