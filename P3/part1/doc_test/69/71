EXXON, U.S. DISCUSS OIL SPILL SETTLEMENT;

The Justice Department is discussing a settlement with Exxon Corp. that could 
result in a substantial fine but spare the energy giant a possible criminal 
trial over its role in last spring's disastrous Prince William Sound oil spill, 
government officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges naming Exxon have been announced, but a federal grand jury 
in Alaska has been investigating the firm since the Justice Department opened 
an environmental crimes office in Anchorage in the aftermath of the March 24 
Exxon Valdez grounding. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of a possible settlement were not disclosed Wednesday, but Exxon 
officials have made it known that they are seeking assurances that most or all 
money collected would be used to fund cleanup and environmental restoration 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Word of behind-the-scenes negotiations between U.S. lawyers and Exxon 
officials, first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, was revealed 
by University of Alaska marine biologist Rick Steiner of Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Steiner said he learned about the talks 
Jan. 23 when he met privately with Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi 
in Washington to discuss a proposal that Exxon invest about $100 million to 
protect timberlands in the Prince William Sound area. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that Exxon had agreed to the total amount of (settlement) money it 
would pay and that they expected to reach an agreement . . . any day," Steiner 
said. "He wouldn't tell me how much that was, but I got the impression that 
$500 million is in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade acknowledged that 
discussions are under way with Exxon attorneys. She declined to say whether 
those talks involve possible criminal charges. However, the Associated Press 
reported that federal prosecutors were involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said the company would have no immediate comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Still at issue, according to Steiner, is whether anticipated financial 
penalties would be assessed as criminal fines or put into some sort of fund to 
benefit the damaged Prince William Sound environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably in the best interests of the state of Alaska and the whole 
country" if the settlement is heavily weighted to underwriting restoration 
efforts, said Steiner, an associate professor with the university's marine 
advisory program in Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to generate more funds for the federal Treasury," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas Baily offered at least partial support for that view 
saying: "Obviously, a fine doesn't do any direct good to the state of Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
He said the state is aware of talks between Exxon and the Justice Department, 
but he said Alaska has taken no position on what sort of terms should be worked 
out. Baily said the state has not been invited to participate in the 
negotiations. And he said he doubts that a federal plea agreement would affect 
the state's pending civil litigation against Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has already spent $2 billion in cleanup efforts in Alaska, but critics 
claim much more work needs to be done. Reducing the amount of criminal 
penalties in favor of increasing the amount of cleanup funds could be a boost 
for the company's public relations, and might mitigate civil damage 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation for everyone -- the environmental community, 
commercial fishermen, everyone" said Steiner, who also is a commercial 
fisherman in Prince William Sound. "Ideally, we'd like to see an agreement that 
ends up with a $1 fine and a restoration fund of $499,999,999."
