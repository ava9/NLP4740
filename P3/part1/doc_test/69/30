LONG BEACH WILL PREPARE DISASTER PLAN FOR OIL SPILL

Long Beach officials said Friday that the city will draw up contingency plans 
to cope with a major oil tanker disaster such as an Exxon Valdez-type oil spill 
amid warnings that an incident of that magnitude could damage beaches and take 
weeks to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
Although manpower and equipment could be mobilized far more quickly in Southern 
California than off the Alaskan coast, the rupture of a huge oil tanker in 
waters off Long Beach or San Pedro could be catastrophic, the general manager 
of a cooperative that handles oil spills acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"If you said to me, 'Could you clean up a 240,000-barrel spill in a week?' the 
answer would probably be 'No,' " said Roy C. McClymonds of Clean Coastal 
Waters, a Long Beach-based cleanup cooperative supported by major oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
McClymonds appeared at a hearing called by Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell to 
inquire into the city's preparedness for a major oil spill. The city balances a 
thriving tourist trade -- including promotion of its long, sandy beaches -- 
against booming port commerce that included 387 tanker visits last fiscal year 
at two oil terminals. 
</P>
<P>
McClymonds told city officials that his crews could start skimming oil within 
three hours of being called to seas in a 25-mile radius of Long Beach. But Kell 
said he is skeptical that local companies have enough equipment to handle a 
major spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this equipment is totally inadequate to handle a large spill," Kell 
said. "They said it would never happen in Valdez. Well, they were wrong. . . . 
I think as a result of failure in Alaska, we need to re-evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Shirey said the Exxon Valdez disaster has prompted 
the city to include a major oil spill, in addition to earthquakes and floods, 
in its contingency disaster planning. The Exxon Valdez was bound for Long Beach 
when it went aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, causing the nation's 
worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Capt. James Card said his agency plans to hold a major oil spill 
disaster drill Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Alaska, the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have several cleanup 
firms that could dispatch manpower and equipment quickly, McClymonds said. 
</P>
<P>
As Jeff Shaw, senior environmental adviser to Arco Marine, put it, there is so 
much equipment near the two ports that an oil spill would be "like breaking a 
window in a hardware store."
