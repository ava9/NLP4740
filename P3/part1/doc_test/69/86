<P>
Exxon Corp.'s second-quarter profits plunged by more than $1 billion, largely 
due to an estimated $850-million cost associated with the nation's worst oil 
spill, the company reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Net income fell 87% to $160 million, or 13 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 
90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter, Exxon said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said the drop was the result of "a special 
provision" allowing for an estimated $850 million, or 67 cents a share, in 
cleanup costs for the March 24 spill of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Without the special provision, Smith said the company's second-quarter earnings 
would have been $1.01 billion, or 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the charge "does not include the potential effect of 
litigation, which cannot reasonably be assessed at this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 Million Spent 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has already spent about $600 million on cleaning up the spill, the worst 
in U.S. history, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed the $850 million is only an approximate cost including estimated 
expenses and estimated insurance recoveries, and cautioned against drawing the 
conclusion that there is only $250 million remaining to be spent in the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has previously disclosed it had an estimated $400 million in spill 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon revenues for the second quarter were $23.61 billion compared with $21.63 
billion for the same period in 1988, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors reacted negatively to the announcement, with Exxon off $1.125 a share 
at $45.625 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Young of Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York said he 
changed his rating of Exxon stock this morning from a "hold" to an "avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he had anticipated the sharp earnings drop since last week because 
congressional testimony indicated a write-off of this magnitude as a result of 
of the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consensus at Odds 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst, who declined comment until he had seen the actual Exxon 
numbers, said the consensus among analysts had been that Exxon would report 
higher operating earnings, before the write-off, than 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez 
fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Valdez spill appears likely to approach that of the March, 
1979, near-meltdown at the Three Mile Island No. 2 nuclear power plant in 
Pennsylvania. Cleanup efforts in that accident, which continue after more than 
10 years, have cost General Public Utilities Corp. an estimated $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said that despite the cost of the cleanup, Exxon's 
financial condition remains strong. "We are continuing to pursue our long-term 
business strategies and to implement planned capital programs," he said.
