After nearly a year at dry dock in San Diego Bay, the Exxon tanker involved in 
the nation's worst oil spill returned to water Friday night following massive, 
multimillion-dollar repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Towed by four tugboats, the Exxon Mediterranean, formerly christened the Exxon 
Valdez, was floated out of its dry dock for the the first time and moved into 
the bay. It was escorted a quarter mile to an outfitting pier, where it was 
berthed to undergo 10 days of equipment checks and other tests to evaluate the 
tanker's seaworthiness. A two-week sea trial, scheduled for early August, will 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's refloating is a significant milestone in the return of this vessel to 
service," said Robert Weatherford, Exxon Shipping Co. business and planning 
manager, during a news conference held aboard the repaired tanker Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hallett, chief financial officer at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 
said shipyard workers began the 24-hour process of flooding the dry dock 
Thursday. Once the water level reached the same height as the bay Friday night, 
the gate of the dry dock was opened. He said the tanker was released and slowly 
floated out. 
</P>
<P>
The gray and red tanker, 987 feet long and 166 feet wide, is now docked at 
Nassco's Pier 6, just south of the Coronado Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The ship has undergone major repairs since last September to its single-skin 
steel hull at the Nassco shipyard, where it was built in 1986. When the damaged 
ship docked at Nassco, officials said whole sheets of the tanker's skin on the 
starboard side appeared shredded, twisted and crumpled, as if it were flimsy 
aluminum, not steel three-quarters of an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic changes to the tanker included the words "Exxon Mediterranean" freshly 
painted on the ship's stern and a new coat of dark red paint on its 
reconstructed hull. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, repaired to its "original construction," is tentatively scheduled 
to make its first voyage to the Middle East in mid- to late August, Weatherford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, reporters were invited by Exxon and Nassco officials aboard the 
ship's bridge for the first time since the tanker spilled 11-million gallons of 
crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, 1989. It was towed into 
San Diego Bay last July for a $30-million repair job at Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was on schedule and on budget," Nassco president Richard Vortmann 
said. "Nothing of this magnitude has ever been done before, so this was a 
tremendous technical engineering feat." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Tom Gillette said one-third of the tanker's bottom was repaired 
or replaced, a process that used 3,000 tons of steel. He said that final 
repairs on the 3-year-old, highly automated tanker were completed last week, 
and the ship is in "tiptop" shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I can finally get back to what I was trained to do," said Capt. Mike Stalzer, 
who will captain the ship during the sea trial and its first assignment to the 
Middle East. He earlier served as a captain on the Valdez, but was off duty at 
the time of the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. President Gus Elmer announced the tanker's new route, which 
will be outside U.S. waters, and its new name earlier this month. He said the 
tanker will load Middle Eastern oil in the Mediterranean and deliver it to 
Europe, becoming the first U.S.-licensed tanker to enter foreign service. 
</P>
<P>
Stalzer, 39, said the Mediterranean's first voyage will probably include a stop 
in Singapore to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean's new route, Gillette said, will probably include loading at 
single-port moorings off Turkey and Egypt and making stops at Trieste in Italy, 
Marseille in southern France, Port Jerome in western France and Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't leave here until everything is tested and we're thoroughly 
satisfied," Stalzer said, noting that the engine room machinery, navigational 
system, radars and other state-of-the-art equipment on board will be tested 
during the two-week trial run, which will be held outside traffic lanes 100 to 
150 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping inspectors will accompany Stalzer 
and his 20-member crew on the repaired tanker's trial run, said Paul Meyers, 
project manager for Exxon. He said the tanker, one of the largest in Exxon's 
13-ship American fleet, will renew its Coast Guard two-year certification as a 
seaworthy vessel during the test run. 
</P>
<P>
As the Valdez, the tanker, outfitted with a 4-foot-deep, 8-by-12-foot swimming 
pool, was designed to travel from Alaska to Panama, along with sister ship 
Exxon Long Beach. Exxon no longer trades in Panama and delivers Alaskan oil 
exclusively to the U.S. West Coast. Gillette said the decline in Alaskan crude 
production prompted Exxon officials to reassign the 30,000-ton tanker to the 
Middle East route. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials denied the tanker's name and route were changed as a public 
relations ploy. They also stood by the company's decision not to equip the 
tanker with a double hull. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco officials said the 300 pipe fitters, carpenters, electricians, welders 
and painters who were employed to fix the Mediterranean have already been 
reassigned to other projects at Nassco's shipyard.
