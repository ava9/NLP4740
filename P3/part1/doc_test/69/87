ABOARD THE ARCO ALASKA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a quiet night off the coast of California. The lights of Los Angeles 
glowed dimly on the horizon and the seas appeared empty, yet Third Mate Marie 
C. Wuerker was alert to potential trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Radar showed a cluster of boats less than half an hour away. The boats gave no 
sign of knowing that they were possibly on a collision course with the Arco 
Alaska. It was a Friday night; one of the radar dots might represent a drunken 
weekend sailor. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 feet long, the Arco Alaska was loaded with 52.4 million gallons of 
crude oil and would require two miles to stop. All on board were painfully 
aware of the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, which caused the worst oil 
spill in U.S. history. This was not a time to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Captain Returns 
</P>
<P>
Wuerker took the ship off automatic pilot and ordered the helmsman to change 
course. Capt. Tom Morse, who had stepped out for a moment, returned to the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Cap, I'm glad you're back," Wuerker said. "Would you keep an eye on the 
fishing boat? He's the only one of concern." 
</P>
<P>
Morse peered at a radarscope. Minutes passed without a word. Then chimes rang 
out at 10 p.m. and the captain, a casually dressed man with hair cropped neatly 
near the shoulder, finally spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't be a problem now unless he does something stupid," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
This was two Friday nights ago. The Arco Alaska was nearing the end of a 
2,025-mile voyage from Valdez, and one of its most difficult passages still lay 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Waters 
</P>
<P>
The oil tankers that last year brought 6.1 billion gallons of crude to Southern 
California, shipping experts say, face increasingly difficult waters near the 
Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors -- the nation's busiest port complex. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger and bigger tankers must compete for space with fleets of other cargo 
vessels -- some of them just as large -- and maneuver safely through the 
sometimes unpredictable movements of those who course the waters in boats, 
windsurfers and jet skis for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"You get all the weekend wonder people out there," the senior captain of the 
ship would say. 
</P>
<P>
In sharply angled channels, the safety margin for the big ships is measured in 
feet and inches. The largest tankers are so huge that they do not dock, using 
the harbor only as an anchorage. And the next largest class -- which includes 
the Arco Alaska -- draws so much water that the ships cannot be fully loaded. 
Even partly loaded, they might scrape bottom if they didn't wait for high tide. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:52, Point Fermin on the Palos Verdes Peninsula was directly north. Two 
dozen small boats lay ahead on the radarscope. It was time for the captain, 
with 19 years at sea, to take control from Wuerker, a two-year veteran and the 
mate on watch. 
</P>
<P>
Morse ordered the engines, which had been turning at 90 revolutions a minute, 
backed down to 60. He went back and forth from the dimly lit helm to the chart 
room to make sure the ship would pass clear of a sunken wreck just outside the 
harbor breakwater. He called out a sequence of course changes, shifting by 
degrees northward, slowing the ship further. His target was the Queen's Gate 
entrance on the Long Beach side of the breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing boats fell behind the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Help 
</P>
<P>
At 11:20 p.m., a swift boat came through the harbor entrance and bore down on 
the Arco Alaska. Minutes later, Lyle Trottier of Jacobsen Pilot Service Inc., 
who had been summoned from shore an hour earlier to guide the ship into port, 
clambered up a rope ladder onto the deck. 
</P>
<P>
A tug, the Pacific Escort, took up position on the right bow. On shore, in 
Jacobsen's radar room, President Dick Jacobsen, a pilot himself, manned the 
scope and radioed the ship's position to Trottier minute by minute. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ship's size is not so apparent at sea, the closer the Arco Alaska 
got to the entrance, the larger it seemed. From the bridge, 109 feet above the 
water, the ship dwarfed the breakwater. The entrance looked tight. To make 
matters worse, a dredge filling in what will eventually become more terminal 
facilities appeared to block the channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the dredge, we have to make a shallower turn than I like," Trottier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 952-foot Arco Alaska began to angle through, with 300 to 400 feet of 
clearance on the left and perhaps 500 feet in front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down to Business 
</P>
<P>
Casual conversation stopped. A five-second searchlight on the north end of the 
entrance swept the deck again and again with a reddish glare. Trottier threw 
out command after command with clipped precision. 
</P>
<P>
"Left 20," he said. Then: "Hard left. Thirty degrees left. Forty turns a 
minute. Midship! Hard right. 20 turns. Midship!" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the big ship was through, heading for a deep-water anchorage far from 
the docks, just inside the breakwater. At 12:26 a.m., with an enormous clanking 
roar, the 12-ton anchor dropped to the bottom. The Arco Alaska was at Anchorage 
C-14. 
</P>
<P>
And that is where the ship stayed until Sunday night two weeks later, when the 
second part of its navigation through the harbor would begin. 
</P>
<P>
These are not average times for tanker crews, and they know it. 
</P>
<P>
An all-hands letter from Jerry A. Aspland, president of Arco Marine 
International, was tacked to the mess bulletin board of the Arco Alaska. 
Aspland labels the Exxon spill "a disaster not only for Exxon but also for the 
entire oil industry," adding ominously: "While it didn't happen to us, it could 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Asking crew members not to "damage (their) personal reputation, that of the 
company or of seafarers in general," he urged them in the April 6 letter to 
avoid complacency on duty and to "be moderate" when ashore. In public, he said, 
Arco employees should "avoid criticism of Exxon" and "rally to the support of 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
During the last supper before the ship's arrival in port, the conversation had 
turned to the Exxon Valdez accident and the sudden attention on tanker 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being watched," Morse acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Exxon Valdez incident, the Coast Guard had begun phasing in a 
new alcohol and drug-testing program. The Coast Guard lowered the legal blood 
alcohol level from .10% to .04% and will soon require pre-employment tests, 
random examinations and testing after accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Arco -- with an eye on the example of fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood, whose blood alcohol level after the accident was more than the legal 
limit -- announced May 1 that it will subject all crew members to breath tests 
as they come on board and institute a program of random alcohol and 
drug-testing. 
</P>
<P>
While no major tanker spill has occurred in waters near Los Angeles, the Coast 
Guard's Los Angeles Marine Safety Office has investigated 127 accidents, 
including collisions, fires, groundings and equipment failures, which injured 
five and caused $6.5 million in damages from 1981 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1976 Accident 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular accident was the Dec. 17, 1976, explosion in San Pedro 
that destroyed the Liberian oil tanker Sansinema, killed nine men, blew out 
windows on shore and caused $21.6 million damage. The blast, caused by 
flammable vapors escaping from tanks, led to the requirement of inert gas 
systems to reduce the risk of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
In a more recent accident, the Navy oiler Roanoke collided with the Liberian 
tanker Mint Prosperity in fog just outside the breakwater on July 2, 1986. The 
Coast Guard ruled that the Navy ship had violated rules. "This is another case 
of a human getting into the loop and screwing things up," said Gary Gregory, 
Coast Guard head of port operations. 
</P>
<P>
On that Sunday night, refinery tanks at the Arco refinery in Carson were empty. 
The Arco Alaska prepared to move from Anchorage C-14 near the breakwater 
through the Long Beach Channel at Pier 121 in Long Beach. There, its high-speed 
pumps would force its cargo -- at 60,000 barrels an hour -- through a 42-inch 
pipeline that goes under city streets to tanks near the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Gray, 39, a resident of Peabody, Mass., was there replacing Morse, 
who had left for a two-month vacation. The pilot was Sam Jabuka, 58, who wore a 
jacket and tie as he came on board. Three tugs took position -- two on the bow, 
one on the stern. 
</P>
<P>
The anchor was aweigh at 9:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pier 121 was only 1 1/2 miles away, but it would take the giant ship -- moving 
first at the speed of a fast walk, then a stroll and finally no more than a 
baby's crawl -- until 11:08 p.m. to tie up with its first line. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m., only 100 feet separated the ship from the dock. Eight crew members 
readied winches and hawsers. On the dock, Arco Terminal employees prepared to 
catch heaving lines. With barely visible progress, the gap narrowed to 75 feet 
77 seconds later; to 50 feet in 86 seconds. At eight feet, Gray ordered pump 
man Glenn Woodford to call out every foot. It took five minutes and 16 seconds 
to close the gap to one foot. 
</P>
<P>
Yabuka, who was directing the tugs at this point, explained that the slowness 
is essential in maneuvering 188,000 tons of vessel and cargo. "You could tear 
all that out in a second," he said, gesturing at the solid-appearing concrete 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the ship was in position and the pumping began. Yabuka headed back to 
the pilot station where another assignment was waiting. It had been a good 
night so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Slid that baby in real easy," he said.
