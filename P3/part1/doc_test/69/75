DIVERS REMOVE 3RD STEEL PLATE DANGLING FROM HULL OF VALDEZ

Divers working underneath the Exxon Valdez on Sunday removed a third massive 
steel plate dangling from the oil tanker's hull, and worked to cut away several 
others while seas off San Clemente Island were calm. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage team, fearing that an earlier plan to catch the plates as they fell 
was too dangerous, allowed the plates to drop to the ocean floor, and Exxon 
Shipping Co. officials say they are uncertain whether any of the pieces will be 
retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, which peeled back from the hull during the Valdez's 2,200-mile trip 
from Alaska, prevent the tanker from clearing the bottom of San Diego Bay, 
where it is scheduled to dry-dock for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state and Exxon completed negotiations of conditions that would 
allow the ship into state waters, but are reviewing final drafts before 
declaring it an agreement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage crew Saturday cut off the largest of seven plates jutting downward 
from the hull, a piece about 70 feet long and 68 feet wide that weighs about 50 
tons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The first plate, an 11-ton piece measuring 32 by 15 feet, came off late Friday, 
and the remaining four smaller pieces are expected to be removed during the 
next three to four days, said Jan Cool, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is that they will work as quickly as they can, within conditions of 
maximum safety," Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel on Sunday was drifting 4 to 6 miles off San Clemente Island, amid 
swells of up to 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Divers lay on their stomachs inside the ship's open tanks to cut the plates, 
which dropped about 3,000 feet to the ocean floor, Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, divers planned to attach cables to the plates, cut them away bit by 
bit and transfer the pieces to a salvage barge. 
</P>
<P>
But concern that the divers' air and equipment hoses, which stem from the ship 
itself, could become tangled with the cables led to the decision to allow the 
plates to drop, Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard, which has jurisdiction over the federal waters in which 
the ship is drifting, authorized the decision, and is monitoring the location 
of the plates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was determined that we could not, because of sea conditions, safely remove 
those plates and catch them and yet protect the divers, too," Cool said. "It's 
quite a dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
She said it is unlikely that Exxon will retrieve the largest plates, because of 
the danger posed to divers, but that smaller pieces might be collected later. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no reason why there should be any concern about dropping these 
plates, from an environmental standpoint," she said. "But we will recover the 
ones we can recover safely." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef there March 24 and 
causing the nation's worst oil spill, along the Prince William Sound shoreline. 
The ship was scheduled to enter San Diego Bay on July 11 for repairs at 
National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery July 10 of the jutting plates, as well as the slicks and 
discharges, delayed its entry.
