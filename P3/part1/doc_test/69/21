Exxon was found guilty yesterday of recklessness over the worst US oil
spill, at Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989. The decision, in a federal
court in Anchorage, Alaska, exposed it to punitive damages of up to Dollars
15bn (Pounds 10bn).
The jury also found against Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the tanker
Exxon Valdez, which ran aground shortly after leaving the port of Valdez.
The verdict yesterday wiped 4 per cent off Exxon's share price, cutting the
market value of the biggest US company by more than Dollars 3bn. Its shares
closed at Dollars 59 5/8 , down Dollars 2 5/8 on the day.
During the trial, which began six weeks ago, it was claimed Mr Hazelwood was
drunk on the evening of the disaster and that Exxon had known for a long
time of his drinking problem. Mr Hazelwood testified he had been treated for
alcohol abuse in 1985, and Exxon, while aware of this, had allowed him to
return to sea without monitoring. At the time of the accident, he had gone
below deck, leaving a third mate in command on the bridge. He denied being
drunk, but admitted he had been drinking shortly before the ship left
Valdez.
The recklessness verdict opens the way for a further phase of the trial this
summer. The same jury will consider the scale of punitive damages to be paid
by the company. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who include 10,000 fishermen and
local land-owners, have asked punitive damages to be set at Dollars 15bn,
ten times the scale of the damages they are claiming.
Exxon said it would argue in court it should not be forced to pay punitive
damages. Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon chairman, said the company believed 'the
evidence presented in the next phases of the trial, showing what Exxon has
already spent and done, will convincingly demonstrate that no award of
punitive damages should be made.'
At an earlier stage in the legal proceedings, the trial judge rejected an
application by Exxon it should not have to disclose its financial wealth to
the jury before they decided on the scale of any damages. Hearings to assess
these are expected in about a month. Before then, the jury will consider
claims for actual damages against the company.
The Valdez disaster has already cost Exxon about Dollars 3.5bn. It paid
Dollars 1.1bn to settle federal and state charges, more than Dollars 2bn to
cleanse the contaminated coastline and Dollars 300m to settle civil claims
voluntarily.
