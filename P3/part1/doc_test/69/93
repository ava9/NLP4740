PROPOSAL INCLUDES FEE TO CLEAN UP OIL SPILLS

Declaring that California has escaped a disastrous oil spill only because of 
"sheer blind luck," two state officials proposed legislation Tuesday that would 
impose a 50-cent-per-barrel fee on oil to pay for spill cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis proposed the fee as part of 
a legislative package that would make the oil industry in California subject to 
tough new fines and regulations designed to force it to take steps to prevent 
tanker spills along the state's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Both officials, who are members of the State Lands Commission, said hearings 
conducted after the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound had taught them that the industry cannot be depended upon 
to take adequate measures on its own either to prevent spills or clean up after 
one has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned was that California was spared (an oil spill) not because of 
adequate preparation, not because of appropriate caution, but out of sheer 
blind luck," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Oil Spill Program 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. disagreed, saying the 
industry has begun its own oil spill program by pledging $250 million to create 
five regional oil spill centers capable of reacting immediately to spill 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Currie said the industry is also supporting federal legislation that 
would create a $1-billion cleanup fund. 
</P>
<P>
"What the industry asks is that they (the state) work with the industry to 
ensure that everything works together on both the state and federal level," she 
said. The state legislation, to be sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) 
and Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), would: 
</P>
<P>
* Create a $500-million superfund to pay for oil spill cleanups. The superfund 
would be financed by the 50-cent fee imposed on each barrel of oil unloaded at 
a California marine terminal. 
</P>
<P>
* Promote earlier participation by the Coast Guard in cleanup operations by 
providing that money from the fund could be used to reimburse the federal 
government for Coast Guard involvement. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish tough new safety rules and make oil tanker and marine terminals 
subject to a maximum $100,000-a-day fine if they failed to comply with the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
* Impose a $10-a-gallon fine for every oil spill and a $30-a-gallon fine if the 
spill is caused by "willful misconduct or negligence." 
</P>
<P>
* Create an office of oil spill response to direct cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
* Require tanker operators moving across state waters to prove that they had 
the resources to cover their liability for any spill. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish coastal tanker control facilities to prevent collisions and 
groundings. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert, who is also chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Oil Spill 
Prevention and Response Preparedness, said he will conduct hearings on the 
proposed legislation throughout the fall and formally introduce it early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Widespread Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the public knew just how unprepared we are right now to prevent 
this nightmare there would be widespread outrage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lempert and Keene acknowledged that the oil companies would probably pass the 
new fees on to consumers in higher oil prices, possibly as much as half a cent 
per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they pass it on to the consumer?" Keene asked. "They'll try." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said any increases in gasoline prices would be small compared with 
the 19-cent-per-gallon average rise in prices after the Valdez incident. "If 
they (the consumers) get hit with a half-cent increase at the gas pump, at 
least they get something for it," he said.
