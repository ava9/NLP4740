<P>
In its first official finding of fault in last year's Exxon Valdez oil spill in 
Prince William Sound, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday 
that all parties involved share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, and his crew should have been less 
fatigued and more alert, Exxon Corp. should have monitored more closely the 
alcohol treatment program in which Hazelwood was enrolled. And the Coast 
Guard's Vessel Traffic Service was inadequate, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
Had any one of these parties been more vigilant, "we could have avoided this 
accident," said NTSB member John K. Lauber. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were unveiled in Washington as NTSB staff members and senior 
officials met to assess their research about the disaster, caused when the 
tanker ruptured on March 24, 1989, after colliding with a reef in the sound. 
The 11-million-gallon oil spill, which has cost $2 billion so far to clean up, 
is the nation's largest and costliest. 
</P>
<P>
The board recommended that all companies operating oil tankers in Prince 
William Sound start alcohol treatment programs for employees, discourage crew 
members from working excessively long hours and train and monitor employees who 
are alcoholics and drug addicts to prevent relapses. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate finding, the board said that Hazelwood's decision to leave his 
third mate in charge of the tanker the night of the spill "was contrary to 
federal regulations and Exxon policy and was improper, given the course of the 
vessel." The board concluded that the mate was impaired by fatigue, which 
contributed to the collision with the reef. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also concluded that the judgment of the ship's skipper "was 
impaired by alcohol" during the critical period when the vessel was stuck on 
the reef and starting to lose oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We had eyewitnesses" who saw the captain and smelled his breath the night of 
the disaster, said NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad. 
</P>
<P>
The agency conducted its own tests and voice analyses to make sure that it did 
not accuse Hazelwood without hard evidence, Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Russo, Hazelwood's attorney, said that the board's efforts to prove 
his client was intoxicated were "feeble." 
</P>
<P>
"Their conclusions are not founded in the evidence," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of 
oil. He was fined $50,000 and ordered to spend 1,000 hours cleaning Alaskan 
beaches. He has appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and misconduct 
against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's master for nine months 
after he pleaded no contest to breaking Coast Guard rules. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Kolstad said the board hopes its report, which included 36 
safety recommendations, will help prevent future spills. Its analysis carries 
no force of law and, by statute, cannot be used in court cases.
