WHAT WENT WRONG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 240,000 barrels of crude oil that have spewed from the ruptured hull of the 
tanker Exxon Valdez since it ran aground Friday have blackened more than the 
pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
They also have sullied the credibility of Exxon Co. U.S.A, which owns the 
vessel, of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which manages the trans-Alaskan 
pipeline and of the state and federal officials whose responsibility it is to 
see that these private firms operate in a responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
This is a harsh judgment, but the facts of this shocking and unnecessary 
environmental catastrophe make no other possible. These facts also make it 
mandatory that Congress take a rigorous and skeptical look at the Bush 
Administration's claim that oil drilling can be expanded into the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge without unacceptable consequences. 
</P>
<P>
While the tardy and inexcusably chaotic cleanup of the worst oil spill ever to 
foul American waters proceeds, vexing questions demand answers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why were the vessel's master, who has a history alcohol abuse, and two 
senior officers absent from the bridge when it strayed out of the shipping 
channel? Why was an unqualifiedthird mate piloting the ship? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did Exxon officials fail so miserably in their responsibility to have 
an effective contingency cleanup plan in place? Why didn't they have the 
requisite equipment on site? Why did the company's officials move so slowly to 
contain the spill, thereby squandering the initial two days of good weather 
that might have made a quick cleanup feasible?. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did Alyeska rebuff earlier offers by Valdez city officials to stockpile 
cleanup equipment, assuring the local leaders -- falsely, as it now turns out 
-- that the oil companies had adequate supplies on hand? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did the Alaskan state government, which has the primary responsibility 
for legal oversight of these matters, fail to exercise it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why has the Bush Administration been so slow to intervene into what was 
from the first day obviously a major environmental crisis? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the President waited until Tuesday before sending senior aides to the 
scene of the spill, and even then seemed to express doubts that the federal 
government ought to take a major role in the cleanup. Bush's approach to this 
disaster is perplexing.
