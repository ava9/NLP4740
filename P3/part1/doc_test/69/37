Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence Rawl, faced at the oil giant's annual meeting 
today with angry shareholders and protesters calling Exxon a corporate 
criminal, rejected demands that he resign over his handling of the Alaskan oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl told stockholders that, in the wake of the tanker grounding that caused 
North America's worst oil spill, Exxon has ordered random drug and alcohol 
tests for employees in sensitive jobs, "including me." He also pledged the 
company will complete its cleanup of Alaska's Prince William Sound by September 
or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is no, I won't (resign)," Rawl told 2,000 shareholders in a packed 
hotel room for an annual meeting dominated by the oil spill issue. "It's 
anti-productive to even consider that." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters chanting "Make Exxon pay" confronted shareholders outside the hotel 
where the meeting was held. Some wore pig costumes and some stood on stilts so 
that stockholders could read signs with slogans such as "Exxon is organized 
crime" and "Exxon is human error." 
</P>
<P>
Along a long driveway leading to the hotel, demonstrators planted mock 
tombstones bearing the names of Alaska bays and inlets fouled by the nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound by the tanker 
Exxon Valdez on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and Alaska residents who own stock in Exxon pressed corporate 
management to speed cleanup efforts. Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for a coalition 
of five consumer and environmental groups, stepped to the microphone to call 
for Rawl's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl responded that his stepping down would be the "worst thing we could do 
now," and only divert the corporation's attention from the cleanup effort in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to say that is going to make you happy? To say I am going 
to make it disappear out there? Because I can't," Rawl said.
