VALDEZ TANK SAMPLES GO TO LAB; SUIT PUT ON HOLD

Samples taken from the tanks of the Exxon Valdez have been sent to an 
independent lab in Sorrento Valley in the hope of determining the makeup and 
toxicity of the milky blue substance that has sporadically discharged from the 
crippled tanker since last Monday, U. S. Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists were expected to finish gathering samples from within 15 of the 
Valdez's tanks by Monday afternoon, the officials said. Analysis of the 
material, earlier found to contain equal parts of weathered crude oil and 
marine life, could take up to a week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state authorities were drawing up written conditions Exxon Co. must 
meet before the Valdez can be moved into state waters for repairs, officials 
said. The negotiations put on hold a lawsuit filed Friday by the state against 
the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Exxon Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, more than 2,000 San Diegans demonstrated on Fiesta Island against 
Exxon, forming a replica of the well-known circle with a slash through it, 
around the word Exxon in large, black letters . 
</P>
<P>
"It was something San Diegans seemed really concerned about, so we took some 
action," said Pam Finn, program director for radio station KKYY-FM, which 
sponsored the early-morning protest. "San Diegans care about their environment. 
This was just a forum in which they could show the world that they do care, and 
that they don't want their waters polluted -- that even the slightest amount of 
oil is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. officials called the demonstration "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"I think if people know the facts . . . and then made their assessments, I 
think they would choose not to protest," said John Tompkins, the company's 
fleet services manager. 
</P>
<P>
The 987-foot tanker on Monday was 14 miles northeast of Pyramid Cove on San 
Clemente Island, the probable site for removal of large steel plates that are 
dangling from the ship's hull and preventing it from entering San Diego Bay for 
repairs, the Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said they had not sighted any new discharges from the tanker. However, the 
state Department of Fish and Game reported at about 1 p.m. seeing two new 
sheens -- a brownish slick 1,500 yards long by 200 yards wide and a bluish 
sheen about a mile in diameter -- about 10 miles southwest of the Valdez, in 
what is considered a shipping lane. The Coast Guard, which flew over the area 
after the report, found only the blue sheen, said Lt. Larry Solberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not it came from the Valdez is hard to say," he said. "The Coast 
Guard saw only one of them . . . and it was in a normal shipping lane." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissipating Rapidly 
</P>
<P>
Solberg said that the sheen was dissipating rapidly but that the Coast Guard 
was able to collect a sample of the substance for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The collection of samples from inside the Valdez's tanks is not expected to 
reveal much more than what scientists already know about the discharge, 
officials said. Coast Guard tests confirmed last week that the bluish-brown 
substance leaking from the Valdez contains both very old oil and marine life, 
in about equal parts. But it is unclear how dangerous or toxic the substance 
could be to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the state and I would like to know is the potential" of the 
discharge, said Gary Petrae, coordinator of scientific support for the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Assn. Petrae is heading the team of scientists 
gathering samples. "But I would estimate that the extremely toxic and even 
relatively toxic oil residues are gone." 
</P>
<P>
A state Fish and Game official said Saturday, however, that the discharged 
substance could pose serious environmental problems to marine life off San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's weathered oil, one of the problems in the Prince William 
Sound spill has been the effects on sea otters as the oil has moved through the 
food chain," said Reed Smith, pollution response coordinator for Fish and Game. 
"We feel there is pollution coming off (the Valdez), and that it could have the 
same kind of effect." 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, which was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and dumping 11 
million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, was scheduled to enter 
San Diego Bay last Tuesday for a nine-month, $25-million repair job at National 
Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entry Delayed 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery last Monday of dangling steel plates, which were peeled back 
during the 2,200-mile trip, and the discharges believed to be coming from the 
Valdez, have delayed its entry. 
</P>
<P>
The written agreement, expected to be drawn up by state officials late Monday 
or early today, will stipulate certain conditions that must be met before Exxon 
is allowed to move the tanker into state waters to remove the six massive 
plates that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, at least one of which is hanging about 70 feet from the bottom of 
the ship, prevent the vessel from clearing the bottom of San Diego Bay, where 
it will undergo repairs to the damage incurred in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the written terms are agreed to, there's no need to issue an injunction, 
because the very thing the injunction asked for has been accomplished," said Ed 
Manning, chief environmental counsel to Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, a member of the 
State Lands Commission, which joined the attorney general's office and the 
state Regional Water Quality Control Board in San Diego in filing suit last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The state agencies involved want to make sure all the conditions are taken 
care of, they're in writing and Exxon agrees to them," Manning said. "It's 
there as a safeguard." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions include no discharge of oil from the ship in state waters, which 
extend 3 miles from shore; a 24-hour waiting period between the last discharge 
and the moving of the ship to state waters; a contingency plan for prevention 
and cleanup of further discharges while in state waters; a biological study of 
the removal site before and after the tanker has the plates removed, and full 
liability for all costs incurred by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials are expected to agree to the conditions, which are similar to 
those issued Thursday by Fish and Game Director Pete Bontadelli, state 
officials said.
