<F P=106> [Appeal by the Union of Democratic Forces National </F>
Coordinating Council: "Blue Coalition Appeals for Joint Actions 
by All Democratic Organizations"; issued at meeting on 21 June] 
  [Text] After the people's vote of October 1991 was 
distorted and after the exhaustion of the possibilities of the 
parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], 
which was forced to become an opposition force and which for 18 
months has defended the positions of the SDS, the SDS no longer 
finds any reason for its parliamentary faction to participate in 
the work of this parliament. With its actions the parliamentary 
majority is destroying the notion of parliamentarianism, 
democracy, and constitutionalism, and alienates Bulgarian 
citizens from participating in political life. 
  The SDS warns of the danger of turning the Bulgarian 
parliament, controlled by the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
and its satellites, into a machine for recommunizing the country 
and returning to the methods of the communist dictatorship which 
existed for 50 years. 
  The pro-communist government of irresponsibility has caused 
mass poverty, raging crime, and moral deterioration, and has 
brought Bulgaria to the brink of a catastrophe. Lyuben Berov's 
cabinet has displayed extremely unworthy political behavior, 
which has compromised the basic principles of democracy. 
  In this fateful situation the only solution for Bulgaria is 
in holding early parliamentary elections in the autumn of 1994. 
These elections will give a clear four-year mandate to a worthy 
political force, which will assume responsibility for 
stabilizing and reviving Bulgaria, which is in a grave economic 
and moral crisis. 
  The SDS refuses to participate in political haggling or in 
forming a new cabinet within the framework of this parliament. 
  The SDS calls upon all the other political forces and 
parliamentary factions who declared their readiness to support 
early parliamentary elections to declare their clear refusal to 
support Lyuben Berov's cabinet, and participate in or support 
forming a new cabinet. 
  The SDS will continue to boycott the parliamentary sessions 
until the moment the National Assembly demonstrates a clear 
willingness to call early elections in the autumn. 
  The SDS is prepared to face the voters and assume 
responsibility for saving the country. 
  We call upon all democratic forces that share the SDS's 
principles and policy documents to carry out joint actions to 
save Bulgaria.
