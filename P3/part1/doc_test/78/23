  [Text] Sofia, April 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov today submitted before parliament a declaration on 
the cabinet's programme by year's end. Providing income 
adjustments after prices nearly doubled in late March and early 
April and offering national security guarantees were pointed as 
the major tasks facing the cabinet at that particular moment. 
The declaration also proposed that deputy prime ministers be 
put in charge of the social policy, structural adjustment in 
economy and foreign policy, and a minister, on foreign 
investments. 
  Prof. Berov's declaration was prompted by the demands of the 
pro- cabinet Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) which last week set 
April 25 as the deadline for the prime minister to come up with 
his proposals for changes in the social and economic departments 
of the cabinet and May 15 to submit a report on a new 
socioeconomic policy. 
  The cabinet's first task is to restore the lost 
prices-incomes balance and curb the rising inflation, Prof. 
Berov told the MP's. He proposed that an interdepartmental 
council on prices and incomes headed by a deputy prime minister 
be set up with the Council of Ministers to this end. He further 
vowed to bring the trade unions back to the negotiating table 
within the framework of the Tripartite Council by the end of 
this week and said the cabinet is ready to start serious 
negotiations. Bulgaria's two major labour organizations backed 
out of the tripartite negotiations after the cabinet declared it 
freezes the salaries in the state-financed sector. 
  Prof. Berov said a deputy prime minister should be appointed 
to coordinate and oversee the structural adjustment in economy. 
This step is aimed to overcome the cabinet's failure to make a 
headway with privatization, a situation which, "among other 
things, was brought about by a rift between the deputy prime 
minister in charge of privatization and the rest of the 
ministers", Prof. Berov's declaration read without naming any 
ministers. Privatization- related matters are now within the 
powers of Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev. A second 
deputy prime minister is needed to take over the foreign policy 
issues and coordinate the work of the different institutions in 
this sphere, according to the prime minister. He also said it 
is necessary to appoint a minister on trade and another one to 
take the lead of the Foreign Debt Management Committee and 
control the foreign investments. 
  Prime Minister Berov told the MP's he was considering 
changes 
in the Defence Ministry leadership. An updated programme will 
be submitted within two weeks to specify the cabinet's activity 
in two stages: the first one ending in September and the second 
one, with year's end. It will also specify the structural and 
personnel changes to be made in the cabinet. 
  An attempt of the opposition Union of the Democratic Forces 
(SDS) to put Prof. Berov's declaration to debates was voted down 
by the other parliamentary factions. SDS floor leader Stefan 
Savov asked what this declaration in fact sought to achieve, 
saying it proposed no specific personnel or structural changes, 
all the more that the cabinet had already had one programme on 
which it was formed in late 1992. Mr. Savov further reiterated 
SDS' stand that this Cabinet can no longer remain in office and 
cabinet overhauls would do no good. 
  "The assessments Prof. Berov's declaration makes are 
identical with those of the Socialist Party but what matters 
here is the prime minister's actions and the effect they will 
have," BSP floor leader Zhan Videnov said. According to Mr. 
Videnov, the personality of the those to enter the cabinet is of 
primary importance. He gave the cabinet a couple of weeks' time 
to make the effect of changes perceptible. 
  "We expected to see a more specific programme and proposals 
to underlie the forthcoming structural and personnel changes in 
the cabinet," ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
spokesman Yunal Lyutfi told a radio correspondent. 
  Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, whom the declaration 
indirectly pointed to in connection with future changes among 
senior Defence Ministry officials, said in the parliamentary 
lobbies he did not intend to resign adding that Prime Minister 
Berov was obviously subject to political pressure. 
  The MP's accepted a SDS motion that parliament tomorrow 
discuss the foreign-currency reserves and the cabinet's 
foreign-currency policy.
