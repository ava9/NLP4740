  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- No official report was 
released by 8 PM local time today on Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov's health, after the government said this morning that he 
was taken back to hospital on suspicion of having contracted 
hepatitis. On March 8 the prime minister had a heart attack and 
on March 11 he underwent a quadruple bypass operation. 
  Berov's doctors have not confirmed the hepatitis diagnosis, 
national radio quoted Gen. Vladimirov, boss of the National 
Security Service, as saying upon his return from the hospital. 
According to him, a medical statement will made by 1 PM 
tomorrow following more tests. 
  The premier's return to hospital set politicians discussing 
the fate of his cabinet. At a scheduled press conference today, 
the leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic Aleksandur 
Tomov said the Prime Minister's probable infection spoke volumes 
not only for the level of Bulgarian health care but for overall 
attitudes toward that man. According to Tomov, all people 
involved in the prime minister's treatment, including the health 
minister, should offer to resign. 
  According to Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Prof. 
Berov will be under quarantine for about a week. Berov's health 
did not prevent him from having two lengthy meetings with 
Matinchev, Bulgarian National Television said in its evening 
news broadcast. Berov's return proved more than what he was 
equal to, Matinchev told national television. He said he today 
advised the Prime Minister to reduce his contacts as much as 
possible, relinquishing his duties to his two deputies. 
  "I am sure Prof. Berov has a will to live and, most 
importantly, to rule this country", the ethnic Turks' leader 
Ahmed Dogan told the press following a meeting with President 
Zhelev. According to the Presidential Press Office, the 
president and Dogan discussed the country's finances and 
economy. At this stage, a cabinet overhaul may be appropriate 
but it should be proposed by the prime minister and coordinated 
with all parliamentary factions, said Dogan. Parliament and 
politicians may be unprepared for any other option, said Dogan. 
According to him, the current developments may grow into a 
political crisis. 
  The health of the state depends on the health of a single 
state leader; Bulgaria cannot do without a prime minister under 
the present Constitution, Stefan Savov, floor leader of the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), today told national 
television. The coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) today discussed possible action in case the cabinet cannot 
stay in control in Berov's absence, BSP floor leader Nora 
Ananieva told the same broadcast. Berov's sickness necessitates 
immediate consultations, said Gospodin Atanasov MP of the New 
Union for Democracy (NSD). A resignation tendered by the 
premier would be in keeping with the Constitution; otherwise, 
the way out is a vote of no confidence, said another NSD MP, 
Ruslan Semerdzhiev, adding he would vote no confidence in such 
circumstances.
