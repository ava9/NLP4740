  [Text] I think there is a possibility that Lyuben Berov's 
statement on cabinet changes, which he is expected to make this 
Thursday, will receive greater parliamentary support, Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civic Alliance for the Republic [GOR], 
declared after his meeting with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the DPS 
[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]. 
  Today we may expect a very important development in the 
position of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] on approving 
the cabinet changes, assuming of course the demands of the 
parties making up the NSD are satisfied, Tomov told our reporter 
Antoaneta Puncheva. One should not permit any single political 
force to dominate the cabinet, Tomov said, because in such a 
situation it is certain that the cabinet will fall. 
  Aleksandur Tomov stated at a news conference held earlier 
that the GOR will issue a statement on the government changes 
and a statement on the government's intentions at the plenary 
session of parliament as soon as they are finally drafted.
