  [Text] Sofia, June 28 (BTA) -- The leadership of the two 
major parliamentary forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) -- discussed the 
current political situation at their regular sessions today. 
Later on their leaders spoke before journalists of possible 
early elections. 
  The SDS has been insisting on early general elections for 
almost 18 months. The Socialists declared themselves for early 
parliamentary elections at their latest congress. 
Representatives of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms (DPS), on the mandate of which the incumbent cabinet 
was formed, have also mentioned early elections this autumn. 
However, these elections have not been scheduled yet. On June 
26 President Zhelyu Zhelev repeated his proposal to the 
political forces to reach an agreement on the date of the 
elections, which according to him, should be held this autumn. 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has also proposed an agreement 
between the political forces on early elections. The idea for 
an agreement between the political forces on the holding of 
elections was also launched last Sunday in an interview with BSP 
deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov. 
  Before the elections it is necessary to tackle urgent tasks 
such as the launching of mass privatization, completion of the 
work of the liquidation councils (liquidating the former 
cooperative farms and returning the land to its former owners), 
normalization of Bulgaria's international finance and economic 
positions and guaranteeing this country's internal and external 
security, BSP leader Zhan Videnov said today. We should also 
decide on the withdrawal of the government and the giving up of 
the mandates of the parliamentary forces to form a new cabinet 
within this parliament, which would be obligatory for the 
faction of the Socialists too. It is also necessary to prepare 
the elections from a purely legal point of view -- amendments to 
the constitution if necessary, amendments to the electoral law 
and the laws on local government, Videnov said. 
  According to SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, there are 
considerable differences between the stand of the SDS and the 
other political forces on the issue of early parliamentary 
elections. "Last Tuesday the SDS committed itself to early 
elections as a political force," Dimitrov stressed. According 
to him, it is not enough for leaders, including Socialists, to 
express their personal views in favour of early elections. The 
decision of the supreme SDS leadership of last Tuesday entails 
commitments which should be undertaken by all political forces 
insisting on early elections. According to the SDS, the 
political forces should commit themselves to no-confidence in 
the cabinet of Lyuben Berov, to giving up their mandate for 
forming a new cabinet within the framework of the incumbent 
parliament and to opposing any attempts to form such a cabinet. 
  The leadership of the SDS and the DPS or part of them are 
insincere in their call for early parliamentary elections, BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov said today. By way of illustration he cited 
the draft of Prime Minister Berov of a framework agreement 
between the political forces providing for elections in the 
autumn of 1994, which according to him was spoilt by the DPS, 
and the preconditions and tactical schemes leading to elections 
set by SDS leaders during the negotiations held with the SDS 
last week at the request of the BSP. The BSP is seeking 
prospects for a left-of-centre agreement on pre-elections and 
post-elections actions, Videnov recalled. 
  An official agreement between parliamentary and 
extraparliamentary forces on early elections and the accession 
to this agreement of state institutions would confirm the 
attitude of the different political formations on early 
elections this autumn, BSP deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov said at 
today's press conference. "I believe that such a proposal would 
help us verify the sincerity of all who have shown an attitude 
to early elections," he said. In an interview for today's issue 
of DEMOKRATSIYA SDS leader Filip Dimitrov says that what matters 
is not the word agreement but party commitment. "I have learnt 
from experience that an agreement may be full of traps, such as 
for example certain laws which will have to be passed," Dimitrov 
said.
