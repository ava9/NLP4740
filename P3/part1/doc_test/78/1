<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F>
Assembly] 
  [Text] The situation here continues to unfold. Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov met in the parliament with Zhan Videnov, 
leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], and Ahmed Dogan, 
leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. After the 
meeting Dogan said that the DPS will support the framework 
agreement proposed by the government, if it is supported by at 
least four parliamentary factions. Dogan did not specify what 
factions precisely should support the agreement, but he does not 
exclude a situation in which the cabinet will have to resign. 
  According to Zhan Videnov, procedural issues were discussed 
at the meeting with Prime Minister Berov on consultations 
between the prime minister and the parliamentary factions. 
  Nora Ananieva said that real consultations are yet to be 
held, and it appears that precisely this is taking place at 
present at the National Assembly's West Hall, where the prime 
minister is meeting with BSP representatives and two 
representatives of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD]. Mr. 
Oktay of the DPS entered the hall, saw what is happening there, 
left the hall, and refused to make any statements. 
  Dr. Yordan Todorov of the NSD said that he is attending the 
meeting as a representative of his faction, but the NSD will 
nevertheless insist on holding separate talks with the prime 
minister. 
  Deputy Ivan Pushkarov has not been offered the post of 
deputy 
prime minister. If signing an agreement is on the agenda, 
Pushkarov's people will not sign. It is not the business of the 
prime minister to make such moves, Pushkarov said. Several 
seconds ago Yunal Lyutfi of the DPS joined the meeting that is 
taking place at the National Assembly's West Hall.
