  [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- Yesterday's resignation of 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev 
is in the highlights of today's press. Most dailies carry 
frontpage reports commenting on Mr. Karabashev's motives. The 
fate of Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev was decided by his 
Alternative Social Liberal Party (ASP) as early as last week, 
reads an editorial in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS). It goes on to say that Mr. 
Karabashev's resignation had to do with the privatization by 
businessmen close to the ASP of two hotels in the Sunny Beach 
resort on the Black Sea. Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov, the 
other ASP representative in the cabinet, will stay on for the 
time being. However, the private STANDART NEWS writes that Mr. 
Bikov was likely to resign, too. He had told the daily's report 
that he considered doing so. 
  24 CHASA carries an interview with Mr. Karabashev. "At first 
I was offered to stay as a deputy prime minister or a minister 
without portfolio, but in the course of the conversation I had 
with Mr. Berov it did not become clear to me what my 
responsibilities were supposed to be. Using other sources, I 
found out that he himself was unclear about it," he said. In 
his opinion, what the prime minister intends to do would be 
disastrous to the government. 
  OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK writes that "after Valentin Karabashev's 
resignation (backed by the parliamentary New Union for 
Democracy, which withdrew its support from Lyuben Berov's 
cabinet) the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) will now 
find itself in the spotlight and will hardly muster the courage 
to accept the conditions of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP).... Facing the threat of ultimate discredit if they do 
so, it would be no surprise if the DPS decide to follow suit and 
withdraw their support from the cabinet, thus prompting 
procedures for the formation of a new cabinet. 
  KONTINENT comments on the same issue under the headline 
"Struggle for Ministerial Posts." "The resignation of Mr. 
Karabashev as deputy prime minister paves the way for the formal 
procedures for the expected structural and personal changes 
which the government and parliament have been using for months 
to fool the crisis-crushed electorate." "The cabinet overhaul 
has nothing to do with the work the ministers have or have not 
done for the nation; it has to do with the work they have or 
have not done to satisfy certain private interests," the daily 
comments. 
  Newspapers hurry to prognosticate on the future members of 
the cabinet. STANDART NEWS mentions the names of Emil Khursev, 
ex-vice governor of the central bank, Aleksandur Tomov, leader 
of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR, a centrist 
formation which split off from the BSP), and Chavdar Kunchev, 
head of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank, as possible candidates 
for the post of deputy prime minister on the foreign debt. 
According to DEMOKRATSIYA and STANDART NEWS, the next minister 
of trade would be Bulgaria's Ambassador to Japan Konstantin 
Glavanakov, a friend of ex-Prime Minister and MP of the BSP 
Andrey Lukanov.
