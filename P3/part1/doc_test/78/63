<F P=106> [From BTA's 11 May "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The press provides 
extensive comments on the forthcoming cabinet changes. Most 
dailies say that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov can hardly be 
expected to introduce the intended cabinet changes before 
parliament today, as promised in an interview last Sunday. 
DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), quotes 
Socialists' parliamentary floor leader Nora Ananieva as saying 
that the document which the prime minister gave to the 
parliamentary forces contained just outlines. Interviewed for 
TRUD, MP Osman Oktay of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) says that the prime minister has not 
convinced the DPS that Rumen Genchev, Prof. Berov's nominee as 
the third deputy prime minister, is competent for this office. 
"DPS disapproves of Gechev's nomination as deputy prime 
minister", STANDART NEWS says in a front-paged headline. 
According to DUMA, in most probability the DPS position is a 
bid for a deal involving influence in key departments. The DPS 
MP's, who are expected to meet with the prime minister on 
Thursday [12 May], oppose the BSP interference in the cabinet's 
overhaul and advised the prime minister against introducing the 
cabinet changes before parliament today, 24 CHASA writes. 
Referring to what are described as well informed sources, 
DEMOKRATSIYA cites former parliamentary DPS deputy floor leader 
Sherife Mustafa as saying that she would not support the prime 
minister's proposal for changes because "she does not want to go 
to prison together with Ahmed Dogan (leader of the DPS)". DUMA 
says that Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is the likely 
deputy prime minister, and MP Gospodin Atanasov of the New Union 
for Democracy (expelees or breakaways from the Union of 
Democratic Forces) will probably be nominated as the new 
minister of justice. "The Socialists describe Stoyan 
Aleksandrov's threat for some ministers resigning en bloc and 
his claim he could cope with Bulgaria's foreign debt problem 
alone as overdoing it," DUMA says. "They All Fell Out," reads 
the headline of an article in DEMOKRATSIYA which says that the 
BSP and the DPS will wait until the conference of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) is held. According to KONTINENT, the 
overhaul of the cabinet has been put off until May 18. "The 
second overhaul of the cabinet stands a good chance of entering 
the Guinness Book of Records as the most time- taking bargain 
ever in world practice," a signed commentary in KONTINENT says. 
An editorial commentary in 24 CHASA says that the tourist 
season and the cabinet overhaul seem to have a common fate: both 
ending before ever starting. DUMA writes in a commentary that 
both the prime minister and the parliamentary forces will 
benefit by protracting the overhaul. OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes 
President Zhelyu Zhelev as saying that he is skeptical about the 
cabinet overhaul. STANDART NEWS writes that MP's have opened 
negotiations on a new cabinet. [passage omitted]
