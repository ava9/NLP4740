  [Excerpts] Sofia, March 31 (BTA) -- Between March 25 and 
March 31 Prime Minister Lyuben Berov had working meetings with 
Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms and leader of its parliamentary group; Nora Ananieva, 
floor leader of the Parliamentary Alliance for Social Democracy; 
Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party; and 
Stefan Bozhilov and Georgi Kostov, co-chairmen of the 
parliamentary New Union for Democracy, BTA learned from the 
Government Press Office. [passage omitted] 
  The political leaders discussed some shortcomings in the 
work 
of certain governmental structures which decelerate the 
realization of the government's programme. Professor Berov 
suggested some structural changes in the cabinet which he moved 
for discussion to the parliamentary groups. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov stated his views on the ways for 
overcoming the crisis in the foreign exchange market. He 
stressed the decisiveness of the Government to take to a 
successful completion the negotiations on the country's foreign 
debts, push the privatization process and accelerate the 
structural reform in industry and agriculture. 
  According to the attending team of physicians, Mr. Berov's 
health is stable. His recuperation proceeds in keeping with the 
outlined programme. He is allowed to make the necessary phone 
calls, hold meetings and work with documents.
