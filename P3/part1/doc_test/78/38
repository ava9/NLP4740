<F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Levi: "Prince Turned Out To Be a </F>
Beggar"] 
  [Text] Before the plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP] held yesterday, 13 March, there was much talk about the 
luxurious cloak of pluralism that the BSP wanted to show off in 
the fashion show that they called a "debate." A show did indeed 
take place, but the models on the catwalk lacked variety, and 
this clearly demonstrated that the king was naked. 
  The gray-hairs were the first to gasp with horror at the 
cloak. They started complaining that the fashion designers had 
not included some very important accessories that they had 
suggested. In the "Panorama" program on television on the 
evening of 12 March, [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov assured them that 
the king's clothes were made up of at least five pieces, and 
that one of these was theirs. 
  However, in the show itself it turned out that the assembled 
fans of the king prefer one-piece designs, such as a sack with 
holes cut out for the head and arms. This was what the chief 
tailor Aleksandur Lilov actually proposed. He presented his 
design, called "New Times, a New Bulgaria, a New BSP," but at 
the very start apologized because, due to lack of funds, it was 
a more gaudy version of the miserable garments in which the 
party emerged from the 39th and 40th BSP Congresses, which were 
the "Manifesto for Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for 
Further Renewal of the BSP." Aleksandur Lilov passed over with 
smile the creation of his chief competitor -- the house of 
Kyuranov, Yonchev, Dureva, and Sons. The public also ignored 
them, finding their well-known extravagance all too familiar. 
For this reason, the debates centered on the draft document, 
not the draft documents. This time, the extravagance of the 
social democrats in the BSP showed itself in the fact that the 
only difference between their draft document and Lilov's was its 
length -- they set their faith in placing "personnel mines" 
(again due to lack of funds). 
  The other designers, from the "Marxist Platform," 
Alternative 
Socialist Association, and "Road to Europe," contented 
themselves with saying that they would present their versions in 
a week's time, and that they would not be different, but merely 
a critical comment on the main design. Some wanted to tack onto 
the latter a piece on the left side, others wanted to put it on 
the right side, and yet others wanted to cover up the holes cut 
out in the front -- that is, in the center. 
  Some observers on the sidelines expressed their amazement 
that all the models looked as if they had come out of the same 
fashion house, with all of them carrying the same decoration in 
the very front, namely "democratic socialism." In addition, all 
of them circle around the hat of "power." 
  At the end the chief advertising agent [DUMA Editor in 
Chief] 
Stefan Prodev complained that no money was available to publish 
individual photographs of the models, which were in any case 
identical. 
  In the final analysis, what emerged from the meeting will be 
demonstrated to the people in the next elections, so that all 
will be able to see that the king is naked and the prince is a 
beggar. Otherwise, the show goes on.
