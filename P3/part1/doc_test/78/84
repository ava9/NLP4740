<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F>
Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Dora Chichkova in Sofia on 6 
June: "If You Fight Battles of the Past You Remain in the Past"] 
  [Text] Zhan Videnov gave DUMA this interview after a long 
and sleepless night on the fourth day of the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] congress. Very tired, with bloodshot eyes -- which, 
according to people close to him, he has had for months -- he 
changed all known notions of ability to work and physical and 
moral stamina. He was chased by a mob of journalists, who no 
longer attach a different family name to his name, and remained 
calm, confident, and generous, as the undisputable leader of the 
greatest and staunchest Bulgarian party. 
  [Chichkova] Did you anticipate such an unconditional victory 
as party leader? 
  [Videnov] It is difficult for me to assess this. I can only 
say that I did not have any problems with the congress' tactic, 
because it fully springs from the strategy I have followed over 
the last two and a half years. This is a rather simpler, but 
very efficient strategy -- it relies on consistency, dignity, 
openness, and selflessness. Others relied on different schemes, 
and I think that they made a mistake, because as we all 
constantly say, the BSP is a changing party. None of its 
congresses repeats the previous one. Whoever wants to fight the 
battles of the past should remain in the past. 
  [Chichkova] I had the feeling that this was a struggle not 
only for the formal, but also for the informal BSP leadership. 
Does the congress put an end to the inner-party theme of the 
dual character of the power, and the theme about the existence 
of two or even more centers of power in the party? 
  [Videnov] I think that the existence of different sources of 
political impulse within the BSP is not only a trouble but a 
source of wealth for the BSP. We got used to working under such 
conditions and utilizing its advantages. We almost completely 
eliminated its obvious risks. Therefore, I do not view the 
problems regarding the BSP leadership as an action aimed at 
annihilating certain weapon emplacements of the enemy. On the 
contrary, I strive to connect all those manifestations of talent 
and initiative, responsibility and human dignity, into a common 
net. There are thousands of such manifestations, they form the 
BSP power, and there is no reason to separate them. 
  [Chichkova] Are you concerned with the future relations with 
the BSP Sofia city organization? I mean the recent tension that 
was evoked and the results of the congress. 
  [Videnov] I do not see reason for a lasting conflict. The 
BSP Sofia city organization was represented very strongly at the 
congress. I had the opportunity both to understand the 
congress' thinking and contribute to its forming. I think that 
in this process the Sofia delegates became convinced that they 
must correct some of their postulates. For example, the issue 
regarding the leaders' morals as a BSP problem. This could be 
the basic problem of another party, or a certain former party, 
but not of the BSP! No, this really is not a BSP problem. 
  I do not think that the party has the right to utilize its 
basic problems in an attempt to resolve tactical tasks. I mean 
ideological problems, management problems, and problems related 
to the party's dignity. Those problems must remain outside the 
realm of tactics. Tactical goals should be pursued by tactical 
means. The congress created the opportunity to utilize such 
means. I rejoice not at the fact that they failed, but at the 
fact that with certain minor exceptions, such means were not 
used at all. This shows that the party clearly distinguishes 
between its strategy and tactics, and is not inclined to use 
every acutely topical issue as a combat weapon. 
  [Chichkova] At the beginning of your first mandate you said 
something like "there is no Zhan Videnov political line." What 
could you say at the beginning of your second mandate? 
  [Videnov] If I remember correctly, I said that Zhan 
Videnov's political image is not clear to the party, and that if 
the party selected him, it must be aware of the risk it is 
taking. I do not know whether the party accepted this risk with 
open or closed eyes. I think that they were half opened. 
  Now, I again would warn the party of the same thing, as far 
as the leaders' issue is concerned. I did everything that 
depends on me to help the party form, clarify, and stress its 
ideological image. I did this also through my participation in 
the congress. I think that now the party has a better 
opportunity to calculate the risk it took. The new risk the 
party will have with its reelected leader is that ... I go a bit 
too far in seeking unity of ideas, words, and deeds. I demand 
this not only from myself, but also from all the rest, and the 
party as a whole. There are complex and deeply rooted inert 
processes in our party, and they change very slowly. In any 
event, I did not offend anyone. As far as the half-opened eyes 
are concerned, they could open completely at the next congress. 
  [Chichkova] Do the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress 
regarding the BSP political line preclude future dramatic splits 
such as the one that emerged at the last vote of confidence in 
the cabinet? 
  [Videnov] The congress confirmed the correctness of the 
political line implemented after the 1990 40th BSP Congress, 
despite all the complex vicissitudes in the political situation 
since then. I think that the congress' work was facilitated to a 
large degree by the last plenum of the BSP Supreme Council. It 
produced a good analysis, clear assessment, and precise 
explanation of the need for change. The congress understood the 
reasons why we maintained the line of stabilization throughout 
all those difficult months, and the reasons that prompted the 
change in this line. We decided to seek a solution through 
early elections this fall. 
  [Chichkova] Are the specific steps the BSP intends to adopt 
to win those elections clear? 
  [Videnov] We have two basic tasks. The first is to complete 
what we planned, paid for, and practically accomplished in the 
activity of the parliament and our relations with the cabinet. 
The second is to guarantee that free, honest, and democratic 
elections be held in Bulgaria in a stable situation, and that 
those elections will produce a mandate for a lasting and 
successful leftist-centrist government. 
  The first task is very difficult, but it could be 
implemented. I do not have the illusion, as some of the 
congress delegates, that from now on every parliamentary week 
will be similar to the last one. No, they will be completely 
different, and it will constantly be more difficult. 
  The second task is even more difficult, not because of the 
danger of an authoritarian degeneration of the transition or 
radical changes in the political situation and the positions of 
the other political forces. (I do not think that those 
possibilities are very plausible, but I do not underestimate or 
exclude them.) The difficult part is to overcome the thinking 
that we can assert ourselves through the negation of others. We 
must rely on the principle according to which we could and must 
negotiate with everyone. 
  Moreover, after two and a half years it is high time to 
soberly assess the possibilities of a practical leftist-centrist 
agreement. Unfortunately, such an agreement does not depend only 
on us. I assess the situation in the Bulgarian leftist and 
leftist-centrist forces as very bad. However, with a bit more 
commitment, consistency, insistence, and concentration of the 
BSP efforts, the situation there could probably change. 
  [Chichkova] Do you like the new BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Videnov] Yes, I definitely like the new BSP Supreme 
Council. I think that it can accomplish a lot. I rejoice 
equally at its new members and at the fact that the continuity 
in its membership represents the confidence in what my closest 
associates in the party and parliamentary leadership have 
accomplished in the last two and a half years.
