  [Text] On 5 January Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP], came to 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters 
of the Union of Democratic Forces, SDS], where he met Filip 
Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating Council. 
The meeting took place at the insistence of the BSP. After the 
meeting the two leaders made statements on the more important 
aspects of their meeting. First the host, Filip Dimitrov: 
  [Begin Dimitrov recording] The first topic we discussed was 
the issue of the parliamentary order and the risks involved in 
violating this order if the parliament will be paralyzed until 
new elections take place. This could be a period of time during 
which Bulgaria would have a caretaker cabinet. It is well-known 
that the SDS submitted a proposal on amending the Constitution 
in this aspect. 
  We also discussed the issue of the Supreme Judicial Council. 
The position of the SDS on this matter is very clear. We think 
that the BSP position on this matter is anticonstitutional, and 
I explained this to Mr. Videnov. 
  The third issue he invoked was related to the differences of 
the two major political forces in anything related to the matter 
of municipal by-elections. The possibility of eliminating the 
differences was discussed. We think that not allowing parties 
that are not represented in the parliament, to participate in 
those elections is an illegal act. However, we will think in 
the future about the specific form of resolving this problem. 
  Generally, I would say that the visit was an indication of 
the problems that are discussed or that exist in the BSP, and I 
think that the SDS could not be expected to get involved in 
those problems. [end recording] 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that he is satisfied with the 
meeting because the conversation clarified the positions of the 
two most important political forces in Bulgarian public life, 
and this according to him means regulating political life, 
imbuing it with a predictable and normal character. This is 
what Zhan Videnov said: 
  [Begin Videnov recording] We discussed the necessity of 
guaranteeing the functioning of the parliament and the 
developments of the political life of the country, regardless of 
the shortcomings of the constitutional and legal arrangements. 
We also discussed the necessity of eliminating the existing 
normative and judicial obstacles that prevent the main political 
forces from fully participating in municipal by-elections. 
  We made our proposals in this sphere and clarified our 
positions. Relevant information was exchanged between the main 
political organs of the two parties. We do not plan new 
meetings, but perhaps specific future parliamentary and 
political actions will emerge as a result of our meeting today. 
[end recording]
