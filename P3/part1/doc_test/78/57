  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- The MP's of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic (GOR) will shortly break away from the 
parliamentary group of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), GOR 
leader Aleksandur Tomov told the press today. The Alliance was 
set up by 46 Bulgarian politicians, scientists, intellectuals 
and public figures last May as a non-profit public organization. 
In February it re-registered in court as a movement under the 
Political Parties Act. The Alliance claims that it has over 
25,000 members. 
  According to Tomov, the decision to split off from the 
parliamentary group of the Socialist Party (the former 
Communists) was taken last December but it is only now that the 
obstacles to a final break have been removed. 
  The main reason for the delay, Tomov said, was the passage 
of 
the 1994 Budget Act on February 28. In the coming days Tomov 
will officially inform the parliament chairman and the 
parliamentary group of the BSP-led coalition of GOR's step. 
  So far five GOR members have declared in writing they are 
leaving the parliamentary group of the BSP, STANDART NEWS said 
today. It takes ten MP's to set up a new group. If fewer MP's 
support GOR, they will go independent, according to Petya 
Shopova MP, quoted in the same daily. 
  Tomov today held a lengthy conversation with Ahmed Dogan, 
leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, on 
whose mandate the present cabinet headed by Lyuben Berov was 
formed. Tomov and Dogan reached the conclusion that no cabinet 
crisis is in the offing and it would be unethical to call for a 
cabinet reshuffle or for consultations for a new cabinet.
