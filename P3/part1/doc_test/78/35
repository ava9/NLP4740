  [Text] Sofia, June 14 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
is likely to nominate a replacement this week for Deputy Prime 
Minister and Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev, who has 
resigned, Socialist leader Zhan Videnov told a regular briefing 
today. It became clear that with this absolutely necessary 
change the cabinet will work until the elections. According to 
Videnov, the personnel and structural changes demanded from the 
prime minister by the Socialists in return for support for the 
cabinet would have made sense only if they had rallied the 
parliamentary majority to support the cabinet. Since this did 
not materialize and Bulgaria is heading for elections in the 
autumn, structural and personnel changes became rather 
pointless, Videnov said. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov yesterday submitted a proposal 
to 
parliament to relieve Karabashev of his post and appoint Kiril 
Tsochev in his place, it was announced later on. The Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) will not demand changes other than those 
already proposed, Videnov said after a meeting of the BSP 
parliamentary group this afternoon. According to him, the 
Socialists will not object to Tsochev's appointment as deputy 
prime minister as well. 
  The BSP may back a motion by the Fatherland Party of Labour, 
its coalition partner, that parliament give up its summer recess 
in view of the possibility of elections in the autumn. 
According to Videnov, it is worth taking a shorter holiday so 
as to pass on second reading the Army and Armed Forces Bill or 
elections-related legislation. Videnov said the Army is in dire 
straits and it is unlikely that 2,000 million leva needed in the 
second half of the year will be allocated. Videnov has proposed 
to President Zhelev to convene the National Security 
Consultative Council for a discussion of this issue. 
  The mayoral election in Veliko Turnovo (central Bulgaria) on 
Sunday [12 June] gives us grounds to believe that the trend to 
support the Union of Democratic Forces has begun to give way, 
Doncho Konakchiev, member of the BSP supreme leadership, said 
when asked to comment on the election results. The election was 
declared invalid because of a low turn-out. According to 
Konakchiev, the results show that a change in the reform model 
is needed. According to Videnov, the BSP reached 65 per cent of 
its electoral potential in Veliko Turnovo and its supporters 
were obviously the more active. Clearly, people are not 
interested in local elections yet and parliamentary elections 
are all that matters for the time being, Videnov said.
