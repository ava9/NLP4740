  [Text] Yesterday the leaders of the ASP [Alternative 
Social Liberal Party] issued a reminder that the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] and DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] 
deputies could not muster 121 votes, the minimum needed for 
parliament to adopt decisions. ASP Organizational Secretary 
Vasil Velinov said that if Berov gives in to all the BSP's 
demands for cabinet changes, he will have to propose them in a 
half-empty chamber, thus delivering an unmistakable hint that 
the deputies in the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] group would 
simply boycott parliament if Berov were to reach full accord 
with the Socialists. 
  The ASP leaders have no intention of meeting or holding 
consultations with the BSP or Berov. According to Velinov, with 
the DPS they had merely held "free discussions" that produced no 
concrete results, and that they would have a meeting with the 
Center for New Policy after the latter's national conference in 
Veliko Turnovo at the end of the week. 
  The position of the ASP on whether it would support the 
cabinet and on the forthcoming structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet should become known after the meeting of the ASP 
Political Council next Tuesday [10 May]. 
  Following a further meeting between Berov and the BSP, it 
became clear that the BSP would find out on Monday how many 
posts it will obtain in the imminent cabinet shuffle. Berov is 
to announce the new names in parliament on Wednesday 11 May. 
Despite having been given a written document explaining the 
concept behind the cabinet changes, the Socialist leadership is 
reportedly not satisfied and has established differences in 
principle with Berov's intentions. At their last meeting with 
Berov, the BSP leaders reported did not accept the prime 
minister's idea of converting the power industry and forestry 
committees into ministries and of merging the tourism and trade 
departments.
