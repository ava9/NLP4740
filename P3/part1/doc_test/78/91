  [Text] Already for the fifth time, the Bulgarian 
parliament served up to the voters its favorite show -- a 
no-confidence vote in Professor Berov's cabinet. This is a show 
because hardly anyone would seriously consider the possibility 
of toppling the cabinet against the background of the existing 
political situation. 
  The result again showed that except for the parliamentary 
faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] which proposed 
the no-confidence vote, and several independent deputies, all 
other parliamentary forces firmly support the cabinet. This 
means of course, that they do not want early elections. 
  There are two reasons causing this attitude. 
  First, no one, including those who proposed the vote, is 
prepared for new elections. The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
is not yet ready with its political program, which is expected 
to determine how leftist the party is. For its part the SDS has 
not shaken the hangover caused by the fall of Filip Dimitrov's 
cabinet, and is not sure whether the process of expelling 
various members has ended. Hence, the SDS boldly attacks the 
cabinet with no-confidence proposals, standing absolutely no 
risk whatsoever that the proposals will be adopted. For its 
part, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] is not even 
sure that it can contend with the existing 4 percent minimum. 
  The second reason is of a purely personal nature. Many of 
the current 240 deputies are not sure about their place in the 
next election lists, or even whether they will figure in those 
lists. Therefore, every additional month in the life of this 
cabinet and parliament literally represents net profit for them. 
  Thus, the no-confidence votes are a pure show for naive 
voters. However, it appears that they are fed up with this show.
