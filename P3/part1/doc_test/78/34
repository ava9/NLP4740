  [Text] In an interview on Khorizont's "Konkurenti" 
[Competitors] program this morning, National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov said that the only way out of the political 
situation that is developing is to hold early parliamentary 
elections. He described everything else as halfhearted, 
obscure, and vague. The country needs a government that has the 
will to push the reform through, the speaker of parliament 
stressed. He pointed out that the present problems are 
connected with the policies of the majority, to which he himself 
does not belong, so his conscience is clear. 
  Aleksandur Yordanov revealed his conviction that it is now 
the turn of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to make a move. 
He said that the BSP should either commit itself more firmly to 
the Lyuben Berov cabinet or it should withdraw its support, 
pointing out that the BSP is waging a losing battle in either 
case.
