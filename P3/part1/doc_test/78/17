  [Text] At the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
Congress, which opened today, party leader Zhan Videnov read a 
report on the party's political line. Sasha Karakaksheva, 
chairperson of the BSP All-Party Control Commission, reported on 
this commission's activity. Nora Ananieva, chairperson of the 
BSP parliamentary faction, reported on the faction's activity. 
  A news conference took place after the end of the first 
session. Zhan Videnov told the news conference that the 
Socialists expect to receive more than 40 percent of the votes 
at the next elections, but they have no intention of usurping 
power. The BSP categorically denies that it was the perpetrator 
of criminal rule, Videnov said. Nora Ananieva said that the BSP 
parliamentary faction will implement the congress decisions, but 
it will act in a flexible manner. A debate on Zhan Videnov's 
report on the party's political line has opened.
