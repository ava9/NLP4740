<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mincho Minchev, chairman of the "Marxist </F>
Platform" Ideological Union in the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by 
Magdalina Andonova; place and date not given: "We Oppose the 
Uncritical Acceptance of Social Democracy"] 
  [Excerpts] [Andonova] On the basis of its contents, the 
draft program of your ideological union is described as the most 
leftist one in comparison with the other draft programs. Do you 
oppose the draft program of the Strategic Center led by 
Aleksandur Lilov? 
  [Minchev] It is true that our draft of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] program could be described as the most 
leftist one of all those submitted. However, this does not mean 
that it is supported only by the leftist periphery of the party. 
On the contrary, we are convinced that it is closest to the 
understandings of the majority of Socialists. 
  Nevertheless, we think that the document of the Strategic 
Center is the basic one. With its openness to most different 
ideas it could unite the party at present and preserve it as a 
whole. Our draft is not an alternative but rather a correction 
to the "Lilov" draft. [passage omitted] 
  [Andonova] Are you trying to save Marxism from oblivion, or 
have you discovered new elements of this teaching? 
  [Minchev] Marxism does not need to be saved. It has not 
been forgotten by any serious political scientist in the West. 
Without the Marxist methodology it is impossible to analyze the 
contemporary social processes or forecast the future. 
  [Andonova] Very briefly, what are the basic tenets of your 
draft program for the BSP? 
  [Minchev] First -- overcoming the social crisis and ensuring 
a new national upsurge in Bulgaria are unthinkable without 
restoring socialism. 
  Second -- For this we do not merely need an alliance of the 
left and center parties, but rather to win the support of a 
great part of the working people in Bulgaria. 
  Third -- We must turn the BSP into a modern Marxist party, 
which takes into consideration the changes that have taken place 
in the world and the new social realities, without relinquishing 
the basic goal -- implementing the civilized socialist plan of 
social development. 
  [Andonova] To what will you never agree regarding the 
positions of your opponents in the party? 
  [Minchev] Those are the people who propose to turn the BSP 
into a typical social democratic party with all its attributes 
(which have been rejected by the time). The changes that took 
place in Europe and the world after 1989 were an expression not 
only of the crisis of the Communist Parties, but also of the 
crisis of the social democratic parties. I find it strange that 
there are people in the BSP who think that since "the fall of 
communism" the parties of the social democratic type have 
triumphed. This is not true! Those parties are also in the 
middle of a great crisis! 
  We oppose the uncritical and total acceptance of the parties 
of the social democratic type as a model for the change in the 
BSP simply because parties of this type are frozen in their 
development at the 1951 level, when the Stockholm Declaration of 
the Socialist International was adopted. 
  Since then the world has changed beyond recognition. During 
this period there was real socialism in the East European 
countries and it is political infantilism to ignore this fact. 
  Something new must be sought. We could find it only if we 
move forward and continue our struggle.
