<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F>
Georgi Kardanov in Sofia on 26 May: "Current Political 
Situation Should Not Affect Subordination in the Army"] 
  [Text] Despite the heavy parliamentary program connected 
with debating the vote of confidence requested by Professor 
Berov and the tension surrounding some government ministers, 
before the secret ballot began, Defense Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov found time to grant a brief interview to a BULGARSKA 
ARMIYA reporter. 
  [Kardanov] Mr. Minister, if the government obtains a vote of 
confidence, what will be the first matter that Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov will address? 
  [Aleksandrov] Along with these demands for the government to 
resign and these numerous votes of confidence that have been 
moved, a considerable number of problems have accumulated that 
require solutions, so how can one decide which of them is the 
most pressing? I have the feeling that some officers seem to 
have forgotten that the most important thing in the army today 
is to obey the orders of one's superiors. Regardless of the 
current political situation, this subordination, as well as 
order and discipline, must be strictly observed in the army and 
the armed forces, otherwise we will have no army. During this 
severe political crisis, it is clear that an extreme 
psychological load is placed on the troops, which is especially 
harmful for subordination. 
  [Kardanov] Certain parliamentary forces and political 
circles have supported the view that your demand for certain 
high-ranking officers to be retired has created tension in the 
army. What is your counterargument? 
  [Aleksandrov] Look here, the General Staff has carefully 
drafted a plan that completely conforms with my views, so that 
the dismissal of the officers concerned is completely within the 
order of things, and it will take place in the fall. I do not 
see any grounds for tension as a result of this fact, or at 
least cannot not accept the force of these grounds, even in the 
event that the Defense and Armed Forces Act is not passed, and I 
personally cannot undertake to affirm that parliament will 
indeed pass it. 
  [Kardanov] You mentioned the words "in the event that the 
Defense and the Armed Forces Act is not passed...." Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov's short-term program envisages passing the 
law before the end of June, yet yesterday Ahmed Dogan, chairman 
of the parliamentary group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement, 
told a reporter that one should not be too hasty to pass the 
law, that it is a very extensive piece of legislation, so that 
there is hardly likely to be time to pass it. What is the true 
situation? 
  [Aleksandrov] I cannot say which is best, but in any case 
the The Defense and the Armed Forces Act should be carefully 
examined from all angles. It is better for us to continue to 
work with the existing law to give time to precisely formulate 
the new legislative material. I do not want to commit myself to 
making a personal assessment of the bill that has been 
submitted, because I am the proposer. In any case, we cannot 
influence the politicians and legislators regarding their 
priorities. On the other hand, this issue has begun to be 
interpreted too much on a personal level, and for this reason I 
prefer to make no comment. 
  [Kardanov] The National Security Commission is doing 
everything possible to speed up the ordering of all the 
amendments and proposals connected with the defense and armed 
forces bill, so they can be passed on to the Legislative 
Commission and reach the parliament voting stage more quickly. 
  [Aleksandrov] Yes, it is true that the National Security 
Commission is well advanced with preparing all the passages of 
the bill, but nevertheless one should not be in too much of a 
hurry, so as to avoid having to pass a new law in a year or two. 
  [Kardanov] Minister Aleksandrov, even if the defense and 
armed forces bill, which is supposed to provide the legislative 
basis for the democratic reform in the Armed Forces, is delayed, 
at least the Law on the Consultative Council on National 
Security was passed. Are you satisfied with the work of this 
supreme body, which is supposed to coordinate the efforts of all 
the country's institutions that are concerned with national 
security? 
  [Aleksandrov] Yes, I have twice attended sessions of the 
council and I can say that both times they debated important 
issues of national security that had a positive effect. This 
gives me good reason to hope that it will also continue to do 
useful and constructive work in the future.
