<F P=106> [Interview with Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti of </F>
Bulgaria, by Diana Petrova; place and date not given: "Dogan 
Works Against Bulgarian State, Lyutfi Is Indebted to Moon"] 
  [Text] [Petrova] Dr. Gendzhev, the Bulgarian Turks 
invested much hopes in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
[DPS], which promised to protect their interests. Now the DPS 
is in the parliament, there is a cabinet formed with the DPS 
mandate, but its constituency is the poorest in the country. 
What are the reasons for the DPS' failure? 
  [Gendzhev] I am well-informed and I know that the DPS was 
formed by the former Bulgarian Communist Party and State 
Security. The establishment of the DPS pursued two goals: The 
first was to prevent the Muslims from voting for the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS]. If they would have voted for the SDS, 
it would have won the first elections. 
  The second goal was to prevent the restoral of the rights of 
the Turks and Muslims in Bulgaria. They succeeded also in this 
sphere. What rights that existed before 1984 were restored? 
Before 1984 there were three Turkish theaters in Bulgaria. Now 
there are none. The Bulgarian radio had three two-hour programs 
in Turkish; now there are only 15-minute programs. The DPS 
promised a two-hour television program. Instead the wives of 
Yunal Lyutfi, Vedal Sakalu, and others paraded around in Turkey 
for six months. 
  Up to 1959 there were 1,390 Turkish schools. Now we do not 
even have the right to four hours of compulsory Turkish language 
studies, and I do not mean special schools. 
  They also lied to the people about the tobacco issue. They 
tamed the strike and pocketed the commissions from Bulgartabak. 
Let Dogan tell me now who will vote for him in Krumovgrad or 
Kurdzhali region. I will curse them if they cast a single vote 
for Dogan. 
  They did not accomplish even five things in five years. In 
my village, Glodzhevo, 600 people get their bread on credit -- 
the owner of the bakery shop writes their names in his ledger. 
Unemployment among Bulgarian Muslims is 80 percent. The Law on 
the Land does not help us at all. People from Kurdzhali live in 
the village of Listets, Silistra region. They moved there after 
the local Turks emigrated to Turkey. In August 1944 the land 
was purchased by five or six wealthy landlords, and in September 
a collective labor farm was formed. The owners never saw their 
land. However, instead of returning the land now to those who 
worked it all those years, they return it to the same landlords. 
The people do not even have money to lease the land. A 
businessman from Petrich cultivates it. This is the merit of 
the DPS. 
  The people understood that Dogan does not serve the 
Bulgarian 
state. He serves foreign interests. I know very well that he 
was recruited in Paris. 
  [Petrova] In the chief mufti affair the DPS opposed you. 
Was the only reason your personal feud with Dogan? 
  [Gendzhev] Destroying the structure of the Muslim religion 
in Bulgaria was another goal the DPS successfully achieved. The 
DPS also participated actively in destroying the Bulgarian 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Yunal Lyutfi visited the United States 
as Moon's personal guest! It became clear who was interested in 
destroying the two religions. The Eastern Orthodox Church will 
never again be united in Bulgaria. Even if Patriarchs Maksim 
and Pimen retire to monasteries, Galaktion and Neofit will not 
work together, while the priests and the people already are 
divided. There will never again be a united church. I will 
take Metodi Spasov [former director of the Department of 
Religions] to court and claim compensation for the moral and 
material damage that was inflicted on me. I will demand 500,000 
leva as compensation for the damage done by dismissing me. The 
Supreme Court already stated that I was illegally dismissed from 
the chief mufti post, and now I will demand to restore me to 
this post. 
  [Petrova] Now Mehmed Hodzha wants to form a new DPS. Do 
you think he has a chance? 
  [Gendzhev] No! At present he has absolutely no chance at 
all. To form a new DPS within the SDS is childish. The people 
get smarter. Why is it that no political party is interested in 
new elections? I am sure that this parliament will function 
until October 1995, when the regular parliamentary elections 
will take place. Let those who deceived the people worry! 
Mehmed Hodzha could organize a small group of supporters, if 
the SDS contributes a penny or two, so that he could organize 
branches. However, this is not what the people want. They want 
to know, for example, how did Mehmed Hodzha manage to acquire a 
tailor shop in the village of Kaspichan and employ 40 women 
there. The people want to know who did what. This also applies 
to all other parties. Now it appears that the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] and the SDS each have the support of 20 
percent of the voters. Well, those are the BSP pensioners and 
those who benefited from the restitution initiated by the SDS. 
And what about the other 60 percent? They have not decided 
yet. For my part, I do not see a real force that could attract 
those voters. Look, the Social Democratic Party shrunk. [Party 
leader Petur] Dertliev got involved in various polemics and 
personal quarrels, and weakened his party. Aleksandur Tomov 
from the Civic Alliance for the Republic also is a losing card. 
The same applies to Ludzhev's New Policy Center. Those are 
formations without supporters. 
  [Petrova] Did you register your party, and will you 
participate in the future elections? 
  [Gendzhev] Yes, the Democratic Party of Justice registered. 
Of course we will participate in the elections. We already are 
preparing -- we seek cadres and ascertain our possibilities. We 
are also preparing our program and are not making too much 
noise. It is too soon for this. We will probably participate 
in a coalition with other parties. For the time being I see 
only the Aleksandur Stamboliyski Bulgarian Agrarian National 
Union [BZNS] as a possible partner. This is the real BZNS which 
has structures. All the rest are hot air. I also rely very 
much on the intelligentsia, which now shuns politics. This is a 
potential force without leadership claims. It is a high time 
for an intelligent party to emerge. Such a party will not serve 
nationalism, but will protect Bulgaria's national interests 
instead. 
  [Petrova] It is well-known that you established a foundation 
which supports the religious life of Muslims in Bulgaria. How 
many mosques are under construction at present in Bulgaria? 
  [Gendzhev] I contributed $15,000 to the construction of the 
mosque in Madan. We contributed to rebuilding the burned-down 
mosque in Khaskovo, and to building mosques in Rudozem and 
Chepintsi. We are also building mosques in the Deliorman region 
-- I mean in the villages of Listets and Vulkan, and there are 
other construction projects. 
  I think that the most important factor is that even after 
the 
difficult period of 1985-86 we succeeded to preserve the respect 
between Muslims and Christians, as well as goodneighborly 
relations between Bulgarians and Turks. The attempts of certain 
persons to set the people against each other represent a crime. 
It is not serious to talk about some Islamic arcs and 
Panslavonic axes that cross Bulgaria. After all, the Bosnia 
Muslims also are Slavs! Our state must protect the tranquility 
in the country and prevent all attempts of inciting ethnic and 
religious feuds!
