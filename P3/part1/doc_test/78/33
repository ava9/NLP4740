<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Marinov, chairman of the </F>
Bulgarian Socialist Party Sofia (BSP) City Organization, by 
Teodora Encheva; place and date not given: "41st BSP Congress 
Was Rigidly Staged"] 
  [Text] [Encheva] Mr. Marinov, were you definitely 
defeated by Zhan Videnov? 
  [Marinov] (Laughing) I do not think your question is 
precise. There was no duel between me and Zhan Videnov even from 
the formal point of view. The contest simply did not take 
place. It was not allowed. 
  [Encheva] But you yourself opened the duel. 
  [Marinov] On the contrary, such an impression was 
deliberately created to use it as a pretext of staging an attack 
against myself and my colleagues from the Sofia organization. I 
would like to say that I am rather concerned with the artificial 
lack of alternatives. This is something that does not speak 
well of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], because the party 
did not do the necessary for having a normal, nonviolent contest 
at the congress. This was a consequence of the congress' spirit. 
The real problems were evaded and there was a desire to proceed 
in a smooth manner, occasionally, amidst staged applause. 
Personally, I use very cautiously the concept "definitely," and 
view ironically any attempt to speak on behalf of history. 
  [Encheva] Who was the stage director at the congress? 
  [Marinov] The old leadership. This was a skillfully 
manipulated congress, which returns us very much to the past. 
everything was reduced to resolving the personnel issue. 
However, the critical discussion should not have been 
eliminated. I am disappointed, because I thought that the 
changes in the BSP are irreversible. 
  There was a strict staging of the statements. The principle 
of giving the floor in accordance to the order of requesting it, 
was not observed. There was an extensive preliminary campaign 
in the media, including our party organ, which had the task of 
creating a negative attitude toward certain organizations and 
people, and then there was the entire technical organization of 
the congress itself. 
  [Encheva] Why were you the only candidate against Videnov? 
What happened to Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, Georgi 
Purvanov.... 
  [Marinov] Well, I suppose that when certain people saw what 
happens, they lost their desire to compete. 
  [Encheva] Desire or.... 
  [Marinov] So to speak. 
  [Encheva] What do you want now from the BSP? 
  [Marinov] I want a program clarity, a clear face, and less 
general and evasive phrases. Second, I want a decisive rather 
that a simulated orientation toward new elections. In this 
sphere we again are carried away by the wave of strong words. 
Third, I want to expand democracy in the party -- only thus 
would it be possible to expand its influence and allow its 
cadres to develop their potential. Unfortunately, according to 
the charter this is impossible. I cannot understand why my 
proposal to allow the municipal organizations to nominate the 
candidates for National Assembly membership was not accepted. 
  [Encheva] Do you still think that the elections will take 
place this fall? 
  [Marinov] I already have my doubts. I am afraid that the 
elections are a flag that is being waved for different reasons. 
I would be a great disaster for the BSP if it finds itself at 
the rear end of the events, and is forcibly brought to the 
election polling stations. However, there still is a great 
chance that there will be elections in the fall, not because 
someone wants them, but because those are the objective 
tendencies. It would be very bad, let me repeat, very bad, if 
the impression is created that the BSP is afraid of elections. 
I am afraid that such an impression has already been created. 
  [Encheva] Nevertheless, why did you not allow yourself to 
be elected as a member of the BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Marinov] I refused to be a delegate of the Sofia 
organization. Frankly, I sensed the prevailing spirit and 
deliberately assumed a risk hoping that an absurd situation will 
emerge, which will indicate the real situation. 
  [Encheva] Do you think that this was a personal defeat? 
  [Marinov] I consider this to be an injustice. Life has 
taught me to endure defeats, but I have difficulties in 
swallowing injustice. I do not think that political rating is 
something fleeting that emerges and disappears suddenly. 
However, my cause was just and most of my benevolent comrades 
will appreciate this. 
  Personally, I did not expect that so many unworthy means 
would be used in such a scope. What can I do, this is 
democracy.... (laughing) 
  [Encheva] Do you feel betrayed? 
  [Marinov] No. I am sorry that most of the delegates did not 
understand what happened. 
  [Encheva] You did not have a team, is this what you mean? 
  [Marinov] I did not have organized support because I did not 
need a conspiracy. However, I had the support of a large part 
of the Sofia organization and other regions. 
  [Encheva] I did not understand what do you call the division 
in the BSP. 
  [Marinov] Look, the question is whose interests are being 
defended through politics. Obviously, certain internal and 
external economic factors have their influence, and our 
differences constantly increase. I do not say that those 
differences could be completely eliminated, but it should be 
clear what prompts our political steps. 
  Today we should have a much more active social policy -- but 
you see what happens. 
  I think that the ideas of general-democratic reforms are 
rather a cover, because it is clear that the reforms have a 
socioeconomic contents. 
  [Encheva] Will you head an ideological current within the 
BSP? 
  [Marinov] My views coincide with the main ideas vested in 
the BSP draft program, prepared by the Strategic Research 
Center. I would make the step you mention if the adoption of 
the program is prevented. Obviously, an ideological and 
political division will emerge then in the BSP. 
  [Encheva] The referendum on the program will be after 9 
September. Will you wait passively until then? 
  [Marinov] First, we have to elaborate the draft. 
  I am afraid that we will have to overcome a serious 
resistance and attempts to change it in such a way that it would 
lose its authentic ideas. It should be clearly explained to the 
party what is the meaning of the referendum. 
  [Encheva] Do you trust Videnov as a chairman? 
  [Marinov] I cannot answer this question unequivocally. 
  [Encheva] This is prompted by your emotions, right? 
  [Marinov] He is the legitimate chairman, and I observe the 
party charter. However, confidence is something much greater 
than that.
