<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Lilov, leader of the BSP </F>
Strategic Research Center, by Todor Tokin; place and date not 
given: "Tribal Political Animosity Could Produce Grave 
Consequences for Country"] 
  [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Lilov, how do you assess the 41st 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress? 
  [Lilov] This is a successful congress. The party's 
political line is being clarified. I mean the main aspects of 
this line -- elections, working out a practical policy, adopting 
a long-range program, and continuing the renewal of the party. 
I think that those steps are in the correct direction and that 
this predetermined the congress' success. 
  [Tokin] The congress decided that the program prepared by 
your Strategic Research Center will serve as the basis of the 
party program. However, its adoption was postponed by three 
months. How do you assess this move? 
  [Lilov] The most important things for me are that first, the 
draft of the strategic center was adopted as the basis of the 
party program, and second, that it was decided to incorporate in 
our draft the most valuable elements of the precongressional 
discussion and the other drafts published and discussed by the 
party. The final form of the adoption is not fatal. However, a 
negative effect will emerge if again requests and intentions are 
voiced, which could prevent the adoption of the program either 
directly or by infringing upon its basic ideas. I would not 
like to think that the next three months will be utilized for 
wasting time or directing the program's elaborations in an 
incorrect direction. 
  [Tokin] How do you assess the election platform proposed by 
Zhan Videnov, BSP chairman? 
  [Lilov] I assess very highly the idea of the party chairman, 
but the program itself is rather raw. In addition, I think that 
we need a program of a different type. At the congress I said 
that the election platform should not specify what the BSP 
proposes for the 21st century, but should say plainly to the 
Bulgarian voters what the party is proposing for the 1994-98 
period, which is relevant to those elections. The BSP must 
propose a new, very clear, specific, pragmatic, and programmatic 
policy in all areas. 
  [Tokin] Do you think that your line was defeated at the 
congress, as the rumors in the corridors point out? 
  [Lilov] (Laughing) Yes, the corridors produced this thesis 
about a defeat or a victory.... I do not think that this is so. 
However, even if this is so, no one knows what he won, whom did 
he defeat, and whether he lost something by being defeated. 
  [Tokin] Do you see yourself as DUMA chief editor? There was 
such a proposal. 
  [Lilov] Oh please! This is an inappropriate proposal. 
  [Tokin] Do you not think that the BSP missed the best moment 
for the elections? 
  [Lilov] This is a serious question. The strong policy and 
the strong party that implements this policy could be identified 
through many signs. One of them is the selection of the right 
moment for its actions. Our party must select that moment for 
the elections, which will be the most suitable one for the 
country and for the policy that our party proposes. Therefore I 
think that we discovered the concept "elections" only after an 
excessively long and unjustified searching. We are late, 
because most of the political factors in Bulgaria already 
invoked this concept. However, I do not think that the BSP 
missed this train. If the party proposes a good tactical policy 
it has a chance. Elections in the fall could be successful for 
the BSP if the party produces a good policy. 
  [Tokin] However, Professor Kyuranov said that if the BSP 
selects the road of toppling Prof. Berov's cabinet, the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] could easily form a new government and 
restore the old parliamentary majority, through which it could 
rule until the end of 1995. 
  [Lilov] The people in Bulgaria must get used to the rules of 
democracy. This factor that according to the laws and the rules 
of democracy has the right and ability to form a government, can 
indeed do so. Prof. Kyuranov cannot guarantee the BSP or the 
leftist forces that if we constantly postpone the elections and 
support a government which is losing credit, then what he fears 
will not materialize. The issue is to conduct democratic and 
free elections and form a high-quality parliament and strong 
government in accordance with the wishes of the voters. We do 
not need behind-the-scenes combinations and should not fear 
elections. 
  [Tokin] Why do you not mention specific political factors 
in your idea regarding a leftist-centrist agreement, which is 
incorporated in the center's program? 
  [Lilov] It is the specific political market that will 
propose specific political factors. This will happen when the 
political scene becomes clear and one can see what election 
platforms and forces emerge. If a postelection leftist-centrist 
coalition is concerned, then one must see the situation in the 
parliament after the elections. I have absolutely no dramatic 
concern that the BSP could remain alone without partners. If it 
succeeds to receive a solid majority in the parliament the 
chances and possibilities of forming a leftist-centrist 
coalition in the parliament will grow. This is a very clear and 
promising idea. If this chance is missed, I think that we will 
commit a grave error, which will not be applauded in any way by 
history or the present and future generations. 
  [Tokin] You said that you relinquish all party posts. Does 
this mean that you also relinquish the leadership of the 
Strategic Research Center? 
  [Lilov] This is absolutely sincere. If I wanted the 
leadership post I could have it without any difficulties. As 
far as the strategic center is concerned -- this is not a party 
post. There are no political appointments in science. 
  [Tokin] Your colleagues reproach you for not mentioning Zhan 
Videnov when you speak about the party's new face. According to 
you, who are the capable persons in the BSP? 
  [Lilov] Those are concocted accusations. Infighting is one 
of our party's bad traditions. 
  I see Zhan Videnov's face among the new faces of our party, 
but I want to stress that the party's elite does not consist 
only of the posts in its leadership. We have certain 
differences with the party leader regarding certain issues, but 
I do not wish to dramatize them. I think that the party leader 
must be independent. If Zhan Videnov obtains this independence 
I will be the happiest member of the party. 
  Yanaki Stoilov is one of the most gifted persons in the 
party. Aleksandur Marinov, Nikolay Kamov, and many other young 
people are the hope of our party. I am glad that at such a 
difficult moment the party can show so many new and promising 
faces. 
  [Tokin] What are the main differences between the BSP and 
the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party [BSDP]? 
  [Lilov] We have no profound programmatic differences. While 
some of the BSDP leaders do not like this, it nevertheless is a 
positive factor in relations between the two parties and a 
wonderful prerequisite of developing cooperation. The 
differences are the result of the still existing historical 
heritage and the failure to develop a sufficiently active and 
constructive dialogue. 
  [Tokin] What party will the BSP present at the elections? 
Whose party will it be? 
  [Lilov] The BSP will present in the elections a party that 
very seriously wants to eliminate the tribal political animosity 
which exists in Bulgaria, and which could have grave 
consequences for our country. The BSP must place national 
consensus and interests above everything else. Afterward, the 
BSP must propose another alternative for the reforms in the 
country. It should do so not in order to stop the reforms, but 
in order to give them a new impulse and provide them with a new 
leftist-centrist philosophy and program. Finally, the BSP must 
express and protect the interests of that majority of the 
population which is subjected to mass impoverishment, while 
keeping in mind its role in our society. 
  [Tokin] Do you think that the leftist wave that began in 
Lithuania and continued through Poland and Hungary, will reach 
Bulgaria tomorrow? 
  [Lilov] There is no other way. We are in the way of this 
wave.
