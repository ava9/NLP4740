<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly member Mehmed Hodzha by </F>
Miroslava Badzheva; place and date not given: "Mehmed Hodzha: 
The Movement for Rights and Freedoms Will Get No More Than 1.5 
Percent in Elections"] 
  [Excerpts] [Badzheva] Mr. Hodzha, now that you have been 
expelled from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], will 
you form an alternative to the movement? 
  [Hodzha] We left the DPS parliamentary faction with the 
clear understanding that the DPS cannot survive with this 
leadership. Therefore, we demanded an extraordinary conference. 
Indeed, not only we demanded such a conference, but also the 
representatives of local branches in various regions. However, 
obviously this will not happen. I am convinced that there will 
be no new national conference. This means that we are left with 
the second variant -- to offer our former and potential voters 
something different than the present DPS. Both in the DPS 
parliamentary faction and Central Council there are honest 
people, but this in itself is not enough. An alternative must be 
proposed. I can tell you that this idea exists already several 
months. It has already matured, now we must only put it into 
effect. We will convene a new meeting to which we will 
naturally invite people from all regions in the country who 
adhere to positions similar to ours. We want to attract the 
dissatisfied people who reject the policy of the DPS leadership, 
and most of all, those who are dissatisfied with the cooperation 
with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. All Europe, not only 
Bulgaria, understood that this cooperation is already a fact. 
This leadership is simply genetically committed to cooperating 
with the BSP. The same phenomenon will also exist in the next 
parliament. 
  [Badzheva] What will be your new party's name? 
  [Hodzha] This is not important. The basic principle around 
which we will rally, will be that this is an anticommunist party 
that is not based on an ethnic foundation. Many Bulgarians 
already demonstrate interest in the new party. 
  [Badzheva] Who are the people that will form the core of 
this formation? 
  [Hodzha] I will not divulge any names, everything is still 
within the framework of ideas. Let us wait a bit longer. 
  [Badzheva] When will you announce officially its 
establishment? 
  [Hodzha] In the next few weeks. 
  [Badzheva] When will you hold the planned meeting? 
  [Hodzha] Again, in the next few weeks. 
  [Badzheva] Is the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] helping 
you in forming the "alternative DPS"? 
  [Hodzha] We do not need any helpers. We are sufficiently 
prudent and able people, and can manage alone. 
  [Badzheva] However, nevertheless, you plan to cooperate with 
the SDS? 
  [Hodzha] We would like to work together with the SDS, but 
this is not an unconditional desire. 
  [Badzheva] What conditions will you pose? 
  [Hodzha] The blue [SDS] coalition must share our intentions 
and ideas. We will stress the democratic principles, human 
rights, and resolving social and economic problems -- all this 
that existed at the beginning, when we were together with the 
SDS. 
  [Badzheva] Would you participate in the next elections on 
the same ticket with the SDS? 
  [Hodzha] I cannot answer this question. Let the SDS assess 
whether it needs me or not. [passage omitted] 
  [Badzheva] What do you think, if elections were held now 
what percentage of the vote will the DPS get? 
  [Hodzha] No more than 1.5 percent. I think that this is the 
last participation in the parliamentary elections with this 
leadership. 
  [Badzheva] You claim that the new formation will not be 
based on an ethnic foundation. Will its program contain the 
demand on proclaiming the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria a national 
minority -- a thesis you defended when you were still in the DPS? 
  [Hodzha] Personally, I support collective rights. Now the 
Council of Europe is preparing precisely such a document 
regarding the collective rights of the minorities. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Badzheva] Do you still claim that the higher DPS circles 
are corrupt? 
  [Hodzha] Since I am magnanimous, I will take cigarettes to 
some of the DPS leadership members when they are in prison. 
  [Badzheva] Will you support your claims with documents? 
  [Hodzha] Yes, when the time comes. [passage omitted]
