<F P=106> [Report by Kalina Stancheva on a statement by Prime Minister </F>
Lyuben Berov on domestic issues for Bulgarian Radio, Television, 
and BTA; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has made a statement 
for Bulgarian National Radio, Television, and BTA on topical 
domestic problems. The "Khorizont" program will transmit the 
statement later, but here is a summary by our reporter Kalina 
Stancheva: 
  [Stancheva] The prime minister has the impression that a new 
campaign to topple the government has begun. In his statement 
he disclosed the composite elements of the campaign and offered 
his explanation as to why the action was starting just at this 
moment. The first reason, he said, was that the two trade union 
confederations had reached a common position regarding their 
property. Prime Minister Berov said that the deadline of 1 
September can be kept without any ultimatum. A furor is being 
raised at this juncture because one of the two trade union 
leaders is having difficulties with his membership. According 
to Berov, the problem will be resolved before the end of August. 
Professor Berov described as a gross falsehood [Podkrepa 
leader] Trenchev's allegation that secret talks were being held 
with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] on replacing individual 
members of the cabinet and striking political bargains. 
  The second groundless accusation was that the Council of 
Ministers is neglecting to provide bread for the people, the 
prime minister said. He said that the ban on the export of 
grain will remain in force until the new harvest is brought in. 
Because of the threatened shortage of vegetable oil, we have 
increased the export duty on sunflower seed and their products, 
he said. 
  Prof. Berov that the government was further accused of 
supplying water without charge to Turkey, but in fact Turkey is 
paying three times the price paid by Bulgarian consumers. 
  The prime minister further said he could not understand why 
the trade unions had come out against the mass privatization. 
Furthermore, Dr. Kurtev [chief secretary of National 
Coordinating Council of Union of Democratic Forces] has accused 
the government of attempts to introduce a state of emergency. 
The prime minister said that at 1200 on Friday 1 April he will 
give a news conference, to which -- and here I quote Prof. 
Berov's words -- I invite Dr. Trenchev, bringing with him the 
damning tape recording that he claims to have in his possession. 
In addition, I invite Mr. Kurtev, Mrs. Mozer [leader of 
Bulgarian National Agrarian Union], and Mr. Spasov to attend, 
bringing with them the list of villages in which they claim 
recommunization is being carried out in the liquidation councils. 
  The prime minister offered the following explanation why 
political groupings of various colors were mounting their attack 
against his cabinet at this moment: It is because the cabinet 
is determined to fulfill in a responsible way its program for 
mass privatization, as well as agrarian reform, and to wage a 
determined campaign against economic crime.
