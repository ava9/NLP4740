  [Text] Some 45 foreign and 255 Bulgarian journalists 
covered the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress, which 
opened today. Our reporter Lilyana Yancheva, who will summarize 
the first day of the congress, was among them. 
  [Yancheva] I would like to say that the report that party 
leader Zhan Videnov read today was well-received by the 
delegates, despite the fact that statements made during the 
afternoon debate were rather critical. This is precisely what I 
want to ask Mr. Videnov, who is sitting next to me: What do you 
think were the most essential and critical elements in the 
statements of the delegates who came to the congress from all 
parts of the country. 
  [Videnov] I think that it is too early to say precisely what 
the focus of the discussion was, what the basic conflict it 
engenders is, and what direction the possible resolution will 
take. I think that the congress will determine the country's 
political calendar for the current year, and our resolution will 
contain the opinion of the Bulgarian Socialists regarding the 
tests that lie ahead. The fact that the congress agenda was 
amended today proves this. Now it contains the BSP election 
platform. 
  A dispute broke out regarding the question of whether the 
democratic character of the transition will be guaranteed if a 
governmental and parliamentary crisis develops; guarantees were 
sought for a future leftist or leftist-centrist government, 
including listening to the opinions of our present and potential 
coalition partners. I think that this subject will unfold 
tomorrow, during the second day of the congress. 
  [Yancheva] There were some very interesting statements on 
the part of Roma delegates to the congress; they voiced 
interesting claims. 
  [Videnov] The Bulgarian Romas have the right to present 
claims to all political forces, state institutions, and public 
organizations. They have an exceptionally unequal social 
status, and they are also subject to serious discrimination, 
against which Bulgarian society as a whole and its institutions 
do not fight. Thus, I think that each party should think about 
this, and our party will certainly do so.
