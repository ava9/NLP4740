  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- The leaderships of the two 
major political powers, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), today discussed the future 
of the cabinet, their representatives said today at their 
regular weekly news briefings. "The time of waiting and 
half-way measures is running out," said BSP deputy floor leader 
Georgi Pirinski, voicing his party's stand. BSP expects that 
the prime minister's ideas about cabinet changes would become 
clear by the end of the week. "The cabinet should go instead of 
reshuffling," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. 
  According to BSP analyses, confrontation in society has been 
further exacerbated, yet Bulgaria has the real chances of 
stabilizing its law and order and its foreign economic 
relations. The Socialists have not changed their demands to the 
Cabinet; yet they have never raised the issue of the restoration 
of ministries or reinstatement of persons. "Structural and 
personnel changes lie within Prime Minister Berov's own 
discretion," Mr. Pirinski said. In his view, Mr. Berov has not 
shown he is decisive enough to "make a U-turn in the cabinet's 
performance." BSP set several demands to the government: 
resumption of political dialogue with the trade unions, 
stabilization of the national budget, setting in motion 
structural adjustment, unblocking privatization, etc. "Unless 
Mr. Berov makes his ideas clear by the end of the week, BSP will 
reconsider its stand," the Socialists said at their news 
conference. 
  Later in the day, Socialists' leaders held an unscheduled 
meeting with Prime Minister Berov, national television reported 
in its main newscast. 
  "The prime minister alone can say how far things have been 
specified with him. I can't say that because what is going on 
now is a change in his notions, frame of mind and intentions. 
There will be continuous changes in the coming days and weeks, 
they will be exceedingly vigorous," BSP leader Zhan Videnov told 
a TV interviewer. The government Press Office specified that 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov will address parliament tomorrow [27 
April]. 
  SDS leader Filip Dimitrov described the intended cabinet 
changes as "the latest trick of anti-national behaviour on the 
part of the communist parliamentary majority." At a regular 
meeting today, the SDS top leadership considered its reaction 
which will depend on whether the cabinet changes will be 
introduced before parliament on Wednesday or not. Mr. Dimitrov, 
however, did not specify the strategies adopted. 
  The parliamentary New Union for Democracy (SDS expellees and 
defectors) and the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) today met to discuss the intended policy 
which Prime Minister Berov is expected to set forth before 
parliament tomorrow, as well as his concept of structural 
cabinet changes. 
  The two factions agreed that no structural and personnel 
changes are necessary until parliament's Easter recess, said the 
spokesman for the parliamentary DPS Yunal Lyutfi. During and 
after the recess, the two factions will continue their 
consultations with Prime Minister Berov on the government's 
programme and the need of personnel and structural cabinet 
changes. 
  The forthcoming structural changes in the cabinet were 
discussed today by Prime Minister Berov with Mr. Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (a radical 
movement which broke away from the BSP), national radio 
reported. Mr. Tomov said that certain political forces should 
not take advantage of the grave economic situation to put 
pressure on the government. According to him, in order to avoid 
a power vacuum and an economic collapse, political forces must 
reach a consensus on the changes needed by Prof. Berov's cabinet.
