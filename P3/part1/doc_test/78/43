<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Prodev: "Two Days After Congress"] </F>
  [Text] Rather than three days, the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] Congress lasted four days and one night. This was 
not because so many of the delegates wanted to speak, but 
because of purely organizational reasons. It turned out that we 
still do not know the real price of time. Time costs money, 
which does not grow on trees. 
  The congress was awaited with interest by our entire public 
and was accompanied by many forecasts. Unfortunately, the 
forecasts were made by amateurs, and not a single one turned out 
to be true. As so many times in the past, it again became clear 
that our political prophets are not interested in the truth 
about the BSP, but in their own notions about it. This causes 
them to deceive themselves, which is not only confusing, but 
almost evokes ridicule. If one reads their forecasts one sees 
that their preliminary expectations have nothing in common with 
the facts. Again most of the journalists, political scientists, 
and observers showed that bias and personal feelings are only an 
elementary propaganda game with the real situation. None of 
them succeeded in forecasting what would happen at the congress, 
and thus distinguish himself. 
  The 41st BSP Congress provided a number of "surprises," 
which 
if sensed before the congress, could have been a case of serious 
political intelligence. I will not dwell on all the surprises, 
but will point out only two that deserve special attention. 
  The first was the fact that the expected personal and 
ideological duels did not take place, although they were implied 
in some of the statements. In this context the expected split 
or great differences in assessments proved to be a bluff. The 
congress' energy was not wasted on imposing someone's will or 
settling accounts. The delegates not only showed prudence, but 
they also did not allow anyone to impose his will for his own 
ends. This was not the result of weariness, feebleness, or 
fear, but of a most serious attitude toward the problems. It 
became quite clear that the factors that divide the party are 
much weaker at present than the factors that unite it. Even the 
strongest words from the rostrum and the most nervous scuffle 
near the microphones did not confuse the congress' general 
atmosphere. On the contrary, the atmosphere was businesslike and 
influenced by the results, not by selfish and vain struggles. 
Even those persons from whom great thunder was expected did not 
violate the rules of good taste. This is more than indicative 
for a political congress taking place in the present social 
situation, torn apart by explosions. It became more than 
obvious that the Socialists can think bitter thoughts, but do 
not seek success through scandals. There were indeed attempts 
to create scandals, but the initiators did not find any support. 
The congress quickly quashed such attempts, sometimes with 
derision, and showed that it thinks on a grand scale and rejects 
petty ambitions. This is what the political prophets were not 
able to forecast. They expected a storm perhaps even 
catastrophic clashes, but instead of this they saw a complex but 
fruitful dialogue. The BSP again proved that unlike its 
political opponents, it is a party with sound nerves and a clear 
voice. 
  The second serious surprise of the 41st BSP Congress 
involved 
the election of its top leadership. For a long time the press 
and the radio toyed with various names, pointed out ideological 
currents, sought heroes and victims, and tried to forecast a 
conflict of personal and group interests. Today the election is 
already a fact and all this does not sound serious. Almost all 
the great figures in the BSP, with a few exceptions, found their 
place on the BSP Supreme Council. Only a few of them, who 
either evoke concern with their behavior, or express radical and 
unacceptable positions, were not elected. I personally regret 
the fact that some of them were not elected, but this does not 
change anything. The election sense of the delegates proved to 
be quite precise. The delegates refused to give their 
confidence mostly to people who did not convince the congress 
that they were selfless in their ambitions, and that they 
profess sober views. 
  Of course, this does not mean that controversial persons, 
people associated with the old notions of party behavior, and 
people who still have a leadership mania did not enter the BSP 
Supreme Council. Despite this, however, the result is positive. 
The delegates voted according to their conscience and generally 
elected a leadership that corresponds to the current BSP 
interests. It is a leadership of balance, professional thought, 
and a useful combination of the center and the ideological 
currents. This is a hope that could produce positive results. 
Those who were not elected are certainly disappointed, but if 
they are politicians, they must draw the necessary conclusions. 
At the present political moment the party does not want and 
cannot be subjected to a test by controversial persons and 
extremist views. It faces serious social battles and needs a 
prudently composed leadership that will guarantee a complete 
balance. I would like to believe that, despite the forecasts, 
precisely this is what the new Supreme Council will do. 
  As usual, various gossip accompanied the congress, or was 
spread afterward. Now that the forecasts have been proved wrong 
it is the time of the lies. One of them is more than bankrupt. 
I mean the BTA report, quoted by certain media, according to 
which I was jeered by the delegates because of a report in DUMA 
that ostensibly attempted to suggest Zhan Videnov's election 
prior to the actual vote. This is a pitiful forgery. The truth 
is that the congress jeered not DUMA's chief editor, but a small 
group of delegates from Sofia who made use of the report in 
order to compromise the newspaper and the party leader before 
the election. By the way, this unworthy act had a decisive role 
in the fact that Aleksandur Marinov was not elected a member of 
the Supreme Council. There were other similar lies, but let us 
not pay any attention to them. Whoever wants to know about them 
should read DEMOKRATSIYA. This newspaper presented what 
happened at the congress in such a twisted manner that one can 
only laugh. 
  The 41st BSP Congress will go down in party history as a 
useful congress. It adopted a new charter and election 
platform, and cleared the way for for the new party program 
finally to be adopted. What was very important -- the congress 
confirmed the decision to hold early parliamentary elections. 
Now life should prove the correctness of the party's collective 
mind. This can happen only if the congress' ideas successful 
merge with the requirements of our time, and if each of us, 
Socialists and supporters alike, accept them as our own ideas. 
Let no one become the victim of excessive suspicion or 
inappropriate confidence. Both suspicion and confidence are 
more than harmful, especially at a time such as the present, 
when the BSP's opponents are becoming ever more confused and 
malicious. We are yet to face the struggle for the new 
parliament, which means a struggle for power that will require 
all our strength. In this sphere things are extremely clear and 
cannot be subjected to any games. It depends on us, rather than 
anyone else, whether the people will believe us and will give us 
their confidence. Therefore, the congress' decisions must 
become the destiny of all those who want to help Bulgaria. It 
was no accident that most the statement read at the congress 
referred to the future. The real chance of our nation lies 
somewhere in the future. Let us devote everything we have as 
Socialists and patriots to this chance. Only thus will we be 
able to prove that we are ready for the great public role that 
awaits us.
