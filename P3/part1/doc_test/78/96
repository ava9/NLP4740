  [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met with Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic [GOR], on 
26 April and discussed with him the upcoming structural changes 
in the government. 
  Aleksandur Tomov described the meeting as a normal and 
routine meeting. He said that he opposes the attempt by certain 
political forces to utilize the grave economic situation in the 
country to put pressure on the government. According to 
Aleksandur Tomov, to prevent the emergence of a vacuum in the 
government and economic stagnation, the political forces must 
reach a consensus on the issue of what changes are needed by 
Lyuben Berov's government. The GOR has serious opinions on the 
cabinet's economic team, but it will not participate in 
political haggling over ministerial posts or propose ministers, 
Aleksandur Tomov said.
