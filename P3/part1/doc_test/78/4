  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP), which supports the government, asked 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov for cabinet changes and for a new 
programme by May 15. After a meeting of the top leadership of 
the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), on 
whose mandate the present government was formed in late 1992, it 
announced the DPS would insist that the government be overhauled 
completely. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) 
calls for the government's resignation and for early 
parliamentary elections. The SDS will not move for a vote of no 
confidence in the cabinet pending debates on a question about 
the government's financial policy posed by MPs of the SDS. 
Today's meetings of the three major political forces showed 
they are readying for elections. The SDS discussed principles 
of selecting candidates. The DPS is likely to run on a separate 
list in the next elections. 
  Meanwhile, BSP leader Zhan Videnov and DPS leader Ahmed 
Dogan 
visited the prime minister who is working in hospital. "The 
prime minister's condition admits of political activity," 
Videnov said. According to Dogan, Prime Minister Berov, who 
underwent heart surgery over a month ago and is now in hospital 
after developing hepatitis symptoms, is in a very good state of 
health. 
  Videnov said the prime minister had promised to hold two 
rounds of meetings with the major political forces to discuss 
cabinet changes. The Socialist leader told the press today that 
cabinet changes should be made with a view to three main goals: 
Bulgaria's international financial stabilization, industrial 
restructuting and de-escalating tensions in the army and the 
law-enforcement authorities. 
  Critical views on the government prevail in the DPS and it 
will insist on a complete overhaul. The land reform and 
privatization are the major points of its criticism. According 
to Osman Oktay MP of the DPS, the movement has not drawn up a 
list of new cabinet members. [passage omitted] 
  Stefan Sofiyanski, deputy chairman of the leadership of the 
SDS, said it was absurd to demand of "a sick person under 
quarantine to form a new cabinet" and added that this pressure 
comes from the BSP. The SDS will wait for the interpellation on 
the cabinet's financial policy to enter the debating chamber and 
if the draft resolution criticising this policy is voted down 
than it will consider moving a no-confidence vote. According to 
Sofiyanski, it would be impossible for a no-confidence vote to 
take place before parliament's Easter recess. So far the SDS 
has moved five no-confidence votes which were defeated. 
  George Ganchev, leader of the extraparliamentary Bulgarian 
Business Bloc, told journalists today that the Premier would 
resign by the end of the week. He cited a "firsthand source" 
without naming it.
