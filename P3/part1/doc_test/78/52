<F P=106> [Commentary by Sonya Angelova: "Berov Will Call the Tune for </F>
a Few More Months"] 
  [Text] Despite the permanent talk regarding early 
parliamentary elections, the current prime minister can be calm 
about his post for a rather long time. There are at least three 
reasons for this. The rivalry between the president and the 
parliament is just one of them. 
  [President Zhelyu] Zhelev's intensive efforts to fix a 
"suitable" cabinet, or to transfer the power to a caretaker 
cabinet, as well as the readiness of a dozen of politicians 
loyal to Zhelev to head such a cabinet, prompts a large part of 
the deputies to look with suspicion toward the White House [the 
Bulgarian Presidency]. In the past few months, they plan to 
curb the president's prerogatives, and only the unexpected 
illness of the prime minister spoiled their plans. 
  Amending the Bulgarian Constitution, however, is not a 
simple 
job. This is a delicate thing, related to subtle negotiations 
and precise arithmetics because part of the people's deputies 
really fear the long hands of the Presidency. The weakness of 
the head of state, however, to publicly settle the account with 
the Socialists and the rapid disintegration that engulfed the 
camp of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], facilitated 
turning the Presidency into the only significant opponent of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The deformations in political 
life evoked analogies of the time of the Third Kingdom. Most of 
the caretaker cabinets of that time managed to win the elections 
regardless of their platforms. Therefore, the idea of 
increasing control over the president appears to be a task of 
supreme importance. There are two variants of this: either the 
parliament should continue its activity and thus keep an eye on 
the caretaker cabinet conceived by Zhelev, or the parliament 
should be entrusted with the task of forming this cabinet. Both 
variants require several months for their realization. Until 
then, Professor Berov will be protected from various votes. 
  The second reason for his temporary immunity is related to 
the unresolved internal problems of political forces. The SDS 
preserved its coalition character long after similar formations 
in other East European states disintegrated. The deadlock 
between the National Coordinating Council and the parliamentary 
faction, however, prompts the two camp to openly long for 
democratic centralism, the one-man-command, and something that 
resembles party discipline. The issue that preoccupies the SDS 
headquarters more than anything else is who will lead the future 
blue [SDS] party. The final term allocated to Filip Dimitrov and 
Stefan Savov is 15 May. Until now, it appeared that only the 
chief of the parliamentary faction [Stefan Savov] is pressed for 
time. The national conference is expected to be the triumph of 
the apparatus games, and the apparatus is fully controlled by 
Filip Dimitrov. Recently, however, the hardliners also 
demonstrated nervousness. Several times, Edvin Sugarev demanded 
proposing a vote of no-confidence and pressed for adopting a 
decision to walk out of the parliament. The discussions related 
to composing the election lists will accelerate those processes. 
If Filip Dimitrov's plan to propose SDS candidates and 
determine their place in the lists succeeds, the outcome of the 
battle will be determined. The central leadership will close 
its doors to the Democratic and Radical-Democratic Parties, the 
blue Agrarians, and a part of the United Christian Democratic 
Center. Even if Savov himself passes through the sieve, the 
next parliamentary faction will already be totally dominated by 
Filip Dimitrov, while the faction's present leader will become a 
respected but tiresome pensioner. Everyone understands the 
situation. The split in the SDS appears to be a matter of time. 
  The third, and perhaps the most important reason is 
privatization. Preparations for privatization began before 10 
November, and yet it does not seem to materialize. The owners 
of the former national wealth are determined by violence or in a 
Byzantine manner. No one is tempted by the political 
consequences of the privatization. Regardless of the formula 
that will dominate the privatization, there will be 
bankruptcies, people will the thrown into the street, an attempt 
will be made to ban the trade unions, and conflicts will emerge 
among economic groups that divided the country in their 
interest. Diminishing the role of the state produces dividends 
in the long run, however, under the present socioeconomic 
situation, the country could find itself in a catastrophic 
situation in the short run. 
  All this is obvious even from the vintage point of the 
government hospital. Therefore, as a man of character, in the 
near future, Professor Berov will dictate his conditions. For 
the time being, the political forces do not appear to have much 
of a choice.
