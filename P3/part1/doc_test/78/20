  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- The National Assembly 
voted 125 to 95 for the confidence motion proposed by the 
Council of Ministers, thus backing its newly proposed programme. 
Under the Constitution the government needed the votes of half 
of the MPs present (today 221 MPs took part in the ballot). 
  "I guess one is supposed to say `thank you' in a situation 
like this, but I don't think those who voted against me feel 
envy for my mission," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after the 
ballot. He promised to make great efforts to keep the state on 
an even keel. [passage omitted] 
  The MPs opted for a secret ballot. Although SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces] and the independent MPs insisted on an open, 
roll-call ballot, the secret ballot got 125 votes. 
  The procedure was delayed more than an hour by the 
continuing 
consultations between the prime minister and the political 
forces. Just before the ballot he met with representatives of 
the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] and NSDP [New Social Democratic Party]. The 
government asked that its normal operation be guaranteed for a 
period of three months, said the spokesman for the DPS, Mr. 
Yunal Lyutfi. He reiterated DPS's support for the cabinet. 
After two meetings with the prime minister the Socialists who 
until then had firmly backed the cabinet felt somewhat 
hesitatnt. BSP leaders Zhan Videnov and Nora Ananieva asked 
from the prime minister too firm guarantees regarding incomes 
compensations, the Government's Spokesman Raicho Raikov 
explained. "They are impossible because of the conditions set 
by the international institutions and G-24," he said. After its 
meeting with the prime minister the parliamentary BSP held a 
long conference at which the MPs were not quite unanimous as to 
the support for the cabinet. 
  The New Policy Center, the Alternative Social Liberal Party 
and the Alliance for Democracy issued a joint declaration that 
they would not support the cabinet. Neither did the SDS. 
  Mr Vassil Gotsev, MP of the SDS, described the ballot as 
"just another farce". He accused DPS leader Ahmed Dogan of 
voting as instructed by Russia's Ambassador Alexander Avdeev. 
Mr Dogan met with Mr Avdeev today and with U.S. Ambassador 
William Montgomery yesterday. "We cannot help asking why Prime 
Minister Berov asked for confidence only until September," Mr 
Gotsev added. Meanwhile, Alexander Lilov of BSP told the 
national radio that early elections will be held this fall and 
that they will be won by the BSP. 
  MP from the New Union for Democracy and representatives of 
the Democratic Bulgaria Union intend to propose a draft 
agreement to the other parliamentary forces to regulate the work 
of parliament until the new elections. They explained that 
parliament and the other state institutions have lost much of 
their prestige. However, jurists from different parliamentary 
forces say that under the Constitution early elections can only 
be held in case of cabinet crisis and the inability of 
parliament to appoint a government.
