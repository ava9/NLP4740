  [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Representatives of the two 
major political forces in Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the opposition Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) elaborated on their parties' stands on 
the census in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  "SDS is anxious about the census. Despite the large number 
of foreign observers, we are apprehensive that the population of 
the Republic of Macedonia lacks the democratic psychological and 
political environment required for free expression," said Mr. 
Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the National Coordinating 
Council of SDS and member of the parliamentary Foreign Policy 
Committee. SDS is skeptical mainly because of the considerable 
politicization of the ruling Macedonian Socialist Party which 
organizes the census taking and because of the fuelling of 
anti-Bulgarian attitudes, evidently to be used in the 
forthcoming election campaign. 
  "As a political force we have always maintained an explicit 
and resolute stand on Macedonia, which we took in 1992 when the 
SDS government recognized that country's independence," Mr. 
Panov pointed out. He added that SDS firmly believes that a 
sovereign, independent Macedonia is a guarantor of balance and 
stability in the Balkans. 
  "The Bulgarian Socialist Party is the only political force 
which two years ago refused to applaud the recognition of the 
Republic of Macedonia which was no doubt a hasty action, said 
BSP leader Zhan Videnov in response to a reporter's question 
about the census in Macedonia. According to Mr. Videnov, the 
problems with the language, the historical inheritance and the 
`Bulgarian' option in the census forms were bound to arise. 
  ``We shall always defend the Bulgarian history, the 
Bulgarian 
national spirit, Bulgarian cultural and historical sites and we 
hope that Macedonia would respond to our open and democratic 
policy in a similar manner,'' Mr. Panov pointed out. 
  Mr. Videnov is apprehensive about possible territorial 
claims 
and arguments between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The two states 
have a profoundly different concept of national security. "To 
Skopje national security is guaranteed by the presence of 
foreign military forces on the republic's territory, while 
Bulgaria seeks to achieve it through balanced and peaceful 
relations with its neighbours and integration with the European 
and world security structures," he explained. In his opinion, 
many chances for preventive settlement of problems between 
Bulgaria and Macedonia have been missed in the past two years 
and it is the respective state institutions that are to be held 
responsible and not the ones who were warning against the 
complications threatening to ensue from the involved 
configurations in the Balkans.
