  [Text] Sofia, June 17 (BTA) -- "There is every evidence 
that the position of the incumbent Bulgarian Government on human 
rights and the rights of Muslims in Bulgaria in particular is 
the right one," Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, secretary 
general of the League of Arab States, told a news conference 
today at the end of his official visit. The visit, paid at the 
invitation of Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, is 
the first one by a leader of the collective body of the Arab 
states to Bulgaria. During his visit, the guest acquainted 
himself with the Bulgarian Government's positions on the Arab 
region and on a number of international problems. 
  "The problem of Muslims in Bulgaria has been raised at all 
my 
meetings at different levels," Dr. Majid said. "Based on what I 
have been told, I can draw the conclusion that at the moment all 
Bulgarian citizens enjoy equal rights irrespective of their 
religion," he went on to say. Concerning Bulgaria's request for 
assistance in removing the question of Bulgarian Muslims from 
the agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the 
guest promised to inform the organization's leadership about 
everything he had learned in Bulgaria and expressed his hope 
that the request would be met. 
  The possibility of Bulgarian companies taking part in 
building the infrastructure in the region of Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip was also discussed with Dr. Majid. "Bulgaria has 
been maintaining active relations with the Arab countries, it 
has taken part in the building of their infrastructure and I 
think it is perfectly natural for it to take part in the 
construction in that area," Dr. Majid said. 
  Asked about the stand of the League of Arab States on the 
latest developments in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], Dr. Majid expressed his hope that 
Macedonia would continue to develop normally, avoiding any 
conflicts and bloodshed. "No doubt what is happening in 
Macedonia now has a negative effect on its neighbours, Bulgaria 
included," he stated. 
  Earlier today Dr. Majid was received by President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. He met National 
Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov too. 
  It was stressed at the meeting with President Zhelev that 
Bulgarian-Arab cooperation should be restored and activated. 
"In a historical, geographical and economic aspect, Bulgaria 
has always maintained good contacts with the Arab states," Kamen 
Velichkov, the president's foreign political adviser, said after 
the meeting. 
  The positions of Bulgaria and the Arab League on some major 
issues in the Balkans and the Middle East were clarified at Dr. 
Majid's meeting with the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament. 
Both sides agreed that Bulgaria would only benefit from the 
quick settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Dr. Majid showed interest 
in the difficulties Bulgaria has got to overcome in the 
implementation of economic reform and in its transition to a 
market economy; he was also interested in the progress of 
negotiations on Bulgaria's foreign debt with the international 
financial institutions, government spokesman Raycho Raykov said 
after the meeting. Prime Minister Berov stressed the fact that 
despite the difficulties, Bulgaria's transition to a 
market-based economy is peaceful. The guest wanted to know if 
foreign investments are protected in Bulgaria; he was assured 
that they are and that Bulgarian and foreign investors are 
treated on an equal footing. 
  Dr. Majid visited St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral in the 
centre of Sofia. He took a walk round the open market-place in 
the square in front of the cathedral where Bulgarian artists and 
craftsmen sell their works. He seemed to be especially 
interested in Bulgarian crafts and crochetwork. Tomorrow Dr. 
Majid will be visiting the Rila Monastery. He is leaving the 
country on Sunday.
