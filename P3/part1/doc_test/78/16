<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Belousova: "Bulgarian Socialist Party </F>
Initiates Petition To Topple Berov"] 
  [Text] At the first sign of deterioration in the social 
situation in the country, Yuri Borisov will initiate a petition 
among the deputies of the Parliamentary Union for Social 
Democracy [PSSD] with the demand to propose a vote of 
no-confidence in Lyuben Berov's cabinet. The deputy informed 
journalists of his intention during the 29 May plenum of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. 
  At their two-day national meeting in Karlovo the members of 
the Socialist Youth Union [SMS] decided that their organization 
should leave the PSSD if a petition aimed at prompting a 
no-confidence vote is not immediately initiated, SMS leader 
Lyubomir Nikolov announced on 29 May. 
  The upcoming 41st BSP Congress should direct the party's 
activity toward holding early elections, while the PSSD should 
facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws by the end of the 
summer vacation, BSP leader Zhan Videnov insisted in the draft 
resolution he proposed at the plenum. Videnov also proposed to 
the PSSD deputies to reject changes in the cabinet which lead 
toward asserting a party character in this organ. In yet 
another proposal he suggested to the PSSD to deny support to the 
governmental program until September 1994, and seek 
possibilities of initiating joint activities with the trade 
unions vis-a-vis the cabinet and the social commitments it 
assumed. 
  In his statement he clearly implied that in anything related 
to amendments in the Constitution and the Election Law 
negotiations must be conducted only with the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS]. 
  At the plenum Ananieva explained the situation related to 
the 
confidence vote, requested by the prime minister on 26 May. 
According to Ananieva, Aleksandur Tomov [leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic] was trying to organize the support of 
30 PSSD deputies for the idea of forming a pro-president 
government. The alternative of forming a caretaker cabinet had 
also been discussed, Ananieva said. 
  The young Socialist proposed a draft resolution calling on 
the PSSD deputies to carry out a vote of no-confidence in their 
chairman, but according to Videnov the proposal was not made in 
accordance to the correct procedure and was not discussed at the 
plenum because of its unserious character.
