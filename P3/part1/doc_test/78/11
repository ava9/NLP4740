  [Text] The National Assembly today voted to reject the 
proposed structural changes to the Council of Ministers. The 
deputies debated the proposed personnel changes to the cabinet 
but did not take a vote. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov asked for 
a vote of confidence in his government. The National Assembly 
deputies will take the vote next Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Zhan Videnov, BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader, told a 
BTA correspondent that the BSP rejected President Zhelyu 
Zhelev's proposal to meet to discuss the government's problems 
because the party considers that the country has a cabinet. 
According to Videnov, the BSP would support the vote of 
confidence in the cabinet if Professor Berov keeps to his 
earlier proposals for changes in the executive. 
  Meanwhile, the parliamentary groups of the BSP and its 
coalition and the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] are 
holding meetings in parliament to discuss the situation that has 
developed.
