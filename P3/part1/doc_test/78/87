  [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- The political problems 
resulting from Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's illness are in the 
highlights of today's press. KONTINENT writes that Mr. 
Aleksandur Pramatarski, vice president of the Democratic Party 
in the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), told its National 
Coordinating Council yesterday that a cabinet crisis is to be 
expected on March 21. The commentary goes on to say that the 
problem with the cabinet will most probably be solved before the 
national conference of the SDS in May and the new government is 
likely to be headed by Georgi Markov of the Democratic Party, 
who recently left the parliamentary SDS to become an independent 
MP. This situation is another godsend for the SDS, reads the 
commentary in KONTINENT. Yesterday President Zhelev and SDS 
leader Filip Dimitrov had lunch together but refused to comment 
on their meeting, writes 24 CHASA, quoting the Balkan News 
Agency. Actually, the SDS is not seeking to provoke a cabinet 
crisis, or is at least trying to postpone it because it is not 
ready for elections, reads an article in STANDART NEWS. "A 
diseased government cannot run a diseased state," writes the 
Bulgarian Agrarian Party's daily ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME. Now there is 
no one responsible for this country's government, says a 
commentary in the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA headlined "BSP Alone Is 
Blind to the Crisis". EKSPRES writes that the prime minister's 
wife told BSP leader Zhan Videnov over the phone that Professor 
Berov hopes to return to his office soon. The Socialist DUMA 
daily writes that the prime minister's illness has made the SDS 
put off its national conference until May. The same daily 
quotes the deputy chairman of the National Coordinating Council 
of the SDS, Mr. Stefan Sofiyanski, as saying that Deputy Prime 
Minister Valentin Karabashev and the acting Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev are squabbling while this country is 
suffocating in a tightening economic knot. 
  [Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian at 1100 GMT on 
16 
March reports two statements by a spokesperson of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council and by presidential spokesman 
Valentin Stoyanov, both denying that President Zhelyu Zhelev and 
SDS leader Filip Dimitrov held any meeting in Sofia on 15 May. 
Stoyanov is reported to have said that "the Balkan News Agency 
report on any meeting between President Zhelev and Filip 
Dimitrov is incorrect from beginning to end."]
