  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 18 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov submitted structural and personnel changes of his cabinet 
to parliament. He did it when taking the vote; the MP's decided 
that the first item on today's agenda would be the debate on 
last Wednesday's no-confidence vote motion of the parliamentary 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). The SDS motivation for the 
no-confidence vote is "the prime minister's inability to 
organize and direct the activities of the government." This is 
the sixth no-confidence vote tabled by the parliamentary SDS so 
far. [passage omitted] 
  Following the opening of the debate on the no-confidence 
vote, the Prime Minister surprisingly introduced the intended 
cabinet changes. He nominated two deputy prime ministers. If 
approved by parliament, Assoc. Prof. Rumen Gechev, an economist, 
will be a deputy prime minister without portfolio coordinating 
the structural adjustment of the country's real economy, helping 
in the implementation of the government's general economic 
policy, acting as a coordinator for the PHARE [Economic and 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and 
supervising the utilization of loans for the investments they 
are designed for, as well as the allocations of the State Fund 
for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Kiril Tsochev is Prof. Berov's nominee as a deputy prime 
minister who will supervise Bulgaria's balance of finances in 
connection with the foreign debt deals and the fluctuation of 
prices and the lev's exchange rate. This deputy prime minister 
will have to work for attracting foreign investments and promote 
the government's relations with private business. Mr. Tsochev 
will also be the minister of trade. When reporters asked the 
MP's who Mr. Tsochev is, nobody seemed to know anything about 
him; the prime minister was heard saying in the parliamentary 
lobbies that Mr. Tsochev had not been promoted by the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party]. 
  The prime minister asked the MP's to accept Valentin 
Karabashev's resignation as minister of trade he filed on April 
28. According to Prof. Berov, he and Mr. Karabashev have had 
differences over the variant of privatization to be implemented 
in Bulgaria since last spring. 
  The prime minister declared himself to be for the 
elimination 
of committees because the Constitution adopted in 1991 does not 
provide for such institutions. Prof. Berov proposed to set up 
two new ministries instead -- of energy and of communications, 
and promised to reorganize another three committees without 
setting up new ministries to replace them. He nominated Nikita 
Shervashidze, so far chairman of the Power Engineering 
Committee, as minister of energy, and Krustyu Mirski as minister 
of communications, specifying the latter was an expert in this 
field. 
  Prof. Berov proposed to dismiss Minister of Justice Petur 
Kornazhev and replace him by NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] MP 
Gospodin Atanasov. 
  If parliament approves the proposed changes, Prof. Berov's 
new cabinet will have 19 instead of 17 members, and four 
government agencies instead of three. 
  If his proposals are accepted next week, the prime minister 
would like a framework agreement between the government and the 
parliamentary forces or the individual MP's supporting it that 
will guarantee the adoption of the bankruptcy and the scheme of 
composition legislation as well as a bill amending the 
Privatization Act by the end of June at the latest. If the 
agreement is not signed, the cabinet is going to resign. The 
resignation will spoil the foreign debt deal, the mass 
privatization project will fail and Bulgaria's economic 
development will be seriously troubled, Prof. Berov told the 
MP's. 
  While Prof. Berov was introducing the cabinet changes, the 
DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement] MP's walked out of the 
parliamentary hall. Sherife Mustafa of the DPS told BTA that 
the DPS MP's were utterly surprised by the personnel changes 
which Prime Minister Berov had not discussed with the 
parliamentary DPS. According to Mrs. Mustafa, the nomination of 
Mr. Gechev as a deputy prime minister is unacceptable for the 
DPS because of his BSP affiliation. Holding a joint meeting 
later on, the DPS, the NSD and the group of independent MP's 
assessed the proposed changes as renunciation of the original 
government formula. 
  The DPS and NSD parliamentary groups came out with a joint 
declaration stating they would not vote for Prof. Berov's 
cabinet changes. In their opinion, Prof. Berov's are political 
appointees rather than experts as was the original formula of 
the government. The new formula is actually a coalition 
government with the BSP prominently represented in it. 
  By submitting his project for structural and personnel 
cabinet changes at a time when a procedure for debating a 
no-confidence vote has already been opened Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov, succumbing to pressure by the BSP, violated the 
Constitution, Petya Shopova of the Civil Alliance for the 
Republic (GOR), a left-of-centre formation, said after a meeting 
of the GOR and DPS parliamentary leaderships. 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that most of Prof. Berov's 
nominees were entirely new for him. The BSP will discuss its 
attitude to the submitted cabinet changes at tomorrow's plenum 
of the party leadership and the leaders of its parliamentary 
group. 
  Asked if he considers his resignation as a possible option, 
the prime minister said he would go if parliament voted no 
confidence in him. The no-confidence motion will be put to the 
vote after 1800 hours tomorrow because under the Constitution, 
24 hours should elapse between the debates and the voting 
procedure.
