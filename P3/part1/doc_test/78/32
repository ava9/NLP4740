<F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova from the Bulgarian Socialist </F>
Party Congress in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] The first thing the delegates to the 41st Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] Congress did was to adopt the congress 
agenda. Two additions to the agenda were proposed and adopted. 
The first proposes that a debate should be held on the party's 
election campaign platform during the discussions on the BSP 
program, and the second is to hear a declaration from a group of 
BSP intellectuals on the situation of the Bulgarian 
intelligentsia and the BSP's stance on this issue. 
  BSP Supreme Council leader Zhan Videnov read to the 
delegates 
an exceptionally detailed report entitled "On the BSP political 
line." Here are a few of the points he mentioned: 
  According to Videnov, the SDS's policy regarding the 
government failed because it was based on confrontation and 
restoration of the former state of things. This has led to the 
SDS becoming isolated form the people and falling into a serious 
crisis, Videnov said. 
  Despite the numerous question marks hanging over the formula 
on which the Berov cabinet was formed 18 months ago, the BSP 
supported Berov because he placed all-national interests higher 
than narrow party ones. However, Videnov stressed that a number 
of features now militate against this support: the blocking of 
the reforms, complete exhaustion of resources, and a fragile 
economy. The most crucial decision that you congress delegates 
have to reach, Videnov said, is to call for early elections in 
October or November, which can lead to major changes in the 
country's development and the imposition of a clear, 
left-of-center, socially oriented policy. However, he emphasized 
that Bulgaria needs early elections, but they should in no event 
be premature ones. For the BSP, the elections were not an aim 
in itself, but means for developing a free and just society. 
The road toward such a society lies precisely via democratic 
elections, the BSP leader emphasized. 
  Here is one of the concluding sentences that Videnov said at 
the end of this speech: More than ever before, we must get to 
realize where and why we went wrong during these four or five 
years that followed 45 years, and then strive to unleash new 
potential for social dialogue. 
  At the moment the congress is continuing with a report from 
the All-Party Control-Auditing Commission, and it is then to 
hear a report on the work of the BSP parliamentary group.
