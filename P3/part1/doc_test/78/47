non-partisan cabinet of Lyuben Berov has survived against all the odds

BULGARIA'S political prospects have brightened after the government of
non-party technocrats managed to beat off an aggressive opposition campaign
for early elections by surviving a critical parliamentary confidence vote.
The strength of the voting last week - 126 to 84 in favour of the reshuffled
cabinet - was unexpected in view of the highly vocal opposition in
parliament to the six-month-old government and its low ratings in opinion
polls. The vote of confidence marks a significant setback for the
anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the country's main
opposition group.
In recent weeks the UDF, whose year-old coalition government collapsed last
October after falling out with its political partners, has frequently called
its supporters on to the streets in an attempt to pressure President Zhelyu
Zhelev into calling fresh elections.
The UDF hoped that the same anti-communist slogans which propelled it to
power in 1991 could once again mobilise strong support in the country. But
with most Bulgarians more concerned about the prospect of another year of
severe economic recession than about party politics, only hardcore UDF
supporters, mainly in Sofia, responded.
Many former UDF supporters have been alienated by the party's bitter attacks
on its former leader, President Zhelev, who is by far the country's most
popular politician. The president himself says that an unforeseen result of
the UDF's anti-government campaign has been to increase support for the
Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP), the former Communist party.
The UDF leadership's radical stance has also split the party and contributed
to the formation of a new centrist group in parliament. This includes 23 MPs
who broke away from the UDF. The centrists showed in last Friday's vote that
they are prepared to co-operate with the socialists and the much smaller
Movement for Rights and Freedom (the party which represents Bulgaria's
ethnic Turk minority) in supporting the government.
Centrist group votes were also on hand earlier this month to help push
through the 1993 budget with a two-thirds majority after three months of
often heated discussion. The vote ratified the government's efforts to keep
the budget deficit to a ceiling of 7.9 per cent of GDP in the face of
demands for higher spending on social security and subsidies.
The political situation remains far from settled, however, with further
splits in both the UDF and BSP expected. 'The situation is in ferment, many
changes are still taking place. The centre has not yet crystallised,' Mr
Zhelev says.
This leaves the government, a cabinet of non-partisan technocrats led by Mr
Lyuben Berov, a 67-year-old former university professor, without firm
support from any of the main political parties. It will therefore remain
difficult for it to move ahead with privatisation and push through laws
needed for economic reform.
The privatisation agency has only just completed its first large
transaction, the sale of a maize-processing plant to a Belgian company,
Amylum, for Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m), and claims that several other
projects are well advanced. But western advisers say there is still a lack
of consensus within the government over how best to speed the process and
over which of several rival mass privatisation schemes to adopt. Similarly,
only slow progress is being made to fulfil IMF requirements for the signing
of a new stand-by agreement to replace the previous arrangement which
expired in March.
One critical area is the need for greater financial discipline in the
state-owned companies. State-owned enterprises owe an estimated Dollars 2bn
to the banks and to one another. The delay in tackling this problem is
blocking privatisation by prolonging the life of unprofitable companies and
contributing to the 75 per cent annual inflation rate.
The IMF and the World Bank both want to see headway in introducing
bankruptcy and tax reform laws and tough new banking regulations before
releasing further credits.
Their views are listened to because the support of the big international
institutions is required both to give much needed technical assistance and
to help finance a future debt settlement with the London Club of commercial
bank creditors.
At the latest London Club meeting in Frankfurt, two weeks ago, the two sides
edged closer to an agreement, according to Ms Mariana Todorova, Bulgaria's
debt negotiator.
The Bulgarian side has dropped its original demand for a 70 per cent debt
reduction to 50 per cent. It has also offered to make an upfront settlement
of Dollars 750m on its Dollars 11bn debt.
The banks on the other hand are seeking to limit the debt write-off to 38
per cent and are seeking repayments of around Dollars 400m a year. This
contrasts with the Dollars 250m which the Bulgarian side claims is the most
it can afford.
