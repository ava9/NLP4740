  [Excerpts] Sofia, June 22 (BTA) -- During the second day 
of consultations on the Judiciary Act, which passed late last 
week, President Zhelyu Zhelev received Prosecutor General Ivan 
Tatarchev and the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council headed by 
its chairman, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev. Supreme Court 
Chairman Ivan Grigorov set forth the council's opinion that 20 
texts of the law contravene the Constitution. In contrast to 
other council members, Ani Kruleva, director of the National 
Investigative Service (NIS), believes the president should not 
veto the law, which meets with approval from investigators. 
According to her, the Judiciary Act adequately regulates the 
structure and functions of the NIS, as well as the status of 
investigators. 
  President Zhelev, who is also Supreme Commander-in-Chief of 
the Armed Forces, today received Vice-Admiral Ventseslav Velkov, 
Commander of the Navy. The sides discussed the state of the 
Navy, ways to resolve its problems and the progress of reform, 
says a press release of the president's office. They exchanged 
views on the Breeze-94 Naval Exercise, the first in this country 
within the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme. 
Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, Greece and the 
United States will be taking part in it and Georgia will send 
observers. 
  Filip Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces 
(SDS), met with top-level representatives of the United Romany 
Alliance headed by Vasil Chaprazov, the SDS press office said. 
The Gypsy leaders expressed concern over the SDS's failure to 
commit itself sufficiently to the problems of the Gypsy 
community, which could make it easy prey to manipulations. Also 
on the agenda were national economic problems and prospects for 
cooperation between the two organizations for their resolution. 
  The Press Office of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
today 
denied stories in DEMOKRATSIYA, EXPRESS and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, 
misquoting a statement by socialist leader Zhan Videnov who 
spoke at a news conference yesterday [21 June]. The Press 
Office said questioners had asked Mr. Videnov to comment on the 
BSP's silence and lack of official stand on the census in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and Skopje's policy on ethnic minority issues, to which he 
responded, "On the contrary, the Bulgarian Socialist Party was 
the only political force two and a half years ago to refuse to 
applaud the hasty unconditional recognition of the Republic of 
Macedonia, arguing that, predictably, such problems would arise 
between the two countries." According to Mr. Videnov, the 
language problem, the problem over the "Bulgarian" option in the 
census forms, and the "Macedonian" option in similar censuses in 
Bulgaria were bound to arise. He went on to say, "Disputes over 
the historical legacy were also bound to arise, and territorial, 
maybe even border disputes, are probably taking shape. No doubt, 
national security is another such area of which the two states 
have profoundly different concepts. For Skopje, it amounts to 
the presence of foreign troops on Macedonian territory, while 
Bulgaria sees it as balanced and peaceful relations with all of 
its neighbours, integrated into the European and world security 
systems. Thus the BSP cannot in the least be accused of taking a 
conformist, vague and inconsistent stand on these issues. They 
cannot mar Bulgarian-Macedonian relations, though many 
opportunities for their preventive settlement have been lost in 
the last two and a half years. Now, undoubtedly, the 
responsibility will have to be shouldered by the respective 
state institutions, and not by those who warned that the 
complicated configuration in the Balkans was fraught with grave 
difficulties." 
  National Bank Governor Todor Vulchev met today with members 
of the BSP leadership, national radio reported. Speaking to a 
radio reporter, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said the meeting 
had taken place at Mr. Vulchev's request. Doncho Konakchiev of 
the Socialists' top leadership said the BSP had asked for such a 
meeting much earlier and it had been occasioned, among other 
things, by vacancies on the central bank's Governing Board and 
forecasts about the exchange rate of the lev. 
  President Zhelev uses the political centre to fulfill his 
ambitions, Velislava Dureva of the Social Democracy Alliance 
within the BSP told a news conference today. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking at a news conference in Razgrad (northern 
Bulgaria), 
Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti, now leader of the Democratic 
Party of Justice, said he expected the World Bank to extend a $1 
million loan for the opening of food enterprises in northeastern 
Bulgaria (a region with a large ethnic Turk population), as well 
as for other projects in the region. Gendzhev believes the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference may rescind its decisions 
against Bulgaria. [passage omitted] 
  Experts of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and of 
the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions (KNSB) hold 
similar views on the government ordinance on permissible levels 
of pollutants in industrial units, the press learned from KNSB 
Deputy Chairman Zhelyazko Khristov today. The entry into force 
of the ordinance, scheduled for January 1, was postponed at the 
trade union's request. If it is enforced in its present shape, 
some 220,000 people working in a harmful environment will lose 
their social benefits, Dr. Khristov said. [passage omitted] 
  In an open letter to Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, the two 
influential trade unions -- KNSB and Podkrepa -- today called 
for the resignation of Culture Minister Ivaylo Znepolski. Their 
demand is motivated by what they see as a "disgraceful action 
aimed to eliminate the institutions which direct, create and 
popularize Bulgarian culture". 
  The customs office in Kyustendil has collected over 1.5 
million leva in fines for customs irregularities this year, 
BTA's correspondent reported. Cigarettes, batteries, water 
pumps and welders have been confiscated and 5 kilos of heroin 
has been seized.
