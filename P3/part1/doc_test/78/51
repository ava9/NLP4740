<F P=106> [Commentary by Khristo Bardaliev: "Bulgarian Socialist </F>
Party Made Painful Step Toward Power"] 
  [Text] It is no exaggeration to say that the 41st BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] Congress was awaited with interest 
not only by society but also by the various parties and 
coalitions. The BSP supporters had good reason to expect (and 
demand) a clear stance on the current political and economic 
crisis. The main opponent of the BSP, the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces], convened a special session of the National 
Coordinating Council to enable it to react immediately to the 
congress decisions. The other parliamentary and 
extraparliamentary parties impatiently waited for the congress 
to end, mostly so that they could reorient themselves regarding 
the date of possible early elections and the potential chance of 
utilizing the "red" carrier rocket for new parliamentary seats. 
  Naturally, it is as yet too early to speak of any full and 
precise answer to these issues. Nevertheless, the main 
tendencies in the development of the BSP can be divined. 
  The most important thing -- for both the BSP and the whole 
of 
Bulgarian society -- was that the congress prevented 
restorational and nostalgic longings for the "bright past" to 
gain the upper hand in its decisions on the BSP program and 
statute. The rejection of the draft documents submitted by the 
"Marxist Alternative" faction is proof enough of this. 
  The convincing majority by which Zhan Videnov was reelected 
as leader indicates that his views will form the basis of the 
parties practical politics in the future. Incidentally, the 
conservatives did gain their revenge by preventing a number of 
prominent members of the OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy] 
from being elected to the Supreme Council -- people like Dimitur 
Yonchev, Velislava Dureva, Rosen Karadimov, and Elena 
Poptodorova. In this way the provincial delegates showed that 
they do not like free thinkers, or perhaps they merely think 
that they can thus make room for new deputies in the next 
parliament. 
  Andrey Lukanov's star also faded. Evidently, the accusations 
heaped upon him of banking swindles had their effect, or perhaps 
he had simply become an embarrassment, being too closely 
connected with the former leadership of the Bulgarian Communist 
Party, or again, maybe both factors played a part. 
  Surprisingly, Aleksandur Marinov also met with failure. It 
is difficult to say what he paid the price for -- his excessive 
personal ambitions or his too close connections with Aleksandur 
Lilov. 
  These personnel changes indicate something of real 
importance, namely that the BSP is taking difficult and painful 
steps along the road of replacing its dogmatic ideology with 
pragmatism. They also show that it already realizes the need to 
break out of the magic circle of insider quarrels about the kind 
of "social democracy" or "democratic socialism" that mean 
nothing in themselves, and is moving toward a specific program 
and concrete actions arising therefrom. 
  The party's specific program and actions will be determined 
by the internal balance within the BSP, between the party elite, 
linked with young Bulgarian business, and the mood of the party 
mass membership, which is dominated by the feelings of the 
sections of Bulgarian society with fewest rights -- the 
pensioners, peasants, and unemployed. 
  The BSP can no longer rely on cheap populist ploys, 
especially since it has attracted much opprobrium by its support 
of the Berov cabinet, support provided in the name of economic 
and social stabilization -- hopes that proved illusory. 
  The renunciation of direct ideologizing is even more 
necessary if the party wants to find allies for the upcoming 
election duel. The less said about concepts and the more about 
the nation's problems, the easier the BSP will find it to 
attract more of the better-quality parties and personalities. 
This will provide the best answer to the meaningless question: 
"Is the BSP changing?" 
  "He who does not advance loses ground" -- the BSP 
headquarters at 20 Pozitano Street has enough historians and 
philosophers who are well aware of the truth of this Latin 
saying. The question is whether the new leadership will succeed 
to turn "the word into flesh," as the Gospel puts it.
