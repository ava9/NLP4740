  [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's major political 
forces, the anti-communist Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) 
and former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), are 
considering their election campaigns before elections are even 
scheduled. For more than a year the SDS have been calling on 
the cabinet of nonpartisan Professor Lyuben Berov to resign and 
insisting on early elections. Three days ago President Zhelyu 
Zhelev withdrew his support for the cabinet. The cabinet's 
resignation is a variant being considered by the ethnic Turks' 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) on whose mandate the 
incumbent cabinet was formed in late December 1992. At a 
closed-door sitting late last week, the Socialists, for their 
part, decided to give a last chance to Prof. Berov's cabinet and 
granted them a month and a half to take under control the 
critical situation of the past couple of weeks. In the 
meantime, Prime Minister Berov, now recovering from a cardiac 
operation, publicized his plans about structural and personnel 
changes in the government. 
  The government has obviously come to an impasse, SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov told journalists after a sitting of the union's 
supreme leadership. According to him, the government is trying 
very hard to convince people that the situation is improving. 
While the dollar seems to be under control, the prices do not. 
The statements of cabinet members sound most strange; they 
display a fake optimism and gross indifference to the man in the 
street, Filip Dimitrov went on to say. He reiterated the 
union's firm belief that the incumbent cabinet should step down. 
The SDS leader would not give further details as to the 
specific action the union is planning to take, adding only that 
it will resort to extraparliamentary means as soon as the 
parliamentary ones prove inefficient. 
  The SDS supreme leadership today also discussed its election 
campaign. This issue was high on the agenda of the BSP 
Executive Council. Socialists' leader Zhan Videnov told 
journalists that disbanding the parliament, which the effective 
constitution provides for in case a caretaker cabinet is 
appointed, is absurd when the country has embarked on the road 
of transition. Amendment of this provision in the constitution 
will require a majority of three quarters of the parliamentary 
votes. 
  Filip Dimitrov also said that the SDS leadership has not put 
for discussion the BSP proposal for amendment to the 
constitution to enable Parliament to sit even after the 
formation of a caretaker cabinet. According to the SDS leader, 
the fact that the Socialists are trying to launch the prolonged 
and complex parliamentary procedure for amending of the 
constitution comes to show that they are the ones who fear early 
election, not the SDS. The ex-Communists fear elections like 
hell, Filip Dimitrov also said.
