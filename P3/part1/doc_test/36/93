WALKERS in New Zealand are spoilt for choice. The country is criss-crossed
with over 40 well-marked treks and there are more than 1,000 mountain huts,
four to five hours' walk apart, for overnight stops.
The variety of landscape is remarkable: in one day you can walk through
forests with great fern trees, up mountains with peaks still covered in
summer snow, alongside lakes, rivers and waterfalls. If you are lucky, you
will see birds such as the fearless and inquisitive kea or the flightless
weka.
Which tramp - as New Zealanders call it - to choose? It is a question of
assessing your own walking ability, finding a trek to match, and deciding
whether to go independently or with a guide. Independent walkers carry their
own food, cooking utensils and sleeping bags and sleep in huts which have
bunks, mattresses, water supply, pit toilets and cooking facilities. Treks
on major routes must be pre-booked even for independent walkers. Hut fees
range from NZDollars 4 to NZDollars 14 a night depending on category, but
350 are free.
Guided walks are for those who do not want to be loaded down with food and
equipment or do their own cooking. These overnight huts are equipped with
hot showers, drying room, duvets, towels and hairdryers. Pack, bedsheet,
waterproof parka and trousers are usually supplied free.
Most of the well-known treks are on South Island. Some 8,000 people walk the
spectacular Milford track every year, undeterred by its average annual five
and a half metres of rain. But numbers are regulated, with only 40
independent and 42 guided trekkers allowed to set off each day from Lake
Anau (you start and finish by boat) to walk deep into Fiordland National
Park to Milford Sound. The price (excluding flights) for a guided trek,
including two nights' resort accommodation, is NZDollars 1,299.
Sir Edmund Hillary has called the Routeburn and Greenstone Valley treks 'two
of the most superb walking areas in the world'. Both are three- or four-day,
Queenstown-to-Queenstown treks. The Routeburn (rainforests, waterfalls,
lakes, alpine meadows full of flowers) crosses the Southern Alps in
Fiordland and Mount Aspiring National Parks, climbing to 1,277m. The price
is NZDollars 782.
The Greenstone Valley, a gentler walk along an ancient Maori trail, follows
the Greenstone river through beech forests. The price is NZDollars 670. Less
populated, but no less beautiful, are the Rees-Dart (four-five day round
trip), and the Hollyford (four-five days) with trout fishing, seal and
penguin colonies en route.
In the far north of South Island is the Abel Tasman coastal track. Open all
year, suitable for the less experienced, it is a trek beside the sea, with
sandy beaches and forested hills. The concession is held by the Wilson
family who have a five-generation association with the national park,
restrict their relaxed guided tours to 16 people, and have accommodation in
a beach-side lodge. The price is NZDollars 645.
Independent walkers using huts or camping areas need a pass which costs
NZDollars 4 a night from the department of conservation, Nelson. New
Zealand's highest guided trek, Ball Pass, in Mt Cook National Park, is a
magnificent two-three-day alpine crossing linking the Tasman and Hooker
valleys through snow-fields. Price, depending on size of group and number of
days, is NZDollars 275 to NZDollars 580.
For detailed information about trekking, contact the New Zealand Tourism
Board (London tel: 071-973-0360). The New Zealand Travel Information Service
(081-748-4455), from whom the above prices are quoted, has a range of treks.
Silver Fern Holidays (0602-40111) and HF Holidays offer the Routeburn trek
with a tour of South Islands national parks for Easter 1993. The price is
Pounds 1,990 (including flight), Pounds 990 (land only).
If you are in New Zealand and haven't booked a trek, give Outside Adventures
in Queenstown (03-442-7126) a call. They provide guided walks, adapted to
ability, plus B&amp;B accommodation.
Recommended reading: Tramping In New Zealand by Jim DuFresne, published by
Lonely Planet Publications, Pounds 6.95. It gives detailed descriptions and
maps of 40 treks, and the best time to go. Some of the high-altitude treks
are not open in NZ's winter months.
