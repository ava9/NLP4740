Writers have never recovered from being evicted by time and social progress
from the garrets they see as their natural habitats. Many still seek
castigatory environments even when, in the age of arts subsidies and social
welfare, comfort is within their reach.
Take the hero of Joel and Ethan Coen's Barton Fink, a black comedy about
madness that won the top prize, and several others, last year at Cannes.
Playwright Fink (John Turturro) has come to Hollywood after his latest
Broadway success - Bare Ruined Choirs, 'a simple tale of fishmongers' - and
is now holed up at the faded, majestic Hotel Earle. The time is the 1940s
when the cinema became a great provider, a welfare state by another name, to
every serious writer willing to slum it for a few months in Tinseltown.
When not discussing his screenwriting future with the fat studio head
(Michael Lerner combining LB Mayer with Jack Warner) and the thin, alcoholic
novelist teaching him the ropes (John Mahoney doing a William Faulkner),
Fink is marooned in his mouldering hotel room with writer's block. The
typewriter, though seldom struck, beats a deafening tattoo when it is.
Fink's neighbour (John Goodman) is genial on the surface, psychotic just
beneath. Mosquitoes whine like insect Eumenides. And the wallpaper is coming
away from the wall stickily, audibly, nastily, like flesh from an early
religious martyr.
Ah yes, but is the place falling apart? Is the neighbour mad? Is the
wallpaper in need of attention? Or is Fink himself, fright-haired and
pop-eyed in his steel-rim spectacles, a few cards short of a full deck?
Initially inspired by Clifford Odets, this lost-in-Hollywood left-winger is
turned by the Coens into a joke-archetypal writer who expressionistically
appropriates every new world he moves into. Though not told explicitly
through Fink's eyes, the scenes inside and outside the hotel both aspire to
a mildly deranged surrealism. The Coen-esque world of Raising Arizona and
Miller's Crossing, where daft events are delivered with a piercing sobriety,
is here given a subjective pretext by the dotty sensibility of the main
character.
But rather than legitimising the Coen style, this ends up devaluing it.
Barton Fink swept the board at Cannes, one suspects, because Roman Polanski
was jury president. Here was a film after Mr P's own heart: a Repulsion or
Cul De Sac for the 1990s, turning clinical claustrophobia into high black
comedy. But Polanski's films had an intensity and a savage cutting edge.
Barton Fink plays increasingly like a series of hit-and-miss sketches dreamt
up by two film-makers doodling between assignments.
Michael Lerner's studio chief is a hit: a human super-blob who alternates
between apoplexy and ingratiation. (Foot-kissing of screenwriters is a
speciality.) But Lerner's scenes could belong to a different film from the
neo-Gothic ones involving Goodman - inspired as if by Kubrick's The Shining
 -or the subplot romance with Judy Davis, who plays novelist's moll to the
Faulkner character and ends up as a corpse between Fink's sheets.
As with many films that spiral out of control, accumulation replaces
momentum. When murder, arson and dementia take over in the last reel, we
feel the same sense of jaded bemusement as when a horror film, running out
of anything further to up, sets fire to the ogre's mansion, hurls the
escaping hero(ine) into the open air, lashes the orchestra's string section
into overdrive and cranes up to view the aesthetic shambles with the
clemency of distance.
There is no mercy even in distance for The Favour, The Watch And The Very
Big Fish. Adapted by Anglo-Australian writer-director Ben Lewin from a story
by France's Marcel Ayme, this is a Euro-pudding that should never have left
the mixing bowl.
Where, to begin with, are we? Paris is the nominal setting and France is the
country of origin for most of the supporting cast. Yet the stars are
Anglo-American (Bob Hoskins, Jeff Goldblum, Natasha Richardson) and the
dialogue is out of Ionesco by a French-English phrasebook. As for the plot -
something about a photographer (Hoskins) employed by a religious artefacts
shop who falls in love with a pretty actress (Richardson) and finds his
perfect Christ model in her one-time ex-convict lover (Goldblum) - it aims
at a deadpan farcical tone, a sort of Gallic Fish Called Wanda, and misses
by a continent.
Bemused by the choppy editing and Franglais dialogue, I never once believed
in the romantic electricity supposedly taking place between Richardson and
Mr Hoskins, here sporting a posh accent, a moustache and a very big fish.
This last, featured in only one scene, is put through a mincer by Hoskins's
cordon bleu sister. Do not ask me why.
Elsewhere I recall two funny moments - a dog attacking a stuffed lion and a
porno film voice-dubbing session - and many more moments of stupefaction
shading into somnolence.
I was on red alert throughout Star Trek VI. Warp-speeding through the
galaxies with Kirk, Bones, Scotty, Spocky and the rest of them, we thrill to
another plot in which the evil Klingons menace decent humanity.
This time their bankrupt empire is suing for peace and their chancellor
Gorkon (David Warner as a galactic Gorbachev) is assassinated en route to
the United Federation of Planets. Was his ship blown up by the Enterprise?
Klingon nasty Christopher Plummer thinks so and so he ships Kirk and Bones
off to Klingon Siberia. From this wintry hell on a far-flung planet we are
told that 'No one ever escaped': which means our heroes take ten minutes
rather than five to do so. Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, only a missing
pair of gravity boots can help Spock find the true culprits and prove his
masters' innocence . . .
Never mind gravity boots. As the spaced-out saga clocks up its 25th year, I
am concerned about all those gravity toupees. William Shatner's Kirk wears a
grey and curly number, while Bones favours a youthful sideways-with-parting
and Spock sports that unchanging jet-black fringe set off by twitching bat
ears. We have never seen so many attempts to conceal advancing
empty-headeness with advanced cranial foliage.
Star Trek VI itself is a piece of shameless let-your-hair-down camp. Rife
with idiot charm, it rejoices in lines like 'You've not experienced
Shakespeare until you've read him in the original Klingon' (Plummer to Kirk)
and 'There's an old Vulcan proverb: 'Only Nixon could go to China'' (Spock
to anyone still listening). Director Nicholas Meyer, on his third trekkie
outing, seems as happily confused as the rest of us over ranks and titles.
(I thought Kirk was an Admiral the last time round? And when was Spock
promoted to Captain?) But undeterred he hurls jokes, explosions and special
effects at us as if there were no tomorrow.
For this cast we are sadly told there may not be. In the closing credits the
stars literally sign off - pink autographs enscrolled on a galactic
background - and another generation, says the over-voice, will soon boldly
go 'where no man - no one - has gone before.' Ah, Political Correctness. Not
even the battle-scarred Enterprise can resist the onslaught of that.
Finally, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is back. Heaven knows what the PC
brigade have to say about this. Here we have an overprivileged Wasp
debutante establishing sway over a group of socially deprived mineworkers of
reduced stature. Still, the songs are good. And the animation, after 50
years, is matchless.
