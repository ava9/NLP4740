John Hughes' "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (NBC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) offers a 
tantalizing fantasy for adults, as well as kids: What if you could fool your 
parents and teachers (or your boss) into thinking you were sick, earning 
yourself a 24-hour free ride from the boredom and responsibilities of real 
life? Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick, in the title role, is so smug and 
invincible that he doesn't give us any chance to root for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" (ABC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a rollicking, 
allegorical super-space opera directed by Leonard Nimoy with an irresistibly 
sure touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool Hand Luke," that solid but often antic 1967 prison film with Paul Newman 
and an Oscar-winning George Kennedy, returns on KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Schroder stars in the new TV movie "A Son's Promise" (ABC, Monday at 9 
p.m.) as a small-town Southern teen-ager who promises his dying mother that he 
will take care of his six younger brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Moves" (KTLA, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a mild, overly theatrical 
Saroyanesque tale in which all of life seems to be concentrated in one seedy 
neighborhood saloon, whose habitues form a sort of extended family. John Savage 
stars in the 1980 film. 
</P>
<P>
The lively 1984 "Runaway" (CBS, Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a Michael Crichton 
'science-fact" adventure, stars Tom Selleck and imagines the worst possible 
kind of handgun, one that shoots microelectronic bullets that are all but 
impossible to escape. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975's "Drowning Pool" (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Paul Newman returns as 
Harper, the tough detective that he first played in the 1966 film of the same 
name, but this film is not nearly as engaging as the original. 
</P>
<P>
John Huston's 1973 "The Mackintosh Man" (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 
handsome, mellow spy thriller whose end unfortunately is almost as confusing as 
its beginning. Paul Newman stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Night of the Comet" (KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.) is an amusing and imaginative 
1984 doomsday sci-fi thriller that finds Catherine Mary Stewart gamely fighting 
off zombies. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatal Vision," the suspenseful 1984 film of Joe McGinniss' best-seller about a 
Green Beret doctor (Gary Cole) convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two 
children, airs on KCAL in two parts, Saturday and Sunday (March 11) at 8 p.m.
