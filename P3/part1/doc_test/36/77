Peter Rainer criticizes Eddie Murphy for giving up those great moments on 
"Saturday Night Live" for commercial films that -- according to Rainer -- don't 
measure up to Murphy's talents ("Murphy &amp; Pryor's Star Trek," Nov. 24). How 
come Rainer doesn't criticize other "Saturday Night" graduates such as Chevy 
Chase, who continues to make those innocuous "on the road" movies; or Bill 
Murray, who did "Ghostbusters II," a film that didn't make me laugh once; or 
Dan Aykroyd, who is to the art of acting what apartheid is to compassion.

Of course it has nothing to do with the fact that all these are white and Eddie 
Murphy is black. Of course not!
