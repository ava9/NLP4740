similar to those depicted in science-fiction programmes such as Star Trek -
already exist and some may eventually be available for home use, Professor
Anthony Turner, head of biotechnology at Cranfield Institute of Technology,
told the meeting.
Prof Turner said sophisticated new biosensors and sensitive diagnostic tests
were already being used to monitor glucose levels in diabetics and to detect
pregnancy within a fortnight of conception.
The future of biosensors - accurate detectors created by the linking of
biology and electronics - looks assured.
Medisense, the biotechnology company based in Abingdon, Buckinghamshire, has
developed a kit which allows diabetics to monitor their blood glucose levels
from a single drop of blood, giving accurate results in 20 seconds.
Magazines aimed at women aged between 16 and 35 carry advertisements for
products using biosensors, such as a home ovulation kit to determine their
chance of pregnancy and a kit which can detect success within a minute. Both
rely on the sensitivity of antibodies which latch on to substances produced
by ovulating or pregnant women.
Prof Turner said research was under way in Japan on ways of allowing tests
carried out by biosensors in casualty departments to be used at home as a
form of preventative medicine. However, he warned: 'I'm not sure it's
completely worked through.'
