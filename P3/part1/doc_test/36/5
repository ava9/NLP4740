Trek Talk: Actor-director William Shatner promises that Trekkies devoted to the 
original 1966 "Star Trek" TV series will find plenty to like about "Star Trek 
V: The Final Frontier," scheduled for release June 9. "It harks back to what I 
liked best in the old 'Star Trek' series, and that is the action and the 
adventure and the interplay between the characters," says Shatner, 58, who 
co-wrote the script, directed the film and reprised his role as the intrepid 
James T. Kirk. Shatner says that compared to the other "Star Trek" movies, 
"this picture is rougher and louder and faster -- there's more of an energy 
permeating the film." ALEENE MacMINN
