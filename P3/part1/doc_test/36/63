NEW GENERATION GOES FOR A SPIN IN OLDS ADS; 
</P>
<P>
RINGO STARR AND PETER GRAVES ARE AMONG THE STARS APPEARING IN OLDSMOBILE'S NEW 
CAMPAIGN.

Former Beatle Ringo Starr, with a little help from his daughter, is in the 
driver's seat of Oldsmobile's new TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
And so is "Mission Impossible" 's white-haired star, Peter Graves; Noel Blanc, 
son of the late Mel Blanc; and even Albert Einstein's great grandson, Edward. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Oldsmobile officials said the car maker will this weekend kick off 
the second year of its "New Generation of Olds" ad campaign. The spots -- which 
place well-known celebrities in humorous situations with their not-so-famous 
children or relatives -- all feature the familiar jingle, "This is not your 
father's Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
"We get calls from all kinds of celebrities who want to be in the ads," said 
Ted Jordan, general manager of the Southfield, Mich., office of Chicago-based 
Leo Burnett. The commercials are created out of both agency offices. "But the 
trick is to only use celebrities who we can closely connect with the product." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," said Don Gwaltney, creator of the campaign, "is we make cars for 
both generations." The TV show "Mission Impossible," for example, is trying to 
appeal to a second generation of viewers. And just about everyone knows Graves 
as the professorial-like figure who always outsmarts the bad guys on "Mission 
Impossible." 
</P>

<P>
Last year, such celebrities as "Star Trek" 's William Shatner and astronaut 
Scott Carpenter had roles in Oldsmobile ads. 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney, group creative director at Leo Burnett in Chicago, said he got the 
idea nearly two years ago while sitting in his office on a Sunday afternoon. 
And as for the jingle, said Gwaltney, "I wrote that one day while driving to 
the airport." 
</P>
<P>
In the "Mission Impossible" ad, which even includes the familiar music from the 
TV show, Graves is pursued in an unfriendly foreign country while driving his 
Cutlass Supreme. And he is able to drive past a heavily guarded border by 
quietly taking off his mask -- only to reveal the face of his daughter, Amanda. 
</P>
<P>
In another spot, Ringo Starr is chased by adoring fans until his 18-year-old 
daughter, Lee, rescues him in a four-door Cutlass Supreme. "A 'fab four'-door," 
his daughter calls it, in reference to the former nickname of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, in which Ringo sings the familiar Oldsmobile jingle, was shot earlier 
this summer in Culver City. The director was Joe Pytka, the much sought after 
Los Angeles commercial director who may be best known for filming the Madonna 
spot for Pepsi that was axed earlier this year after airing only once. Viewers 
confused the ad with Madonna's provocative music video, and Pepsi executives 
decided to swallow their estimated $5-million investment in her ad. 
</P>
<P>
And while Oldsmobile executives say they have been careful to select 
celebrities who are not likely to cause the company any headaches, some things 
can't be predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, the company filmed a commercial that included an 
appearance by Mel Blanc -- the voice of such cartoon characters as Bugs Bunny 
and Daffy Duck. But less than a month later, Blanc died. Although Oldsmobile 
still plans to run the commercial later this year, executives are debating 
whether to run its last segment, where Blanc appears seated in the back seat of 
the car with several animated characters and says, "That's all folks." 
</P>
<P>
While the Blanc family has given Oldsmobile permission to run the ad, at least 
one celebrity broker said airing it might not be such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough call," said Alann Heldfond, a celebrity broker at Ingels 
Productions in Hollywood. "Certainly, they would have to test it extensively 
before they put it on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Advertising researchers say last year's Olds ad campaign was among the most 
effective in the auto industry. And sales of some Oldsmobile models improved 
considerably. But one researcher said that by keeping the same campaign theme 
for a second year, Oldsmobile may also be digging itself into a rut. 
</P>
<P>
"They can only stretch this celebrity thing for so long," said Jim Hillson, 
senior analyst at Phase One, a Los Angeles advertising research firm. "It 
sounds to me like they're running in place. The real challenge is to take the 
attention away from the celebrities and draw it toward the cars."
