No news is bad news for video fans looking for another big-movie release this 
week. There isn't one. It's the lull between "Batman" and "Ghostbusters II" 
(already out) and "When Harry Met Sally . . .," "Star Trek V," "Road House" and 
"Great Balls of Fire" (all released next week). 
</P>
<P>
This week's slim pickings: 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to Me" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). This 1989 drama's cast may 
attract you -- Kirk Cameron, Jami Gertz, Roy Scheider, Amanda Peterson and 
Anthony Zerbe -- even if the reviews were generally poor and the plot is less 
than irresistible. It's all about two members of a college debate team getting 
ready for the big match against Harvard. Yes, it's a very slow week. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Get Ahead in Advertising" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R). We've had talking 
horses, talking mules and talking cars before, so why not a talking pimple? The 
pimple pops up on the shoulder of an anxiety-ridden advertising hotshot in this 
heavy-handed black comedy starring Richard E. Grant and directed by Bruce 
Robinson (both from "Withnail and I"). 
</P>
<P>
"84 Charlie Mopic" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). Even though lost in the shuffle 
of higher-budgeted Vietnam War movies, this 1989 drama about a six-man 
reconnaissance team that's being filmed by a documentary crew received some 
good reviews. The cast (Richard Brooks, Christopher Burgard, Nicholas Cascone, 
Jonathan Emerson and Glenn Morshower), though mostly unknowns, also was praised 
by critics. Patrick Duncan directed. 
</P>
<P>
"A Sinful Life" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). The L.A. Groundlings play "Just Like 
the Pom Pom Girls" was turned into this interesting 1989 failure -- a wacky, 
quirky comedy about the lengths a single, unemployed mother named Claire Vin 
Blanc (played by Anita Morris) will go to keep her baby (named Baby) from being 
placed in a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ann Jillian Story" (J2, $79.95). TV movie starring Jillian in her own 
filmography, tracing her career through her battle with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost Writer" (Prism, $79.95, PG). Obscure 1989 comedy about a free-lance 
writer who "ghost writes" the life story of a movie star who's, you guessed it, 
a ghost. Not to be confused with a 1984 PBS adaptation of a Philip Roth story 
by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" on Feb. 1 for $24.95 (VHS and Beta), 
$29.95 (laserdisc) and $39.95 (Super-VHS). 1989's second-biggest theatrical hit 
(after "Batman," of course) will be Paramount's first release ever in 
Super-VHS. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal Weapon II" on Feb. 8. Warner will offer the hit sequel for $24.98 (VHS, 
Beta, laserdisc) and $29.98 (8mm). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"Anne of Avonlea" (Walt Disney, $29.95 for the double-cassette package) is the 
likable TV sequel to the great Canadian-series version of the classic girl's 
story "Anne of Green Gables." As in the first series, Megan Follows stars as 
Anne -- this time grown up and becoming a teacher. This 224-minute second 
series was shown on both PBS and the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy Smith's Ultimate Stomach and Thighs Workout" is a 90-minute exercise 
tape out on Media for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
There's more new music video than you can shake a microphone stand at, 
including: "Bon Jovi: New Jersey -- the Videos" (PMV, $19.95, 60 minutes), 
"Depeche Mode 101" (Warner Reprise, $19.98, 117 minutes), "Bobby Brown: His 
Prerogative" (MCA, $19.95, 60 minutes), Laurie Anderson's "Home of the Brave" 
(Warner Reprise, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Reba McEntire: Reba" (MCA, $14.95, 30 
minutes), "Kenny G Live in Concert" (6 West, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Ice-T: 
Ice-Berg" (Warner Reprise, $16.98, 90 minutes), "Jody Watley: Video Classics, 
Vol. 1" (MCA, $16.95, 45 minutes), "Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe" (6 West, 
$14.98, 30 minutes) and "New Edition: Past and Present" (MCA, $19.95, 59 
minutes).TERRY ATKINSON
