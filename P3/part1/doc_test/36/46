A candidate running for Congress in Riverside County on Monday asked KCBS 
Channel 2 to give him equal time after the station aired a film early Sunday 
starring Ralph Waite, who also is seeking the seat. Another candidate said he 
planned to make the same request. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Pearson, who is running against Waite for the Democratic nomination in 
the 37th Congressional District, contacted the CBS-owned station after it 
broadcast "The Secret Life of John Chapman" from 4 to 6 a.m. Sunday. The 1976 
made-for-television movie starred Waite as a college president who took a 
sabbatical to become a ditch-digger and short-order cook. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received a call from (Pearson) and are evaluating the request," KCBS 
spokeswoman Lisa DeLucia said. "We schedule so far in advance (that) we were 
not aware that (Waite) was running for office." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, best known for his role as the patriarch in "The Waltons," which ran on 
CBS from 1972-1981, announced his candidacy March 7. DeLucia said that the 
station prepares its schedule a month to six weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Jacobs, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, said that he 
plans to ask for equal time too. Under federal regulations, TV stations must 
provide equal time to opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has 
qualified for the ballot appears on a broadcast outside of bona fide newscasts, 
interview programs, documentaries or spot coverage of news events. 
</P>
<P>
Waite could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Similar cases in the past have resulted in competing candidates being given an 
amount of air time equal to the time that the actor/candidate actually appeared 
on screen, not for the entire broadcast in which he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent actor to be affected by the equal time law was former 
President Ronald Reagan, whose movies were kept off the air during his 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strictest interpretation of the law came when George Takei sought a 
Los Angeles City Council seat in 1973. KNBC Channel 4 refrained from showing 
animated versions of "Star Trek," which included him supplying the voice of Mr. 
Sulu. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Democratic primary in the 37th Congressional District is 
expected to face four-term incumbent Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta) in 
November's general election. McCandless is expected to easily win renomination 
in the June 5 primary.
