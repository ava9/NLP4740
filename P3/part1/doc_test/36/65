"The Lemon Sisters" (selected theaters) are three white ladies from Atlantic 
City who want to be the Supremes. Best buddies Eloise, Franki and Nola have 
gone from 1959 to 1982 in a time warp; at 31, they're still doing '60s hits in 
small-time bars. As played by Diane Keaton, Carol Kane and Kathryn Grody, this 
unrelated threesome might not be offended if you called them "girls"; that's 
what they want to be: a girl group. And their movie, a bit like "The Fabulous 
Baker Boys," wants to be a ballad for show-biz wannabes. 
</P>
<P>
In a rotten but cute world, you can always rely on your cute pals to get you 
through rotten times. They'll be there with the party, the ambulance, the 
shopping bag full of money. So says "The Lemon Sisters," and its one of those 
pearls of movie wisdom where the shiny thin shell barely covers the grain of 
sand inside. The people that made this movie -- writers Jeremy Pikser and Mo 
Gaffney and director Joyce Chopra, working from Keaton's idea -- never seem 
tight with their material. They don't empathize with these "little people." 
Secretly, they condescend, make them into butts and foils. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lemon Sisters" is set in Atlantic City, but it's a kiddie-land resort as 
far removed from the boardwalk of blighted dreams and losers that we saw in 
Louis Malle's 1980 "Atlantic City" as "Roseanne" is from "Raging Bull." That's 
not necessarily bad. "The Lemon Sisters" isn't trying for anything profound or 
poetic. But the title is a giveaway. The sisters are called "Lemons" because 
they're supposed to be awful -- and they wear their awfulness with pride. One 
is a fruitcake; the other a couch potato; the third makes taffy. 
</P>
<P>
Only the occasional monochrome flashbacks to the past -- the three little girls 
huddling under piers or playing oceanside -- have any amplitude or warmth. In 
the present, Chopra and the writers keep putting their foot on the nutty-cutie 
pedal and jamming it to the floor. The candy-colored boardwalk world, shimmery 
pink and yellow, has an oddball on every corner, hawking local color. 
Bag-ladies, hustlers, goombahs, hoods and flakes: They're all here, jostling 
like rush-hour riders on the Goofball Limited. It says something about the 
movie's attitude that the only time a "Lemon" succeeds is when she makes such a 
tangle-footed wreck of a lounge date that she's hired as a comedian. Keaton's 
character, Eloise, lives in a TV museum, full of such cherished boob-tube 
artifacts as Ralph Kramden's jacket, Davy Crockett's coonskin cap and an 
Enterprise chair from "Star Trek" -- and the movie is a TV show too, a silly 
one. In one sequence Elliott Gould, as a lovable bozo of a saltwater taffy 
concessionaire married to Grody's Nola, opens a new store with a huge, 
dumb-looking mechanical bunny outside and immediately -- that very second! -- 
he has his business destroyed when a nearby casino starts handing out free 
taffy. As Gould stares out toward the ocean with spaniel eyes, his mechanical 
rabbit keeps whomping away before his empty store, his blasted dreams. It's the 
movie's specialty: big-bunny irony. 
</P>
<P>
The lead actresses -- Keaton, Kane and Grody -- are friends in real life, and 
they obviously saw "Lemon Sisters" as a vehicle for that friendship. They're 
all good; in fact the movie's ensemble, which also includes Gould, Aidan Quinn, 
Ruben Blades and Estelle Parsons, is amazing. But "Lemon Sisters" doesn't 
create a world: It packages a cast. 
</P>
<P>
Keaton's role is a showcase for her virtuoso whining, pouting, stomping and 
neurasthenic tics; Carol Kane sails off once again into frizzy-haired 
ditz-land, and Kathryn Grody seems to be the sensible frumpy type mediating 
between her out-there buddies. That isn't a put-down. Kane is an under-used 
comic genius, and this is the kind of movie a frizzy-haired ditz can walk away 
with. That's exactly what she does: in a tie with slick-haired mensch Ruben 
Blades. 
</P>
<P>
There's a built-in self-mockery that cuts apart this whole film. It pretends to 
be on the side of losers and dreamers, then keeps snickering at them. Midway 
through, Eloise, Franki and Nola start singing "Stop! In the Name of Love," and 
Kane starts shaking and Keaton flashes her drop-you-dead grin and suddenly this 
cheek-pinching movie opens up. There's something almost insanely pleasurable 
about that performance. But, abruptly, "The Lemon Sisters" cuts it short. It's 
not about pleasure in performance; it's not even really about friendship. It's 
just a taffy-pull of self-congratulatory nostalgia, full of big-bunny irony.
