new phenomenon, the laser disc / Video

HAVE YOU the stomach for another technological revolution? These are trying
times, I know. One audio-visual breakthrough treads on another's heels like
shoppers at a January sale. Who could have foreseen that by 1993 the
videocassette, once the wonder of the home-viewing age, would seem as old
and demode as Aunt Edith's aspidistra?
The new phenomenon is the laser disc. If you have not yet experienced these,
you should know what you are missing. Their main advantages over cassettes
are better picture quality, greater fidelity to original formats
(Cinemascope, Panavision and Co) and larger possibilities to scan, search
and study. Of the two types of disc on sale, CLV offers a basic range of
improvements, including the division of movies into 'chapters' to aid scene
or picture search. The more densely programmed CAV discs, though shorter in
duration, allow the viewer to activate additional aids like subtitling and
commentary.
The prices of movies on disc are chilling but not prohibitive. Moderate
treats like The Addams Family (Columbia TriStar) or Air America (Pioneer)
will set you back Pounds 25 pounds, while all-singing all-dancing
blockbusters - Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (Columbia TriStar),
Lawrence Of Arabia (Columbia TriStar) and Terminator 2 (Pioneer) - come in
at Pounds 35 pounds. The only Pounds 40 one is Kevin Costner's Dances With
Wolves. But then if you are mad enough to like that calendar-art sermon on
racial accord, you are probably mad enough to pay the price.
I have not yet plunged into purchasing a disc-player. When not sallying
forth to richer friends' homes, I do my viewing on the steam-powered VCR.
Here one has a wider range of movies to choose from, including samples of
that startling trend - thank you for the cue, Mr Costner - whereby actors
are turning into directors. This month alone brings three films never before
exposed on British screens: Diane Keaton's Wildflower (High Fliers), Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Christmas In Connecticut (First Independent) and Lou
Diamond Phillips's Ambition (Columbia TriStar).
Phillips wrote, directed and stars in his film, as a would-be crime writer
who employs a paroled murderer as research material. Minor but well-crafted.
Schwarzenegger's offering originated as a TV special. Packed with slightly
shopworn stars - Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, Tony Curtis - it is
festive-spirited enough to be viewed in the undemanding aftermath of
Christmas.
Of the three thespians turning directors, Keaton most looks as if she is
going places. Having directed a kooky vox-pop documentary called Heaven,
screened at Cannes some years ago, she grooms her talent further in
Wildflower. Like Arnie's film, this was made for TV. But Keaton, also an
acclaimed photographer, takes a threateningly mawkish tale about an
epileptic girl (Rosanna Arquette) rescued from a brutal stepfather by two
brothers and brings it alive with lighting and camera movement. Coming from
a front-of-camera career, she also knows how to wake up actors. Arquette is
superb, so is Beau Bridges as the boys' father.
What else have we for you? Not a lot, I fear. The video industry assumes a
state of paralysis in the wake of Yuletide and the New Year, so you must
make do with such fare as Star Trek VI (CIC), Christopher Columbus: The
Discovery (Braveworld) and Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot (CIC). You might,
though, try two well-penned films about showbiz. The Player (Fox), scripted
by Michael Tolkin and directed by Robert Altman, is an exuberantly
scurrilous portrait of Hollywood life. And Peter Bogdanovich's film of
Michael Frayn's Noises Off, hated by those who had seen the play, was
guffawed over by everyone who had not, including me. Happy new year.
