FT  25 JUN 94 / Fashion: To hell with dressing your age

Do you not find propriety awfully middle-aged? How often do you hear the
'woman of a certain age' asking: 'Is this all right. I don't look like
mutton dressed as lamb, do I?'
Indisputably, there is a middle period in one's life when to look too trendy
or too drop-dead sexy invites derision - the singer Cher immediately comes
to mind.
But there is an absolutely certain age, by which I mean 70-plus, when a
woman can wear any for-the-hell-of-it garments she likes and get away with
it. It is the privilege of age, like being able to say exactly what you
think or be a 'character' and, as long as she carries it off with conviction
and aplomb, we all applaud madly.
I was reminded of this liberation a few months ago when I attended a party
thrown by publisher Naim Attallah to celebrate the publication of Pamela
Cooper's autobiography A Cloud of Forgetting. Pamela Cooper is 83 and as
sassy and irreverent as you will find.
Like Miriam Rothschild's mad head scarves, Diana Cooper's whoopsy-droopsy
garden hats, or Violet Bonham-Carter's Fortuny Delphos dresses, her personal
style has nothing to do with conformity.
On this occasion, most of us standing in the drawing-room of her son, Lord
Gowrie, were decorously upholstered in velvet, as stiffly posed as if still
wearing coat hangers.
Pamela Cooper was dressed in a pomegranate-coloured, viscose-knit tunic top
and bell-bottom trousers, bought, her grandchild explained to me, that
morning from a hip teenage chainstore for 'really nothing]'
It looked madly nouveau-Biba, teamed with Jesus sandals and a modernistic
1960s necklace which looked like a fitting from Star Trek's Starship
Enterprise.
This octogenarian was by far the most flamboyant figure in the room.
Even her demeanour spoke of the Roaring Twenties or Swinging London, for she
adopted that inimitable 'backbones are out' pose.
In her hey-day, in the 1920s, world weariness was madly fashionable and
wonderful for shocking dowagers.
These days Pamela Cooper has moved on. While the pose and the attire may
speak of ennui, the mind is as keen and amused as any girl recently up in
town from the shires. She is lapping up the world.
There is nothing weary about her approach to life. And that is why, wearing
that gear, behaving in that manner, she makes those of us in between long to
be either 20 or 70.
It is the middle ground, in Major's middle England, populated with the
endlessly middle-aged, in middle class propriety that makes me feel
dispirited.
Show me a trucker or a toff in wildly unsuitable clothing and I will show
you a good party.
