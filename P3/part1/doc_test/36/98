Brent Spiner deserves praise for his portrayal of Lt. Data on "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation." I'm sure it's not easy bringing an android character "to 
life," but Spiner does it with skill and sensitivity, making Data one of the 
more enjoyable characters on the show. I hope his work is recognized when the 
nominations go out for Emmys.
