SMALL SCREEN: Huntington Beach businessman Mel Mermelstein, above, who 
successfully sued a Torrance-based group that claimed the Holocaust did not 
occur, is coming to the TV screen. A docudrama, "Never Forget," starring Star 
Trek's Leonard Nimoy, is being shot locally and is due on the TNT cable network 
in January. . . . Mermelstein, an Auschwitz survivor who is often consulted on 
the set, says it was "kind of strange" watching himself portrayed. Even 
stranger: He's playing his own father. Mark I. Pinsky and Sonni Efron
