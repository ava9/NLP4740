Annette Funicello joins the cast of Make Room for Daddy (next Sunday at 1 a.m. 
on Nickelodeon) as Gina, an exchange student from Italy. That was in 1959, 
before her Beach Party days.

For once, Mason and Hamilton Burger are on the same side on Perry Mason 
(Tuesday at 7 p.m. on KDOC). The defendant in "The Case of the Prudent 
Prosecutor" is the D.A.'s friend, so he disqualifies himself and asks Mason to 
defend him.

The harmless ending of The Dick Van Dyke Show was controversial back in 1963, 
when it first aired. In "That's My Boy??" (Tuesday at 1 p.m. on KDOC) Rob is 
convinced that the baby he and Laura have brought home from the hospital isn't 
theirs. The kicker that explains why Rob needn't have worried almost didn't 
make it on the air.

Ex-Angel Farrah Fawcett returns to Charlie's Angels (Wednesday at 2 p.m. on 
KTLA) as Jill Munroe long enough to help rescue her on-screen sister Kris 
(Cheryl Ladd) from kidnapers.

Later in the week, a pre-Angel Ladd is in safer hands with Richie Cunningham, 
who wins a date with her on Happy Days (Saturday at noon on KTLA). Arnold 
becomes a theatrical star in Hooterville and heads West to become a Hollywood 
ham, in a two-part Green Acres (Monday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon).

The second Star Trek pilot, "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (Wednesday at 
midnight on KCOP), was the one that sold the series to NBC.

<P>
Those pesky little creatures, "The Invaders," go after Agnes Moorehead in The 
Twilight Zone (Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. on KTLA). 
</P>

lineup, beginning Saturday. It will air Monday through Friday at 11 p.m. and 
Saturday and Sunday at 11:30 p.m.

Simka (Carol Kane) makes her debut on Taxi (Thursday at 11:30 p.m. on KTLA) and
