It is my impression that movies, TV and stage shows were to be entertainment, 
which the dictionary defines as diverting and amusing. What puzzles me is when 
I hear producers say a program wasn't realistic enough. 
</P>
<P>
Since when is realism diverting and amusing? Could it be that these people 
aren't realistic enough to know the difference? 
</P>
<P>
My interpretation of entertainment is "The Wizard of Oz," "Superman," "Back to 
the Future," "Batman," "Star Trek," Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood, Tarzan, Disney 
classics and so on. All quite unrealistic, but everlasting! 
</P>
<P>
I think the most realistic thing to do is keep bedrooms for sleeping, violence 
for the news broadcasts and return to real entertainment that is both diverting 
and amusing.
