Starship Enterprise, the spaceship that boldly went where no one had gone
before in the television series Star Trek, was yesterday laid up on planet
Earth after a decision by its owner to end its weekly forays into the
cosmos.
Paramount Communications, the US entertainment group that made the first
Star Trek series and its sequel, Star Trek: The Next Generation, has
cancelled the television series because it believes it can make more money
out of the concept by reserving it for blockbuster movies.
Star Trek has been one of the most successful programmes in television
history. The first series - a low-budget affair with wobbly scenery and
unconvincing special effects - ran for only 79 episodes between 1966 and
1969, but it built up a cult following that spread its popularity around the
world and gave rise to almost incessant re-runs.
In 1987 Paramount launched Star Trek: The Next Generation, a new series
based on the original concept but featuring high-technology special effects
and a new cast.
Some Star Trek fans were disappointed by the politically correct tenor of
the new series. While the crew of the original Starship Enterprise tried
hard to be open-minded about civilisations differing from their own, they
could usually be relied on to fail, blasting non-conforming species into
annihilation.
In contrast, the crew of the Next Generation's Enterprise seemed all too
understanding.
Even so, the Next Generation succeeded in becoming one of the most-watched
programmes on US television, drawing a regular audience of about 30m.
It was also one of Paramount's biggest money makers.
The last episode, a two-hour special entitled 'All Good Things  ..' brought
the 178-episode series to an end on Monday night
