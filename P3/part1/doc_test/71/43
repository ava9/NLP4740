  [Excerpts] The fortified and strategic fort of Bala Hesar 
was completely conquered yesterday afternoon by the mojahedin 
and forces of the Islamic army. Sources of the country's armed 
forces reported to the Bakhtar Information Agency that Bala 
Hesar fort was (?captured) as a result of [words indistinct] of 
the mojahedin and the Islamic army forces. [Passage indistinct] 
The forces of the mojahedin and the Islamic army aborted the 
offensive of the militia in the first hours and started an 
attack against their fortifications and positions. With the 
help of God much success was achieved by the mojahedin. The 
mojahedin were able by the conquest of Chman-e Hozori, Kasa Burj 
hill, and security posts around Bala Hesar and finally of the 
Bala Hesar fort, yesterday afternoon, the Golboddin-Dostam 
militia suffered a heavy defeat [sentence as heard]. 
  Bala Hesar fort was the Golboddin-Dostam militia's very 
strong position. From the heights of this fort, militia fired 
several times into the residential areas of Kabul, foreign 
embassies, and installations of public utility. As a result of 
the complete conquest of the Bala Hesar fort, militia have 
suffered heavy losses. Corpses of the Dostam-Golboddin militia 
litter the fort's surroundings. The forces of mojahedin and the 
Islamic army were able to inflict losses on the militia as a 
result of heavy weapons fire. In the course of the attack much 
damage was inflicted on the militia. The precise number will be 
announced later. According to a report by Bakhtar Information 
Agency correspondents, mojahedin of the Harakat-e Eslami 
organisation have captured large areas, including Darolaman 
Palace, Doghabad, Pilawari, and a section of Khairabad hills, in 
the west of Kabul, from the Golboddin militia. And in the 
direction of Bala Hesar's southwest, the Islamic army forces 
captured the strategic hill of Kasa Burj and many fortified 
positions of the Golboddin-Dostam militia in Maiwand Wat and in 
Shor Bazar. The received reports say that in the course of 
those heavy battles dozens of the militia were either killed or 
captured. The captured people include two prominent militia 
generals who joined the mojahedin. [passage omitted] 
  The air force of the Islamic state crushed the militia's 
positions and destroyed much of their heavy weapons. [Words 
indistinct] as a result 11 residents of Kabul City were martyred 
and (?178) others were injured. Rockets damaged the Turkish 
Embassy and the former telecommunications building. [passage 
omitted]
