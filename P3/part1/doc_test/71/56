<F P=106> [New Year address by President Borhanoddin Rabbani; place </F>
and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] With full confidence and 
earnest belief we say that the people of Afghanistan, by the 
blessing of Almighty God, will overcome the difficulties and 
will succeed in defeating conspiracies and intrigues; and peace 
and security will be restored in every corner of the country as 
wished and desired by the people. With firmness and 
steadfastness we will repair the destruction left by the 
fighting and will realize the (?plan) for the country's economic 
revival and reconstruction. It should be mentioned that the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan is at a satisfactory level of 
having strength and power and is able [word indistinct] to stop 
[the enemy advances]. The Armed Forces of the Islamic state are 
enjoying high combative morale and powerful military 
preparedness. The past months' experience clearly demonstrates 
this fact: [words indistinct] of Kabul, clearing Konduz 
Province, districts of Anderab, Khenjan, and Doshi in Baghlan 
Province, as well as Ghowrmach District and some regions in 
Farab Province, of seditious elements and rebels, are vivid 
examples in this respect. Despite all the abilities and 
preparedness, the Islamic state follows the strategy of talks 
and understanding and rejects a military solution to the issues. 
  At this time, when the world has entered into a new stage of 
coexistence and understanding, a way must be sought for the 
fundamental solution of issues by talks in a peaceful manner. 
On the basis of these beliefs and thoughts the Islamic state 
emphasizes the principle of talks and understanding with the 
(?respective) Jehadi forces. Believing in the notion that 
people are the real heir [words indistinct] the people have a 
right to decide about their country and future leadership. 
During the period of the Islamic sovereignty the state has 
always paid respect to this principle and has always followed it 
in its actions. 
  Dear Compatriots, in order to get out of the present 
condition and for the sake of saving people from pain and 
sorrow, preventing further destruction of their homes by deadly 
rockets, and in respecting and following the principle of [words 
indistinct], the state pays respect to the will of people 
concerning the country's future leadership. We believe that a 
[word indistinct] decisionmaking assembly of the people 
delegates representing the will and views of the people and 
elected by a method that is acceptable to the relevant sides, is 
to be set up in the country as soon as possible. [passage 
indistinct] 
  Starting from the first day of 'Id al-Fitr the state has 
declared a unilateral 15-day-long cease-fire in Kabul city so 
that the peace delegations can work and accelerate their efforts 
on this path in a secure atmosphere away from threat. We have 
also invited the United Nations and the conference of the 
Islamic countries' foreign ministers to supervise the 
proceedings of convocation and activities of this assembly to 
make sure of its freedom of action. With pleasure I was 
informed that a UN delegation, led by esteemed Mahmud Mestiri, 
will soon travel to Afghanistan. [words indistinct] the state 
is ready for every cooperation with the UN delegation in this 
respect. 
  Dear compatriots, for marking Nawroz [New Year Day] in a 
proper way, and in order to provide better conditions for the 
peace delegations enabling them to accelerate further their 
fruitful work [words indistinct], I declare the extension of the 
unilateral cease-fire in Kabul city for another two weeks.
