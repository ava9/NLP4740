  [Text] Fifty Dostum militia surrendered to forces of the 
Islamic army in Fariab Province. Reports received by BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY from Fariab Province say the men, headed by 
Habibollah, realizing the inhuman and un-Islamic character of 
Dostum's militia, joined the forces of Jehadi Division 24 of the 
province in Qoshqar area in Fariab Province along with five 
rocket launchers, eight PK machine guns, and two ZK1 machine 
guns. The report adds that the surrendered people expressed 
their hatred of the crimes and atrocities of Dostumites and 
promised that, with all their will, they are ready to fight 
against Dostum's militia.
