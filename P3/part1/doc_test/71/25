  [Text] The first supply convoy arrived to Kabul today from 
Shir Khan Bandar. 
  A source in the 20th Jehadi Division of Baghlan Province 
reported to Bakhtar Information Agency that Shir Khan 
Bandar-Kabul supply route has been repaired and was opened to 
traffic through (Kotel-e Murgh). Esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud; and 
Esteemed Abdul Hay Haqjo, commander of the 20th Jehadi Division 
of Baghlan Province, accompanied by the high ranking 
representatives of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, watched the 
process of arrival of the supply convoy and transport vehicles 
which arrived from Shir Khan Bandar to Kabul and travelled from 
Kabul to Shir Khan Bandar via (Kotel-e Murgh). 
  Sayed Abdul Motaleb, official in charge of the repair and 
construction of this road said that the repair and construction 
of this road began two months ago with the cooperation of the 
government officials and the Muslim people of Andarab and 
(Neharin) districts and was completed recently. It is now 
opened to traffic with this first supply convoy to pass through. 
  A correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency adds that the 
oppositions of the Islamic State of Afghanistan who are the 
enemies of our land and Muslim people, were using the economic 
blockade of Kabul city as a strong propaganda tool. The opening 
of the road between Kabul and Shir Khan Bandar, which connects 
Afghanistan with Tajikistan, in Central Asia, is a considerable 
victory for the Islamic State of Afghanistan in removing the 
economic blockade imposed by the oppositions of our country 
against our Muslim nation and is another obvious defeat for the 
opposition. 
  Once more supply convoys arrive to Kabul the price of food 
will come down and the economic problems of our country will 
become relatively less.
