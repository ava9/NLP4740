  [Text] A meeting of the cabinet was chaired today by 
Esteemed Deputy Prime Minister Mawlawi Mohammad Arsalan Rahmani. 
At the meeting, the current situations in the country were 
discussed. 
  The press department of the Prime Ministry told the Bakhtar 
Information Agency that [word indistinct] Planning Minister 
Hojjat-ol-Eslam Seyyed Mohamad 'Ali Javid read out a draft plan 
that has been prepared by an appointed commission concerning the 
solution of the problems of war, the maintenance of a lasting 
peace, and the formation of a new political order. The meeting 
approved the draft for a final solution, and it was decided 
that--in understanding with other Muslim and rightful 
parties--this draft was to be even more enriched and complete. 
  The following is a brief outline of this plan: [passage 
indistinct] The cabinet, as the highest executive body of the 
country, gives the right to itself to be in front on the path of 
strengthening peace in Afghanistan and to coordinate all Islamic 
plans and efforts that are in process in this regard. [passage 
indistinct] as follows: 
  1. The solution of internecine problems and armed clashes 
between the jihadi formations of Afghanistan and the opposition 
side [as heard] through talks and negotiations in consideration 
of the observation of the Jalalabad agreements. 
  2. The formation of a constituent council numbering 60 to 
100 members--including Afghan scholars, jihadi formations, 
political, social, and Muslim personalities--to prepare for a 
great national council, the Loya Jerga. This council [passage 
indistinct] so that personalities understanding our religious 
and national values-- as far as possible--can come together 
representing various strata and circles in the country to 
determine the political destiny of this country, which has been 
soaked in their blood. 
  4. [number as received]. It is necessary that the 
representatives of Afghanistan's administrative units be 
appointed in proportion to their population. 
  5. In order to obtain [word indistinct], it is necessary 
that the representatives of the United Nations and of the ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] observe the work and the 
formation of the Council. 
  6. In order to avoid an administrative vacuum, it deems 
necessary that the Islamic State of Afghanistan continue its 
work until the end of its term in keeping with the decisions of 
Shura-e Ahl-e Hal wa Aqd [Solution and Settlement Council] and 
that of the Jalalabad agreements. 
  7. It is necessary to choose a number of [words 
indistinct] from members of the Islamic Loya Jerga as members of 
the country's parliament [words indistinct]. 
  8. The aforementioned Jerga is to appoint the country's 
future leadership and parliament. 
  9. This plan is to be implemented within the next five 
months. 
  10. This Loya Jerga is similar to the council that has 
been recorded in the Feqh books [Islamic law] as Shura-e Hal wa 
Aqd. The cabinet and the relevant commission ask all scholars 
and [words indistinct] of the country to even further enrich 
this draft through their written and verbal views and proposals. 
  At the end of the meeting, Javid and the cabinet members 
took 
part in a news conference and explained various parts of the 
draft to home and foreign journalists.
