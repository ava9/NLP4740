  [Text] Woreshmin, a commander attached to Golboddin, 
together with his 24 men were killed in the vicinity of Bala 
Hesar during the recent operation carried out by 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam militia. The BIA military correspondent 
reports that during a counterattack, the military forces of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan forced the Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam 
militia to retreat and imposed heavy losses on the aggressors. 
The report adds that Woreshmin was a general attached to Toran 
Amanollah. He had intended to appoint Woreshmin as chief of 
staff of his forces.
