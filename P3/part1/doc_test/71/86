  [Text] Two commanders of Karmal-Dostam's infamous militia 
were killed recently in Faryab Province. Sources of the Armed 
Forces told BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY's military correspondent: 
As a result of the successful operations by the mojahedin and 
the forces of the Islamic Army, dozens of militia including two 
of their commanders -- Nasim Chapaw and Zar Alam -- were killed, 
and many areas have been cleared of Dostam's militia. According 
to another report, Gol Mohammad, known as Gol Pahlawan, brother 
of Rasul Pahlawan [Dostam's commander in Meymaneh, capital of 
Faryab], has been seriously wounded in a confrontation with 
mojahedin in Faryab Province.
