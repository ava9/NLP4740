  Esteemed brother Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin 'Ali Akbar

peace and the blessings of God upon you. On behalf of the state 
and Muslim people of the ISA and myself I convey the most 
cordial congratulations on the occasion of the 15th anniversary 
of the victory of the Islamic revolution of Iran to you dear 
brother, and to the state and Muslim people of Iran. I am fully 
confident that existing fraternal and friendly relations between 
the governments and the people of the two neighbouring and 
Muslim countries, which are based on Islamic fraternity and 
common culture, will further expand and consolidate in the 
interest of our people and peace and security in the region and 
the world. Taking this opportunity once again I wish from God 
your excellency's health and success, along with the tranquility 
and prosperity of the fraternal people of Iran. Success comes 
from God. [signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of
