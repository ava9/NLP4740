  [Text] Turkey has turned down a political asylum 
application from General Dostam, head of the militia. This 
point has been disclosed in a report of the MUJAHED newspaper, 
Jami'at-e Eslami's [Islamic Society of Afghanistan's] 
publication organ, in its recent issue. The report says that 
after consecutive defeats in Kabul and in northern areas of 
Afghanistan, General Dostam asked for political asylum in 
Turkey, which turned it down. The report adds that he has 
bought a house in Germany in preparation for an escape. A 
Bakhtar Information Agency political commentator in this respect 
writes: General Dostam attempted a coup d'etat on 11th Jadi [1 
January] at the instigation of foreign countries and in 
cooperation with Golboddin Hekmatyar. He now seeks ways of 
escaping. The report says Dostam and Golboddin believed at the 
outset they would do away with the islamic state in two hours. 
But four months later the putschists increasingly receive 
crushing blows.
