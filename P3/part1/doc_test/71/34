  [Excerpts] An offensive by Golboddin-Dostam's militia was 
aborted this morning by Islamic Army forces. A source from the 
General Command of Kabul Garrison told a BIA military 
correspondent that the infamous militia of Golboddin-Dostam 
launched a failed offensive at about 0500 this morning from an 
easterly direction. It was aborted in the first few hours as a 
result of the resistance and defense of mojahedin and the 
Islamic Army forces. The rebellious militia suffered 40 
casualties and dozens of injuries and a number of their light 
and heavy weapons were destroyed. According to another report, 
following their defeat, the failed militia subjected residential 
areas and public utility to blind rocket attacks. As a result 
of those savage attacks five compatriots were injured. 
Similarly, as a result of a rocket landing in the contagious 
diseases hospital two of our compatriots were slightly injured 
and the hospital building was damaged. [passage omitted]
