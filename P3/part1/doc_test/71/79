<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghanistan Is Opposed to Aggression </F>
and Condemns the Mercenaries"] 
  [Text] As already reported, in December 1993 Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of Armenia, sent 
letters to Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan, and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
in which he expressed concern at the involvement of Afghan 
mujahidin in the Karabakh conflict in units of the Azerbaijani 
Army. 
  We were able to acquaint the reader with fragments of the 
return message of the president of Afghanistan. Today we have an 
opportunity to publish a more detailed text obtained from the 
staff of the president of the Republic of Armenia: 
  "Your Excellency, I have received and studied your message 
concerning the involvement of certain irresponsible Afghan 
persons participating in the war in Nagornyy Karabakh. The 
Afghan side recognizes the feelings of the Armenian leadership. 
I want with great regret to inform you and, through you, the 
people of Armenia that some groups of adventurers undermining 
social and political stability in Afghanistan are, truly, for 
financial backing for their aims accepting Afghan underlings of 
the former Soviet Azerbaijan in order to cause a deterioration 
in relations between Armenia and Afghanistan. 
  "Your Excellency! The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the 
freedom-loving people of Afghanistan, recognizing the UN 
Charter, express their protest against aggression, from wherever 
it emanate. 
  "We view the roots of the contradiction between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan as the consequences of a conspiracy of the former 
Soviet leaders. The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the people 
of Afghanistan advocate peaceful coexistence and are following a 
strategy of peace and Afghanistan's friendly relations with the 
two countries: Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the light of this we 
do not approve of the participation of Afghan citizens in the 
armed operations in Karabakh. We support a peaceful resolution 
of the conflict between the recently formed countries. 
  "Your Excellency! The participation of certain mercenaries 
going by the name of mujahidin cannot cause a deterioration in 
the friendly relations between Afghanistan and Armenia. The 
Afghan side will endeavor in every possible way to prevent this 
inhuman business, which is being conducted by extremists using 
their income from this to increase instability in Afghanistan. 
Afghanistan will try to put an end to this business as soon as 
possible. 
  "Your Excellency! Availing myself of the opportunity, I wish 
you and the people of Armenia success, good health, and 
happiness."
