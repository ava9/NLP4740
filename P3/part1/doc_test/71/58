  [Text] Eighty-three rockets and mortar shells were fired 
into residential areas of Kabul today by Dostam-Golboddin 
militia. A responsible source of the General Command of Kabul 
Garrison told a military correspondent of BAKHTAR INFORMATION 
AGENCY that today's rockets, which were fired from 
Golboddin-Dostam controlled areas into the city of Kabul, landed 
in wards 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, and 11. As a result, one of our 
innocent compatriots was martyred and nine others were injured. 
One house was destroyed.
