  [Text] Militias of Golboddin and Dostam killed a number of 
each others men in Kabul as a result of differences on dividing 
up looted goods. Reports received by Bakhtar Information Agency 
say the clashes have mainly occurred between the militias of 
Golboddin and Dostam for the looted goods of Kabul residents. 
As many as three Dostam's militia have been taken prisoner by 
Golboddin's militia, and the prisoners were later killed. 
According to another report, in the course of clashes between 
Haji Zarif's men--who are associated with Golboddin's 
militia--and Dostam's militia, 19 Dostam militiamen were killed 
and three Golboddin militiamen were badly injured. Another 
report says that some days ago a cousin of Zardad, a commander 
of Golboddin's militia, was captured by Dostam's militia, and in 
retaliation, Golboddin's militia killed Sofi Karim, a Dostam 
militia ringleader, in Karta-e Naw area. Reports say the motive 
of the clashes between the militias of Golboddin and Dostam have 
been the dividing up of looted goods and the sale of weapons; 
this has increased their previous differences.
