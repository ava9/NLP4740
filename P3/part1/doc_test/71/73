  [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia's attacks were aborted 
in Qala-e Ahmad Khan, and a large area was cleared up in Karta-e 
Naw [southeast of Kabul]. Reports received by the Bakhtar 
Information Agency [BIA] say that forces of the Islamic army 
were consolidating their positions in the course of the day, and 
they crushed two attacks by the Golboddin-Dostam militia in 
Qala-e Ahmad Khan. As a result a number of the militia were 
killed. 
  According to a report by BIA, calm has resumed in Kabul, and 
the refugees of the city are returning to their homes in the old 
Microrayon and Shah-Shahid. The report says that a large number 
of Kabul's refugees who had gone to Jalalabad six months ago are 
returning to their places. Over the past three days the Islamic 
army's conquests have removed militia's heavy weapons positions 
from the city. They can hardly cause trouble to the people, as 
a result. However, the conquests have put urgent tasks on the 
shoulders of the state. The reconstruction of the conquered 
areas, most of which have become ruins, the reactivation of the 
police security zones, and the construction of educational and 
health institution in those areas rest at the top of the list of 
programs. 
  The report adds that the danger has not completely been 
eliminated, but that the Golboddin-Dostam militia threaten 
residential areas through their stealthy attacks. According to 
reports, in a crowded area of the city 13 residents of Kabul 
were martyred as a result of three bombs dropped by a jet 
airplane. The raid took place at 0800 this morning. As a 
result, three shops were damaged. 
  According to an authentic source, strong words were 
exchanged 
two days ago between Golboddin and Dostam in a radio 
conversation, and militia's scandalous defeat in Kabul has been 
considered its real reason. 
  In the course of a face-to-face battle, six foreign citizens 
were killed and seven others have been captured. A BIA 
correspondent who had personally spoken to the prisoners 
reported to us that the prisoners were taken by mojahedin in the 
area of Kara-e Naw. Despite the fact that senior state 
authorities have spoken about the existence of foreign citizens, 
and the Islamic army reported their capture, this is the first 
time that reporters have been allowed to see the prisoners and 
to photograph them. The prisoners have given their names as 
follows: Naddem Shahzad, from Mianbagh in Punjab; Sayed Ahmad, 
from Punjab; Mohammad Aziz, from Sailkot in Punjab; Farhatnur, 
from Multan; Abed Saleem, from Karachi; Jawed Akhtar, from 
Peshawar; Bahram Khan, from Peshawar. Nadeem Shahzad says that 
he has lost six of his friends in the course of the battle whose 
bodies were left in the battlefield.
