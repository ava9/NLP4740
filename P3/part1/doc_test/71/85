  [Text] The militia's of Dostam-Golboddin have embarked on 
an all-round attack on Chardara District, Konduz Province, in 
order to compensate for their defeats in the capital and in the 
northern regions during the last few days. The attacks of the 
murderer militia's, accompanied by heavy air bombardment, on the 
residential areas of Konduz and Chardara District, caused loss 
of life and financial damage to people. The militia's also 
resorted to plundering the people's properties, too. 
  The Islamic Army and Mojahedin embarked on a successful 
military operation this morning at 0500 in order to foil the 
attacks by militia's of criminal Golboddin and infidel Dostam. 
As a result of these operations, the coordinated militia's of 
Golboddin-Dostam were cleared from the district of Chardara. In 
the course of these operations more than 100 militia were killed 
and more than 100 militia were arrested. Among militia that 
were killed are General Ahmad and General 'Abdol Samad. General 
Nabi, General Ahmad Ankhoyi, General Saleh, and General 'Abdol 
Wahed, four other members of the murdering militia's of 
Golboddin-Dostam were arrested by mojahedin. During these 
operations more than 300 types of light and heavy weapons were 
either destroyed or captured.
