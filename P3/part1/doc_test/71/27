  [Text] The strategic area of Yerganik is completely in the 
hand of the forces of the Islamic Army, and the mojahedin are 
defending it confidently. Quoting a responsible security 
source, a BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY correspondent reports: 
After their consecutive defeats in the northern provinces of the 
country, the militia recently mounted a failed assault on the 
Yerganik Pass. As a result of the bravery of the Islamic Army 
units and the mojahedin, the attack was repelled and heavy loss 
of life and damage was inflicted on the aggressors. The report 
adds: The militia began their attack at a time when Islamic Army 
units had confronted the enemy with humiliating defeats in 
various parts of Baghlan Province and conquered their positions 
one after another.
