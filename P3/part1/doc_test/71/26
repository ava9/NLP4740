  [Text] A four-day cease-fire between forces of the Islamic 
state forces and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] came into force 
beginning at 0500 on 15 February. 
  A high authority of the Islamic State of Afghanistan told 
BAKHTAR that, as demanded by peace councils, for the purpose of 
opening supply routes and in respect for the sacred month of 
Ramadan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan has agreed to 
implement a cease-fire with the forces of Hezb-e Eslami in Kabul 
alone. During this period, peace delegations will observe the 
opening of highways to Kabul and the free flow of transport 
along these highways. 
  The source said the jehad declared against the Dostam looter 
militia by the president of our country is continuing. Dostam 
is in no way a party to the current cease-fire. The Islamic 
state will observe a complete cease-fire during these four days, 
provided that the opposition side also observes it.
