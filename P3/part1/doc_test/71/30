  [Text] Three commanders of the infamous Golboddin-Dostam 
militia have recently joined the Islamic Army and Mojahedin 
along with their men. According to reports reaching the BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY, three militia commanders, Commander Sayed 
Taher, Commander Qader Shah, and Commander Hafif who were in the 
ranks of the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia in a battalion 
located around the electricity project in Tashqhorghan, have 
joined the unit of Commander Hamidullah [word indistinct] along 
with their weapons and men. They expressed regret over their 
past activities. The men from the Army post expressed their 
indignation against the militia and pledged to continue the 
jihad to the end until the complete elimination of the militia. 
  Our correspondent adds that since the failed coup d'etat of 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam on 1 January until now, dozens of 
militia commanders and men, having expressed regret over their 
activities, have ended their hostilities with the Islamic State, 
and continue their jihad and struggle against the militia 
alongside the ranks of the mojahedin.
