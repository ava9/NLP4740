  [Text] While the people of Kabul were busy celebrating the 
second anniversary of the Islamic revolution victory, the 
Golboddin-Dostam militia martyred 21 citizens by firing blind 
rockets. According the report of the Kabul garrison command, the 
Golboddin-Dostam militia fired last night and today 116 rockets 
and mortar mines at Kabul city. As a result, 21 citizens of 
Kabul were martyred and another 32 were injured. Those injured 
were quickly transferred to the nearest hospitals and medical 
clinics for treatment. Material losses were also inflicted on 
the people; 13 residential houses in various regions of the city 
were demolished. As a result of the landing of one rocket, 
several children were martyred while they were carrying drinking
