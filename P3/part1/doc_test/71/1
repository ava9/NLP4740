  [Excerpts] Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, 
president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has replied to a 
message sent by Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic 
of Armenia, in the following terms: 
  Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of 
Armenia: I have received Your Excellency's message in which you 
mentioned the participation of a number of irresponsible Afghans 
in the war between your country and the republic of Azerbaijan 
over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Afghan side 
understands the feelings and concerns of the leadership and the 
people of Armenia. 
  Your Excellency, president of the Republic of Armenia: The 
Islamic Government of Afghanistan has experienced the bitter 
taste of occupation and interference by the old Soviet Union. 
For two years this country has been dealing with the negative 
impact of foreign occupation and various interference. Afghans 
are peace-loving people and do not have any interest in 
interfering in other countries' affairs. The presence of a 
number of Afghans participating in the war between your country 
and Azerbiajan has no connection with the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan and the war-torn Afghan nation; and those who have 
taken part as mercenary soldiers do not have any jehadi 
background and have not been in the ranks of Afghanistan's 
mojahedin. 
  Mr. President, it is with regret that I have to inform you 
and through you the Armenian nation that a number of 
warmongering groups have, on the instructions of foreigners, 
acted to promote political and social instability in Afghanistan 
and have employed a number of Afghan workers for financial 
purposes to seek financial sources to support the militias 
associated with the old Soviet Union, and have dragged them to 
take part in the war between your country and Azerbaijan. 
[sentence as heard] [passage omitted] 
  Your Excellency, the presence of a number of mercenaries and 
dealers in the name of Afghanistan's mojahedin in the war that 
you have mentioned cannot spoil the relations between 
Afghanistan and Armenia. The Afghan side is striving to halt as 
soon as possible these inhuman dealings of a number of rebels, 
whose profits have been and will be used for activities against 
national security and political stability in Afghanistan. 
Taking this opportunity, I wish health, long life, and success 
to your excellency, and the welfare of Armenian people. 
  [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan
