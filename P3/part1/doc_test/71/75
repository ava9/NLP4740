Agency correspondent reports that after the militia's defeat in 
the northern provinces--during which Rasul Bekhoda, one of their 
oppressive leaders was seriously injured and 70 militiamen were 
killed in face-to-face fighting with the Islamic Army--men from 
the same group in Mazar-e Sharif left the country for the 
Central Asian republics with forged passports and after looting 
public properties.

infamous Parchamies [Communist Party faction led by Karmal] 
alongside Golboddin's men has created new concerns among

harder than ever for them. Therefore, 30 militiamen have escaped 
to Pakistan recently with their families from Kabul city.

  It has been said that Rasul Bekhoda is one of the 
high-ranking commanders of Dostam's group who had been a 
commander of [word indistinct] in Pol-e Charkhi. Then he was a
