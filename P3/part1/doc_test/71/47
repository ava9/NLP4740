  [Text] During the course of a clearing up operation, 
mojahedin and forces of the Islamic army in Samangan Province 
pushed back the Golboddin-Dostam militia as far as 8 km. 
  One of the country's responsible security sources told the 
Bakhtar Information Agency that forces of the Islamic army and 
mojahedin cleared a large area of Samangan Province from the 
dirt of the militia during the course of a clearing up operation 
on 27 June. As a result, 10 members of the Golboddin-Dostam 
militia were killed, and a large amount of their light and heavy 
weapons have been captured as booty by the mojahedin. The 
report adds that the militia has completely lost its combat 
morale, and militia members were obliged to flee upon leaving 
their positions.
