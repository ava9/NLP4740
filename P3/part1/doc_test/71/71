  [Excerpts] With the help of Almighty God, the strategic 
hill of Maranjan and the surrounding areas have been captured by 
the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The army's advance continues. 
Maranjan Hill was captured by the mojahedin 17 hours after the 
conquest of Bala Hesar base. 
  With regard to today's conquest, an official of the Ministry 
of Defense said: 
  [Begin unidentified Defense Ministry official recording, in 
Dari] [Words indistinct] operation started at about 0500 by the 
forces of the Islamic Army from several directions: from the 
direction of Bala Hesar and Maiwand Wat, and [word indistinct] 
and Pol-e Pacha Khan. [words indistinct] 
  The Islamic State of Afghanistan, so far as possible, 
exercised forbearance in order to find a peaceful solution to 
Afghanistan's problems. The enemy abused this forbearance by 
the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and they did not avoid any 
crime against the people throughout this period. Only recently 
they planned to organize an all-out offensive against Kabul. 
The offensive was to be mounted by forces of Hekmatyar's and 
Dostam's militia. It should have taken place at this time. 
Luckily, the Defense Ministry forces of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan foiled this offensive. 
  At the moment, the enemy's major bases--which were their 
heavy weapons bases from where they attacked the city with 
rockets--have been captured. A large section of Kabul City, 
which was abandoned by the residents, has now been liberated. 
We hope that the residents of the city of Kabul, who have been 
rendered refugees and even went to Pakistan, will be able to 
return to their homeland and to reside in their original homes. 
  The operation continued, as you know, until 1700. [words 
indistinct] As a result of the operation a large number of the 
enemy's tanks and heavy weapons have been captured. The number 
of prisoners, as of this moment, is more than 700. A large area 
was liberated, which includes the Ghazi Stadium, Kabul theater, 
Maranjan Hill, and the (?villages) of Qala-e Zaman Khan and 
Deh-e Khodaidad. [words indistinct] [end recording] 
  Tab-e Maranjan was captured [word indistinct] following the 
seizure of Bala Hesar. 
  During the course of an intensive air and land attack that 
was carried out by the forces of the Islamic State, the militia 
has lost the ability for confrontation. The militia's fire 
power was reduced notably in comparison to yesterday. 
  A high-ranking military official of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan estimated the number of prisoners taken during the 
last two days at between 600 to 700; among them are 11 foreign 
nationals. 
  [Words indistinct] received reports saying that the complete 
clearing up of Karta-e Naw and a serious advance toward 
Charasiab [Hekmatyar's headquarters] continues, and the 
Golboddin-Dostam militia forces are fleeing. Another report 
says that a large area behind Tajbeg Hill has been completely 
conquered. [passage omitted] 
  The Golboddin-Dostam militia suffered a heavy defeat in the 
west of Kabul and has escaped. [passage omitted] 
  Mama Habib Modathir [word indistinct] at his command base at 
Darolaman Palace said: The Golboddin-Dostam militia mounted an 
extensive offensive on our positions last night. The militia 
encountered the strong resistance of the Harakat-e Eslami 
mojahedin and were forced to retreat. As a result of the 
gallant resistance of the mojahedin, a large area was retrieved 
from the control of the militia. In this area are: Darolaman 
Palace, Mahmud Tarzi High School, the former building of the 
administration of the Ministry of Defense, the services section 
of Housing Department, Nur Hospital, the office of the deputy 
head of the Construction Department, [word indistinct], 
Sarasiab, Doghabad, Qala-e Muslim, Qala-e Qaderi, Qala-e Abas 
Qoli, and Asiab-e Khoshk. The advance of the jihadi forces and 
mojahedin toward Chilsoton and Rishkhor continues. 
  Modathir added: During the course of the operation, one set 
of BM-1 [not further identified], two tanks, hundreds of light 
weapons, three 83-mm artillery pieces, four medium-sized 
mortars, two rocket launchers, two PK machine guns, two ZK-1 
machine guns, five motor vehicles, and a large quantity of arms 
and ammunition have been captured from the enemy as booty. 
During the course of this successful operation, 40 members of 
the Golboddin-Dostam militia were taken prisoner by the forces 
of the mojahedin, nine of whom were foreign mercenaries. 
  Sardar Mohammad, Abofazl, Mr. Alawi, Sayd Husain Husaini, 
Commander Sofi Safar, Commander Mohammad Anwar (?Sakhra), 
Commander Aziz Ahmad, Commander Sayed Ali Shah, and other 
commanders and mojahedin participated in the operations. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be said with [word indistinct] that the number of 
losses was very small on the state's side, and observations show 
that the occurrence of minor incidents have been due to the 
carelessness of individuals. [passage omitted] 
  The destruction caused by the battles in Maiwand Wat [main 
street in Kabul] is more terrifying than any other part of 
Kabul. Among the ruins, only a few armed mojahedin could be seen 
loitering. [passage omitted]
