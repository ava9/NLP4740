  [Text] By firing 20 rockets, the infamous militia of 
Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin murdered and injured a number of our 
compatriots last night. A source of the General Command of 
Kabul Garrison told a military correspondent of BIA that 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam's militia made last night the targeted 
20 Saqar rockets at ward 11 of the city of Kabul. As a result 
of this savage act, six of our oppressed and innocent 
compatriots were martyred and 10 others were injured. The 
injured were quickly taken to hospitals and treated. In 
addition to the loss of life, much damage has been inflicted on 
the residents of Kabul. The rockets were fired from an eastern 
direction, which is controlled by Golboddin's men.
