  [Text] The press office of the presidency of Islamic state 
reported to Bakhtar Information Agency that esteemed Professor 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, has sent the following message to Sardar Faruq 
Ahmad Khan Laghari, president of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, on the incident of Pakistan's embassy in Kabul: 
  Your Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan Laghari, president 
of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, on behalf of myself and Muslim 
Afghan nation, I am pleased to convey best wishes to your 
excellency, and through you to the fraternal nation of Pakistan. 
Your excellency, I would like to express my deep regret and 
sorrow at the incident which occurred on 23 February in your 
country's embassy -- most probably at the instigation of 
self-seeking elements who seek to make fraternal and friendly 
relations between the two neighboring and Muslim countries 
tense. Your excellency, religious and cultural ties, and 
material and moral support of the nation and government of 
Pakistan on the uprising of the people of Afghanistan against 
foreign aggression and the granting of asylum to millions of 
Afghan refugees have so deepened and expanded our relations that 
the occurrence of incidents such as the aforementioned cannot 
damage our countries' religious and good neighborly relations. 
I take the opportunity to wish from the compassionate God your 
excellency's health, long life, success, and prosperity for the 
people of Pakistan. 
  [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan.
