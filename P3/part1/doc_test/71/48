  [Text] The infamous Golboddin-Dostum militia launched a 
futile attack on the Islamic army's positions last night from 
the southern direction but was repulsed by the Islamic army's 
counterattack after loosing three opposition forces positions 
and suffering heavy losses. 
  A responsible source of the Ministry of Defense said to the 
correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency that the savage 
militia last night at 0100 attempted to invade the Islamic 
army's positions from the southern direction but forced to 
retreat after suffering heavy losses; three of their positions 
were seized by the Islamic army. The source added that the 
infamous militia after this defeat carried out a rocket attack 
on residential regions of Kabul as a result of which a large 
number of our citizens were either martyred or injured. A 
number of residences were demolished. The attack took place 
with only one day remaining from the visit to Kabul of Mahmud 
Mastiri, special envoy of the UN secretary general. 
  The repeated attacks by the Golboddin-Dostum militia during 
the past two nights and the firing of rockets at the city's 
residential regions is taking place with the aim of showing 
Kabul as insecure. The infamous Golboddin-Dostum militia who 
have faced decisive military defeats both in Kabul and in the 
country's northern regions, are attempting now to create 
obstacles for a special (? presentation of proposals), the will 
of the nation, and peaceseeking international efforts for 
solving conflicts in the country.
