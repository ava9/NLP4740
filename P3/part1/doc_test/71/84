  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of 
Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various 
forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national 
sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For 
instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the 
beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and 
good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this 
issue to the attention of the related authorities of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic 
channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented. 
  But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and 
the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference 
not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests 
against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal 
affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy 
of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all 
internationally accepted current norms and principles, and 
demands from the authorities of that country to seriously 
refrain from the repetition and continuation of such 
interference which will have grave consequences for and negative 
impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries. 
Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such 
interference.
