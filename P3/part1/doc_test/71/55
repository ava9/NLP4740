  [Text] The infamous militia of Golboddin-Dostam last night 
mounted a failed offensive on the positions of the Islamic 
army's forces in the easterly direction. A security source told 
the BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY [BIA] military correspondent that 
the offensive of the militia was aborted in the very first hours 
of the attack, and damage was inflicted on rebellious militia, 
which suffered a great loss of life. Following their defeat 
last night, the militia subjected residential areas of city of 
Kabul to rocket attacks last night and this morning. It caused 
no loss of life, but some damage was inflicted on the residents 
of Kabul. According to another report, yesterday afternoon a 
heavy clash took place between the militias of Golboddin and 
Dostam in the area of Brishnakot in Kabul. The conflagration 
continued until 2200 last night, and much loss of life was 
suffered by the warring militias. The security source added 
differences between the commanders of Golboddin's party and 
commanders of Dostam were increasing. Since the start of the 
unholy alliance between Golboddin and Dostam, this was the 
umpteenth clash between these two militia groups.
