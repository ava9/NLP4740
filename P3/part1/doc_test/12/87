  [From Hardev Kaur] 
  [Text] Honolulu, Sat.-- Japan and China said the Asia 
Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers meeting should not 
be institutionalised, a sentiment which falls in line with the 
feeling of their counterpart from ASEAN. 
  They said there was no requirement whatsoever to 
institutionalise the meeting. Their feeling on this was 
conveyed to Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim during their bilateral discussions here 
yesterday. 
  Anwar had meetings with Chinese Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli, 
Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury 
secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Anwar also had an informal meeting 
with his Taiwanese counterpart Chen-kuo Lin. They are all here 
to attend the APEC Finance Ministers meeting which begins today. 
  ASEAN Finance Ministers had already met on Thursday where 
they reached consensus on the matter. 
  Thursday's meeting was hosted by Thai Finance Minister Aran 
Thammano. The common ASEAN position will be presented to the 
APEC Finance Ministers today. 
  The consensus is that the APEC Finance Ministers meeting 
should not be institutionalised and that they can meet and 
discuss relevant issues during the meetings such as the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Asian 
Development Bank annual meetings. 
  They also felt that there was no need for a joint statement 
at the end of the day-long meeting and that a statement from 
Bentsen as chairman of the meeting would suffice. 
  Anwar told the Malaysian Press after his bilateral meetings 
that response to ASEAN's common position from the three 
Ministers was "positive". 
  On his discussion with Bentsen, Anwar said they also touched 
on other issues to be raised at today's meeting. Anwar said he 
was very pleased that Bentsen had asked Malaysia to take the 
lead in discussions on capital flows and capital markets, 
including the positive developments and achievements made by 
Malaysia thus far. 
  They discussed the APEC Finance Ministers' meeting and said 
that it should remain an informal meeting. If there is a need 
for a meeting next year, it could be tied to some meeting that 
"we are all already due to attend". 
  The issue of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) was also 
raised. Anwar told Bentsen that just as Malaysia was supportive 
of some of the meetings that had been held within the context of 
APEC, an informal caucus within the East Asian context and in 
the same spirit were also desirable. 
  Anwar described Bentsen's response as being positive 
following the explanation, adding that "if it can happen in an 
informal framework within the APEC context, I see no reason why 
it cannot be supported within the EAEC context". 
  Meanwhile, Anwar said Liu was keen to exchange views on 
Malaysia's development experience. Liu suggested that a special 
session be held in China to enable an exchange of views with the 
Chinese leaders and economic planners in terms of macro planning 
and strategies for growth with low inflation when Anwar visits 
China. 
  Other issues raised included the possibility of joint 
investments between Chinese companies or subsidiaries of 
government controlled companies and some Malaysian private 
sector ventures in Malaysia and in China. 
  The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) project was 
also discussed when Anwar met Fujii. Anwar assured him that the 
project would continue as scheduled. 
  Fujii, on his part, gave an assurance of continued support, 
including soft loan for the project and the possibility of 
continued assistance in manpower planning and expertise. 
  He also said experts for some of Malaysia's development and 
educational projects and programmes could also be made available 
if and when needed. 
  Asked about increased capital flows and arguments that these 
could complicate issues and thus the need for an institution to 
regulate these flows, Anwar said he did not think increased 
capital flows would complicate matters "but it certainly will 
boost economic growth" 
  It requires effective cooperation with other countries and 
authorities. "That is why in principle, we support the need for 
an indepth study on issues relating to capital inflows and to 
seek ways and means to effectively coordinate or cooperate even 
though it is essentially a private sector initiative," he said. 
  On whether APEC could step in for this purpose, Anwar 
pointed 
out that "it was never the intention of APEC to be a regulatory 
body and each country has its own effective regulatory framework 
for coordination with the relevant authorities".
