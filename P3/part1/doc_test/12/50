FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Hardwood curbs could deplete forests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CURBS on world trade in tropical hardwood could result in more forest
depletion rather than conservation, Mr Carlos Alberto Primo Braga, economist
in the World Bank's International Trade Division, says.
In a study of how trade policies have affected forest use in Brazil and
Indonesia, he argues: 'Use of export restrictions visited additional
environmental degradation on Indonesia's wet tropical forest than a proper
resource management programme involving a tax on all timber at the logging
stage would have done.' The findings challenge environmentalists who have
fought for a ban on trade as a main plank in their push to protect the
world's forests.
Mr Primo Braga sets out the rate forests are being lost and shares
environmentalists' concern over the plight of tropical wet forests. Forest
depletion has already significantly affected the economy of some developing
countries, like the Philippines, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, he notes. If the
pace of deforestation continues unchecked through the 1990s, the number of
net exporters of forest products among developing countries would fall from
33 to 10 by the year 2000.
World Bank studies show that about 60 per cent of depletion is due not to
trade but farming and cattle ranching, with the balance split between road
building, urbanisation, fuelwood and logging: 'Activities geared to the
domestic market ..are the main players in the deforestation process.' His
case is vividly illustrated in Brazil, where commercial logging accounts for
less than 1 per cent of GDP, and for under 1 per cent of export revenues.
Much of this is concerned with coniferous and eucalyptus logging in the
south of the country, rather than tropical forests. Of total hardwood
logging, 10 per cent goes on to the export market, the rest being used
inside Brazil.
As a result, trade measures against Brazil's exports are useless. They have
no influence on the deforestation process, and they lull environmentalists
into a false sense that progress is being made. Instead, they should be
focusing on the core problems: poverty, development projects, migration, and
government subsidies for logging and cattle ranching. The error of trying to
use trade measures to slow deforestation is shown differently in Indonesia,
where hardwood products account for 14 per cent of export earnings, with
over 40 per cent of production exported.
Indonesia's outward orientation is not just due to government policies, Mr
Primo Braga argues. Indonesian hardwood is more competitively priced, since
its forests have higher densities of commercially valuable trees; the light
colours of Asian hardwoods are preferred by consumers in developed
countries; access to forests is easier; and it is closer to the world's main
importer, Japan. Indonesia introduced trade curbs first on logs, then sawn
wood, under a strategy of encouraging higher value-added production in the
country. The result: intensified depletion of forests, since local
processors using inefficient machinery need more logs for every unit of
output than counterparts in Japan or Canada.
'If Indonesian sawmills and plywoods were operating at the world
technological frontier, the same production of sawn wood and plywoods
achieved in the second half of the 1980s could be reached with an annual
economy of 3.3m cu m of logs.' This would have cut annual log harvests by 10
per cent. A ban on trade in tropical hardwood would tend to depress its
price. An import ban would 'assign a lower value to forests, and (encourage)
less careful management of the resource, providing greater incentives to
convert forest land to other uses.'
