  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 31 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia have agreed to study whatever fresh evidence is 
available in their bid to resolve the overlapping claims on the 
Sipadan and Ligitan Islands, Malaysian Foreign Ministry 
Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said Monday. 
  He said both countries were agreed that the issue of 
overlapping claims on the Islands off Sabah and northeast 
Kalimantan could be settled through negotiations. 
  Whatever new documents and ideas can be presented for study 
before the third round of talks in Jakarta in May, he told 
reporters after the presentation of Japanese Government cultural 
aid to Malaysia at the Foreign Ministry here. 
  He was confident that the two sides could reach a concrete 
consensus at the talks although the issue was complicated. 
  Malaysia and Indonesia had studied all the documents and 
maps 
that were presented at the second round of talks here last week, 
he said. 
  He said both sides shared the view that all international 
legal aspects be resorted to if necessary to resolve the issue. 
  Both parties were confident that the issue would not spark 
off something that is to be regretted in the future.
