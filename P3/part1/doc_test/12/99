<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Foreign Minister Datuk </F>
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi by STRAITS TIMES correspondent Ismail 
Kassim in Kuala Lumpur; date not given] 
  [Text] On the pluses and minuses of Malaysia's 
pro-active foreign policy: 
  [Badawi] To be credible, we have to conduct our policy with 
integrity and honesty. If we are not popular as a result of 
that, it is just a consequence. Whatever action we take is not 
meant to make us popular. 
  The bottomline is that it's a plus for us... 
  But we don't go round on the basis of counting pluses and 
minuses. From my assessment, more people appreciated and 
approved of our actions than disapproved. 
  On the impact of such an approach on neighbours and 
friends: 
  [Badawi] We cannot pursue a policy purely on the basis of 
what our friends want us to do. As an independent and sovereign 
nation, we have the right to voice our views in any 
international forum and we have expressed them loud and clear. 
But we do not do it on the basis of wanting to compete with 
others. 
  We are also very responsive to suggestions from other 
leaders. We have never held back our support for any good idea 
that came from anybody... 
  On Malaysia being the odd-man-out in ASEAN over the 
future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], a 17-member 
grouping: 
  [Badawi] I don't think so. If I understand (Indonesian 
Foreign Minister) Ali Alatas, I don't think Indonesia is ready 
for a more formal structure. I have been assured that Singapore 
too does not want anything big. 
  If we are not careful, the development of APEC could lead to 
the diminution of sub-regional cooperation. That's why Malaysia 
has been speaking up -- because we want to make sure that ASEAN 
is not swallowed. We do not want ASEAN to lose its identity and 
its effectiveness. 
  We have taken a pro-ASEAN position. We want to preserve and 
promote ASEAN because we value ASEAN cooperation which has 
proven verv successful. 
  We do not reject APEC. We will participate in its meeting 
and we will implement whatever projects we are involved in. But 
we do not believe APEC should be structured with a big 
secretariat like a mini-United Nations. 
  On the attendance of Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar 
Ibrahim at the APEC finance ministers meeting this week, and Dr. 
Mahathir's likely presence at the Jakarta APEC summit later this 
year: 
  [Badawi] We have been assured that it is (the finance 
ministers meeting) going to be a one-off meeting, not an annual 
affair. That's why Datuk Anwar went in his capacity as finance 
minister, not as the deputy premier. 
  Dr. Mahathir is also likely to go to Jakarta. Whatever 
happens after that, we don't know. 
  My fear is that the APEC summit might be an annual event. I 
think there will be many countries anxious to hold this kind of 
gathering. But our position remains unchanged. 
  In ASEAN, we respect our differences over this issue. It has 
not divided us yet and there's still continuing cooperation. On 
some pressing issues, we can still reach consensus. 
  But we are actually worried of what may happen in the 
future. 
  On reports that American officials are urging Japanese 
and Koreans privately not to join the EAEC [East Asian Economic 
Caucus] despite the Clinton administration dropping its 
opposition to the caucus which excludes the United States: 
  [Badawi] I don't want to use harsh words such as hypocrisy. 
But this is the kind of double-game diplomacy that we don't 
want. One plays at the net, the other lobbying from the 
backline. 
  I will go by what Warren Christopher said in Singapore in 
his 
official capacity not as a private person. 
  (During the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in Singapore 
last July, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared 
that "the United States now views the development of the EAEC 
with interest and without hostility, and hopes that the EAEC 
would enhance a more open trading system".) 
  It was not an off-the-cuff remark he made in some corner of 
the world in response to a reporter's question. So we have to 
hold on to his words. 
  We hope that the first meeting of EAEC at an appropriate 
level can be held by the end of this year. 
  On the repercussions of the current row with Britain 
which began after the London SUNDAY TIMES newspaper began 
implying that Malaysian government leaders, including Dr. 
Mahathir, were corrupt: 
  [Badawi] We are monitoring it very closely. At the moment, 
nothing adverse yet. 
  On our part, we have no fear in dealing with any government 
which speaks on what it believes in. I don't think other 
countries have any problem with us. It's a not a minus point 
for Malaysia to stand up for its beliefs. After all, we are not 
tearing up any contract that has been signed. 
  Every issue will be resolved eventually. I am in no position 
to predict when this can happen. See what happened with 
Australia. All the noises and then it all ended amicably. 
  Neither Malaysia nor Britain wants to do anything to worsen 
the situation. 
On his first official visit to Singapore from tomorrow and 
bilateral relations: 
  [Badawi] Well, we are so close, we don't normally make state 
visits. I don't think [former prime minister] Tun Razak or Tun 
Hussein made any official visit to Singapore. Likewise, Lee 
Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong too have never made an official visit 
to Malaysia. 
  As to my trip, it is like dropping into a neighbour's semi- 
detached house for tea. I have been going in and out and 
passing through all the time, so Kan Seng (former Singapore 
Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng, who is now in Home Affairs) 
suggested that I drop in for a chat. 
  There isn't anything intimidating about the visit. I am not 
going to talk about the dispute over Pulau Batu Putih (Pedra 
Branca). 
  The meeting of officials to resolve it has been going on. 
They have their own schedule. I am not going to interfere. 
  As to other problems, I can't think of any.
