<F P=106> [First part of two-part interview with Forestry Minister </F>
Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon; 
date not given] 
  [Text] What is the new Burmese forestry policy? 
  [Chit Swe] We are revising our national forest policy. Our 
present policy is an old one, based on the Indian national 
forest law. The Indian authorities have already revised it five 
times. We have never revised ours that is why we are doing it 
now. Anyhow, we have enacted a new forest law on November 30, 
1993. Our old one has been in use since 1902. 
  We are now trying to reduce state enterprise business, and 
to 
encourage the private sector to engage more in forestry 
business. Also instead of just selling, we are going into more 
value-added downstream industries. For those who want to carry 
out forestry-related business, they now have a choice of a 100 
per cent investment or a 50-50 per cent joint venture. Now we 
mostly welcome value-added business. We have got a lot of good 
and bad experiences in the last 4-5 years. For those, who want 
sawn timber and finished goods, there are plenty of 
opportunities. There is no problem. 
  So it means that after 31 December 1993, no more 
logging concessions have been granted to foreign companies? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes. 
  What kind of value added industries are you 
promoting? 
  [Chit Swe] There are many kinds of timber businesses. Some 
factories have to start from veneer or plywood and some go 
straight to finished goods such as furniture or handicraft. If 
it is the furniture business, it is very easy to submit a 
project proposal to the Foreign Investment Commission, and 
within months or weeks we can make a decision. 
  If they want a factory with a 100-hoppus tons a year 
capacity, a very big amount or big volume by international 
standards, then it is not easy for us. But if they want a 
medium sized factory of 30-40,000 hoppus tons a year, I think we 
can supply our raw material by tenders. In our country, to 
travel from the North to the South is a long journey. Most of 
our logs are in the upper of Myanmar [Burma], so to take them 
from upcountry to Yangon [Rangoon], sometimes takes years. Our 
climate is a little different from that of Indonesia and 
Malaysia. For them, they can extract logs all year round, but 
we get the rainy season for nearly six months and we lack 
harvesting equipment and our transport is also very poor. 
Sometimes you have to wait to harvest after November because in 
October there can be swamp-like conditions and it is not easy to 
put skidders inside. 
  You have a number of saw mills, plywood and furniture 
factories. How are they being operated -- by your Govermnent or 
by the private sector? 
  [Chit Swe] We have got some saw mills owned by our Myanmar 
Timber Enterprise. Some are in good condition, but some are in 
a bad state. If somebody wants to hire or enter into a joint 
venture with the saw mills, we have got more than 80 of them. 
Also if they want to enter into a joint venture with our timber 
enterprise we can supply them with raw material. 
  We have got five plywood factories and only two foreign 
companies, one is Daewoo of South Korea and the other SEA Lumber 
Company of Malaysia. Both are doing joint venture businesses. 
So there are three left and many companies are proposing to 
enter into joint ventures with them. Anyhow there is no 
commitment as yet. We are still negotiating. 
  What is the investment percentage of the joint ventures 
by Daewoo and SEA with your Government? 
  [Chit Swe] Our side is 45 per cent, and their side is also 
of 
the same percentage. But then, they also bring in another 10 
par cent from other company. It means there are two companies 
from their side. So Daewoo is 45, our side is also 45 and 10 is 
from another third partner. It is the same with SEA Lumber. 
The third partners are mostly investors or financiers. 
  What about those 80 sawmills? 
  [Chit Swe] Some saw mills are a little far away from the 
forest, so it is not easy to enter into a joint venture with 
other companies. We are also in short supply of harvesting 
equipment. We need money to buy machines, so instead of buying 
and selling our raw material, foreign investors can bring in 
their extraction equipment, and we will supply them with raw 
material. This means we can both together produce sawn timber 
for export to other countries. This is a joint venture. 
  What about furniture factories? 
  [Chit Swe] We have got three. For these three furniture 
factories, some countries from the West, some from Singapore and 
some from other countries have put up proposals. I think we 
have already agreed with one company from Singapore, that is 
Lambir Company. 
  Do foreign investors have to bid in running these 
factories, or do they each have to submit a proposal which is 
then considered individually? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes, one by one. 
  Apart from this downstream value-added industry, are 
you still selling logs? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes, we still got some commitments that will last 
for another 2-3 years, but we are reducing and phasing out these 
activities. 
  Who are your main buyers? 
  [Chit Swe] Our timber enterprise earns a total of about 
US$200 million a year from logs and the valued added industry. 
This is an average income. We want to sell more but we have to 
adhere to the annual allowable cut. For teak it is only 350,000 
hoppus tons (630,000 cubic metres) a year, and 1.3 million 
hoppus tons (2.34 million cubic metres) for hardwoods and other 
species. We cannot cut more than these amounts. 
  Forestry is the second most important industry after 
agriculture. Among the ministries we are the number one foreign 
exchange earner, but it is not easy now because other sectors 
are competing such as fisheries and manufacturing. 
  You are now facing increasing probbms related to 
smuggling snd illegal cutting of trees. How are you going to 
deal or resolve these problems? Are you going to enact a new law 
or amend existing ones? 
  [Chit Swe] If there is a will, there is a way. Smuggling in 
our country is very small when compared with other countries, 
such as Malaysia and Indonesia. I think in Malaysia, the 
imprisonment term is up to 20 years, but in our country it is 
only seven years. 
  What was the percentage of your forest cover before and 
after you gave out logging concessions to Thai companies? 
  [Chit Swe] There was less than 50 per cent forest cover 
before the concessions. Now it is nearly that figure. 
According to the FAO statistics, Myanmar forest cover area in 
1969-1971 was 32.2 million hectares and in 1989 was 32.4 million 
hectares. There is some expert opinion that by the year 2000, 
every country should have a forest cover area of up to 30 per 
cent. Most countries have less than 20 per cent, but ours is no 
problem because we have got about 50 per cent of forest left.
