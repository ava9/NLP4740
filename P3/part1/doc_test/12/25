loggers - Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil

When the Indonesian forestry ministry recently announced that it had banned
a large timber company from listing shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange,
the move caused a stir. For the ministry imposed the ban because of its
suspicion that the company was involved in illegal logging.
It would certainly not surprise timber industry afficionados if the
allegation were true. What created the interest was that after many years of
complaint about lack of resources and information, the ministry was now
taking steps to enforce the law.
Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil. It totals
144m hectares and covers 70 per cent of its land area. The country has long
been aware of the value of its forestry resources and the need to conserve
them.
Government policy concentrates on control of illegal logging and the
introduction of higher value added products, a reduction in shifting
cultivation by forest dwellers and the provision of new employment, and the
establishment of renewable timber plantations to support a fast-growing pulp
and paper industry.
Log exports were banned in 1985, and low interest loans offered to companies
establishing plywood factories. As a result, exports of plywood have jumped
from USDollars 991m that year to USDollars 3.2bn in 1992. Total exports of
processed wood products, including furniture, reached USDollars 4.2bn in
1992, the third largest export earner after oil and textiles. Principal
markets are Japan and South Korea.
At the same time, the pulp and paper industry has also shown remarkable
growth. The industry has been privatised and capacity is expected to grow
from 1.5m tonnes of pulp and 3.2m tonnes of paper to 14.6m tonnes of pulp
and 7.2m tonnes of paper over the next 10 years.
With pulp production costs of USDollars 250 a tonne, significantly lower
than European and North American producers, Indonesia is expected to become
a significant producer. Exports of pulp and paper have already risen from
188,000 tonnes in 1987 to 660,000 tonnes in 1992.
The timber industry is dominated by the giant Barito Pacific Timer, the
largest listed company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the holder of 5m
hectares of forestry concessions, an area larger than Switzerland.
Barito is controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a young ethnic Chinese
Indonesian businessman with close links to Indonesian President Suharto and
his family. It exports 95 per cent of its annual production of 1.3m cubic
metres of wood products and 90,000 tonnes of adhesives.
Barito had sales of USDollars 459m last year and net profit of USDollars
145m, a rise of almost 100 per cent on the previous year. The company is
benefiting from a rise in plywood prices from around USDollars 300 a cubic
metre in late 1992 to more than USDollars 500 a cubic metre now.
The company made an initial public offering of shares last year, raising
USDollars 292m. It has plans to expand into the pulp industry and has
purchased a total of 660,000 hectares of forestry land, some of which is
already replanted.
Barito last month signed a preliminary agreement with Marubeni and Nippon
Pulp and Paper of Japan to establish a USDollars 1bn pulp plant with a
capacity of 500,000 tons. This is expected to come on stream in 1997. It is
also acquiring timber assets in Malaysia.
Another large ethnic Chinese-owned business group, the third largest in
Indonesia, is the principal participant in the existing pulp and paper
industry. The Sinar Mas group, a long established business with interests in
banking, property, food and agribusiness, controls the two principal listed
companies, Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia.
Indah Kiat, with timber plantations and mills in Sumatra, has production
capacity of 790,000 tonnes of pulp, of which 410,000 tonnes has just come on
stream, and 344,000 tonnes of paper, backed up by a timber concession of
300,000 hectares.
The company had turnover of USDollars 305m in 1993, up 53 per cent on the
previous year but earnings were hit by lower world pulp prices and fell from
USDollars 57m to USDollars 42m.
Brokers W. I. Carr expect a recovery this year as the new pulp output pushes
forecast sales to USDollars 483m and improved export pulp prices and
domestic paper prices increase net profit to USDollars 76m.
Sinar Mas's other big producer, Tjiwi Kimia, has a production capacity of
21,600 tonnes of pulp and 394,000 tonnes of paper. It supplies 35 per cent
of the domestic paper market and 50 per cent of the local stationery market
and exports 40 per cent of its production.
Its expansion plans involve upgrading to high quality papers such as
non-carbon required paper and cast coating paper and installing new
machinery.
The company's turnover last year was up 25 per cent to USDollars 289m and is
forecast to rise by a similar amount this year. Net profit was USDollars
37m, up 19 per cent. A surge in the domestic price of paper to USDollars 900
per tonne, compared with USDollars 600 per tonne internationally will push
up profits this year.
But the government is expected to move to reduce tariffs and surcharge
against imports, currently at 40 per cent, to reduce prices. Nevertheless,
Tjiwi Kimia is expected to increase net profits for 1994 by 39 per cent to
USDollars 51m.
Rapid growth in environmental action groups has accompanied the rise of the
timber industry in Indonesia and companies have been regularly hit by
complaints. Indorayon, a large pulp and rayon producer which had earlier
been accused of polluting water supplies, suffered a serious chlorine leak
at its North Sumatra plant last year and was forced to cease operations for
a time.
Indorayon produces long and short fibre pulp with a capacity of 260,000
tonnes backed up by 269,000ha of tropical forest and 86,000ha of pine
forest. Its rayon plant has a capacity of 60,000 tonnes.
Forestry and environment officials have been quick to investigate listed
companies' pollution controls and have enforced requirements to install
expensive waste treatment facilities. Indah Kiat was fined last year for
allegedly acquiring timber from improper sources.
But environmentalists believe there is still much to be done, especially in
the monitoring of illegal logging. They point out that, according to
Indonesia's own rules on sustainable forest management, the maximum amount
of timber that can be cut is 31.4m cubic metres a year. But actual demand is
44m cubic metres, almost 40 per cent higher.
More effective monitoring of resources, plus better tax collection from
timber corporations are the main recommendations from action groups for the
future control on one of the country's most valuable resources.
