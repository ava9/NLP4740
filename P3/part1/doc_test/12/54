  [Text] Reports of illegal loggings have dropped 
dramatically following the adoption of the National Forestry 
Amendment Act 1993 by all Malaysian states. 
  The director general of the Forestry Department, Dr. Ismail 
Awang, said there is a 50-percent drop in the number of cases 
reported in Pahang, Kelantan, and Perak since the act was 
enforced in February. 
  The amended act provides for a maximum 500,000 ringgit, and 
the mandatory jail term from one to 20 years for those convicted 
of illegal logging. 
  Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Ismail said the 
department had also embarked on a five-year forest management 
plan as a guide for more practical forest management.
