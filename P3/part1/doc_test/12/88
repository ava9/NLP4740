  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, 13 Feb--The ruling party, the Sabah 
United Party (PBS), has never been serious in its efforts to 
develop and advance the state. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the 
matter 
is evident from the attitude of the PBS, which has never made 
any request of the Federal Government regarding development and 
progress for the benefit and comfort of the people of Sabah. 
  "In the more than four years since the PBS left the National 
Front (BN), the PBS has never made any clear or serious request 
for the purpose of developing the State of Sabah," he told 
reporters today at Papar Mosque, about 50 kilometers from the 
state capital, when interviewed at a meeting with the public to 
break the fast. 
  Also present at the meeting were Osu Sukam, BN candidate 
from 
the Kawang District, and Rahim Ismail, BN candidate from the 
Buang Sayang District, who are, respectively, president and 
deputy president of the UMNO [United Malays National 
Organization] Papar Division. 
  Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said that from the 
time the PBS stabbed the BN in the back until now, the Central 
Government has never received any letter from the party for the 
purpose of obtaining allocations for development for the benefit 
of the people of Sabah. 
  "All that the Central Government received from the PBS was a 
request for privatization projects, including the privatization 
of Sabah Forest Industries (SFI), which would benefit merely a 
few PBS leaders," he said. 
  On the same subject, Anwar advised the people of Sabah to be 
cautious of PBS political propaganda as the election approaches. 
He said the people of Sabah must not let the PBS buy their 
dignity during the "election fever" season before the eighth 
Sabah State Legislature election, now only about four days away. 
According to Anwar, the PBS will soon use its money 
"distribution" tactic among the people of Sabah. 
  "I will not be surprised if the PBS soon distributes two or 
three hundred ringgit to every Sabahan. But what is the value 
of that amount of money over five years? Where are our national 
values and what is the value of our dignity if our eyes are 
closed by two or three hundred ringgit distributed every five 
years?" he asked. 
  Anwar called on the people of Sabah to eliminate the PBS in 
this election in order to move in a more meaningful direction in 
the future. He said the people of Sabah who are Muslims have no 
choice other than to bring down the PBS, which does not respect 
Sabahans who follow Islam.
