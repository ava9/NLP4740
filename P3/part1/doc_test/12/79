'RIGHT - We're Moslems' declare the stickers on car rear windows in Jakarta,
in a sort of Islamic counterpoint to the 'Honk for Jesus' message seen on
the highways of America.
Two statements are commonly made about Islam in south-east Asia. The first
is that Indonesia has the largest Moslem population in the world, with 90
per cent of its 183m people professing the Islamic faith; the second is that
the Islam practised in Indonesia and Malaysia is much milder than the Middle
Eastern brand.
Both statements are broadly true, but they gloss over the great diversity of
Indonesian and Malaysian Islam, a diversity which encompasses radical as
well as moderate and mystical tendencies.
Only this month Mr Abdul Fatah Wiranagapati, a 69-year-old Moslem
fundamentalist linked to a separatist movement in the northern Indonesian
province of Aceh, was sentenced to eight years in jail for attempting to set
up an independent Islamic state.
Aceh's mosques overflow with worshippers each Friday, the Moslem holy day,
and resentment of the central government in Jakarta has helped to fuel
Islamic fundamentalism.
In the nearby Malaysian state of Kelantan, the Parti Islam is attempting to
introduce Islamic criminal law in defiance of the central government's view
that such a move is unacceptable in a multiracial and multi-religious
society.
On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems opposed to gambling recently
protested against the introduction of a lottery. Last month saw the opening
of the country's first Islamic bank, Bank Muamalat Indonesia.
The rise of Islamic consciousness over the past decade - more and more women
wear Islamic scarves, for example - has prompted President Suharto and his
supporters to emphasise the country's Moslem identity and to make several
real and symbolic concessions to Moslem groups.
President Suharto encouraged the formation two years ago of the
All-Indonesia Association of Moslem Intellectuals (ICMI) to bring together
loyalist Moslems under the leadership of Mr B J Habibie, the minister
responsible for research and technology.
Last year, Mr Suharto and his wife undertook their first pilgrimage to
Mecca, earning him the title 'Haji' (one who has been on the Haj) and the
honorary first name 'Mohammed'. He was also a supporter of the new Islamic
bank.
The complex forces of Islam are evidently regarded as a useful counterweight
to the military establishment and the extent to which the authorities are
guilty of political opportunism has now become a matter of public debate.
A mass prayer in April for President Suharto's re-election became so
controversial after the event - particularly when a number of Islamic groups
said to have given their support to the prayer denied involvement - that the
president was forced to distance himself from the organisers of the rally.
'The president relies more and more on the Islamic movement,' says Mr
Abdurrahman Wahid, moderate leader of the country's largest Moslem
organisation, the Nahdhatul Ulama (NU).
'But the problem now is that when a rift takes place between the president
and the armed forces then those people who would like to formalise Islam in
state life try to manipulate the gap to make the president dependent on
them. This is the sorry state we are now in. . . I'm concerned that this
kind of manipulation will encourage the fundamentalists to come up.'
Mr Suharto is well aware of the dangers of the somewhat unpredictable
Islamic card that he has played in the recent election campaign.
He deliberately emasculated political Islam after the overthrow of President
Sukarno in 1965, forcing all the Moslem parties into the new United
Development Party (PPP) and framing the non-confessional official political
philosophy of 'Pancasila'.
More recently, Mr Suharto's 'New Order' government has discouraged
Indonesians from studying in countries such as Saudi Arabia where they might
absorb extremist Islamic ideas. Students say they have been told that there
are good Islamic studies courses in the US and Canada as well as in the
Middle East.
'The New Order de-politicises Islam and de-Islamises politics,' says Mr
Wahid, whose NU organisation is thought to have some 35m supporters. 'But at
the same time the government needs legitimacy from Islamic groups for its
programmes - like family planning for example.'
The moderate, mystical strain in Indonesian Islam remains strong. Islam was
brought to Indonesia by traders from Arabia and Persia from around the 14th
century, and orthodox Moslems, known as 'santri', are numerous on the coasts
of Sumatra, Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In Java, however, many of the poor are
classed as 'abangan', Moslems whose beliefs are mingled with pre-Islamic
Javanese mysticism as well as Hinduism and Buddhism.
Leaders of the Islamic Association of University Students (HMI) - which took
over the gloomy Jakarta offices of the banned communist party - reject the
violent style of Iranian or Afghan Islam and say they do not even mind about
the lottery.
'We want to become Moslems of intellect and professionalism,' says Ms Lena
Mariana Mukti. 'We are very tolerant. Our relations are very close with
other religious groups. For example after the Dili incident (when Indonesian
troops shot dead at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators at a funeral in
predominantly Christian East Timor) we went to demonstrate in the street.'
Mr Wahid reckons there is a core of only about 5,000 active Islamic
fundamentalists in the country, but he is under pressure from radicals
within his own organisation to take a stronger stand for Islam, and
profoundly concerned about Saudi-funded efforts to confront the supposed
'Christianisation' of society, an issue he regards as dangerously divisive.
'I was surprised one day when my eight-year-old daughter said she was on the
same bench as a Christian girl at school,' he said. 'Eight years old and
already talking about things in religious terms] It's not healthy for
Indonesia. . . Ten years ago there was no word of 'Christianisation' in the
mosques; now there's plenty.'
Mr Wahid distinguished himself as a Moslem by defending Mr Salman Rushdie's
right to free speech after Ayatollah Khomeini had condemned the British
writer to death for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses.
He believes that Islam should be a democratising rather than an
anti-democratic force and, in the face of harassment from the authorities,
he chairs the Forum for Democracy group.
'I saw the hanging of Jews in Baghdad in 1969 - 14 of them,' he says.
'That's when I decided to go for democracy. . . We don't want to divide
people into Moslems and second-class citizens. What happens in Iran now, or
Saudi Arabia? Non-Moslems have no rights at all.
'As long as we're given the right to explain the human side of Islam, then
I'm convinced that Indonesians will always be moderate Moslems,' he says.
