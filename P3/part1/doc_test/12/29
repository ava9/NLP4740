Officials at Indonesia's forestry ministry are contradicting each other in
what threatens to escalate into a row between the minister of forestry and
the country's largest timber producer, Barito Pacific Timber.
Earlier this week the forestry minister, Mr Djamaluddin Soeryohadikusomo,
said that if Barito Pacific wanted to renew the licences for its forest
concessions, it would have to hand over as much as 49 per cent of its shares
to a state-owned company.
The minister accused Barito of causing 'considerable' damage to forests
under its control, and said the government wanted its own man in the
company's management to ensure 'sustainable management of its forest
concessions'.
Barito Pacific responded by saying that the minister's comments referred to
two forest concessions in south Kalimantan which did not belong to Barito
Pacific but which did supply the company with logs.
This statement was subsequently supported by the forestry ministry, which
said in a press release that the issue concerned not Barito Pacific Timber
but the forest concessions set up to supply logs to the company.
However, an official at Barito Pacific said the company had been 'helping'
in the management of these two forest concessions over the past five years.
Barito Pacific officials denied the government wanted to take over 49 per
cent of the equity in their company, saying instead that the minister wanted
the state to take a 49 per cent stake in the two companies which own the two
forest concessions in south Kalimantan, Yayang Indonesia and Aya Timber.
The forestry minister is expected to make a further statement today.
Barito Pacific is the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood producer and
a listed company.
It controls some 5m hectares of Indonesian forest.
