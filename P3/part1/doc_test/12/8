Indonesian and Malaysian corporate interests are to form one of the world's
biggest timber concerns in a complex deal valued at around Dollars 1bn.
Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and the world's
leading plywood exporter, will purchase about 70 per cent of Construction
and Supplies House group (Cash), a relatively small, loss-making building
supplies company listed on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. At the same time Cash
is to buy a 30 per cent interest in Barito Pacific.
The deal is the biggest cross-border transaction so far between listed
companies in south-east Asia. Malaysia and Indonesia account for more than
90 per cent of global tropical plywood production and analysts suggest the
two countries could be seeking greater control of plywood prices through the
alliance.
Barito Pacific has timber concessions in Indonesia of more than 5m hectares
 -an area larger than Switzerland. The company is controlled by Mr Prajogo
Pangestu, an Indonesian Chinese who has become one of Indonesia's leading
corporate figures.
Apart from Barito, Mr Prajogo has a 10 per cent holding in Astra
International, one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates, and has business
partnerships with two of the children of President Suharto.
Last year about 12 per cent of Barito was listed on the Jakarta stock
exchange and the company now accounts for more than 10 per cent of the stock
market's total capitalisation. Private family interests of Mr Prajogo
control the rest of Barito.
At a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Prajogo said the alliance with the
Cash group was the first step in plans for Barito to go international.
Analysts feel Mr Prajogo has other reasons for the move.
Recent industrial disputes and riots in Indonesia have made the small but
economically powerful Chinese community nervous. The Cash deal effectively
moves a large part of Mr Prajogo's private assets offshore.
By injecting a substantial part of his private interests into a listed
Malaysian concern, Mr Prajogo will take advantage of the high price/earnings
ratios commanded by timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
Foreign fund managers are also seen to favour Kuala Lumpur-listed companies
over those listed in Jakarta.
On completion of the deal, Mr Prajogo will still retain control of Barito
and own more than 60 per cent of Cash. The newly enlarged Cash will become
one of the biggest timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
The terms of the transaction, valued at MDollars 2.59m (Dollars 1bn),
include Mr Prajogo injecting privately held interests in Papua New Guinea
and China into Cash in exchange for newly issued Cash shares. Cash will use
a combination of rights issues, cash and irredeemable, convertible unsecured
loan stocks to purchase 30 per cent of Barito shares.
