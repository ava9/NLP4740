  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The 
demarcation of the international boundary between Malaysia and 
Indonesia in Sabah and Sarawak (in East Malaysia), which started 
in 1975, is expected to be completed by the year 2000, Land and 
Cooperative Development Secretary-General Azmeer Rashid said 
Monday. 
  He said 98 percent or 333 km of the boundary in Sabah and 
East Kalimantan on the Indonesian side had been demarcated and 
agreed to by the two countries. 
  Work to survey and demarcate the remaining two percent or an

  Azmeer is leading an 18-member team to the 19th meeting of 
the Malaysia/Indonesia joint committee on the demarcation of 
their international boundary while Indonesia is represented by a 
16-member team, headed by Major General H. Suryatna Subrata of 
the home affairs department. 
  For the boundary in Sarawak and West Kalimantan, Azmeer said 
only 35 percent or 1,400 km had been demarcated and agreed upon.
