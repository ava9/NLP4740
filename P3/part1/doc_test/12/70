The Indonesian government has announced plans to reduce its timber output by
over 28 per cent over the next five years because excessive felling is
believed to have caused floods followed by severe droughts on the country's
most densely populated island of Java.
Mr Djamaloedin Soeryohadikoesoemo, the minister of forestry, said that the
country's timber production would be cut to 22.5m cubic metres by the turn
of the century from its present level of just over 30m cu m.
This month a severe drought in central Java damaged about 16,000 hectares of
rice fields and is expected to lead to 3 per cent fall in Indonesia's rice
output. Excessive logging is destroying the forest's crucial function of
watershed protection.
Plans to reduce timber output are linked to increasing concern about the
extent of illegal logging in the country. The government estimates between
4m and 6m cu m a year are cut down illegally each year but environmental
lobbyists say the figure is much higher.
In recent months, the Ministry of Forestry has attempted to crack down on
illegal logging. Mr Soeryohadikoesoemo said that 248 forest concessionaires
had violated logging regulations and were being fined a total of Dollars
21m. Some concessionaires had already had their logging licences revoked.
Plans are also under way to implement an eco-labelling scheme, which would
provide consumers with information about the origin of wood products
manufactured in Indonesia.
Wood and paper products accounted for nearly a third of the total value of
Indonesia's non-oil exports last year.
