competition - Kieran Cooke reports on a surge in activity between Indonesia
and Malaysia

South-east Asia's big companies are increasingly co-operating in order to
exploit more fully the area's robust economies, and leading the charge are
Malaysian and Indonesian concerns.
'Over the last few months we have seen a sudden surge in business activity
between Malaysia and Indonesia,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy
prime minister, on a recent investment mission to Indonesia. 'Companies in
our two countries are learning to co-operate rather than compete.'
Though Malaysia and Indonesia have strong cultural, racial and religious
links, there have often been sharp political differences between the two
countries. Corporate contacts have been few and trade limited.
The catalyst for the recent flurry of cross-border corporate dealings was a
meeting between President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister, at the end of last year. Since then, deals have
been announced on a regular basis.
Indonesia has agreed to import Proton cars manufactured by Malaysia's
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional. In return, Malaysia will buy aircraft
manufactured by Indonesia's Industri Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). Proton says
it will export about 2,500 of its cars to Indonesia during the next year and
eventually plans to assemble cars there. Malaysia has not said how many
Indonesian-made aircraft it intends to buy.
The deal is controversial. Other car importers in Indonesia have been
angered by reports that PT Citra Lamtoro, the local company which has been
appointed as Proton distributor, will be exempt from 300 per cent Indonesian
duties imposed on most imported vehicles.
PT Citra is controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of Mr
Suharto.
One of the year's more unusual corporate deals came in February when
Indonesian and Malaysian interests took control of Lamborghini, once the
pride of Italy's sports car manufacturers.
Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son, has a 50 per cent stake
in Megatech, the Bermuda-registered company which owns Lamborghini. Other
shareholders are Mycom, a listed Malaysian gaming company, and the
Mal-aysian police investment fund.
In April, two of south-east Asia's wealthiest businessmen, Mr Robert Kuok
and Mr Liem Sioe Liong, announced they were teaming up to develop sugar
plantations and refining operations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
Mr Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, controls a business empire with interests
ranging from beach resorts and housing schemes to ownership of a controlling
interest in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post group. Mr Liem, an
Indonesian Chinese, controls Indonesia's largest business group, with
interests ranging from noodle making to cement manufacturing.
In mid-July Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and
the world's leading exporter of plywood, said it would purchase about 70 per
cent of a small, loss-making Malaysian building supplies company listed on
the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
Indonesian companies anxious to go public and raise funds for expansion are
envious of Kuala Lumpur's highly liquid stock market. The Jakarta exchange
is considerably smaller and less developed.
Under the terms of the deal, Barito will inject a significant part of its
funds into the Malaysian company and so achieve a 'back-door' listing on
what is south-east Asia's biggest exchange in terms of total capitalisation.
The deal has been backed by the Malaysian and Indonesian leaders, but it has
also been criticised. Such corporate manoeuvrings are coming under
increasing scrutiny from Malaysia's Securities Commission. In Indonesia
there is criticism that Barito, controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an
Indonesian Chinese businessman closely linked to the ruling family, is not
investing company funds inside the country.
Last month, Renong, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, and the
Indonesia state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia agreed to set up a Dollars 100m
venture capital fund in Indonesia. Its aim is to help medium-sized
industries in that country and promote links with their Malaysian
counterparts. Again, the deal is supported by both governments.
Renong has close links to Malaysia's United Malays National Organisation,
the dominant political party in Malaysia, while Bank Rakyat is one of
Indonesia's largest banks, with assets of about Dollars 12bn.
'We encourage investment from the east and west in our countries,' says Dr
Mahathir, 'but we should also promote investments and co-operation between
neighbouring countries.'
