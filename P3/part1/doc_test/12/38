NEGOTIATIONS ON a new tropical timber accord to replace the 1983 United
Nations agreement begin next week in Geneva amid strong pressure from
environmental groups for tougher rules on forest conservation.
The 51 members of the International Tropical Timber Agreement - who account
for virtually all the Dollars 7.5bn world tropical timber trade  - will also
discuss a controversial demand from producing countries that non-tropical
timber be included in the successor accord. This idea has already been
rejected by consumer nations.
Producers will in addition be pressing rich nations to share the burden of
tropical forest conservation by increasing financial assistance and
facilitating technology transfer.
The four-day meeting, which ends on April 16, is not expected to resolve the
main differences between the two sides. The UN Conference on Trade and
Development has already scheduled a further negotiating session in Geneva
for June 21-25.
The 1983 tropical timber accord, which came into force in 1985, is due to
expire at the end of March 1994. Its 23 producing members, the biggest being
Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, represent about 89 per cent of the world's
tropical forests and about the same proportion of world exports of tropical
timber by volume.
Japan and the European Community are by far the biggest importers among the
28 consumer members, which account for about 80 per cent of tropical timber
imports.
The 1983 agreement aims to ensure that the economic use of tropical timber
is balanced with conservation efforts and environmental needs. But
environmentalists complain that the International Tropical Timber
Organisation, which administers the pact, has failed to stop large-scale
forest destruction and degradation. For their part, producers say the ITTO
has been of little help in promoting sustainable forest development.
Initially, the main function of the Yokohama-based organisation was seen as
promoting research and development projects related to forest management,
exploitation and economic and market information. By the end of last year,
the ITTO's council had approved 179 projects worth Dollars 150m.
But in the past two to three years, the ITTO has paid more attention to
environmental issues. Its 1990 action plan includes giving priority to
arresting the decline and degradation of tropical forests, and in 1991
members committed themselves to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical
timber exports will come from sustainably managed forests. The ITTO has also
issued guidelines on sustainable forest management and the conservation of
biological diversity in tropical forests.
