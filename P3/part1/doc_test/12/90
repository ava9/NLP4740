incidents have served as a reminder of growing religious power

THE normally peaceful life of southern Thailand, where gilded Buddhist
temples give way to the domes and minarets of mosques amid the rice fields
and rubber plantations, has been rudely disrupted since the beginning of
last month by a series of violent incidents.
They include an ambush that killed two soldiers, an attack on a train in
which a woman died, the throwing of a grenade into a Buddhist temple and
co-ordinated arson attempts on 35 schools.
There is no doubting the seriousness of the attacks, but there is little
agreement about who is to blame.
Thai Moslems say at least some of the incidents have more to do with
domestic Thai politics than with religion, but they have served as an
unwelcome reminder to South-East Asia's secular governments of the growing
power of Islam in the region.
The mood in Thailand's south, in the fundamentalist-led Malaysian state of
Kelantan over the border and in the nearby Indonesian territory of Aceh give
the lie to the conventional wisdom that South-East Asian Moslems practise a
'milder' form of Islam than their co-religionists in the Middle East.
In reality South-East Asia's 200m Moslems are as diverse in their beliefs as
Moslems are in the Arab world or Christians are in Europe.
South-East Asian Moslems include the mystics of Java, the Cham fisherfolk of
Cambodia, and the Libyan-trained guerrillas of the Moro National Liberation
Front in the southern Philippines. The largest populations are in Indonesia
 -the biggest Moslem country in the world  - and Malaysia.
Government officials and businessmen have often said that Islamic
fundamentalism in South-East Asia peaked at the time of the late Ayatollah
Khomeini's control of Iran in the 1980s and has since declined under the
influence of industrialisation and increasing wealth.
But Moslem radicals themselves - and their liberal and feminist opponents -
disagree.
Some Moslems say that Islam is growing stronger because economic growth has
benefited only a privileged minority, and because Islam is a peaceful force
for democracy in conflict with auto-cratic governments. They deplore the
impact of imported western television programmes on Moslem morals.
The killing of Moslems in Bosnia, the Israeli bombardment of Moslem villages
in southern Lebanon, and the persecution of Moslems by the Burmese military
government have also angered Asian Moslems.
'Islam is a growing strength in this part of the world because they
(Moslems) were so frustrated with the past and present system that dominates
them,' said Mr Subky Abdul-Latif, an executive committee member of the Parti
Islam se-Malaysia (PAS), the fundamentalist Malaysian opposition party.
'Moslems are being suppressed all over the world.'
PAS, which has controlled the state government of Kelantan on the Thai
border in a coalition with another Malay party since the 1990 elections, is
attempting to introduce sharia law for all the inhabitants of the state
although this would appear to contravene the Malaysian constitution's
guarantee of religious free-dom.
Thai military officers have accused PAS of harbouring separatist guerrillas
from Thailand in Kelantan. PAS says - ambiguously - that it respects the
international border. 'We don't want to interfere, but we don't want them to
bully the Moslems there,' said Mr Abdul-Latif.
Malaysia's neighbour Indonesia, meanwhile, has long used brutal methods in
its attempts to suppress an Islamic separatist rebellion in Aceh on the
northern tip of Sumatra. According to Amnesty International, the human
rights group, Indonesian troops have summarily killed about 2,000 civilians
there.
On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems attacked several Christian
churches and homes in November and December last year, apparently in
response to a rise in Christian fundamentalist proselytising.
The Indonesian and Malaysian governments, perceiving the growth of Islamic
influence, have - at the same time as trying to crush their opponents or
defeat them politically - attempted to co-opt fundamentalist Moslems by
becoming more Islamic themselves.
President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, have each established Moslem organisations to promote Islam as
something compatible with the technological, social and economic development
they are pursuing.
Both governments are encouraging the development of 'interest-free' Islamic
banking in parallel with conventional banking practices. Only last month,
Malaysian officials said they expected all financial institutions in the
country to offer some kind of Islamic service within a year.
In Kuala Lumpur these days, it is more common than it used to be to see
women wearing Islamic headgear covering their hair and shoulders. Malaysian
Moslems can be, and occasionally are, punished under state sharia laws for
drinking alcohol or for being in close company with someone of the opposite
sex (excluding relatives); even government officials opposed to PAS say they
want to increase the authority of the sharia courts.
The Malaysian capital is still a lively, cosmopolitan city, but some
middle-class Moslems, not to mention the minority Christians of ethnic
Chinese origin, are worried by what they see as an emerging mood of Islamic
orthodoxy.
Although there is little sign of separatist fervour among Thai Moslems, who
are the majority in the south but make up only 4 per cent of Thailand's
population, they resent what they regard as Buddhist domination of their
lives, especially in education.
Islam has grown stronger over the last decade, and devout Thai Moslems say
they want primary as well as secondary school girl pupils to wear the modest
attire known as hijab. They would like an end to compulsory Thai dancing
lessons and factory workers to be allowed time off to pray. And they say
Moslems should have the chance to use Islamic financial institutions.
