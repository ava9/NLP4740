  [Summary from poor reception] "A new era has been forged in 
economic cooperation between Malaysia and Indonesia. This 
follows the highly professional visit of Deputy Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim to Jakarta recently. A record 12 
memoranda of understanding were signed between both governments 
and respective private sectors." 
  The high-level business trip was intended to set up a joint 
venture company called Malindo. The joint venture will help 
identify small- and medium-scale industries in Indonesia. The 
venture is meaningful because it will promote closer ties 
between the private sector in the two countries. 
  "The partnership is all the more timely and vital in view of 
ASEAN's goal to form a single market early next century. 
Malaysia's trade and investment linkages will help the two 
countries to become growth centers within ASEAN." 
  Of course, as in any business venture, problems are bound to 
crop up. The challenge is to overcome these problems and work 
for mutual benefit. There will be many rewards, including for 
the two countries' markets. There are differences in the 
business relationship between the two countries, but more 
importantly there are great similarities. It is encouraging to 
see that a memorandum of understanding was signed to market the 
Proton in Indonesia. This is the national car's first entry 
into the protected Indonesian market. Indonesia should become 
involved in Malaysia's national car project by supplying auto 
components for the project. An Indonesian group and the 
manufacturer of the national car are already discussing this 
possibility. Two-way cooperation has also been extended to the 
financial sector. 
  "Malaysia has promised technical assistance in establishing 
Islamic financial and insurance system. There is much Malaysia 
can contribute in this area, as it has one of the most 
successful Islamic banking system in the world." 
  "It is also all important in a world that is increasingly 
becoming more competitive, and where developing countries seem 
to be always pushed around."
