RESENTMENT over attacks by European environmentalists on Sarawak's timber
industry bubbled over in an address by the chief minister Datuk Patinggi Tan
Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud in Kuching this week to an audience of scientists
attending a workshop on Ecology, Conservation and Management of South East
Asian Rainforests.
He asked how much accusations tallied with facts and suggested that the
'green' lobby was political rather than scientific and, at the extreme,
could being seen as a form of protectionism restricting international trade
in tropical wood products.
His views are not surprising from a minister of the Malaysian state of
Sarawak, which is 70 per cent forest covered and depends very heavily on its
timber trade for revenue. And some of the frustration stems from a lack of
international recognition of the efforts being made to improve forest
management and control.
About 54 per cent of Sarawak's forest is classified as 'permanent forest
estate' (PFE) for timber production.
In 1990 an international team of forest and environment experts put together
by the International Tropical Timber Organisation was invited to review the
forest situation in Sarawak. One of its recommendations was a reduction in
annual log production from the PFE in order to be surer of future
sustainable harvests. As a result Sarawak set out to reduce production from
the PFE from 12.2m cubic metres to 9.2m cu m in two bites each of 1.5m cu m
in 1992 and 1993.
It has not been easy to contemplate a 25 per cent drop and the state
government has had to impose quotas on logging companies during the last
four months of this year to ensure the target is reached. Some timber
companies have had to reduce production by more than 50 per cent. Forest
areas outside the PFE are not subject to such controls.
