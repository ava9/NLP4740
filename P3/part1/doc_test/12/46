  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 21 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Malaysian 
International Industry and Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz has 
ensured the presence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed at the 
next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum to be held in Indonesia in November this year. After a 
meeting with Indonesian Trade Minister S.B. Judono here Friday, 
Minister Rafidah Aziz said Prime Minister Mahathir will surely 
attend the next informal meeting of the leaders of the APEC 
member countries. 
  Like the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), both APEC and the 
East 
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) are expected to boost cooperation 
among nations, including those in the ASEAN region, she said. 
  Economic ministers of the ASEAN member countries will also 
hold a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April 1995 to discuss a long 
term program of the organization which groups Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei 
Darussalam, she said. The Kuala Lumpur meeting, according to 
Minister Rafidah Aziz, is expected to also discuss the Uruguay 
Round of GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs). ASEAN 
has a common interest in the results of the agreement, she said. 
  The Malaysian minister said that during the meeting with her 
counterpart, Trade Minister S.B. Judono, both sides agreed to 
sign an agreement on investment guarantee on Saturday (January 
22) and to amend the previous trade accord between the two 
countries. Trade relations between the two countries have been 
running smoothly so far, she said. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Judono said there is always a 
possibility 
of accelerating the implementation of the Common Effective 
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) from 15 years to 10 years as Malaysia 
has suggested. However, he said "We should first implement what 
was agreed upon by the ASEAN member countries last year and see 
how the progress is." 
  Indonesia's exports to the neighbouring country include 
tobacco, paper, vegetable oil, coal and textiles, while its 
imports among other things are steel, chemical substance and 
machinery. 
  The total value of the bilateral trade in 1992 reached about 
one billion dollars, with a deficit of 37 million US dollars for 
Indonesia. 
  During the first semester of last year, Indonesia recorded a 
trade surplus from its exports worth 326.3 million dollars to 
Malaysia, while its imports worth only 198.8 million dollars.
