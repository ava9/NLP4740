We take strong exception to the thrust of "Malaysia's Native People Feeling 
Bite of Logger's Ax" (March 19). The article is misleading and over-dramatic, 
and does not give a fair assessment of the role of the timber industry in the 
Sarawak forest or in any other tropical forest. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to recognize that native groups in all regions of the world are 
in time exposed to advanced civilization, and it is an obligation of society to 
make available to those groups the benefits of a higher standard of living. The 
Penan natives of East Malaysia are very small in number, and it is unreasonable 
to assume that they would not be exposed to the outreaches of a more modern 
society whether or not timber harvesting takes place. It is also unfair to 
downplay the economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the International Hardwood Products Assn., we object to this 
misleading slant directed at our industry. Rather, we have taken the initiative 
to promote good forestry practice and have assumed a worldwide leadership 
position to ensure the ongoing preservation of tropical forest regions wherever 
they exist.
