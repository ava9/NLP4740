  [Text] Jakarta, Dec. 10 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia have agreed to intensify cooperation in forestry 
research and exchange programme of forest experts in efforts to 
counter anti-tropical woods campaigns by developed countries. 
Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo said the 
cooperation would focus mainly on research and studies of 
tropical forests such as rattan, bamboos, and rubber. Malaysia 
and Indonesia view the cooperation very important because they 
share common problems in dealing with anti- tropical wood 
campaigns by advanced countries, he said in Surabaya, East Java 
last night. Jamaludin and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Sri 
Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, attended a dinner hosted by East Java 
Governor Basofi Sudirman in conjunction with the annual meeting 
of 38 forest experts from the two countries which is due to last 
[to] tomorrow. Jamaludin said both sides would intensify 
information exchange on tropical forest development and 
management system in efforts to confront anti-tropical wood 
campaigns sponsored by industrialised countries. We share a 
common political will with Malaysia to counter those who accuse 
developing nations of uncontrolled exploitation of tropical 
woods, he said. Such accusations are unfounded, he said, adding 
that Indonesia has always maintained a strict policy on forest 
preservation. Jamaludin said Indonesia with a large area of 
tropical forests would be playing a key role among ASEAN 
countries to counter such campaigns. The four-day meeting in 
Surabaya is the sixth such annual gathering among experts of the 
two countries.
