expansion - Regional report: the Far East

THE FAR East is becoming accustomed to being the exception to the rule.
While Japan's economy has suffered from the global recession, many countries
in Asia continue to grow at 5 to 10 per cent a year. This has led to a
burgeoning demand for pulp and paper in the region, and the industry is set
upon expansion.
A clutch of figures tells the story: Malaysia's paper industry is expected
to average 27 per cent growth between 1991-1995; Thailand's paper demand in
1990 grew 19 per cent; Indonesia's paper capacity is expected to grow by
over 30 per cent this year to 3.2m tonnes.
The far eastern picture, however, is not just one of growth, but of gradual
change, the driving force of which will be Indonesia, the world's largest
archipelago with over 13,000 islands and a 185m population.
Indonesia's forests, estimated at 144m hectares, are second only in size to
Brazil; and, with a per capita income of Dollars 600 a year, the country is
labour-competitive. Labour costs, which account for about 22 per cent of
Indonesia's total pulp production costs, are one third of Thailand's and
Malaysia's, and one tenth of Taiwan's.
However, a shortage of international capital, and a decision last year by
the government to set ceilings on offshore borrowing, has made financing
large pulp projects difficult. Officials of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper
Association, estimate that at least seven pulp projects, with a planned
total output of 1.7m tonnes, have recently been cancelled or postponed.
As Miss Sian Hansen, pulp and paper analyst at Crosby Securities, explains:
'Virgin tropical fibre-pulp has taken a tumble in price, and the plants just
couldn't be economical in this kind of world market.'
Five projects, however, with a capacity of 3.4m tonnes a year of pulp are in
the pipeline.
Sinar Mas Group, Indonesia's second largest conglomerate, is installing new
pulp plants at its Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia subsidiaries, with capacity of
about 2,600 tonnes a day, at a cost of about Dollars 1bn.
Industry officials say Barito Pacific plans a plant of 1,500-2,000 tonnes of
pulp a day in South Sumatra, to be operational by 1995, at a cost of up to
Dollars 1bn; Mr Mohamad Hasan, a wealthy logging concessionaire, is planning
a plant of similar size in East Kalimantan; and Indorayon has designs for a
1m tonne a year pulp plant in Riau province.
Mr Gus Nilo, managing director of Sinar Mas, believes Indonesia's long-term
prospects are bright, and explains that 'the issue is volume. If you cut
down all the forests in Vietnam, it would be unable to supply China.'
He estimates that only 5 per cent of Indonesia's forests need be turned into
plantations for one third of the world's pulp demand to be supplied.
Whilst Indonesia's potential in the Far East is unrivalled, it has been slow
to exploit its advantage. Miss Hansen estimates that Indonesia is at least
10 years behind Brazil in technology and the development of plantation
forests, of which only 326,000 hectares had been planted by the end 1991.
Indonesia's underlying competitive advantage makes its emergence as a key
player in the market almost inevitable. 'Korea, Taiwan and Japan have pulp
mills, but they import the wood. Their wood costs are about four times
ours,' explains Mr Nilo.
While Brazil remains the cheapest producer, Indonesia should be able to cut
costs further as more plantations come on stream, boosting productivity and
pulp quality. Miss Hansen forecasts that the typical catchment area for a
200,000-tonnes-a-year pulp mill in Indonesia will fall from a current 32,000
ha toward the 20,000 ha of Brazil.
Indonesian companies are already looking toward greater regional
integration. Sinar Mas has taken a stake in a paper mill in Ling Po, in
southern China. There are plans to invest up to Dollars 200m to expand the
plant, the pulp being supplied from Sinar Mas's Indonesian operations.
As the industry matures in the Far East, officials believe Indonesia will
capitalise on its cheap pulp production to take a greater share of the
region's growing paper market.
As with pulp, that change is likely to be gradual. In 1990, Japan's paper
and board demand totalled 28.2m tonnes, about half the region's consumption.
Indonesia is almost alone in the region in producing more paper than it
consumes, but net exports in 1991 were only 270,000 tonnes.
Although this was a fourfold increase over 1990, further high growth will be
constrained by domestic demand, a low 7.5kg in 1990, which is rising by over
10 per cent a year.
