In mid-summer, Malaysia and Singapore noticed something strange happening to
the weather. On most days a thick haze, caused mainly by forest fires in
neighbouring Indonesia, blanketed much of the Malay Peninsula. The
authorities warned of the dangers to health. There were also air traffic
control problems.
Indonesia has now admitted the extent of the damage, describing the fires as
one of the worst ecological disasters in the country's history. 'Based on
the latest reports, the current fires have covered up to 5.1m hectares,'
said Mr Djamaluddin Suryohadikusumo, Indonesian forestry minister. In recent
days, rains have doused many of the fires, but underground peat deposits
continue to burn over an area larger than the Netherlands.
Within Indonesia, arguments over the cause of the fires continue, while
Malaysia and Singapore worry about the effects of the haze. There have been
worries about health; there are concerns that recent events could do serious
damage to the multi-billion-dollar tourist industries of both countries, and
in Malaysia there have been warnings of a dip in agricultural production.
The fires are believed to have initially broken out in early August, during
a prolonged drought. At first, the Jakarta authorities did not seem
over-concerned: the smoke did not affect the main Indonesian island of Java
but blew north-west towards Singapore and Malaysia.
Mr Djamaluddin is adamant that about 90 per cent of the fires were started
by local communities who practise a slash-and-burn form of farming to clear
land for agricultural uses.
But environmental groups in Indonesia blame the fires on plantation
companies who took advantage of a prolonged dry season to burn land and
plant palm oil. They also point the finger at logging companies who, they
say, are recklessly degrading forests and leaving large amounts of
combustible debris behind.
Critics say the Indonesian government not only lacks the necessary equipment
to try to control such fires; they contend it has shown little willingness
to intervene and settle land disputes between settlers and logging
companies, thought to be one of the other causes of the fires.
A fire on Kalimantan in 1982 destroyed a similar area of rain forest. 'This
present fire ranks as the worst,' said Ms Emmy Hafild of the Indonesian
forum for the environment, a leading non-governmental organisation. 'This
will happen every time we have a long drought, because most of our forests
have been degraded.'
Environmentalists are concerned about the increasing frequency of large
forest fires in Indonesia. Apart from the big fire in 1982, serious blazes
also occurred in 1987 and 1991. Neither Malaysia or Singapore have publicly
criticised Indonesia over the fires. Malaysia has its own pollution
problems, the result of eight years of more than 8 per cent economic growth,
and is reluctant to lay all the blame on Indonesia. But there is also a
wider issue.
Indonesia is seen much as the 'big brother' of the Association of South-East
Asian nations (Asean). Asean prides itself on solving its problems through
consensus. This can mean potentially tough issues are often ignored. So far,
the only outside help accepted by Jakarta has been an offer from Singapore
to give more weather information.
