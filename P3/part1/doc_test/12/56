  [Text] Kepala Batas, Sunday [26 June] -- The Government is 
unaware of a plan by a local non-governmental organisation to 
hold a forum on East Timor in Kuala Lumpur, Foreign Minister 
Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today. 
  He emphasised that the Government was not involved and would 
not give its blessings to the organisers. 
  "Our stand on the East Timor issue is clear. It is an 
Indonesian problem and it is up to the Indonesian authorities to 
resolve it," he said. 
  Abdullah was talking to reporters after attending the Bertam 
UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch meeting which 
he heads. 
  He said the move to initiate such a forum was bound to occur 
as Malaysia practiced a democratic system that allowed freedom 
of speech. 
  "But we are hopeful it will not complicate the strong 
relationship between the two countries," he added. 
  According to the ANTARA news agency from Jakarta yesterday, 
Indonesia had expressed displeasure over the forum planned by 
the Malaysian Action Front.
