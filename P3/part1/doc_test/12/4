  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 27 (OANA-ANTARA) -- A three-day 
meeting on Ligitan and Sipadan islands started here on Wednesday 
with Indonesia urging Malaysia to respond to its arguments to 
expedite the settlement of dispute over ownership of the two 
tiny islands off Kalimantan. 
  "I hope that the response would be given at today's 
meeting," 
head of the Indonesian delegation Izhar Ibrahim said. 
  At the opening session, the Indonesian delegation also 
expressed the hope that the two countries would agree upon 
several principles of settlement which would serve as the basis 
for the settlement of the dispute in the next negotiations. 
  Izhar reminded the participants of Indonesia's stance on the 
status of the islands adopted at the first meeting in July 1992 
when the Indonesian delegation submitted documents and maps to 
back Jakarta's claim over the two islands and the Malaysian 
delegation put forward a memorandum along with supporting 
documents. 
  "The Indonesian Government has replied to the memorandum in 
February, but the Malaysian Government has not yet responded to 
the documents and maps we have submitted to the Malaysian 
delegation," said Izhar, who is the director-general of 
political affairs at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Ahmad Kamil Jaafar, who led the Malaysian delegation said 
the 
dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan was not a matter of determining 
boundaries, but rather it was related to sovereignty which 
should be evidenced with the international law. 
  Kamil, who is secretary-general of Malaysia's Foreign 
Ministry expressed his optimism that the dispute could be 
resolved amicably. 
  The row over Sipadan and Ligitan resurfaced in recent months 
after Malaysia promoted the islands as a tourist attraction, 
which sparked off criticism from the Indonesian authorities. 
  President Suharto and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed at their meeting in Langkawi, Malaysia, last July agreed 
to solve the dispute over ownership of the islands through 
negotiations. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said last 
week the dispute was a problem but it did not threaten the 
frienship between the two countces, which are both members of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  In a reply to newsmen's questions, Kamil said the 
delegations 
of the two countries were expected to enter the stage of 
negotiation at the meeting shortly after they settled problems 
relating to the exchange of documents agreed upon at the 
previous meeting. 
  In a separate occasion, Izhar said the Indonesian Government 
hoped that the meeting would enter the phase of negotiation. 
  The meeting is the second held under the scheme of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia joint working group on Sipadan and Ligitan. 
The working group was established at tha conclusion of the 
first session of the Indonesia-Malaysia joint commission in 
Kuala Lumpur in October 1991, in which the two countries agreed 
to hold negotiations aimed at solving the 25-year-old dispute.
