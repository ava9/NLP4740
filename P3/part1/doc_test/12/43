Kramat Tin Dredging, the listed subsidiary of Malaysia Mining Corporation
(MMC), plans a share swap with Artika Optima Inti (AOI) of Indonesia in a
deal estimated to be worth USDollars 145m.
Kramat will gain a 32 per cent stake in AOI, while AOI will hold about 25
per cent of Kramat.
The Kramat/AOI deal is subject to approval by both the Kuala Lumpur and
Jakarta stock exchange authorities.
MMC was once one of the world's biggest tin conglomerates but in recent
years has diversified away from mining. AOI is part of the Djajanti Group,
one of Indonesia's biggest timber companies.
Analysts say the deal allows Kramat to focus its attention on the
potentially lucrative timber industry, while giving AOI the opportunity of a
'back door' listing on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
Earlier this year AOI was refused approval for a public offering on the
Jakarta stock exchange after the Indonesian government said that the company
had failed to abide by the terms of its forestry concessions.
AOI has announced plans to build a large cement plant in eastern Indonesia.
In June PT Barito Pacific, one of Indonesia's largest companies, entered
into a complex shares and cash deal with Malaysia's Construction and
Supplies company.
Analysts said that deal, still subject to approval from the Malaysian
securities authorities, would allow Barito to raise funds on the highly
liquid Kuala Lumpur market.
