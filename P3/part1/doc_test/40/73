  [Excerpts] In 1993, Chinese researchers scored significant 
achievements in biological sciences: 
  1) Dr. Tang Jianguo and other researchers at Beijing 
University developed a genetic engineering human insulin with 
similar constituents and biological functions to natural 
insulin, by directly expressing the encoded pro-gene of human 
insulin in E. coli. The method is believed to be more 
cost-effective and more productive than the conventional methods 
using E. coli system and yeast system. 
  2) Ten new proteins were designed and synthesized by 
researchers at the Department of Chemistry of Beijing 
University. First the researchers designed and synthesized 10 
templates of these peptides including polypeptide segments 
having completely new sequences, branch-shaped hexopeptides, 
linear dodecapeptides, and cyclic dodecapeptides. The templates 
were then used to synthesize six new tetraspiral proteins 
containing 54, 60, 70, and 76 amino acid residues respectively. 
All proteins synthesized in this laboratory are not naturally 
found. 
  3) The CAS Institute of Biophysics launched a project on 
``Three Dimensional Structure and Functions Research of 
Phycoerythrin,'' and successfully obtained the 5 Angstroms 
resolution structure of phycoerythrin crystal. It is the protein 
research project on third large protein conducted by Chinese 
researchers using multi-paired isomorphism replacement method 
following insulin and trichosanthes protein research. Research 
work on phycoerythrin structure is believed to be much harder, 
because of large molecular weight of phycoerythrin (260,000 
Dalton), which is about 45 times of insulin molecule and 10 
times of trichosanthes molecule. 
  4) Dr. Lu Fengmin at the Harbin Medical University developed 
a new method to research anticancer gene to stop the spread of 
cancer cells. Dr. Lu creatively uses anti-sense technique to 
research the first Chinese-isolated and cloned P[.sup]14-6[/] 
cDNA, and constructs the first P[.sup]14-6[/] cDNA antisense 
RNA clone. Through transfection, antisense RNA can cleverly 
block the expression of homologous genes in cells and stop the 
homologous genes' biological activity, which in turn inhibits 
transformation of normal cells into malignant cells.
