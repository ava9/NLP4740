Utah researchers have shown that the gene that causes neurofibromatosis belongs 
to a family of genes that suppress tumor formation. The new discovery, reported 
last week in the journal Cell, indicates that research on the gene will provide 
not only information useful for treating neurofibromatosis but also new 
insights into the mechanisms by which cancer occurs.

Neurofibromatosis is the most common nervous system defect caused by a single 
gene defect. It affects one out of every 3,500 people, causing symptoms that 
range from brownish skin lesions to massive, deforming tumors called 
neurofibromas, seizures and fatal tumors of the nervous system.

The identification and cloning of the gene that causes the disorder was 
reported barely three weeks ago. "We didn't expect to have the protein produced 
by the gene for another 12 to 24 months," said Peter Bellerman of the National 
Neurofibromatosis Foundation. "Now we have it. It's a tremendous leap forward."

Geneticist Ray White and his colleagues at the University of Utah found that 
the protein produced by the gene suppresses the activity of certain oncogenes 
-- naturally occurring genes that lead to cancer. Knowing its identity, he 
predicted, would allow researchers to synthesize chemicals that could both 
block tumor formation and prevent the growth of neurofibromas.
