Fruit Fly is a tiny brown creature with bulging polyhedral eyes. He doesn't 
like dirt. If a microscopic piece of mold clings to his back, a pair of bristly 
legs swivel around and push it off. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pristine simplicity to Fruit Fly, Edward Lewis says. The insect is 
clean, disease-free and, in its normal form, an exact replica of all of its 
relatives. "There isn't that crazy variability that you see in some creatures," 
the Caltech biology professor says. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 71, has been studying common fruit flies, mainstays of genetics 
laboratories, precisely because of that consistency in form, for more than 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A short, unassuming man with neatly clipped white hair, Lewis is one of perhaps 
100 microbiologists and geneticists around the world -- popularly known as the 
"Lords of the Flies" -- who have made Drosophila melanogaster their life's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Sound ridiculously esoteric? Hardly. The tiny flies, about an eighth of an inch 
long when they're fully developed, are providing answers to some of the big 
questions about organic development: How does a blip-like aggregation of cells 
develop into a complicated organism, with eyes, gonads, a nervous system and 
the rest? What can go wrong? What causes cancer or birth defects? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preeminent 'Lord' 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' little flies (you've seen them swarming around overripe bananas) have 
been providing the stuff with which to delve deep into the peculiar chemistry 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who is widely acknowledged as one of the preeminent "Lords," was 
recently elected to the Royal Society of London (Isaac Newton was an early 
president). His speculations 30 years ago about the existence of clusters of 
developmental genes, forming a kind of "command center" to direct other genes, 
helped set the agenda for recent genetics research, some of his colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis usually speaks in the sober, measured tones befitting an internationally 
recognized scientist, with digressions about the "ultrabithorax gene" or the 
roentgens produced by background radiation. (A roentgen is a measurement of 
radiation named for the discoverer of X-rays, Wilhelm K. Roentgen.) Even his 
colleagues can stumble trying to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis can be downright rhapsodic when he talks about his flies. 
</P>
<P>
On the third floor of Caltech's Kerckhoff Hall is a refrigerated room, 
maintained at 68 degrees Fahrenheit, with shelves brimming with jars, like 
small milk bottles. There are about 8,000 of them in the "Cold Room," and they 
hold a revolving population of about 2 million flies. 
</P>
<P>
Drosophila is a perfect laboratory specimen, says Lewis. "They keep themselves 
scrupulously clean," he said. "They acquire no known diseases. All of your 
(fruit flies) can't get wiped out at once by some sickness. That's happened 
with mice, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Even more important for the geneticist is the flies' lack of individual 
differentiation. "There is a real 'normal animal,' " said Lewis. With more 
complicated laboratory specimens, individual differentiation makes it difficult 
to say what is really normal. The point is that geneticists and microbiologists 
learn about the normal by studying the abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly event in the basement of Kerckhoff Hall is the mutating of male flies 
with X-rays. About 30 of them at a time are etherized and packed into a 
gelatinous container, like a big vitamin capsule, and zapped with X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"We give them a dose which would kill a human being outright," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The resilient fruit flies' bodies come through almost unscathed. But their 
chromosomes, the coded genetic material that dictates the form of their 
offspring, are often disrupted by errant electrons. Chances are that the sons 
and daughters of those irradiated male flies (which are bred with virgin 
females) will be mutants. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cold Room, there are jars full of flies with legs growing out of their 
heads where antennae should be, eyes without pigment or extra sets of wings. 
These are the freaks that provide signposts to the essence of the normal. 
</P>
<P>
"What the geneticist has to do is use mutation to figure out the normal," said 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Techniques 
</P>
<P>
Comparing normal and abnormal specimens, Lewis and his post doctoral fellow Sue 
Celniker have mapped specific genes on oversized chromosomes from the flies' 
salivary glands. Using new chemical techniques, they have begun to identify the 
specific proteins that carry developmental messages to embryonic cells. 
</P>
<P>
The pristine simplicity of Fruit Fly has yielded some intriguingly simple 
truths about the development of an organism, Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
"There are clusters of genes on the chromosomes lined up in the same order as 
the flies themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if you could "read" particular clusters of genes strung out 
along a chromosome, they would spell out the body of Fruit Fly, in the sequence 
in which it normally develops: head, abdomen, thorax. After one segment 
develops in its embryonic state, the associated developmental cluster turns 
itself off (or switches modes) and flips on the next one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Developments 
</P>
<P>
Disrupt the process, however, as with an X-ray-induced mutation, and a peculiar 
thing happens. Development gets stuck in a particular mode. Thus, the wing 
segment, for example, repeats itself, giving Fruit Fly multiple sets of wings 
instead of the normal pair. 
</P>
<P>
The wider significance of the odd behavior of fly chromosomes is the possible 
link between cancer (in which cells replicate themselves irrationally) and 
genetic defects. "Cancer is really a return to the embryonic cell state," said 
Lewis, "with cells that aren't under master regulatory control." 
</P>
<P>
Other geneticists have actually isolated a cluster of cells that appear to 
serve as the developing organism's command center, turning developmental genes 
on and off at precisely the right moments. The same cluster, called the "homeo 
box" (from the Greek homeotic, meaning similar) has been found in fruit flies, 
frogs, mice and humans. 
</P>
<P>
An amazing discovery, says Lewis. "It shows (humans and lower life forms) have 
a common ancestor, going back more than 500 million years." Twenty-nine years 
ago Lewis predicted the eventual discovery of the master regulatory genes, 
which dictate the course of development from embryo to mature organism. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis compares the homeo box to a computer on a modern fighter plane, keeping 
the speeding machine stable and flying in a straight line. "The master control 
regulates all the parts," he said. "There's a core of information sitting 
there, like the genes in the homeo box." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Homeo Madness' 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, the homeo box has been the hottest thing in genetics. 
Its discovery has started a wave of "homeo madness," as one journal put it, 
with one scientist after another weighing in with new findings. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure yet what happens when there are disruptions of the homeo box. 
"But there are all sorts of problems due to slight losses (in genetic 
material)," said Lewis, citing the recent discovery that cystic fibrosis occurs 
because of the absence of just three of 250,000 chemicals composing one human 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' obsession with Fruit Fly began when he was a teen-ager in Wilkes Barre, 
Pa. "There was an advertisement in Science magazine saying that you could buy 
fly cultures," he said. By the time he and a fellow student began growing their 
own flies in the high school biology lab, they had both read "The Biological 
Basis of Human Nature," by Herbert Spencer Jennings, and they were brimming 
with new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Why the passionate interest? "I think it was that you could, with a few 
symbols, express how things are inherited," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work of Predecessors 
</P>
<P>
He went to the University of Minnesota -- "It was a big university that didn't 
charge much money for out-of-state students" -- and got his doctorate from 
Caltech in 1942. He has been a fixture at the institute ever since, carrying on 
the Drosophila work of his predecessors at Caltech, Thomas Hunt Morgan and 
Alfred H. Sturtevant. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis retired from teaching last year. But he's not about to stop his research, 
he says. When he talks about recent developments in genetics, there's still a 
whiff of youthful enthusiasm, reminiscent of the high school student from 
Pennsylvania. "Amazing," he says frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wrote that the newly discovered developmental genes that Lewis and 
colleagues are studying represent the Rosetta Stone of organic development. 
True? "A nice expression," Lewis said cautiously, switching from artist to 
scientist. "It sort of gives you the idea."
