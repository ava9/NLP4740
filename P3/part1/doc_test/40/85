In a finding that could help in the development of an AIDS vaccine, researchers 
for the first time have immunized monkeys against infection by a distant 
relative of the AIDS virus that causes a rare form of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The virus used in the vaccine, HTLV-1, has also been linked to multiple 
sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain other rare neurological 
conditions, and is endemic among intravenous drug users in certain eastern 
urban areas such as New York City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Virus 
</P>
<P>
The HTLV-1 virus is spread by the exchange of body fluids in the same fashion 
as the AIDS virus, and federal officials last year estimated that 2,800 people 
could be infected with it each year as a result of blood transfusions. During 
the last two months, the American Red Cross began screening all donated blood 
for the presence of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Insights gained in the current research, which was done at Ohio State 
University, may show researchers which components of the AIDS virus must be 
present in a vaccine, according to Ohio State pathobiologist Richard G. Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen estimated that at least three years of further studies will be required 
before the vaccine can be tested in human beings. 
</P>
<P>
The Olsen group's research is "simply fascinating," said neurologist Steven J. 
Greenberg of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. "I think it is 
going to be a source of great excitement in the neurological and virological 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotrophic virus-1), discovered in the early 1980s by 
virologist Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, is a member of an 
unusual family of viruses called retroviruses. Unlike most disease-producing 
viruses, whose genetic information is contained in the form of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) like that found in all animal and human cells, retroviruses encode 
their genetic information in ribonucleic acid (RNA). 
</P>
<P>
When a retrovirus infects a cell, a special viral enzyme must convert the RNA 
information into DNA before the virus can reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of the Same Type 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus is also a retrovirus, as is the feline leukemia virus, which is 
the No. 1 killer of domestic cats in the United States. Olsen and his 
colleagues previously developed a vaccine against the feline leukemia virus 
that is now widely used to protect pets, and they used the same technique to 
develop the HTLV-1 vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
HTLV-1 has been shown to cause adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, which are 
rare in the United States but are more common in Japan, Central Africa and the 
Caribbean basin. In January, Greenberg and a group from the Wistar Institute in 
Philadelphia reported independently that they had found traces of HTLV-1 or a 
virus very much like it in many patients with multiple sclerosis, a chronic 
disease of the central nervous system that afflicts about 250,000 people in the 
U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen has found traces of the virus in patients with lupus, an autoimmune 
disorder in which the victims' immune systems attack their connective tissues 
and internal organs. The virus has also been linked to exotic disorders, such 
as tropical spastic paraparesis, in which nerves on the limbs become paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen's vaccine does not contain the virus itself, but proteins that are 
secreted by HTLV-1-infected animal cells that are grown in the laboratory. The 
proteins he uses are precursors of the viral proteins -- that is, large 
proteins that must be trimmed by cellular machinery before they can be 
incorporated into viruses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Immune Response 
</P>
<P>
In the development of the feline leukemia virus, Olsen found that these 
precursor proteins produce a greater immune response than the viral proteins 
themselves and are less likely to produce harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the cat vaccine and the HTLV-1 vaccine, furthermore, contained proteins 
from both the outer coating of the virus particle and the inner core. That is 
an important finding, Olsen argued, because most potential AIDS vaccines now 
being studied use only one type of protein or the other, and are thus less 
likely to be effective. "More than one protein is going to be necessary" for an 
AIDS vaccine, he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen injected nine macaque monkeys with the vaccine, then inoculated them and 
five nonvaccinated monkeys with STLV-1, a virtually identical monkey equivalent 
of HTLV-1. (The researchers used STLV-1 to ensure that the vaccination had not 
simply stimulated immunity to human products.) 
</P>
<P>
The unvaccinated animals, he reported at a recent meeting on retroviruses, all 
became persistently infected with the virus, showing virus activity in their 
white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitored for Two Years 
</P>
<P>
But white blood cells from the nine vaccinated monkeys showed no evidence of 
viral activity, suggesting that the vaccine protected them from the virus. Some 
of the monkeys have been monitored for as long as two years without any traces 
of infection. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg and others have cautioned that further studies are necessary because 
HTLV-1 can insert its genetic information into the host cell's genes and remain 
hidden for two to four decades before triggering an active infection. Olsen 
agrees, and is now using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search 
for the viral genes in white blood cells from the vaccinated monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hematologist Irvin S. Y. Chen warned that Olsen will have to conclusively 
demonstrate the safety of the vaccine before it can be tested in humans. Only 
about 1% of people infected by the virus actually develop disease, he said, so 
a vaccine would have to have a very low incidence of side effects to justify 
using it.
