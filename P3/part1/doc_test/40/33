<P>
Scientists researching melanoma reported Thursday that they have found a gene 
responsible for a hereditary form of the deadly skin cancer associated with 
abnormal skin moles. 
</P>
<P>
The gene is associated with dysplastic nevi, larger-than-normal moles that 
change color or shape and are prone to becoming cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 12% of cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma occur in people whose 
families are also prone to the cancer and usually in association with the 
abnormal moles. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, headed by Sherri Bale of the National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Md., located the gene in members of six families susceptible to 
melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
Using molecular genetic techniques and gene linkage analyses, the scientists 
found the gene near the end of the upper arm of chromosome 1 -- the largest of 
the 46 chromosomes in human beings.
