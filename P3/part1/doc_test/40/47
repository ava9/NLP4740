Although the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease has been known for 
more than 30 years, researchers have not been able to develop an effective 
therapy for the disease, which strikes one in 400 blacks born in the United 
States. When the oxygen content of blood from individuals with the disease 
falls below normal levels, as from exercise, red blood cells become deformed 
and impair circulation, causing damage to organs. 
</P>
<P>
One problem in developing potential therapies is that researchers had never 
been able to produce the disease in animals to provide a testing ground. 
Molecular biologists from the Universities of Alabama, Pennsylvania and 
Washington reported last week in Science, however, that they used genetic 
engineering to produce mice with sickle cell disease. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers inserted the defective human gene for hemoglobin (the 
oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells) into mice, where the gene 
produced human hemoglobin. These animals were then cross-bred with mice who 
normally produce inadequate quantities of mouse hemoglobin. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the red blood cells in the resultant mice contained the 
defective hemoglobin, and these cells sickle when their oxygen content is 
reduced. The researchers are studying the long-term effects of such sickling in 
the animals.
