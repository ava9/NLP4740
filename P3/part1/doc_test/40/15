Japanese researchers have identified the defective gene that causes one form of 
xeroderma pigmentosa, an inherited disease in which sufferers are unusually 
sensitive to sunlight and are prone to light-induced skin cancer. Although many 
people carry the defective gene, only about one in 250,000 actually develops 
the disease.

<P>
There are believed to be about eight genes that cause different forms of the 
disease. A team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka of Osaka University reported in the 
British journal Nature that they isolated the gene causing the most common form 
of the disease, known as XPAC. It causes about a quarter of all cases.

<P>
The defective gene, first isolated in mice and then in humans, is thought to be 
involved in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA, the genetic blueprint 
of life -- damaged by sunlight. Earlier this year, researchers identified the 
gene that causes a rarer form of xeroderma pigmentosa, and scientists are 
currently searching for the remaining genes.
