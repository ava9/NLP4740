An inherited human disorder that causes retardation and skeletal abnormalities 
has been cured in mice by the injection of a human gene, a researcher said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The technique cannot now be used in humans, but the experiment demonstrates 
that gene replacement is feasible for treating an important group of human 
disorders, said Edward Birkenmeier of the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me. 
</P>
<P>
"It works remarkably well," Birkenmeier said. "You can completely cure the 
mice." 
</P>
<P>
The mice carried a genetic mutation like that seen in the human disorder called 
mucopolysaccharidosis type 7, or MPS-7, which occurs in about one in 25,000 
births. The seven forms of MPS are characterized by genetic defects that leave 
the body without an enzyme needed to break down and dispose of waste products. 
</P>
<P>
Birkenmeier has eliminated the symptoms of MPS-7 in afflicted mice in two ways. 
In the first, he injected the human gene into fertilized mouse eggs, which were 
then grown into healthy mice. In the second, he removed bone marrow cells from 
afflicted mice, inserted the gene into the cells, and put the cells back into 
bone marrow, where they replicated and produced the missing enzyme.
