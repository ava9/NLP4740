Researchers at La Jolla's Salk Institute have found the gene for one of the 
most sought-after chemicals in the brain, a protein that plays a key role in 
early learning and memory. 
</P>
<P>
That protein, called the glutamate receptor, is intimately involved in the 
transmission of signals from one brain cell to another and is thus crucial to 
normal functioning of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Inborn defects in the glutamate receptor can produce epilepsy, while brain 
injuries such as stroke and trauma can trigger malfunctions in the receptor 
that cause permanent brain damage. The isolation of the gene for the receptor, 
reported in today's Nature, may make possible the design of new drugs to combat 
these medical problems and, in the longer term, may lead to drugs that enhance 
memory and learning. 
</P>
<P>
"This discovery is extremely important," said neurobiologist Charles F. Stevens 
of the Yale Medical School. It is the culmination of an intense race to isolate 
and identify the receptor, he said, and the beginning of a new race to develop 
ways to take advantage of the knowledge 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to be working in their labs day and night to follow up on 
this," Stevens said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long recognized that there are four major receptor systems in 
the brain that are involved in the most rapid communications between cells. The 
receptors are all proteins that are embedded in the external membranes of the 
brain cells. When they bind to specific messenger molecules, they trigger 
chemical changes within the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the receptor systems, the so-called GABA and glycine receptors, are 
suppressive, shutting brain cells down so they don't transmit a signal. Such 
systems are involved, for example, in blocking off pain and in modulating 
muscle movements. 
</P>
<P>
The other two systems, the acetylcholinergic and glutamate receptors, are 
excitatory, stimulating a brain cell to send a message on to other brain cells, 
a process known as "firing." They are crucial in learning and memory and in 
computational and recognition processes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists had previously isolated the genes that code for the other three 
types of receptors, but the gene for the glutamate receptors has proved elusive 
-- presumably because this receptor's structure is substantially different from 
that of the other receptors. The new discovery thus means that neurologists now 
have all four types of receptors available for study and potential 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least half a dozen different types of glutamate receptors in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
One type of glutamate receptor binds very tightly to a chemical called kainic 
acid. Defects in this type of receptor cause the convulsions that characterize 
epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
Neurobiologist Stephen Heinemann and his colleagues at Salk report today that 
they have isolated and cloned the gene for the glutamate receptor that binds to 
kainic acid. They have shown that when kainic acid binds to this receptor, the 
receptor opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium ions to 
enter the cell. That influx creates an electrical potential that stimulates the 
cell to send a message on to another cell. 
</P>
<P>
Another type of glutamate receptor binds to a chemical called NMDA. This 
receptor triggers a strengthening of communication links between brain cells 
that is thought crucial to the storage of memories. The NMDA receptor is also 
the site where PCP, the street drug also known as "angel dust," binds to the 
brain to stimulate hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
The NMDA receptor also plays a crucial role in brain damage when stroke or 
trauma occurs. When the oxygen supply to brain cells is cut off by such an 
event, glutamate leaks out of the cells. Acting through the NMDA receptor, that 
overabundance of glutamate causes the cell to fire repeatedly -- to the point 
where the cell self-destructs. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies are extremely interested in learning the structure of 
the glutamate receptors, according to Heinemann, because the knowledge should 
make possible the design of drugs that could interfere with the destructive 
processes by binding to the receptor without causing the cells to fire. 
</P>
<P>
Heinemann said in a telephone interview that, with the knowledge they have 
gained about the structure of the kainic acid receptor gene, they are well 
along the way toward isolating the genes for the other glutamate receptors, 
including the NMDA receptor gene. 
</P>
<P>
Heinemann and his colleagues isolated the kainic gene and the receptor from the 
brains of rats because those animals are relatively easy to work with. Previous 
studies with the other three classes of receptors have shown that the rat 
receptors are very similar to their human counterparts, Heinemann said, and 
that information gained from them is directly applicable to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Two other groups of researchers involving scientists from Salk also report 
independently in today's Nature that they have isolated the genes for other 
brain proteins that bind kainic acid. In both cases, however, the proteins they 
observed -- one from chickens and one from frogs -- are much smaller than that 
observed by Heinemann. And in neither case does the protein appear to have a 
role in communication among brain cells, because the proteins do not cause a 
pore to open in the cell membrane. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely, Stevens said, that these two kainic-acid-binding proteins may be 
involved in previously unknown physiological reactions. But the simultaneous 
appearance of the three papers, he wrote in a commentary in Nature, suggests 
that "something about Southern California must be good for research on 
excitatory amino acids."

HOW THE GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR WORKS 
</P>
<P>
The glutamate receptor, which is involved in the learning process and memory 
formation, allows brain cells to communicate by converting a chemical signal 
into an electrical signal. 
</P>
<P>
1-When one brain cell or neuron is about to send a message to another, it 
releases a molecule of glutamate, an amino acid. 
</P>
<P>
2-The glutamate molecule binds to the glutamate receptor on the second brain 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
3-This opens a pore or gate that allows electrically charged calcium atoms to 
flow into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
4-The change in the electrical charge within the second brain cell stimulates 
it to send a message on to the next neuron in line by releasing another 
glutamate molecule.
