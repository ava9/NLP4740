A federal scientific panel Wednesday took a potentially major new step in gene 
therapy as it for the first time approved a plan to treat an illness by 
inserting new genes in patients. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental gene therapy will be used to treat a rare and almost always 
fatal childhood immune deficiency disorder. 
</P>
<P>
If the research is successful, the "potential for gene therapy could lead to a 
range of treatments for many presently incurable diseases," said Dr. W. French 
Anderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and one of the 
researchers on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Its basic importance is that it is the first step to something that could be a 
major treatment procedure over the next 10-20 years," Anderson added. He 
characterized Wednesday's approval as, "really the first step. If this is 
successful, it will lead to a second step and a third step." The treatment 
proposal was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the National 
Institutes of Health. It must now be further approved by six other panels, and 
then must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long way from being done," said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, a National 
Cancer Institute scientist who is also one of the researchers on the project. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blaese predicted that "ultimately in the next century there will be an 
infinite number of possibilities for using genes to treat disease. In the next 
decade or so, you will probably see them used in the treatment of cancer, 
hemophilia and other diseases." 
</P>
<P>
The new therapy will treat the disease adenosine deaminase deficiency. 
Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that performs an essential function in the 
immune system. Without the enzyme, the body's ability to fight infection is 
crippled. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only successful treatment for the disease is a bone marrow 
transplant from a sibling who is an identical match. However, the researchers 
hope to treat the disease by replacing the gene that makes the crucial enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have learned how to replace the gene in lymphocytes that are 
grown in tissue cultures in the lab. They thus propose to take a small amount 
of the patient's enzyme-deficient blood, then isolate the lymphocytes, or white 
cells, from the blood. The lymphocytes are then to be grown in a tissue 
culture, where they increase 1,000 fold. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the researchers will add normal genes to the white cells. Then the 
healthy white cells with the new genes will be put back into the patient. 
</P>
<P>
It is presumed that the corrected white cells will then flourish, begin 
producing the essential enzyme, and thus restore a functioning immune system. 
</P>
<P>
The therapy would not be a permanent cure, Blaese said, since the enzyme would 
be produced only as long as the genetically manipulated cells live. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how long these cells last," he said. "Some lymphocytes, however, 
can live for years." 
</P>
<P>
Adenosine deaminase deficiency is "very, very rare," Blaese said. "There are 
only 20 to 30 patients in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, genetically engineered cells were injected into a human patient for 
the first time. The federally approved experiment was designed not to use the 
genes as a therapy, however, but as marker genes to track the movement in the 
body of cancer fighting white blood cells. Blaese was also involved in that 
experiment.
