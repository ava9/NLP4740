GENE MAY INCREASE RISK OF LUNG CANCER;

A new examination of lung cancer within families suggests that an unidentified 
gene may increase a person's risk of the disease -- a finding that supports the 
theory that lung cancer, like other diseases, can result from an interaction of 
genetics and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published todaywed in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 
suggests that people with the gene are more likely than others to develop lung 
cancer relatively early in life, particularly if they smoke or are exposed to 
certain other carcinogens. Traditionally, it was thought that lung cancer 
resulted solely from environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers emphasized Tuesday that the theory remains to be proven by 
pinpointing the gene and determining how it works. The current study was based 
solely on observation of lung cancer patterns in families, not on an analysis 
of genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
"It would mean that . . . it's a disease that has many different causes," said 
Dr. Henry Rothschild, a co-author of the paper. "(If) there is a group of 
people that have a gene that makes them more susceptible . . . preventive 
measures (such as anti-smoking programs) could be taken in those people." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also stressed that smoking and other environmental factors are 
more important than genetics in lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for several decades that lung cancer can "cluster" in 
families. It is also well known that smoking and exposure to workplace 
carcinogens can cause lung cancer, although some people are believed to be more 
susceptible than others. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Center 
studied 337 families of people who had died of cancer. Many of Louisiana's 
parishes have lung cancer death rates that rank among the highest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers explored who in each family had developed cancer, at what age 
and under what conditions. Taking those factors into account, they say they 
found disease patterns consistent with accepted patterns of inheritance first 
identified by Gregor Mendel, founder of modern genetics. 
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that the gene accelerates the early onset of cancer. It 
appeared to play a significant role in cancers that developed in middle age. By 
contrast, most cancers occurring in old age were attributed to smoking alone. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how the gene might exert its effect. But epidemiologist Thomas 
A. Sellers, who headed the study, said the gene might affect the way people 
metabolize potentially carcinogenic material in cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance (of this) is that once you isolate one specific mechanism, you 
can see how that disease is caused," Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers acknowledged that it is possible his theory is wrong and that perhaps 
unidentified environmental factors are mimicking genetic patterns. But he said 
that seemed unlikely because "the genetic model fits the data so well." 
</P>
<P>
He said the group intends next to try to identify the gene through studies of 
DNA. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial accompanying the paper in the journal, George E. Bonney of 
Howard University Cancer Center said the paper provides some of "the first 
strong evidence for gene-environment-lifestyle interactions" in the development 
of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonney added, "Finding (the gene) will provide the ultimate proof of its 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, a professor of medicine and genetics at the University of 
Washington , said the study adds new information to the field of so-called 
ecogenetics -- the study of the interaction of heredity and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"If one could find out that you, and not I, are highly susceptible to the 
carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoking, you might think twice about 
smoking," he said.
