A genetic defect passed on only by mothers to their children has been linked to 
some eye disorders and a type of epilepsy and may be responsible for even more 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
By analyzing patterns of genetic inheritance among several large Georgia 
families and analyzing specific genes, Emory University scientists linked 
genetic flaws in mitochondria, the cell's energy producing bodies, to three 
inherited diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published recently in the journal Cell, the researchers linked 
mitochondrial defects to a rare disease of the central nervous system called 
myoclonic epilepsy. Its symptoms range from deafness and dementia to breathing 
difficulties and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer -- in the first discovery linking mitochondria to an inherited 
disease -- the Emory team reported it associated a mitrochondrial defect to a 
puzzling form of blindness, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. 
</P>
<P>
The Emory researchers said their discovery may be an important step toward 
diagnosis and treatment of many previously unexplained diseases of the brain, 
heart and nervous system.
