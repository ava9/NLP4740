Loss of genes that make interferon, a natural disease-fighting substance, has 
been linked with development of a form of leukemia, researchers said. The 
researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop 
the body's cells from becoming cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Chicago found an association between loss of 
the genes and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood cancer that 
is the most common form of childhood leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29% of them 
lacked the interferon genes. Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list 
of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular 
genes.

<P>
Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's immune defenses 
and controlling cell growth.
