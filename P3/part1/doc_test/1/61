The Turbulent Years My Life in Politics By Kenneth Baker Faber and Faber
Pounds 20, 498 pages
It is time to call a halt to political memoirs. This is not because of
indiscretions, of which political memoirs contain regrettably few. It is
because of excessive length, self-justification and a tendency to tedium.
When Lord Butler's The Art of the Possible was published in 1971, it ran to
274 pages. Lord Home, who had been prime minister, ran to 320 in 1976, but
the number of words to the page was smaller. Both books remain enjoyable and
informative to this day. Butler, in particular, was regarded as a model for
future writers. Lord Healey studied him closely, yet still came out with 607
pages in the Time of My Life. Lord Lawson set the record for a single volume
with his 1,119-page Memoirs of a Tory Radical earlier this year, yet at
least, like Healey, he had something to say.
Kenneth Baker's effort at 498 pages is the most egocentric book I have ever
read. One doubts if even the FT's computer could count the number of usages
of the first person singular. Even the title is a mix of the pretentious and
the banal. There have been many 'turbulent years' in British politics apart
from the 1980s, and so far as the 1980s were turbulent it was not entirely
because of Baker.
It is true that one may have underestimated his ambition to be party leader.
I had forgotten that when he became party chairman in 1989 Ladbrokes made
him the 2-1 favourite to succeed Margaret Thatcher, against 7-2 for John
Major and 4-1 for Sir Geoffrey Howe and Michael Heseltine; the political
journalist Peter Jenkins still had him as co-favourite with Heseltine almost
a year later.
It is also true that Baker has had a slightly unfortunate political career:
on the wrong side at the wrong time. He was essentially a 'Heathman'. When
Edward Heath lost the general election in February 1974, Baker felt obliged
to stay with him even though he was plainly itching to move on. He became
Heath's parliamentary private secretary, 'a rare example of a rising
politician joining a sinking ship', as he notes in his selective quotations.
The Heath attachment initially cost him dearly with Mrs Thatcher.
Advancement came slowly. It was not until 1985 that he entered the cabinet
as secretary of state for the environment. He took his place at the end of
the table, 'but with each reshuffle,' he adds, 'I moved closer to the
middle'.
It is true again that he has some achievements to his credit: the promotion
of information technology, for example. It is slightly less plausible, as he
suggests, that he was the main driving force behind the privatisation of
British Telecom and the water industry. In some areas where he was active he
left behind rather a mess: for instance, the abolition of the Greater London
Council without a successor governing body for the capital. On the community
charge or poll tax, he argues that all would have been well if his original
conditions, such as running it alongside rates, had been implemented.
He did much better at education. It is a strange fact that he was one of the
few secretaries of state in recent decades to look at the educational system
as a whole. Mrs Thatcher did not make much of a fist of it when she did the
job herself; she neglected it in her early years as prime minister. Baker at
least sought fundamental reforms and the raising of standards. He stayed for
three years (almost a Conservative record) before being moved to the party
chairmanship.
The trouble there was that while he was not a great friend of Mrs Thatcher,
he came to admire her and wanted her to stay. As a cabinet spending
minister, he claims that he was one of the few who consistently stood up to
her. This led to a certain mutual respect. By then, however, the prime
minister's days were beginning to be numbered and Baker was again riding the
wrong horse. He seems to have done this with some honour, at least according
to his memoirs: certainly he did not conspire against her, as the right-wing
of the party had thought he would.
After her fall, he became briefly home secretary, then turned down the Welsh
Office and left the government when Major won the 1992 election.
Yet the real sadness does not concern his career. It is that a man steeped
in English literature and English history should dash off such a memoir: not
much edited, not well-written and entirely without detachment. Kenneth
Baker, the former education secretary, should be ashamed of himself. One
hopes Lady Thatcher will do better.
