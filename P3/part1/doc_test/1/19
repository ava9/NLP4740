THE DOWNING STREET YEARS By Margaret Thatcher HarperCollins, Pounds 25, 914
pages
MARGARET THATCHER is a born-again Conservative in the same way that some
people are born-again Christians. She was converted by Lord Joseph, who told
her around 1974 that he had only recently become a Conservative himself. For
his first 20 years in politics, many of them at the top, he had been almost
a Fabian. Mrs Thatcher then saw the light and it never left her.
One of her first acts as prime minister was to abolish the Central Policy
Review Staff, or 'think tank', because 'a government with a firm
philosophical direction' had little time for 'detached speculations'.
There is another revealing comment in the early pages of Lady Thatcher's
memoirs. She drew a different lesson from the second world war than many of
her contemporaries, whether British or Continental, left or right. Mrs
Thatcher concluded that the war demonstrated the need for strong
nation-states. Her hostility to the European Community was there from the
start: some of it extends to personal dislike of those who think otherwise.
Detachment is not the book's strong point. It is not meant to be a mark of
disrespect to say that the volume it most reminds one of is Harold Wilson's
memoirs of his 1964-70 premiership, though without some of Wilson's
excellent set-pieces. Lord Wilson, like Thatcher, wrote rapidly after
leaving Downing Street. The impression he left of his stewardship was of
moving from one meeting, one subject, one crisis to another. Policies were
governed by events.
Lady Thatcher likes to think it was different in her period; she has not
demonstrated it. Possibly this is because the formula of the book is wrong.
After the mildly personal introduction, she simply rattles on in more or
less chronological order - from steel strike to coal strike through whatever
happened in between. At no stage is there an attempt to step back and look
at a subject as a whole: (say) British defence policy, Ireland or education.
Education indeed is the book's biggest gap, just as it was probably her
greatest failure in office. She had after all been education secretary, her
only previous cabinet post, before she became prime minister. Better
teaching, better training was essential to everything she wanted to do to
turn Britain round in the long term. Yet in the forming of her first
cabinet, the education post is not mentioned, and it is not much thereafter,
though we learn that she did once offer it to Lord Gowrie.
There is another fault in the formula. A book of over 900 pages may seem
long. In fact, it is very short to cover 11 1/2 years in Downing Street. The
result is that practically every episode is told in truncated fashion,
frequently omitting key details such as who gave advice. Many civil
servants, to whom Lady Thatcher has reason to be grateful, receive no
mention. Thus the tone becomes one of self-vindication: the message that she
was betrayed grows stronger as the book goes on.
Not all her comments are entirely accurate. I doubt if John Moore, once an
heir-apparent, would agree with her claim that he insisted on returning to
work too early after illness. He thought he was being harried back. Sir Leon
Brittan might also complain that he has been treated less than generously.
The prime minister strongly suggested there would be an early invitation to
return to the cabinet after his resignation over the Westland affair. The
suggestion has been written out of her history.
Other omissions may stem from pressure of time. It would be good to have had
more of her impressions of foreign leaders. When they come, as on Jimmy
Carter, they can be perceptive, but are desperately short. About Giulio
Andreotti she is not only short but plain rude. The foreign hero is Ronald
Reagan, whom Lady Thatcher thinks Britain failed to appreciate, but here
again one would have liked a bit more.
Lady Thatcher has always been a better speaker than writer and naturally she
required research assistance for these memoirs. Yet there are times when her
own distinctive voice comes through. For example, when she sacked Lord
Soames from the cabinet she had the impression he 'felt the natural order of
things was being violated and he was, in effect being dismissed by his
housemaid'. On former Labour leader Michael Foot she remarks: 'If I did not
think it would offend him, I would say he was a gentleman.'
These flashes, however, are rare. Many of the most savage are reserved for
Lord Howe and, to a lesser extent, Lord Lawson towards the end of the book.
Another volume is promised on her first 50 years. It should be more
interesting because less is known about the subject. One hopes that it will
also be more relaxed and less egocentric.
Lord Howe's review of Lady Thatcher's book will appear in next Saturday's
FT.
