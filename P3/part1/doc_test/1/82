attempts to create a public display of unity at conference are undermined

FRESH CRACKS appeared last night in the Conservative party's effort to
underpin Mr John Major's leadership after the disclosure of further
criticism of the prime minister by Lady Thatcher.
Despite a subsequent damage-limitation exercise, the first day of the
party's Blackpool conference was overshadowed by the leak of excerpts from
Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs revealing her less-than-flattering
opinion of Mr Major.
The furore surrounding the leak, published in the Daily Mirror, forced a
public statement last night from the former prime minister in which she
recalled that she had backed Mr Major for the leadership when she resigned
in November 1990.
The Sunday Times, which has bought the serialisation rights to the memoirs,
The Downing Street Years, last night failed in an attempt to get a High
Court injunction preventing further publication of information from the book
and this morning the Daily Mirror printed what it said were more leaked
extracts.
Lady Thatcher's statement added that she wanted to confirm 'that she would
do the thing again today and that she continues to support John Major as
leader of the party and as prime minister'. Her friends then flatly denied
reports that she had referred in the book to her successor as
'intellectually lightweight', 'politically naive' or 'small-minded'.
Beyond those phrases there was little sensational in the leaked report. But
the memoirs are understood to reflect Lady Thatcher's view - expressed
frequently to confidants - that Mr Major has failed to display firm
leadership. One senior Conservative who has seen a manuscript of the memoirs
described the report as 'exaggerated but broadly accurate'.
The row destabilised attempts by the party leadership to create a public
display of unity during what is seen as a critical week in Mr Major's
efforts to restore his political authority.
With Lady Thatcher due to arrive in Blackpool today and appear alongside Mr
Major tomorrow, senior ministers maintained a public display of indifference
to her alleged criticisms. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, led calls
for the party to bury its divisions.
But privately there was anger at Lady Thatcher's continued refusal to give
full support to her successor. Party officials said if attempts at
bridge-building failed they were determined that she rather than Mr Major
should bear the blame for any public breach.
The anxious mood of the conference was reinforced by a warning from Lord
Tebbit, a leading Eurosceptic, that support for Mr Major from the party's
right wing would depend upon him sticking to an aggressively anti-federalist
approach to Europe.
In a speech designed to prevent a renewed outbreak of the party's civil war
over Europe, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Conservatives now
had the opportunity to unite behind a policy which would defend Britain's
identity in Europe.
But the tensions below the surface were underlined by Lord Tebbit's
deliberately faint praise for Mr Major and by a warning from the party's
pro-European wing that they would not tolerate concessions to the sceptics.
Meanwhile, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was said to be determined to
keep open the option of further tax increases in his November Budget.
