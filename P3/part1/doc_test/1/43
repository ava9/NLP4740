<P>
The crowd cheered, Margaret Thatcher raised her hand in a familiar wave and 
then she was gone, out the gates of Buckingham Palace and into history. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, prime minister for more than 11 years, had formally resigned and 
returned her "letters patent" to Queen Elizabeth II and bade the monarch 
farewell in a 45-minute audience Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
She had already made her final appearance as prime minister at the House of 
Commons and said goodby to her staff at 10 Downing St., her office and 
residence, and at Conservative Party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Wishing her successor well, she declared in an emotional statement on the steps 
of 10 Downing: "It has been a tremendous privilege to serve this country as 
prime minister. Now, it is time for a new chapter to open, and I wish John 
Major all the luck in the world." 
</P>
<P>
And without further ceremony, the Thatcher era ended. 
</P>
<P>
Winning three elections in a row, Thatcher had been prime minister longer than 
any of her predecessors in this century and worked great changes across the 
whole of British society. But last week, Conservative members of Parliament, 
fearing that they would lose the next election under her leadership, forced her 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Her time had come to an end, and she came to recognize it," Norman Tebbit, one 
of her closest political advisers, commented Tuesday. "It hurt -- there is no 
denying that it hurt her -- but she recognized it and resigned. Now Margaret 
Thatcher is gone, and we have John Major as the leader of our party." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Cabinet members were speaking Tuesday of the "natural renewal of the 
party," but many British political commentators were describing it as a "palace 
coup" to remove an increasingly unpopular prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher, although described by columnists as "bitter" over her ouster, 
held her peace, apparently satisfied that Major, who already had become her 
choice as a successor, was safely installed as the party's leader and prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The gossip columnist Nigel Dempster reported that Thatcher had told her "inner 
circle" at the beginning of November that she would resign next spring after 
Major, who had been chancellor of the exchequer, had introduced a new, 
election-winning budget, complete with tax cuts and lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher "wished to hand over to Major in the most favorable conditions," 
Dempster reported in what appeared to be an attempt to put the best face on 
what had been a great humiliation for her. 
</P>
<P>
Major, she declared as she left Downing Street, "has the makings of a great 
prime minister, which I am sure he will become in a very short time." 
</P>
<P>
"She has behaved impeccably in a most appalling business," Lord St. John of 
Fawsley, another Thatcher supporter, said with admiration, and a British 
Broadcasting Corp. commentator described her as "playing the role of a tragic 
heroine with absolute aplomb." 
</P>
<P>
Since her resignation last Thursday, Thatcher has acted with such poise, in 
fact, that it seemed -- except for the brief moment Tuesday morning when she 
choked back tears outside Downing Street -- as if she had wanted all this to 
happen and had even orchestrated it. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher's tenure had ended so abruptly, so unexpectedly -- there is no 
lame-duck period of transition in British politics -- that her plans for the 
future were far from clear. Although 65, she has no intention of retiring, but 
what she will do after such a long tenure at the top is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be in the House (of Commons) tomorrow," she told reporters gathered 
outside her non-official home in the southern London suburb of Dulwich, 
recalling that she still represents the London constituency of Finchley in 
Parliament. "We have always worked. It is the only thing we know." 
</P>
<P>
At her final appearance as prime minister -- her 698th "question time" in the 
House of Commons -- she had promised that her sharp debate "will continue from 
the back benches as they have from the front." 
</P>
<P>
Former British prime ministers, however, are by political custom entitled to a 
hereditary earldom, and Thatcher has already been proposed by Burke's Peerage, 
the company that keeps track of the British nobility, as the "Countess of 
Grantham," a title that would recall her humble origins as a grocer's daughter 
in the Lincolnshire village of Grantham. 
</P>
<P>
This would entitle her to sit in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of 
Parliament, and provide her with a forum in which she can speak out regularly. 
(Her husband, Denis, would remain "Mr. Thatcher," according to Burke's, but her 
son Mark, a businessman in Texas, would become the Earl of Grantham on her 
death.) 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher advisers, including Tebbit, said she is likely to defer that honor, if 
she does accept it, until the next election rather than cause a by-election in 
which her Finchley seat in Commons might be lost to another party. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, she has arranged a temporary office at the House of Commons and 
borrowed staff to answer the more than 30,000 letters she has received, 
arriving by the sackful, since she resigned. So many flowers were received, 
more than 1,200 bouquets, that a small fleet of government trucks had to be 
mobilized to distribute them to London hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Her next priority, according to aides, will be to take up the scores of 
invitations for speeches around the world, and she will probably start with a 
trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And later she will probably write her memoirs, which London literary agents say 
could fetch as much as $12 million in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
"First, she wants to re-emerge into the world by overcoming the 'withdrawal 
symptoms' that come when you give up power," her daughter Carol, a free-lance 
journalist, said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the longer term, Thatcher is said to be considering the creation of a 
foundation, much like the one now headed by former President Jimmy Carter, that 
could serve as a base for her as well as a center to propagate Thatcherism, as 
her conservative philosophy of less government, more individual initiative and 
greater self-reliance is now known. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a large world stage for her," Tebbit commented, "and I hope that she 
will remain on it for a very long time. . . . There has never been a former 
prime minister like this one." 
</P>
<P>
There have also been some playful proposals for Thatcher -- president of the 
European Community, succeeding Jacques Delors, whom she has often criticized, 
and even governor of a European central bank, whose creation she opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's salary as an ordinary member of Parliament is the equivalent of 
$52,600, a sharp drop from the $131,700 she received as prime minister, but her 
75-year-old husband, a retired businessman, is a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The whole transition was summed up symbolically as Thatcher, no longer in the 
prime minister's black Jaguar but in a lesser bulletproof, bomb-proof 
limousine, drove out of Buckingham Palace and headed toward her home in 
Dulwich, a quiet, leafy suburb of stockbrokers, businessmen and professors, 
rather than back to Downing Street. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased four years ago, the new, $800,000, five-bedroom house has never been 
lived in. Rather, Thatcher kept it for just such a moment, recalling how former 
Prime Minister Edward Heath had to hunt for a place to live after he was ousted 
in a 1974 parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
All week long, Denis Thatcher, usually wearing an old blue cardigan, had been 
loading the family car, an equally old Ford station wagon, with suitcases and 
boxes and driving them down to Dulwich. On Monday, a big white moving van had 
taken away the rest of the Thatcher belongings -- so many, in fact, that much 
of the family furniture and personal effects were put into storage. 
</P>
<P>
The house is protected by an iron gate and high walls on three sides but is 
open on the fourth to a golf course, where Denis Thatcher hopes to spend much 
of his time. The residence will be guarded by the government's diplomatic 
protection service. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, still regarded as a target for terrorists, will have police 
bodyguards, and the government will provide her with an armored limousine. But 
Denis Thatcher, who had to sell his cherished Rolls-Royce for public relations 
reasons when his wife became prime minister, plans to buy another. 
</P>
<P>
Carol and Mark Thatcher have been helping with the moving, and Carol took on 
the task of stocking the Dulwich house with food. 
</P>
<P>
"I offered because I knew she hasn't been to the supermarket for 12 years," 
Carol recalled. "Then she said, 'Of course I have been to the supermarket -- I 
have opened enough of them.' She'll be all right."
