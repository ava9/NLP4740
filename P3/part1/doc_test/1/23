EUROPE'S ELITE MEET

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the 12 European Community countries meet in the Irish capital 
Saturday to give their formal blessing to German reunification and sort out 
some of the problems it raises for their planned economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand say 
the best course now is to move more aggressively toward full political union in 
Western Europe, and that's the line they'll be pushing in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
But they're sure to face resistance from Britain's "Iron Lady," Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher, who is fiercely protective of her country's national 
identity and who calls the idea of formal European political union "esoteric."
