It is hardly surprising that by the time Sir Bernard Ingham left 10 Downing
Street, Maggie's craggy mouthpiece was not on good terms with Sir Geoffrey
Howe, who helped to jemmy the iron lady out of power. The surprising thing
is that relations between the two men did not suffer a good while earlier,
given an incident in 1981.
Oddly enough, it is not recalled in the much publicised memoirs in which
Ingham, bulky and indispensable like the great lady's handbag, has given a
compelling if not entirely unbiased account of his days and nights in Number
10. Puffed-up media lobby correspondents with mischievous motives, and
ministers who wilfully spoke out of turn come in for considerable stick.
What happened in 1981 was that Ingham himself quickly learned, at both his
and Sir Geoffrey's expense, about the danger of making unguarded, albeit
unattributable, remarks to the 'reptiles' - to borrow Denis Thatcher's
epithet - of the parliamentary lobby.
With Britain struggling to escape recession, Ingham found himself late at
night in a Copenhagen hotel room with assorted lobby reporters topping up
tumblers and bemoaning a boring EC summit meeting bogged down by quotas on
Japanese car and video-recorder imports.
Surely, they goaded the chief press secretary, Margaret Thatcher's free
market philosophy could not embrace artificial restraints on trading? Ingham
agreed, conceding that the only reason such measures were necessary at the
time was to protect a British economy in a 'bloody awful' state.
The tabloids sobered up and splashed their front pages with the quotation,
attributed to a 'top Thatcher aide'. As if that would not have been bad
enough in itself, Sir Geoffrey who was then chancellor had just stretched
the nation's credibility by pronouncing 'we have come to the end of the
recession'.
Howe was highly unamused; Ingham a little bit wiser.
