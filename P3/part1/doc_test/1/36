THE GREEN SHOOTS had appeared at last. The end was in sight for the
Maastricht treaty. Ministers ordered champagne in the bars of Westminster.
Mr John Major decided that it was time to start rebuilding his political
authority.
For the first time in recent memory the prime minister this week had a
spring in his step. After months of living in the shadow of his party's deep
unease over the recession and its divisions over Europe, he felt confident
enough to again set out his own agenda.
Sketching his vision of Britain's future in Europe, he abandoned the ritual
genuflections to the Tory Euro-sceptics which have blurred his message since
last autumn.
He dismissed the Maastricht rebels as victims of the nostalgia of empire.
His cruel image of Lady Thatcher, once the invincible Iron Lady, was of a
phantom grandeur - 'a clanking of unusable suits of armour'. It was time for
his opponents to catch up with Britain's place in the world - and in Europe.
Last night Mr Major underlined that he has turned his back on her economic
strategy - above all on the calculated indifference to manufacturing
industry which permeated the 1980s.
There would be no return to 1970s corporatism. But this government cared
about the manufacturing base, new technology, the trade balance. No one
could imagine his predecessor telling an audience of businessmen that
'everything we do has to be supportive of you'.
Mr Major's new-found confidence rubbed off on his party at Westminster. The
hard-core opponents of Maastricht will never be won over. But among the
silent masses on the Conservative back benches there was a sense that their
leader was beginning to look again like a prime minister.
The general presumption is that the economic recovery will pick up speed
over the summer.
Even if the recent falls in the jobless total prove temporary, the
employment market may stabilise more quickly than was previously hoped.
Consumer confidence should sustain the rise in retail spending. The pick-up
in the housing market should reinforce the trend.
The completion this week in the Commons of its committee stage loosened the
shackles of the Maastricht bill. There are hurdles still to jump - Lady
Thatcher is promising a deafening onslaught from the House of Lords. But the
treaty should be ratified by late July.
So it was hardly surprising that the prime minister, who has spent most of
the past year in headlong retreat, should decide that now was the time to
declare that the tide has turned. As Mr Major toured the television studios
one cabinet minister declared: 'It can only get better.'
Perhaps. But wise souls were counselling against premature euphoria.
The shape of the economic recovery is far from certain. At present it is
being driven by consumer spending. The rest of Europe is in recession.
Unless industry heeds Mr Major's exhortations to export and invest, the
risks of an unsustainable widening of the trade gap and of another upsurge
in inflation are obvious.
In the meantime, the government must find ways to meet the toughest limits
on public spending for a decade. Cutting the health and social security
budgets and curbing spending on the police and defence will not be without
political cost.
Then there is Bosnia. The US administration seems poised to threaten
military action against Serbian forces in the former Yugoslav province.
Neither the government nor the Tory party can predict the consequences of
Britain being drawn further into the chaos in the Balkans. No one doubts
they are potentially disastrous.
But after the crises of the past year it would be churlish this week to deny
Mr Major his celebration.
