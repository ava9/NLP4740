The final stage of a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and Malaysia,
alleged to have been won by Britain in return for the promise of aid, was
negotiated privately by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, and the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher excluded officials from the final meeting on the deal in Kuala
Lumpur in September 1988 when a memorandum of understanding between the two
countries was signed, according to a businessman closely involved in trade
relations between the two countries.
'The officials were asked to leave because it was felt that they were
slowing down negotiations,' the businessman said. 'It was a race against
time for us (the UK).'
The question of whether Lady Thatcher had a role in promising aid to
Malaysia in return for the defence sales may be examined by the Commons
foreign affairs committee, which is investigating why the UK promised Pounds
234m of aid for Malaysia's Pergau Dam against the advice of Sir Timothy
Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration.
Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP who will chair the sessions examining Pergau,
said it was possible the committee would want to question Lady Thatcher
directly.
The committee is also likely to examine allegations which appear in today's
Economist magazine that the protocol on the defence package, signed in March
1988 by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained a clause that aid
would be given equal to a percentage of the value of the defence sales. Any
such clause would have breached UK government guidelines.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, disclosed last month that the
protocol included a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects
under this programme' - but he did not mention any formula determining the
value of such aid.
Lord Younger said last night that he did not remember the protocol
containing such an explicit formula. However, in June 1988 he wrote to
Malaysia saying that aid could not be linked to defence sales.
The Economist says that soon after Lord Younger's letter was sent, the
Foreign Office wrote to Malaysia reiterating that aid would nevertheless be
provided, though no mention was made of the defence sales.
The Foreign Office yesterday said that the donation of aid to Malaysia in
the late 1980s was 'strictly within the law'.
Lady Thatcher was unavailable for comment.
