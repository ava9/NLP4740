Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the government's handling of
military-related exports to Iraq reaches a crucial stage this week when it
takes evidence from Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister.
The inquiry has promised to investigate a range of areas where Lady Thatcher
may have exercised ultimate responsibility over Britain's approach to arming
Saddam Hussein's regime before the Gulf War.
For the first time the inquiry will have the chance to discover the
philosophy behind the government's stance on Iraq from the highest level. It
will also assess the extent of Lady Thatcher's personal knowledge of
decisions which allowed machine-tool exports and the sale to Iraq of other
military hardware.
The questioning of Lady Thatcher by an inquiry into her government's
policies is not unprecedented. She gave evidence to Lord Franks' inquiry
into the Falklands conflict in 1982. But on this occasion she will be
subject to questioning in public.
Lady Thatcher is expected to appear at the inquiry on Wednesday, unless the
date is hurriedly rearranged. The confined and relaxed atmosphere of the
inquiry room at Buckingham Gate has heightened security fears surrounding
her appearance.
Lord Justice Scott is anxious, however, that the inquiry should follow the
course that has been established in the previous eight months of hearings,
where questioning is led by his counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale QC.
Ms Baxendale's adversarial capabilities are likely to be tested to the full
in a day-long session of questioning.
Lady Thatcher can be expected to use this return to the political spotlight
to mount a vigorous defence of her policies.
The extent to which Ms Baxendale will be able to employ an approach that has
occasionally bordered on the inquisitorial will be watched keenly by former
political adversaries and colleagues who attempted to challenge Lady
Thatcher during her premiership.
Expectations of a rare display of drama have been raised by the pitting of
legal exactitude against political acumen in the semi-formal atmosphere of
the Scott hearings.
While Lady Thatcher's formidable style of delivery is well-known, she will
be encountering a disarmingly friendly approach from her questioner which
has previously masked an ability by Ms Baxendale to deliver pointed remarks,
usually accompanied with a broad smile.
The questioning will centre on events towards the end of Mrs Thatcher's
tenure as prime minister in November 1990, nearly four months after the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
One focus will be the extent of her knowledge of the way that Foreign Office
guidelines on exports to Iraq were changed after 1984.
She will be asked specifically whether she knowingly misled parliament in
dealing with questions on the Iraqi policy.
The hearing has already been told that ministers misled MPs in a string of
parliamentary answers, drafted by Department of Trade and Industry
officials, which denied that the government had changed its policy towards
Iraq after the 1988 ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war.
The inquiry has documents to show that in 1988 ministers changed the policy
towards Iraq, allowing the export of equipment to Iraqi arms factories. In
April 1989 Lady Thatcher explicitly denied the policy change in an answer to
Labour MP Mr Harry Cohen. The inquiry will want to know whether she was
aware of the change at the time.
Lady Thatcher will also be asked to shed light on an assertion made at an
earlier hearing by Mr Alan Barrett, a Ministry of Defence official
responsible for vetting militarily useful exports to Iraq, that she had
authorised exports that could be used for making shells and missiles.
