She may lack her former pulling power, but she still pulls a large whack.
Baroness Thatcher is currently in Brazil at the invitation of Banco Garantia
to speak at a conference on privatisation. Yesterday she was due to meet the
president and the foreign minister. But Brazil's most important government
member - finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso - cried off. He had to
stay over in the US to discuss details of Brazil's anti-inflation and debt
rescheduling plans.
But the Iron Lady still drives a hard bargain. She is understood to be
charging Pounds 120,000 for her words and, with the Brazilian cruzeiro
devaluing by 40 per cent a month because of rapid inflation, is wisely not
accepting local currency.
