<P>
Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine today announced a bid to oust 
Margaret Thatcher from the British premiership she has held for 11 years and 
rejected criticism that it was wrong to force the contest during the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57 and a self-made millionaire, said he would run against the "Iron 
Lady" in a ballot beginning Tuesday for the leadership of the ruling 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins will be prime minister. Aides said Thatcher, 65, is "determined to 
fight and win." But some politicians said she is fighting for her political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
A first ballot of elected Conservative legislators is scheduled for Tuesday, 
when Thatcher will be in Paris for a 34-nation European summit. Heseltine is 
not expected to win outright. He would need 159 of 372 votes to force a second 
ballot, if all legislators voted.
