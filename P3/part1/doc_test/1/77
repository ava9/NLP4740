<P>
In a way his recent predecessors never did, President Bush is making use of a 
unique political asset -- the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Barbara Bush -- to enthusiastic applause -- at every stop on his 
four-state fund-raising trip for Republican candidates this week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the GOP faithful in the Midwest seemed more responsive to the mention 
of Mrs. Bush's activities than they were to the President's account of the 
Soviet-American summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was Mrs. Bush's 65th birthday, giving Bush an added reason to bring up 
her name. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that Barbara were here on her birthday -- the hero of Wellesley. I'm 
very, very proud of her," he said in remarks at a luncheon here. He was 
referring to her commencement address last week at Wellesley College, where she 
had been the subject of complaints that she had been invited as speaker only 
because of her husband's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, former President Ronald Reagan's advisers sometimes felt that his 
wife, Nancy, was a liability, especially in the early years of his presidency. 
Certainly, Reagan did not keep political audiences informed of Mrs. Reagan's 
doings. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson were all active but more 
controversial first ladies. Pat Nixon and Mamie Eisenhower almost always stayed 
in the political background. 
</P>
<P>
In his speeches on behalf of GOP candidates this week, Bush took pains to 
mention that Mrs. Bush also gave her endorsement to GOP incumbents and 
challengers alike. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the GOP candidates Bush endorsed saluted his wife almost as a 
co-President, and one even quoted from her Wellesley speech. 
</P>
<P>
While opinion polls indicate that the President is enjoying unprecedented 
popularity, Mrs. Bush seems to have a universal appeal that goes beyond 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband affectionately refers to her as "the silver fox" or by a family 
nickname, "Bar," in his otherwise straight-forward political talks. 
</P>
<P>
In Des Moines on Friday morning, the President said he had spoken with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems unexcited about her 65th birthday," he said. "She's doing just 
great. And thank you for giving Barbara and me the opportunity to serve the 
greatest country on the face of the Earth," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago on Thursday night, Bush apologized for being tardy, saying he had 
been on the phone with his "birthday girl." 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher preferred to talk 
about Mrs. Bush's Wellesley speech rather than about the outcome of his summit 
talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband was touring the Midwest, the First Lady devoted part of her 
birthday to a favorite task, reading to children. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush appeared on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" and read to a dozen 
children seated around her. The story was "Leo, the Late Bloomer," about a lion 
who was slow to learn to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
The children responded with a chorus of "Happy Birthday, Mrs. Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, how'd you know?" she asked. "Who told you that secret? Thank you very, 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Mrs. Bush visited a class at Berkshire Elementary School in 
District Heights, Md., for another reading session.
