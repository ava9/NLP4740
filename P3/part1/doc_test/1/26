FOR SOME, it will be like old times. Three years after she was
unceremoniously ditched by Conservative MPs, Baroness Thatcher arrives in
Blackpool today guaranteed an ecstatic welcome and a standing ovation from
the faithful.
The party leadership is betting that her appearance on the platform
alongside Mr John Major, the prime minister, will ram home the primary
conference message - that the disunity of the last year is over. But will
it?
A highly unscientific straw poll taken in the bars and tea-rooms of the
Winter Gardens conference centre suggests that many constituency
representatives would like the former prime minister to shut up, but few
expect her to.
It also revealed something less predictable: in spite of the widespread
reporting of Lady Thatcher's private view that Mr Major is a weak prime
minister, a sizeable number of delegates think it inconceivable that she
could be disloyal to the current high command.
'I think she is too much of a politician to say anything out of line. I
don't think she is in a position to criticise John Major because he is the
leader,' said Mr Ray Richardson, a businessman from the Black Country.
'I was a great supporter of Margaret Thatcher when she was in power, but my
view is she supports the prime minister. She's got to hasn't she?
'I think the very fact that Margaret Thatcher is coming to the conference
shows her backing for John Major. She is certainly not going to criticise
him because she is a strong ally of the Conservative party and the country.'
Others were not so sure, especially when reminded of Lady Thatcher's
forthcoming memoirs and her apparent desire to promote the succession
chances of Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the
Treasury.
'I thought she would be above (disloyalty),' said Mrs Peggy Jones from
Gower. 'I don't know if she is really saying these things or if it is just
the newspapers, but if she is saying them it would be disloyal.'
She added: 'I think she should make it clear that she is standing behind
John Major. She should say that she supports his policies.'
Mr Bernard McArdle, a Blackpool councillor, was convinced that the image of
a reunited party being projected by the leadership was not a facade, and
certain that the conference would launch Mr Major on a sustained recovery.
But he thought Lady Thatcher's memoirs, to be published later this month,
would probably be less than complimentary about many Conservative
politicians, including Mr Major.
'I would expect her to be critical because she is a very critical person.
She has always been a very straightforward, honest person, and I think she
will be critical of herself as well,' he said.
'But I don't think she will be disloyal. Some people might interpret some of
the things she says as disloyal, but loyalty to the party is in her blood.'
But what about her apparent manoeuverings on behalf of Mr Portillo?
'I would not put that past her. She is the mother of the party, isn't she?
There is a motherly instinct, and she doesn't want to see it all fail. She
wants to make sure there is someone else, to her liking, to make sure it
carries on.'
The corridors of the Winter Gardens are not exactly swarming with
unreconstructed Thatcherites, but, equally, you don't have to go far to find
one.
Mrs Pamela Windsor from East Surrey said she was 'devastated' by the exit of
the former leader, and nearly 'gave up politics to take up knitting or
something'.
Mrs Windsor thinks Mr Major is 'following the wrong policies,' and believes
that Lady Thatcher should have stayed in office for at least a further five
years.
She is also one of many representatives who profess sympathy for the
rightwing MPs whose critical 'noises off' have so upset Mr Major. 'Good luck
to them,' she said.
But could Lady Thatcher not best unify the party and protect her own legacy
by giving wholehearted support to Mr Major?
'If I had been her I would have been much more spiteful. I think she has
been very restrained,' she said.
