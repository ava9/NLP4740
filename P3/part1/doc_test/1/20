FT  26 APR 91 / Observer: Poles apart
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'How did you get on with the Queen, Mr President, and what did you think of
Windsor Palace?' It was the question all had been waiting for and Poland's
Lech Walesa didn't disappoint.
'Windsor is very nice. But I'd move a few things round a bit if I lived
there. The light was too far away from the bed - and the bed was so big I
could hardly find my wife.'
And the Queen? 'Ah yes, she's like a mother. Nations like England need a
mother. We need a mother too.'
Walesa is also a great admirer of another lady with near icon status in
eastern Europe: the iron lady herself, Margaret Thatcher. The two met again
yesterday, but 'far too briefly'. So he invited the ex-premier to come back
to Poland 'for a longer talk' about her vision of politics.
He was less charmed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, who was
quoted as having raised questions about the merits of debt- forgiveness.
Walesa, whose visit has been long on ceremony but shorter on substance,
recalled that while Polish workers were struggling to get rid of communism
western banks were bankrolling the ancien regimes.
'Imagine Poland is building a car. The 50 per cent debt relief agreed by the
Paris club gives us the body. The 20 per cent added by the Americans and the
10 per cent by the French is like adding wheels to the car. Anything extra
Britain can add is welcome.'
