WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY WE MUST FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE BUSH'S RHETORIC HURTLES US TOWARD WAR, HE HAS YET TO GIVE AMERICANS 
ADEQUATE ANSWERS.

"Either he gets out of Kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by 
force and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences. He has been 
warned. Time is running out for Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Parliament on Nov. 7 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's neo-Churchillian rhetoric is getting a little cloying. While the 
fabled Desert Rats may be fine soldiers, they are outnumbered 100-1 by Iraqis. 
Americans, not Brits, are going to do the dying to validate these 
overdramatized ultimata we keep getting from 10 Downing St. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about the fate of 500,000 Kuwaitis that so tears at the heart of the 
Iron Lady who calmly deeded over to Deng Xiaoping the 7 million betrayed and 
terrified subjects of Her Majesty's Crown Colony of Hong Kong? 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush's rhetoric is hurtling us toward war, he has yet to give 
his countrymen adequate answers to the crucial questions: What vital interest 
of ours is threatened by Iraq's control of Kuwait? Why is Hussein our problem; 
why is this our war? 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was never an ally. And, unlike Syria's Hafez Assad, Hussein never blew 
up an American airliner or Marine barracks. Why, then, is Hussein's "brutal, 
naked aggression" against Kuwait a casus belli for the United States, when his 
"brutal, naked aggression" against Iran was abetted by the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Well, says the Wall Street Journal, "someone has to stop him. If you ask why it 
should be the Americans, the answer is that the Americans are the only ones who 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. Others can, but won't. Iraq is a country of only 17 million, 4 
million of whom are disloyal Kurds. Iran has 50 million; Turkey, 55 million and 
the largest army in NATO; Egypt, 55 million; Syria, 11 million, and a regime as 
brutal as Saddam Hussein's. Israel has atomic weapons. If the takeover of 
Kuwait is not reason enough for them to go to war, why is it our battle to 
fight, halfway around the world? 
</P>
<P>
As each of the old arguments for war is answered, new ones are advanced. We 
must fight, it is now said, to stop Hussein from acquiring atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If deterrence protected us from the ICBMs of Moscow, why should we fear the 
SCUD missiles of Baghdad? 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III found a new pretext: "The 
credibility of the United Nations is at stake. It's very important that when 
the United Nations takes actions -- passes resolutions and takes actions -- 
that those resolutions and actions be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
So, we Americans are to be the Hessians of the new world order. Our Marines are 
to be sent out to fight where the United Nations tells us, to punish those the 
Security Council deems deserving of slaughter. Can the secretary believe the 
American people will buy into this? 
</P>
<P>
All our Arab allies, it is said, want Hussein destroyed. Of course, the Arab 
regimes do, but, what about the Arab people? Will they cheer us? Or, will they 
come to hate and despise us, as they came to hate and despise the Israelis? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, we are moving toward war. The U.S. armored divisions are being brought 
down from Germany. Europeans and Japanese rush to Baghdad to bring their 
hostages out. Vice President Dan Quayle says that it is not enough to get 
Hussein out of Kuwait; we must strip him of his arsenal. Bush, with his "I have 
had it!" rhetoric, paints himself deeper and deeper into a corner, the only 
exit from which may be the open window marked "war." 
</P>
<P>
And, when the war starts, who will be with us to the end? And, where is the 
end? If we destroy Iraq's air force, nuclear plants and chemical weapons, can 
we then go home? Or, must we send in the tanks and drive him out of Kuwait? If 
Hussein's military-Baathist regime is standing after that, must we send the 
Marines up the bloody road to Baghdad, lest a wounded, revanchist, hate-filled 
Iraq wait to strike again? We know how the war begins -- with 2,000 air sorties 
a day. Wholesale destruction. But, how does it end? 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq is smashed, who occupies and rebuilds and defends Kuwait? How do we 
deal with the new power in the Persian Gulf, Iran? What if we learn that 
Tehran, too, is working on atomic weapons? 
</P>
<P>
Instead of looking for a pretext to get his country into war, Baker should be 
searching, hard, for some way to get his President off the hook. For, if 
America attacks, it will not be Hussein's war; it will be Bush's war. It will 
split his party, polarize his country, poison its politics, wiping out what is 
left of our position in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
For what? Does anyone think that, after we have shed all that Arab blood, our 
reward will be true peace in that cauldron of hatred they call the Middle East?
