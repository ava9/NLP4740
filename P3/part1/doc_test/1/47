BRITAIN is bracing itself for a blizzard of hype. The imminent publication
of the political memoirs of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, is
becoming a publishing and political phenomenon unparalleled in the post-war
era.
Even the hype is being hyped. Television cameras will tonight film The
Sunday Times newspaper coming off the presses. It will carry an exclusive
interview with Lady Thatcher to tout the newspaper serialisation that
precedes the worldwide publication of The Downing Street Years on October
18.
'It will be of considerable significance for the Conservative party and the
constitution,' Mr Andrew Neil, The Sunday Times editor, said of the
interview.
The interview was a consolation prize. Mr Neil wanted to begin the five-week
serialisation tomorrow - before next week's Conservative Party conference at
Blackpool. Lady Thatcher said 'no' and informed Mr Neil it was 'a
deal-breaker'. The Sunday Times decided to delay by a week the
serialisation, which Mr Neil hopes will add between 50,000 and 100,000 to
his paper's 1.27m sales. 'To the political classes, this book is the
equivalent of Andrew Morton's Princess Diana,' said Mr Neil.
Mr Eddie Bell, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins - which like The
Sunday Times is part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media empire -
began to realise he might have a phenomenon on his hands in May at a dinner
for the world of bookselling and publishing at London's Berkeley Hotel.
Lady Thatcher told the gathering, including many people with socialist or
social democrat inclinations, that she was planning to market the book with
a two-week tour of the UK followed by a two-week tour of the US. But mostly
she told them about Britain and how she wanted to see it great again.
'It was incredible. She got a 10-minute standing ovation,' said Mr Bell, who
has read the book twice. He described it as 'an absolute page-turner'.
Mr Bell's head is on the block because he has paid, it is believed, a total
of Pounds 3.5m, including serialisation rights, for the book and a sequel
about Lady Thatcher's early years.
So far the orders are as impressive as the advance. By yesterday UK
booksellers had subscribed for - that is, ordered in advance on a
sale-or-return basis - 247,000 copies. Two reprints are already complete and
another is likely before publication.
Nearly 200,000 copies have been ordered in the US. The book will be
available all over the English-speaking world by October 18 and there will
be simultaneous editions in translation in 11 countries.
The book is not a chronological account of her 1979-90 premiership, but
covers themes such as the 1982 Falklands conflict and the 1984-85 miners'
strike. The Falklands chapter is said by those who have read the book to be
particularly strong, with details of decision-making, almost
minute-by-minute, at the highest levels.
Movers and shakers in the political world expected the memoirs to be a frank
and informative read. But they did not think Mr John Major, Lady Thatcher's
successor as prime minister, needed to lose much sleep over them.
Certainly, the mood at Conservative Central Office appears relaxed. One
senior official said yesterday that since Lady Thatcher had 'made it clear'
she was not in favour of a leadership election, 'anything else she wants to
say pales into insignificance'. The memoirs would be of 'enormous historic
significance', the official said. He was not sure if Mr Major would have
time to read them.
But there is more to come. Lady Thatcher has promised to begin the second
volume - on the day she gets back from her four-week promotional and signing
tour for this one.
