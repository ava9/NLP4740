<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, leader of the "Pactists," </F>
by Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Neither With Reagan, 
Nor With the Man in the Street"] 
  [Text] The "Pactists:" Segni speaks. His ideal is not the 
Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher, neither is it former U.S. President 
Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he is convinced that efficiency 
and solidarity are not antithetical. Mario Segni is not giving 
up, because he sees plenty of room for a political force in 
opposition to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. 
  [Biello] Well Deputy Segni, the progressive front has found 
its identity. Where are the "Pactists" looking? 
  [Segni] The current objective is to create a 
liberal-democratic and reformist group, an alternative to the 
leftist group of the PDS. Therefore, I launched the Pact for 
National Rebirth, asking citizens for a million signatures. I 
explained the key points of my program clearly: those who agree 
with them can join the pact. I will never agree to place 
national unity in discussion, just as I have already said that 
the MSI [Italian Social Movement] or National Alliance is not an 
alternative to the PDS. 
  [Biello] Let us go to the economic program. What will you do 
about the budget? 
  [Segni] Spending must be reduced, but this does not mean 
destroying the social state. For many years it was said that 
efficiency and solidarity are irreconcilable; well, I want to 
build a state that is able to guarantee both requirements. For 
example, the South still needs assistance, but productive 
assistance, not welfare. 
  [Biello] Quite a challenge. Unless you are thinking about 
raising taxes. 
  [Segni] The tax burden absolutely cannot be increased, and I 
have proposed setting a 40 percent ceiling on rates. The 
obstacles that make the tax system a hindrance to development 
must be removed. And decentralization is needed that will give 
local administrations the means to govern. 
  [Biello] And the labor emergency? 
  [Segni] We must provide greater flexibility to the labor 
market, especially to facilitate entry into it, aside from 
eventual temporary departures. And we must invest in human 
capital.
