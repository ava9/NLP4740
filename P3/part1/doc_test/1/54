AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY: RIGHT AT THE CENTRE By Cecil Parkinson Weidenfeld &amp;
Nicolson Pounds 18.99 312 pages
In Lady Thatcher's Tory party Cecil (now Lord) Parkinson stood almost
exactly between Norman Tebbit and Michael Heseltine, two men with whom his
paths crossed frequently and sometimes ran together. Parkinson was better
off and more formally educated than Tebbit and therefore lacked the Tebbit
abrasiveness. But he was considerably less well off than Heseltine and
therefore lacked the latter's independence.
Parkinson was also a curious mixture of the flamboyant and the banal. It is
an exaggeration to have called this book an autobiography for, although it
has interesting parts, much of it is outstandingly dull. About half of it
consists of rather tedious accounts of what he did as a minister, the
implication being that there was little life outside the office. Those
looking for revelations will fail to find them.
There are, however, two striking sections. The first concerns his feelings
about Margaret Thatcher, whom he admired beyond the call of duty. The second
is about his early days before he chose politics. The fall of the prime
minister, as she then was, occupies the first 50 pages and must have been
one of the main reasons for writing the book.
Parkinson was one of the few cabinet ministers to support her to the end.
The others were Kenneth Baker and Peter Brooke. He quotes her as saying that
it was not the challenge of Heseltine that brought her down; it was, in her
own words, 'the cabinet'. He then proceeds to bear this out.
When Mrs Thatcher narrowly failed to win on the first ballot, the bulk of
the cabinet decided that she must go and - of equal importance - that
Heseltine should not be the successor. That was why both John Major and
Douglas Hurd were put up against him - to split the Heseltine vote.
Parkinson argues that she had almost seen it coming.
His theory goes that she was preparing yet again to create a cabinet in her
own image. She was unable to do that when she became prime minister in 1979
because she inherited too many 'consensus' rather than 'conviction'
colleagues. She started to change the balance with her first cabinet
sackings in 1981 and by bringing in people such as Parkinson and Tebbit. Yet
the new parliamentary intake goes in cycles. Many able Tories who entered
the House of Commons in 1979, such as John and Christopher Patten, were not
Thatcherites, but in due course had to be promoted on merit. The balance was
thus swinging against her until she could bring forward the more
convictionist intake of 1983, such as Francis Maude, Michael Forsyth and
Michael Portillo. Time ran out.
Parkinson is a good political analyst and one is inclined to take his theory
seriously. He was also an excellent party chairman. Compare his smooth
success in helping to win the general election of 1983 with the quarrels
that went on when the Tories won much more acrimoniously in 1987.
Perhaps his background helped. His father was a 'Bevin boy' who went down
the mines because he was too old for the war and subsequently worked on the
railways. Cecil was a young recruit to the Labour party and sometimes
attended communist rallies. Although his socialism had ebbed before he went
to Cambridge, he still tended to look down on what came to be called the
'Cambridge mafia' in the Heath, Thatcher and Major cabinets.
He was offered a place at Emmanuel College on the assumption that he would
read divinity, but switched to English literature which he read under F R
Leavis before changing again to law. Unusual for the Cambridge of the time,
he chose to go into industry and joined Metal Box. While training as an
accountant, he came across a 'tall, blond Oxford graduate called Heseltine'
who already ran his own business and seems to have terrified him.
Politics came gradually, partly by building a constituency organisation with
Tebbit. He won Enfield West in a 1970 by-election and quickly became PPS to
Heseltine.
The party chairmanship was the peak of his career. It was on the day of the
election in 1983 that he told Mrs Thatcher about his affair with Sara Keays.
He felt unable to accept the prime minister's offer of the Foreign Office as
a reward for his services and went instead to the Department of Trade and
Industry. There was one achievement: he brought about the settlement between
the Stock Exchange and the Office of Fair Trading which led to Big Bang. But
the affair and the media pursued him and he had to resign. Mrs Thatcher
showed her continuing loyalty by bringing him back later, though only to
energy and transport.
The references to Ms Keays in this book are brief. He repeats that slightly
offensive line in his public statement at the time: 'I am of course making
provision for the mother and child', and there is a singularly ungracious
reference to 'my pregnant former mistress'.
Still, many people found him attractive. The Queen approached him one day:
'They tell me you have influence with the prime minister. She must take a
proper holiday and if you will speak to her about it, so will I'
