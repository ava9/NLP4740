Who would dare cross the threshold of Maggie's Den or brace themselves for a
stiff one with The Iron Lady?
Much of British history is celebrated in pub signs; the Saracen's Head
recalls the Crusades, John of Gaunt is remembered as the Red Lion, and
Richard III as the White Boar.
So the Brewers' Society decided to ask the publicans of today for their
opinion of contemporary history. What facets of modern life did they think
likely to be commemorated on the pub signs of tomorrow? Not surprisingly, of
all the people and events that have made their marks on the 1900s, the two
nominated for similar immortality are Margaret Thatcher and the computer.
The Thatcher, in her usual fashion, dominated the political entries. Only
two others merited suggestions - Norman Lamont (Lamont's Lament) and David
Mellor (The Mellor Drama).
But The Silicon Chip, The Bit and Byte, The Computer and Mouse, et al,
according to the licensees, was likely to be honoured long after that other
phenomenon of our times, the Euro-Sceptic, was forgotten.
