EDWARD HEATH, A BIOGRAPHY By John Campbell Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20, 876
pages
Sir Edward Heath will be 77 next week. In the last words of this 876-page
biography: 'He has outlasted all his contemporaries (in the House of
Commons); and his reputation is beginning to be restored.' In the end, it is
his staying power as a politician rather than his achievements in office
that continue to astound. He was prime minister for less than four years and
left Downing Street in near ignominy after the general election of February
1974.
While hesitating to recommend a book of such length to busy people, I would
say that it is at least as interesting as a tale of the difficulties of
governing Britain as it is an account of, by any standards, a very unusual
man. Practically all the problems that can ever afflict a British
administration came together during Heath's premiership in the early 1970s.
Unemployment passed the then politically unacceptable level of 1m. The
trades unions were rampant: there was not one miners' strike, but two, the
second coinciding with the threat to oil supplies from the Middle East war
of 1973. Northern Ireland was at its worst.
In the midst of it all, Heath was working at his ambition and lasting
achievement of taking Britain into the European Community. Even that was at
least as difficult in the House of Commons as passing the treaty of
Maastricht. It was secured only by the support of the Roy Jenkins wing of
the Labour party and the insistence of Francis Pym, the chief whip, against
all Heath's natural instincts, to allow the Tories a free vote.
It will be up to historians ultimately to judge whether the Heath government
floundered because of the prime minister's peculiar temperament or whether
it was precisely his single-minded determination that allowed it to achieve
as much as it did. John Campbell, previously a biographer of F E Smith,
Lloyd George and a short on Roy Jenkins, does not presume so far, but he
offers some significant reassessments.
The first is that it is quite untrue that Heath was the forerunner of
Margaret Thatcher but betrayed the new Tory faith in the market economy by a
series of U-turns starting with the rescue of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. As
Campbell convincingly demonstrates, Heath was never much of a free market
radical. He was a Tory paternalist who had been effectively, as chief whip,
chief of staff to Harold Macmillan. He believed in regional policy, in
interventionism and in keeping the closest eye on the employment figures as
almost the single key political indicator.
The section on Selsdon Man is brief, but telling. The conference of the Tory
shadow cabinet at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970 was not especially
about economic policy; it was planned simply to bring all strands of policy
together ahead of a general election. Yet the media latched onto it. Iain
Macleod suggested telling them that it was all about law and order, which
the media fell for. It was Harold Wilson who then coined the phrase 'Selsdon
Man' - 'a lurch to the right, an atavistic desire to reverse the course of
25 years of social revolution . . . a wanton, calculated and deliberate
return to greater inequality'.
Initially, the conference may have helped the Tories because the almost
accidental publicity helped to show the country that there was an opposition
party in waiting for government. In the longer run, however, the phrase was
damaging to Heath since Selsdon Man was all that he wasn't. It represented
what he later thought about Margaret Thatcher.
Campbell's other useful reassessment is on Europe. Mythology has it that
Heath was a passionate European almost from his birth on the Kent coast.
Possibly he was, though not everyone knew it. Campbell suggests that he was
put in charge of the original, abortive negotiations with Brussels precisely
because, unlike such known Europeans as Christopher Soames, Peter
Thorneycroft and Duncan Sandys, he was thought to have an open mind.
(Incidentally, it was from that period when he was negotiating terms for
over 2,500 products that he became known as 'Grocer Heath' - nothing to do
with his relatively humble background.)
Campbell convincingly explains one more point. When Britain finally won
entry to Europe under President Pompidou, Heath believed that the country
must make a dash for growth in order to be able to keep up with its new
partners. That was the misleadingly called 'Barber boom'. It was really the
Heath boom. As Lord Barber remains reluctant to say in public, as chancellor
he was desperately worried about it, just as he was about the prices and
incomes policy espoused by Heath.
The lacuna, as it is in all books on the period, is on the detail of how and
why Heath came to call a general election on February 28 1974. If he had
held on or just possibly gone earlier, British history in the next few years
might have been very different - certainly the history of the Tory party.
For this we await Heath's own account, if it ever comes.
Luck has played a large part in his career, not always for ill. He was
fortunate to have been number two to Lord Home at the Foreign Office. Thus
he had no hesitation in supporting Home for the leadership when Macmillan
resigned. In the process his own rivals were largely eliminated, and Heath
became the natural successor. The strange unexplainable paradox is that in
1970 he won a general election he was expected to lose and in February 1974
lost when he was expected to win. Here surely is the case for fixed-term
parliaments.
There are lots of anecdotes along the way. As a boy, Heath called his dog
'Erg', after his names: Edward Richard George. Campbell forgets to tell us
what kind of dog. It is also possible that the author has a peculiar animus
against The Times. Lord Rees-Mogg, editor during the Heath years, will not
enjoy being exposed for being almost invariably wrong in his comments.
