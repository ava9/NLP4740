<P>
A diplomatic dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union deepened Monday as 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accused the Soviets of reverting to 
crude, old-style diplomatic tactics and the Kremlin ordered a sharply reduced 
British presence in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted over the weekend when Britain ordered the expulsion of 
eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists for alleged spy activities. While 
initial news of the expulsions was suppressed to avoid disturbing what has been 
acknowledged here as one of the warmest periods in Anglo-Soviet relations since 
World War II, Moscow quickly retaliated by announcing the expulsion of an 
identical list of 11 Britons. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an additional move, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that the number of Britons 
permitted to live in the Soviet Union would be reduced by 170 from a present 
level of 375 to 205, a figure he described as a quota agreed upon by the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The quota, at 205, has been radically violated, and as a reciprocal measure, 
it is stated that now we establish the quota of personnel of British 
representation at the figure of 205," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, however, Foreign Office officials said they are unware of any such 
quota and expressed confusion over Gerasimov's figure of 375. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 78 registered British staff working in the Soviet Union," a Foreign 
Office spokesman said. "We have no idea what he (Gerasimov) is talking about 
with 375." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman speculated that the figure might relate to all personnel, both 
Soviet and British, who work for British organizations or diplomatic missions 
in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion over the exact target of the latest Soviet action, 
Thatcher left little doubt about her personal reaction to developments, 
bristling with thinly controlled anger during interviews Monday with both major 
British television networks. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them the chance to say 'things have changed,' as we hoped they might 
have done," Thatcher said, referring to her government's decision to handle the 
initial expulsions discreetly. "They didn't take the chance, and they showed 
that things haven't changed as much as we had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very, very significant decision," she added. "What a pity." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a formal statement to the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary 
Geoffrey Howe justified the initial expulsion order, declaring that "the 
decision . . . was taken only after very careful consideration and on the basis 
of incontrovertible evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"The action we took was absolutely necessary for the security of the country," 
Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
No details of the Soviets' alleged activities were released. 
</P>
<P>
British officials dealing with the affair said illegal activities by the 11 
Soviets were first brought to Moscow's attention as early as last January and 
that warnings had been repeated since. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them every opportunity to . . . cease their activities," said a senior 
government official. "We didn't want this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunched With the Queen 
</P>
<P>
The present diplomatic row comes just one month after Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's visit to Britain, during which he strengthened his personal 
links with Thatcher and lunched with Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
The British monarch's acceptance of a formal invitation to visit the Soviet 
Union -- the first such invitation since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution -- 
seemed to symbolize a high point in post-World War II Anglo-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this warmth, Thatcher has consistently been among the severest critics 
of Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent dispute within the Western Alliance over how best to react to 
Gorbachev's offer to negotiate away short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, she 
has been the most strident opponent of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic political opponents Monday linked her tough stand on short-range 
weapons with the diplomatic expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) summit next week, and 
Britain is completely isolated there," said Labor Party foreign affairs 
spokesman Gerald Kaufman. "Everyone else (but Thatcher) is willing to consider 
negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear weapons at some 
point. Mrs. Thatcher is alone, and what she's doing is whipping up the Cold War 
in an effort to somehow justify her isolation." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, six months after Gorbachev took power in Moscow, Britain 
and the Soviet Union engaged in a series of expulsions that affected 31 
nationals of either country and left Anglo-Soviet relations in a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
Only 18 months later, however, Thatcher embarked on a triumphant visit to 
Moscow that established a strong personal relationship with the new Soviet 
leader and began the revival of ties between the two countries.
