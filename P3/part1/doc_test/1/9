<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, bloodied but unbowed by a bruising battle for 
leadership of her party, vowed today to fight on, but her main rival boasted 
that he is now only nine votes short of ending her political career. 
</P>
<P>
"I fight on, I fight to win," Thatcher told reporters in London on her return 
from the Paris European security summit. 
</P>
<P>
But political sources said there were signs of support ebbing from Thatcher to 
Michael Heseltine, who forced the contest for leadership of the Conservative 
Party into a second round with a strong showing in Tuesday's first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57, an ex-defense minister who resigned from his post five years ago 
in a dispute with Thatcher, said more Tory members of Parliament will switch to 
him on the second ballot, for which only a simple majority is needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten people have told us since last night that they are with us," a Heseltine 
campaign official said. "We need nine more to get us to the 187 level." 
</P>
<P>
Political sources said some influential politicians believed that Thatcher, 65 
and in office for 11 1/2 years, should be persuaded to step aside now and avoid 
the risk of a humiliating defeat that would split the party. 
</P>
<P>
But defeat was not on the "Iron Lady's" mind when she emerged from her official 
residence at No. 10 Downing St. to repeat that she is still in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher drove from Downing Street to Parliament, where she stood amid cheers 
from supporters to present her report on the Paris summit. 
</P>
<P>
Since her return from the summit, Thatcher had been closeted with party 
leaders, getting their advice on the mood among Conservative legislators after 
the inconclusive first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher won 204 first-ballot votes to Heseltine's 152 but failed by four votes 
to get the margin needed under the rules to avoid a second poll next Tuesday.
