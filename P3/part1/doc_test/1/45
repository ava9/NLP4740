FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mirror victorious over
Thatcher book

THE SUNDAY TIMES last night failed in its attempt to get a High Court
injunction to prevent the Daily Mirror from publishing further information
from Downing Street Years, Baroness Thatcher's political biography.
Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, was last night in talks with
lawyers to see whether to mount an immediate appeal. If this were to fail
there could be further Daily Mirror revelations in advance of the five-part
serialisation of the 800-page memoirs which begins in the Sunday Times this
Sunday.
Yesterday the Daily Mirror published five pages of material apparently based
on the first volume of the memoirs, to be published by HarperCollins on
October 18.
Mr Neil said yesterday: 'The Daily Mirror has done me a favour today (in
terms of publicity). I just don't want them doing me any further favours.'
The Daily Mirror coverage had very few direct quotations from the book. The
paper said, however, that Lady Thatcher thought that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, was small-minded, politically naive and an intellectual
lightweight and that she had deliberately withheld her true opinion so that
he could succeed her.
There were no quotations marks around the descriptions of Mr Major but it is
clear the Sunday Times believes the Daily Mirror either has a copy of the
book or has talked to someone who has.
The Sunday Times conceded last night that at least some of the quotes in the
Daily Mirror coverage were genuine. Lady Thatcher's statement last night
made no specific denials of any of the Mirror's claims, though it was later
said on her behalf that nowhere in the book does she describe Mr Major as
small-minded, politically naive or an intellectual lightweight.
The Daily Mirror also alleges that:
Lady Thatcher believes she was politically 'mugged' by Lord Howe, the former
deputy prime minister.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present chancellor, was, contrary to general belief,
one of the few who supported her during her leadership crisis.
On her last day in office Lady Thatcher found the door to her study locked
and the key removed from her keyring.
The Daily Mirror publication comes in spite of unprecedented security at
HarperCollins which has included a large brass lock on the office of Mr
Eddie Bell, the chief executive, and security advice from Mr John Stalker,
the former senior police officer.
The timing of the coverage in the newspaper could not have been more
politically explosive.
All the signs are that the former prime minister does have controversial
things to say in her book, which is already virtually guaranteed to be a
worldwide best seller with advance orders totalling more than 500,000.
The Sunday Times editor wanted to begin serialisation of the book last
Sunday but Lady Thatcher insisted that this should not happen until after
the party conference.
