CHOOSING THATCHERISM MINUS THATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER BECOMES THE YOUNGEST BRITISH PRIME MINISTER IN 
THIS CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It probably won't be clear for some time whether the Conservative Party has 
chosen in John Major a truly worthy successor to Margaret Thatcher, who has 
been a giant on the world stage. The truth, which has been added to over each 
of her 11 1/2 years in power, is that they don't make many like her anymore. 
</P>
<P>
With the undoubted exception of Winston Churchill she has been her country's 
greatest prime minister of this century. No one did more to reorient and 
restore a troubled and even floundering nation than the shopkeeper's daughter 
who became Britain's first woman PM. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Iron Lady is gone from the front benches of the House of Commons but, 
judging from Tuesday's vote for Major, she is hardly forgotten. Of the three 
candidates for party leader, and so for PM, Major, the chancellor of the 
Exchequer, was politically closest to Thatcher and indeed had been publicly 
endorsed by her. Thus, Thatcher succeeded in thwarting the ambitious "Tarzan" 
-- former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, whose bold challenge to her 
leadership set in motion the events that triggered her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Major may not be a Thatcher clone, but there is no doubt he was the favored 
choice of the Tory right wing, and the one least likely to break dramatically 
from her policies. This means the Tories presently intend to confront the Labor 
Party in the next general election with the benefit of all that Thatcherism has 
meant, minus the sometimes abrasive personality of the lady herself. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, this probably means a British foreign policy more or 
less to its continued likening, though Britain without Thatcher in the driver's 
seat could be less resistant to the European Community's glamorous lure. For 
John Major -- who, rare among Conservative Party leaders, never attended a 
university, and, indeed, dropped out of school at 16 -- and who once even stood 
in an unemployment line -- this is an extraordinary moment to be thrust so 
quickly into power. At 47, this son of a onetime circus performer becomes the 
youngest prime minister in this century. It is impossible not to wish a man 
well who came from these beginnings and now has achieved the pinnacle of 
British political power.
