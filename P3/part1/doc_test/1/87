FT  07 OCT 93 / Sunday Times loses appeal over memoirs

LAWYERS for The Sunday Times failed last night in their attempt to stop the
Daily Mirror publishing further material based on Lady Thatcher's
controversial memoirs, The Downing Street Years.
Three Court of Appeal judges refused to overrule two earlier decisions by a
High Court judge not to grant an injunction to The Sunday Times and the
book's publishers, HarperCollins.
Sunday Times editor Mr Andrew Neil called the decision 'crazy' and said the
judges had 'given the green light to theft and bribery on a massive scale'.
After The Sunday Times, which has bought exclusive UK serialisation rights
to the book, failed to get an injunction against the Daily Mirror on
Tuesday, the Mirror went further yesterday.
The paper claimed Lady Thatcher had lost faith in Mr John Major even when he
was chancellor and said that 'intellectually he drifted with the tide'.
According to the Mirror, which clearly has access to some contents of the
book to be published on Monday week, Lady Thatcher says Mr Major had 'a
tendency to be defeated by platitudes which I find disturbing'.
The Sunday Times returned to the High Court yesterday for a second time
seeking an injunction against the Daily Mirror but Mr Justice Forbes decided
publication was in the public interest. The Sunday Times argued that further
revelations, including material about the Falklands war, could not be
classified as of current interest.
Mr Anthony Whittaker, lawyer for The Sunday Times, said it came down to a
question of where to draw the line between the need to preserve
serialisation rights and the need to give way to the public interest in what
the book said.
At the moment the judges had all drawn the line against News International,
he said. But it was also a question of degree. How much should be published
before the balance changed, he asked.
Mr Whittaker said they would wait and see what, if anything, the Mirror
published today before deciding on the next move. It might be that they
would conclude there was very little chance of getting an injunction, in
which case the only remedy open to The Sunday Times would be to sue for
damages.
That would be an extremely long, bitter and expensive exercise, he said, as
the government had discovered when it attempted to obtain an account for
profit against The Sunday Times in the Spycatcher affair.
'It will be very sad if at the end of the day no political memoir can be
protected against the interference of the memoir thief,' he said.
The Mirror reported yesterday that Lady Thatcher was scathing about some of
her colleagues, including Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. Today's
extract includes less-than-complimentary comments about Lord Archer, Mr
Michael Heseltine, Mr Malcolm Rifkind and chief whip Mr Richard Ryder.
