HOME TECH: BOWIE CD ANNOUNCED IN PRESSED RELEASE

Savvy record publicists learned early in the compact-disc craze that the best 
way to get critics' attention was to send out a CD copy of a new album rather 
than the conventional vinyl one. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when critics still had few of the discs, writers were so caught up 
with the excellent CD sound quality that they tended to listen to almost 
anything that came their way in the format. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rykodisc -- the Massachusetts record company that started in 1984 as a 
CD-only label -- has taken the "CD-tease" to an imaginative new level in media 
relations. To outline the company's ambitious plans to re-introduce David 
Bowie's pre-1981 work on CD (and vinyl and cassette), the company has mailed CD 
"press releases" to pop music writers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The standard 5-inch disc opens with a rare 1971 rendition by Bowie of Chuck 
Berry's "Round and Round." The music is followed by a three-minute announcement 
by MTV news anchorman Kurt Loder explaining that Rykodisc's Bowie campaign will 
kick off in early September with a set featuring 45 selections recorded between 
1967 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The three-disc CD set, "Sound + Vision," will contain a sampling of Bowie hits 
-- including "Changes" and "Young Americans" -- plus various rare and 
previously unreleased tracks. Expected to retail for between $50 and $60, the 
package will also contain an illustrated 72-page booklet saluting the career of 
one of the most stimulating figures of the modern pop era, an odds-on favorite 
to eventually make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The package will also contain a CD-Video disc featuring the 1980 video clip for 
Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes" single as well as three audio selections from the 
Englishman's heralded "Ziggy Stardust" tour in 1972. Rykodisc will then begin 
releasing early next year all of Bowie's pre-1981 albums, from "Space Oddity" 
to "Scary Monsters," at the rate of one or two per month. The albums will 
contain bonus tracks in many cases, perhaps all. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Anne Svingen, spokeswoman for Rykodisc, said approximately 1,000 of the 
press releases -- which cost about $2 each -- were mailed to music writers 
around the country. Members of the company's marketing department had been 
toying with a CD press release for some time and felt the flashy Bowie campaign 
would be an ideal time for one. 
</P>
<P>
CALL OF THE WILD: "Gorillas in the Mix," already in the stores from Rykodisc, 
doesn't have the commercial appeal of a Bowie album, but it is as 
unconventional as anything ever put out by the rock master of shifting personas 
and musical styles. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Krause, a San Francisco bio-acoustic researcher and former studio 
musician, has recorded animal noises and strung various combinations of them 
together via "sampling" synthesizers to make music. What you hear often sounds 
just like electric guitars or steel drums, but it's actually the animal noises 
electronically processed. 
</P>
<P>
In a good-natured track titled "Ape No Mountain High Enough," the lead rap 
vocals were taken from sounds of mountain gorillas, while the piano is from a 
dolphin. Other animals featured on the album include elephants, parrot fish, a 
walrus, coyotes and crickets.
