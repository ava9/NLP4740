WELL, caution and common sense prevailed, and the judges of the Mercury
Prize, Pounds 25,000 in readies for the creators of the best British pop
album of the year, gave the money on Wednesday night to Suede for their
eponymous album, Suede. If the Mercury wants to be the equal of the Booker
in terms of outrage it will have to do better than that. If it wants to
prove that the pop industry is as respectable and export minded as the
manufacturers of widgets it could hardly have done better.
Last year the judges of the first Mercury Prize took something of a flier
and selected Screamadelica by the Scottish group Primal Scream. It added
30,000 to the sales of their album but hardly made the band international
stars.
This year the bookies' favourite won. Suede are the brightest young British
band. They are fashionably androgynous, not to say gay, in a coyly blatant
way, with lots of nudges, and bold images, in their lyrics. They appeal to
young girls, who like the fact they resemble them, and to young boys, who
enjoy a cathartic brush with the wild side. They are the type of band that
record executives feel easy with, that they want the public to like.
This is amazingly tuneful music, in the mainstream tradition, with echoes of
everyone from David Bowie to Duran Duran, but with lyrics that make the
Rolling Stones sound like sissies. The strongest song is 'Animal Nitrate',
with its oblique druggy story line, while 'Metal Mickey' is equally tuneful
about sex.
Suede manage both hummable melodies and a louche image, which promises a
long international career. It is music for hairdressing salons and for
American arenas, and is only revolutionary in not being aimed at the dance
clubs, which have dominated the music scene for too long.
What of the other nine short listed albums? Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me
Yet, by Gavin Bryars, was the essential long shot, the bizarre album which
ensured lots of publicity for Bryars and for the Prize. Last year this role
was taken by John Tavener's The Protecting Veil, which offered some link
between the popular and the classical worlds. Bryars spiritual input,
although genuine, is more ragged than Tavener's seamless mock medievalism.
Its inspiration was the song of a street beggar and it has the impact,
powerful but upsetting, of the gutter. It grates and irritates and lingers.
Then came a group of albums which reveal individuals with their own wayward
visions edging towards the commercial. The most interesting was No
Reservation by Apache Indian. This successfully merges street sounds,
especially the obtrusive Jamaican Ragga, and its incessant hypnotic lyrics,
with the equally mesmerising Asian Bhangra music. It is a powerful mix, more
stimulating than soulful, but a good, if optimistic, vision of young urban
living and brings Indian music into the mainstream at last.
New Wave by The Auteurs is solidly student music, bed-sitter images for the
1990s stuck in the sound of the early 1970s. Here again the lyrics are worth
attention and the orchestrations are not afraid of cellos and a subtle bass
line. There is a committed intensity in New Wave and if writer-singer Luke
Harris owes something to Leonard Cohen in his vocal approach it is a
worthwhile debt.
The Mercury judges could not totally ignore current popular taste, however
debased, and hot favourites with Suede were club band Stereo MC. Connected
was the album with the hit singles, songs lapped up on the dance floor but
smooth enough for listening. There is a little rap; an easy groove; and
loads of spirit to make this the acceptable sound of the times, funky but
unlikely to scare the horses. The other main commercial challenger was New
Order. Republic shows a welcome return to form for Peter Hook's enduring
band. This is dreamy, well crafted, mature pop music.
Dina Carroll and PJ Harvey were the women candidates. Carroll's So Close is
old fashioned, American soul. It is a big voice revolving around a small
emotional circle. Rid of Me by PJ Harvey is more interesting. The voice has
a wistful intensity which you can hardly escape from, and if the songs are
despairing at least genuine depths of feeling are being plumbed.
The final two albums show up the limitations of the Mercury Prize. Both were
short- listed to satisfy contradictory and unfulfillable demands. Stan
Tracey is one of the UK's longest serving and best loved jazz musicians. His
tribute to even greater Greats, such as Ellington and Rollins, in Portraits
Plus appeals to the coterie of jazz fans and to sentimental judges. In
contrast Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales could also never win because Sting
obviously does not need Pounds 25,000, or a career boost, and you cannot
honour such an established artist without revealing a total lack of
imagination, even if his album is the probably the best group of pop songs
written in the past year. Sting would doubtless have given the Prize to a
deserving international cause. Suede, showing that they have quickly assumed
the trappings of success, gave the money to cancer charities.
