RAISING THEIR VOICES TO AID ARMENIAN ORPHANS

More than 100 show business celebrities -- from Charles Aznavour to Pia Zadora 
-- gathered in a Hollywood recording studio Sunday to do for the victims of 
last month's devasting earthquake in Soviet Armenia what pop music stars have 
done for starving Ethiopians, bankrupt American farmers and AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Although names such as Liza Minnelli, Ben Vereen, Steve Lawrence, Dionne 
Warwick and others who met to record "For You, Armenia," may be more identified 
with Las Vegas showrooms than rock 'n' roll arenas, they sang and spoke of 
their cause with equal passion. 
</P>
<P>
And passion was the principal commodity among the group -- officially dubbed 
Friend to Friend -- for their efforts to raise money and send supplies to the 
quake region are still in their earliest stages. 
</P>
<P>
A related European effort to send help is already under way, but the Americans 
have no distributor for the record cut on Sunday and no network or syndicator 
has agreed to broadcast a special based on the session. 
</P>
<P>
But the group does have Aznavour, the noted French composer whose parents were 
from Armenia. He spearheaded Sunday's effort and co-wrote the song the 
celebrities recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moved by what happened and I wanted to do it for the children, so many 
of whom are now orphans," said Aznavour. "I hope to raise enough money, 
minimum, to support the thousands of homeless children." 
</P>
<P>
Aznavour's efforts began shortly after the Dec. 7 quake. He and George 
Garvarentz composed a version of the song in French and recorded it a few weeks 
ago with a collection of European celebrities. Sales of that record raised 
enough for the relief group to send 40 tons of supplies and 10 dialysis 
machines to Armenia, Aznavour said. 
</P>
<P>
The people who gathered to make the U.S. version of the record are hoping to 
create a constant pipeline of supplies to help the quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, some of whom brought their families, began arriving around noon 
and were herded into a Paramount Pictures sound stage. Many hugged and kissed 
each other and some spoke with newspaper and TV reporters on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the day of the Lord, and what better way to let people know I care?" 
said Vereen. "We are forgetting about differences of color, language, political 
ideology, and planting a seed as brothers and sisters for a greater force. 
We're not sending bombs, but coming together through music." 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a God-given talent, you help," said Minnelli. "I'm speaking more 
in a spiritual sense than in a religious sense. When I saw the disaster in 
Armenia, I thought I was going to die. Besides, when Charles Aznavour calls and 
says you can help, you go." 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of the schoolchildren I met over in the Soviet Union and the 
devastation that's going on there now, it's such a tragedy," said "Head of the 
Class" actress Khrystyne Haje, who traveled to Moscow last year to shoot an 
episode of the ABC situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Hollywood celebrities was Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
husband of absent Jane Fonda who didn't go to the session. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been involved with a lot of things in the Legislature for Armenia 
previous to this effort, and now, with this, I think you find a solidarity 
among the people that shows we cannot forget those around us," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great that the government gets involved," said comedian Wil 
Shriner, "but really, everything starts with the people." 
</P>
<P>
After about 90 minutes of meeting and talking, record producer Michael Masser 
led the celebrities to the nearby studio to begin rehearsals of the song. 
</P>
<P>
As the group began recording, director Peter Bogdanovich was weaving his 
cameras in and out of the studio. He was shooting the planned video and TV 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, the singers were hitting their stride, belting out the 
anthem-like lyrics of the tune: 
</P>
<P>
 Your children will 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild for you ... 
</P>
<P>
 For you Armenia 
</P>
<P>
 The world is by your side 
</P>
<P>
 We know you will survive 
</P>
<P>
 We've opened our arms 
</P>
<P>
 You've opened up our hearts.
