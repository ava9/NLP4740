BOB GREENE: MY ONE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout history, it has been said that if a man accomplishes only one great 
thing during his time on Earth, then his life has been worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thought. Some men have become inspiring political leaders and have 
helped bring peace to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some men have become religious leaders and have brought a sense of spirituality 
and reverence to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some men have become brave generals and have led the forces of goodness to 
victory over the forces of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
And now, at last, I have accomplished the one great thing that justifies my 
presence on the planet -- the one great thing I will always be remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
I am the guy who is responsible for getting the comma out of the title of 
"Louie Louie." 
</P>
<P>
This monumental achievement actually took place about a year and a half ago, 
but it became official in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that last week I received a long-distance telephone call from 
John Rockwell, a music critic for the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation did not get off to the best of starts. Here is a transcript: 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell: "Hello, this is John Rockwell of the New York Times." 
</P>
<P>
Me: "I hate you." 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief silence on the other end. I explained to Rockwell that in 
1974 he had given a bad review to a book I had written. 
</P>
<P>
"I did?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you did," I said. "Not that I would be small enough to remember such a 
thing 16 years later." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure I did?" Rockwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like me to quote the bad things that you said about my book?" I 
said. "I somehow seem to have this remarkable ability to remember every word." 
</P>
<P>
We laughed heartily. Well, we laughed. Then Rockwell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I think I'm going to refer to him as "Mr. Rockwell" from this point 
on. That's New York Times style -- "Mr." I've always wanted to use it. "Mr." 
That looks nice in a newspaper. "Mr." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, then Mr. Rockwell told me he was getting ready to write an analysis of 
the song "Louie Louie," and that he needed to locate the column I had written 
about the song. 
</P>
<P>
"Louie Louie" was the 1963 record by the Kingsmen that -- in the words of Mr. 
Rockwell -- "lives on as America's primordial party anthem, the quintessential 
signature tune of rock as good-natured sloppy excess." The success of the 
Kingsmen's version of "Louie Louie" is widely attributed to the fact that many 
young people, when the record was first released, thought the Kingsmen's 
muffled lyrics were dirty. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the dignified spirit of finding out if this was true -- if "Louie 
Louie" was really a dirty song -- that in 1988, in the service of a magazine I 
was writing a column for at the time, I tracked down one Richard Berry. Richard 
Berry was not one of the Kingsmen; he was a rhythm-and-blues singer who wrote 
"Louie Louie" in 1955 and sold away the rights to it soon after. Berry told me 
that, no, the lyrics to "Louie Louie" were never dirty. He sang me the song to 
prove it. 
</P>
<P>
That is not why Mr. Rockwell was calling, however. Mr. Rockwell was calling 
because he remembered that the question of whether there was a comma between 
"Louie" and "Louie" had been addressed in the column. 
</P>
<P>
I had told Berry that the fact-checkers at the magazine I wrote for were going 
to drive him crazy unless Berry could tell me whether it was "Louie, Louie" or 
"Louie Louie." Berry said he had no idea -- he had written the lyrics to "Louie 
Louie" on a piece of toilet paper in a nightclub dressing room. "That piece of 
toilet paper that I wrote 'Louie Louie' on fell apart many years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I insisted it was important to determine whether there was a comma in the 
title. I told Berry he was going to have to make a decision. "OK," he said, as 
much to get rid of me as anything else. "'Louie Louie.' No comma." 
</P>
<P>
And here was Mr. Rockwell inquiring about the correct style of "Louie Louie" -- 
and soon after, in a New York Times headline, there was the song title: "Louie 
Louie," no comma, now as much a part of Times style as the courtesy term "Mr." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Rockwell's story about "Louie Louie" was quite formal; he actually compared 
the song to the works of Beethoven. Referring to the lasting power of both 
Beethoven and "Louie Louie," Mr. Rockwell wrote: "The success of a masterpiece 
derives partly from its inherent worth, but also partly from the more 
unpredictable, volatile interaction of the work, its public and the Zeitgeist." 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't know about that. But I do know what Berry told me about the song: 
</P>
<P>
"I never could understand the popularity of it. It was a song with three stupid 
guitar-chord changes in it."
