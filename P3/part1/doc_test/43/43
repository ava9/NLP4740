LOS LOBOS RETURNS TO OLD HAUNTS ON NEW LP

<P>
One reason Los Lobos took so long to record its new album, "The Neighborhood," 
was, ironically, the huge success of the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet's "La 
Bamba" single. 
</P>
<P>
The group's last album of original songs -- 1987's "By the Light of the Moon" 
-- was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the 
American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los 
Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection 
sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of 
numerous critics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway 
success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: several songs 
for the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Mexican-American 
rock star Ritchie Valens. The soundtrack album sold more than 2 million copies, 
and Los Lobos' title track spent weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to 
return with another collection of oldies. But that would have meant setting 
aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will the Wolf 
Survive?" recordings so memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican 
folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring 
venture, but negligible when compared to "La Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that 
Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was 
overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los 
Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house 
in the Belvedere district of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows," Hidalgo 
said, "but we would wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was 
it to see us or just because of the movie?" 
</P>
<P>
The "Pistola" project, he said, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music 
that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"The Neighborhood," which will figure prominently in the group's Oct. 19 
concert at the Greek Theatre, features a few bluesy, high-spirited workouts 
that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album radiates with the 
disarming artistic vision exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos -- which also consists of singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, bassist 
Conrad Lozano and saxophonist Steve Berlin -- began work on the new album in 
late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But writing it 
took longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II,' " Perez said. 
"That would have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course 
of writing the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . . 
the thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with 
'La Bamba.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and 
as introspective as 'Moon' . . . that maybe we should do something more 
accessible," he said. "But every time we started going too far in that 
direction, we found ourselves stopping and clearing the table . . . starting 
all over, getting back to something that really meant something to us." 
</P>
<P>
The four original members of Los Lobos (Berlin joined the group in the '80s) 
were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate rock bands until 
getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only being able to play 
Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four friends began 
exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that 
they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 
1980. Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and 
imagination that was being generated by bands on the Hollywood club circuit, 
and the group shifted to rock. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and Los Lobos 
stepped up to an entirely new creative level. 
</P>
<P>
Images of the band members' old neighborhood surface in some of the songs on 
the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the 
title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album, and it seemed to 
tie things together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything . . . about the way 
each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from the usual news routines of gang violence and drive-bys 
and everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And 
that's what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of 
that hope." 
</P>
<P>
Perez dug deeper into the band's philosophy and past. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock 
hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question 
had a lot to do with where we came from . . . this neighborhood."
