March, 1972, on the occasion of the 60th birthday of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The prize is awarded to those who have made distinguished

  A large number of Kim Il-song prize winners and works

and increase grain production by finding new varieties of rice, 
Chon Se-pong, a writer who wrote novels and many other good 
literary works and sportswoman Han Pil-hwa who contributed to 
the development of sports. 
  Some 20 people including historian Chae Hui-kuk, head of a 
chair of Kim Il-song University, No Ik-hwa, a sculptor of the 
Mansudae Art Studio, Yun Tong-hyang, a writer of the Korean 
literary production, became the Kim Il-song prize winners in 
recent years. 
  Yi Chong-o, a composer of the Pochonbo electronic band, was

ideological and artistic value. 
  A music and dance epic "Song of Glory" became the Kim 
Il-song 
prize work laureate for giving a vivid portrayal of the glorious 
and brilliant history of the great leader's revolutionary 
activities, his undying revolutionary feats and the happiness 
the Korean people are enjoying under the wise leadership of the 
Workers' Party of Korea.
