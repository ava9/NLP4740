THE RESTLESS J.J. CALE AND HIS 'TRAVEL-LOG' OF AN UNPLUGGED LIFE;

To anyone familiar with his music, it's tremendously apropos that J.J. Cale has 
spent the past decade living in a mobile home. While loose and laid-back, 
Cale's songs -- which include the Eric Clapton-covered "After Midnight" and 
"Cocaine" -- are anything but stationary. 
</P>
<P>
His current, groove-laden "Travel-Log" album is redolent of low-rent good 
times, barbecue smoke and corrugated metal, but there is also enough rhythmic 
snap and sizzle present that it's clear Cale could kick the blocks away from 
his tires and scream down the road any time he chose. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed being a Gypsy," the soft-spoken Oklahoman said Wednesday 
from his new home near Escondido, where his 24-foot trailer remains parked out 
back. "I basically make my living writing songs, so I've been able to go around 
in my trailer. If I got tired of a place, I could move on and roam around. It's 
a nice environment for writing songs, as opposed to sitting at a recording 
studio console all day." 
</P>
<P>
A Tulsa native, Cale first came to Los Angeles in the early '60s in a musical 
migration that also included fellow Tulsans Leon Russell and Carl Radle. He got 
in the habit then of living in hotels wherever his club gigs took him. 
Following his introduction to fame with Clapton's 1970 hit with "After 
Midnight" and his own subsequent success with "Crazy Mama" in 1971, Cale 
relocated to Tennessee and adopted his trailer park lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
When he again moved West a decade ago, Cale settled in Orange County because "I 
didn't want to live up by the (Los Angeles) music industry. I was trying to cut 
down that jones. So I moved down around Anaheim. There's a lot of trailer camps 
around Disneyland, and I kind of liked it there. It was real straight, as 
opposed to the Hollywood environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet life and it had its advantages. There's no responsibility: You 
don't have anything to clean up, it's cheap, the bills are a cash deal. I'd 
bicycle most places, which I found could be faster than a car. I didn't own a 
phone. As far as business goes it was kind of slim because if you don't 
communicate you don't do too much business nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cale's unplugged lifestyle and infrequent output -- "Travel-Log" is his 
first LP in six years -- has led to his being typified as a recluse in the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons I've been doing quite a few interviews lately: If 
you don't say anything, they make up things. So suddenly I'm a recluse. But I'm 
a songwriter basically, not a performer, and selling songs is kind of an inside 
deal, so I didn't need to be hyped for that." 
</P>
<P>
Along with presently making himself more available to the press, Cale has 
expanded his typical annual six-week tour -- conducted by mobile home, 
naturally -- to a four-month outing. The greater activity is reflective of the 
album itself, as "Travel-Log" may be Cale's most enlivened work, and it simmers 
with more ideas and feeling than some of his more famous emulators have 
mustered in eons. 
</P>
<P>
It helps no small amount that Cale is surrounded by excellent and kindred 
musicians on the album, including pianist Spooner Oldham (a true legend in 
Southern soul music), bassist Tim Drummond (whose credits include James Brown, 
Ry Cooder and Bob Dylan), saxophonist Steve Douglas (the honk on Duane Eddy's 
hits) and percussionist Jimmy Karstein, who has worked with everyone from Gary 
Lewis to James Harman. Joined by singer-guitarist Christine Lakeland and 
drummer Jim Cruce, they also form the band that will perform with Cale at the 
Coach House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
More than the linking geographical theme to some of the "Travel-Log" songs -- 
titles include "Shanghaied," "New Orleans" and "Tijuana" -- the tracks add up 
to a coherent whole, suggesting a musical journey. Surprisingly, the album's 14 
songs were recorded over a five-year period, employing a variety of studios and 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"I really scattershot things," Cale said. "Sometimes I'd write the song first 
then hire the musicians or write the song into a tape recorder and have the 
band learn off that, record the rhythm track with a band and write the song 
from that, sometimes do it in a big studio with real fine gear, sometimes do it 
in my trailer with real funky, cheesy equipment." It's a matter each time, he 
said, of finding a special atmosphere, "trying to find something I can relate 
to myself." 
</P>
<P>
After a successful release in Europe last year, "Travel-Log" was issued 
domestically this year on Silvertone/RCA. Though Cale earns his bread chiefly 
as a songwriter, occasionally as a performer, the influences he cites are all 
guitarists: Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Scotty Moore and Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown 
among others. Cale usually submerges his guitar technique deep in the grooves 
of his songs, surfacing with short, brilliant solos. Clapton and Mark Knopfler 
both list Cale as a source for their styles. 
</P>
<P>
Both on record and live, what Cale tries to communicate through music is "the 
same feeling I get from playing it. Music is a kind of magical thing, and you 
can't make magic every time, but you try. Every once in a while it has that 
magic, and the audience knows that. I probably miss it more than I hit it, but 
I think that's what all musicians try for." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago Cale opined that, given the compromises of the music business, "the 
true art stays at home." He still feels that way. "It can be more artful there 
because you don't have to come up with formulas and business decisions, all the 
money things don't affect what you do. You just do it for art, for your own 
enjoyment or for friends, and there's no connections or financial rewards. With 
each generation it seems like music is more of a business. People look at the 
music business like doctors look at medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Cale objects to the rewards. He generally is against classic songs 
being cheapened through use in commercials, but the appropriation of "After 
Midnight" by Michelob doesn't faze him: "Number one, because they pay me for 
it. I sold all my songs and have no control over them, but I do get paid when 
they use them. And -- modest fellow -- I didn't think 'After Midnight' was one 
of those kind of special tunes, so it didn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Cale's "Cocaine" offers an ambivalent view of that drug's lure, and was written 
at a time when it was far from being the societal problem it has since become. 
Though the song remains a party anthem for some, Cale said he can't have any 
regrets about penning it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't because I'm a writer. I'm a great believer in freedom of speech. The 
song is not for cocaine, and it's not against cocaine. It's something I 
observed and wrote a song about. That's what all writers do, in prose, poetry, 
whatever. I wasn't trying to turn anybody on to cocaine, or turn anybody off. 
When I wrote it I didn't realize that 10 years later it would be a big thing 
the government was going crazy over." 
</P>
<P>
He's glad that the fans he attracts know his material well enough to not be 
shouting for "Cocaine" or his other familiar songs during his shows. They can 
present other problems, though. "The songs people do request are the obscure 
ones off some old B-side that I probably can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Cale recently purchased a genuine house without wheels on the rural outskirts 
of Escondido. He explained, "I thought I'd get me a little place and see what 
mowing the lawn was like." 
</P>
<P>
He's 51 now and never thinks of retiring because, he said, "I'm kind of retired 
now. You have to remember I didn't do anything for the last five years. I'd 
rent a recording studio for two days once or twice a year, then once a year 
ride around in a motor home for six weeks. So basically for 10 months of the 
year I've been retired. 
</P>
<P>
"It's generally really hard to pay your rent playing music. Most people have to 
quit after a couple of years. I've been real lucky to be able to do it for 30 
years. I didn't get rich. But I can pay my bills. I wouldn't want to have 
gotten any bigger than I did because when you're that famous people really get 
on your case. My days are all kind of like Saturday because I don't have a 
regular job to go to at 9 every day. I read a lot and have a lot of time on my 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Cale recently learned that fans in England publish a newsletter dedicated to 
his doings called "Troubadour" (the title of an album he released in 1976). 
"Finding out about that was a real surprise," he said with a chuckle, "I have 
no idea what they manage to fill it with."

lifestyle and infrequent performances may have something to do with that. ;
