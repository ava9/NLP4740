At night, Francois returns to the streets, looking for an alley, a park or an 
accommodating bench, the familiar haunts of thousands of the city's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But during the day, he can be found lost in a melody as he plays "Stardust" and 
other standards for an admiring lunchtime crowd at an upscale Westwood cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons are stunned when they hear his story. A Skid Row fixture for the last 
five years, Francois (his first name is Michael, but he says he never uses it) 
says most people didn't even want to look at him, let alone give him a chance 
to play. That was the case when the 64-year-old musician showed up at Bon 
Appetit in Westwood two months ago, looking very much like a street person, 
offering to play the piano for food. 
</P>
<P>
He got his chance. After persuading David Gimpel, manager of the cafe, that 
after living the blues he could also play them, Francois cut his hair, trimmed 
his beard and found some clean clothes. And then he began returning to the club 
every day at lunchtime to practice the songs he knew so well before despair and 
drugs led him to a life in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody told me about this place and so I walked here from downtown one day," 
Francois said of the 14-mile trek. "I remember going to a catering truck near 
here to ask them for some milk, and some construction worker says, 'Why don't 
you go get a job?' I told him I was on my way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult adjusting (to the mainstream) again. Right now I'm at a point 
where I don't know exactly where to go. But I'm just trying to straighten my 
life out. I'm doing something and I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
His deft touch on the piano doesn't reveal glimpses of the hard life Francois 
has endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles native said he spent time in jail on drug and vagrancy charges 
earlier this year. He tried to pull himself out of the tailspin and played for 
a time at a Venice jazz club, but ended back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Francois spent most of his adult life working in one job or another, 
spending most of his time as a hairdresser. Music served more as a hobby than a 
profession. He took lessons to learn the saxophone but taught himself how to 
play piano. 
</P>
<P>
Francois said his downward spiral started in 1985 when five family members, 
including his wife, sister and grandmother, died in less than a year. That led 
him to drugs, he said, and eventually to Skid Row, far from the studios and 
jazz clubs where he once played and aspired to greatness. (He said he worked as 
an uncredited sideman with soul groups such as the Impressions and the 
Temptations.) 
</P>
<P>
No one has been more startled at Francois' turnaround than Gimpel, who helps to 
manage his father's Broxton Avenue cafe and music publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not in good shape when he came in here but he's cleaned himself up and 
now we can't get rid of him," Gimpel said. "He comes in the morning to 
practice, to learn some new songs, and he's playing pretty well now. He's 
adopted us and we've adopted him. And he's really trying hard to do something 
with his life." 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Beverly Hills resident Ann Banks, have been so touched by his 
story that they've felt compelled to offer him help. Banks has given him 
clothing and is telling anyone who will listen about "this incredible musician" 
who is trying to right himself through his touch on the ivories. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the cafe one day with my back to the wall, and all of a sudden I hear 
the most beautiful music," she said. "He has the most incredible touch on the 
piano. And when I heard his story, I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Francois is still playing for food and tips, but the future looks 
promising. A record management company official has offered to try and find him 
auditions and also a room for him to live. And what Los Angeles story would be 
complete without a movie deal? Francois said he has been approached by a film 
producer who said he was interested in doing a TV movie on the story of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But, Francois insists, the story is not finished yet. He said he is determined 
to try and make a living as a musician. But at the top of his list is his goal 
to rise above the streets and assume a more normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"God was really good to me," he said. "When I started playing again, the music 
just came back to me. It's been easier relearning the songs than it has been 
adjusting to the other parts of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are just starting to happen now, and I'm happy that I've reached this 
point. Two months ago, I was living on the streets downtown, and now I'm living 
on the streets in Westwood. That's better, right?"
