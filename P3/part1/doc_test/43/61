He's played music with a Go-Go and a Rolling Stone, but Jesse Sublett is making 
his reputation in the land of literature. 
</P>
<P>
His second mystery novel, "Tough Baby," published by Viking, hit bookstores in 
October, following last year's critically acclaimed debut effort, "Rock Critic 
Murders." Each spotlights Martin Fender, a musician, who, like Sublett, mixes 
careers. Fender also works for a collection agency. He reminds Sublett of the 
bizarre characters he encounters in his frequent trips as a bass player on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians are very similar to crime detectives," said Sublett, 36, of North 
Hollywood. "These are people who are too weird to do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Sublett puts himself in that category. After years of playing music in Texas -- 
he formed the Skunks rock group -- he moved to Los Angeles in 1987 because 
"that's where Raymond Chandler lived." He joined a group led by Go-Go Kathy 
Valentine and wrote songs. And he soon discovered that his passion for writing, 
always secondary to his musical pursuits, could be more than a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was a kid, I loved writing," he said, "and I soon realized it was a 
viable thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Critic Murders" was nominated for the Private Eye Writers of America's 
Shamus Award, and Viking printed 12,000 copies of "Tough Baby." He is busy 
working on a third mystery novel, "Boiled in Concrete," due in August. He has 
written two screenplays -- one has been optioned -- and hopes to write 
mysteries that don't relate to the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sublett hasn't abandoned his musical career. Later this month, Demon 
Records is scheduled to release a live album by the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor 
Band recorded at the Roxy in March. Taylor used to be a Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Sublett plays bass on the record. His song, "Who Put the Sting on the Honey 
Bee," appears on the album and in "Tough Baby." 
</P>
<P>
The careers sometimes mix in strange ways. "I was talking to Mick Taylor and he 
told me he thinks Chandler is the best too. I almost passed out." 
</P>
<P>
Sasch in Studio City has introduced a new weekly special on Sunday nights -- 
Alternative Music Night. Instead of the standard fare of rock-and-roll and Top 
40 presented all week, the club, according to manager Mark Yandle, was looking 
for a night to showcase New Wave/alternative performers. 
</P>
<P>
"For months, we've known we wanted to be more than a rock-and-roll club," 
Yandle said. "And the response to our first night was incredible. People loved 
hearing the original music." 
</P>
<P>
When the concept debuted Oct. 21, a disc jockey played alternative records. In 
the future, Yandle said, the club will present live performers offering all 
kinds of music, including reggae and original dance material. All shows begin 
at 9 p.m.; the club's cover charge is $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Barn Dance will have a tribute Tuesday to Gram Parsons at the Palomino in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, who died of a drug overdose in 1973, would have been 44 next week. 
Ronnie Mack, Barn Dance's host, credits Parsons with being a pioneer in country 
rock. Parsons sang and played guitar, and his songs include "Sin City" and 
"Devil in Disguise." Among the performers scheduled are Rosie Flores, James 
Intveld, Dale Watson and Lucinda Williams. Barn Dance held a similar tribute 
for Parsons last year.
