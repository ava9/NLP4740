Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, is separating from her 
husband, Mark Phillips, after 15 years of marriage, but they do not plan to 
divorce, Buckingham Palace announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The queen, on holiday at Balmoral, Scotland, was described by royal sources to 
be "obviously saddened" but to understand the couple's decision, which was 
taken in principle earlier this year, according to Press Assn., Britain's 
domestic news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. Mark Phillips have decided 
to separate on terms agreed between them," the announcement said. "There are no 
plans for divorce proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the separation were not disclosed, but Anne, 39, will continue to 
live at the couple's home, Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire, 80 miles west of 
London. Phillips, 40, will move to another house nearby, the palace said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 8, will live with their mother at 
Gatcombe, and Phillips will have full access to them, the palace said. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said Phillips was receiving a financial settlement from the 
queen that would make him wealthy. The palace said it was unable to comment on 
a cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Anne, in Puerto Rico for a meeting of the International Olympic 
Committee, brushed past reporters this morning without answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
Palace informants said the couple had already decided to part before an 
incident last April when affectionate letters written to Anne by royal aide 
Timothy Laurence, 35, were stolen and sent to the Sun newspaper. Details of the 
letters were not disclosed, but the disclosure of the princess' close relations 
with the handsome Royal Navy commander, an aide to her mother, provoked a rash 
of speculation about how long her marriage could last. 
</P>
<P>
Philips has been linked with various women, most recently a 45-year-old public 
relations consultant in Canada with whom he was reported to have been seen at 
candle-lit dinners.
