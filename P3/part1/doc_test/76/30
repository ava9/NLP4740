most provoking] There is nothing for it but to make the best of things. We
started at a little after 9.30am in the carriage. It was blowing fearfully,
almost a hurricane, and the stream was very full. Leaving the carriage we
set off on foot at 11am and, although the ground was soft, we soon reached
the track running alongside the loch.
The native pines are very fine here. The ascent is quite stony and the path
winds along, climbing higher and higher and passing small waterfalls which
are quite magnificent. We lunched at a little after 3pm.
The sun struggled through as we passed beneath Lochnagar and, although we
sometimes had to walk through old snow drifts, it was fine. Arrived home at
6.30pm and dined at 8pm.
SO MIGHT our day around Loch Muick have been recorded in Queen Victoria's
Highland Journals, had she been with us. She would probably have included a
note about the several red grouse which leapt from our feet in a flurry of
wings.
She might have added reference to the herd of 90 or so stags which shifted
almost imperceptibly up the steep, dark brown, heather-covered hillside away
from us as we crossed the foot of the loch.
But the frogs in the shallow ditch beside the track would have played no
part in Victoria's diary. They were too small to have been noticed by the
royal passers-by.
Victoria was the first reigning British monarch to visit Scotland for any
length of time since the days of Charles I, and Deeside only became a
regular royal venue after Victoria and Albert acquired Balmoral and built
the new castle there in 1855.
The benefits from the sudden arrival of royalty on their doorstep were not
lost on the canny Scots, and a number of 'By Appointment' crests hangs over
the shop fronts in nearby Ballater.
Royal Lochnagar Distillery above Balmoral was also graced by the presence of
Victoria and her prince, and today's visitors probably see little change in
most of the processes there.
In addition to the castle, Victoria built two houses at Loch Muick. The
first, with Albert, was at the foot of the loch while the second, Glassalt
Shiel, was built after his death: Victoria could not contemplate living in
the first house again because of the memories it had for her.
She called the new building the Widow's House, and it stands at the head of
the loch overshadowed by dark mountains. We passed it on our walk and could
well imagine an estate agent today presenting it (with some accuracy) as a
substantial double-fronted stone house with six bedrooms, four reception
rooms and fine views over the loch. In Victoria's book it is 'a compact
little house (but with only one staircase)'.
How she would have described the comfortable four-star Craigendarroch Hotel
in which we stayed just outside Ballater, with timeshare lodges scattered
among the trees in its 28 acres of grounds, is impossible to say.
Among the outside activities offered is horse riding based just a few miles
away down the Dee Valley from the hotel in Glen Tanar. Suitably mounted on
pleasantly responsive ponies, we climbed up into the hills, hacking along
forest tracks, fording streams and even riding along the Queen's Drive, so
called because Victoria and Albert passed this way on one of their 'great
expeditions'.
At the time these excursions would have been exercises in logistics almost
as complicated as modern-day Himalayan expeditions. Using carriages on the
roads and crossing moors and mountains on foot or on the backs of local
ponies, the royal party would cover 40 or 50 miles in a day and stay away
from home for two or three days at a time.
They climbed over mountain ranges through weather which was often inclement
and without the comfort of modern hill walking clothing and equipment. On
the far side, frequently cold and soaked through, they would be met by
waiting carriages which would take them to a local inn. Victoria delighted
in staying incognito, although one gets the feeling from her journals that
she half wanted to be recognised.
As the discovery of their true identity followed the royal party, so they
left a trail of carved memorial stones and name changes behind them. Once
sampled by Victoria, an ordinary water source became the Queen's Well.
Perhaps the most notable is at Fettercairn, which marks one end of the
Victorian Trail produced by the Kincardine and Deeside tourist board. The
Queen spent the night here but the villagers only discovered the visitors'
identity after they had left.
Almost, one suspects, as an act of penance they constructed a large,
pinnacled gothic archway over the road.
The cost to the local inhabitants must have been enormous. However, the
value of the penance to the village is now becoming apparent, for heavy
lorries - unable to pass through the arch - are forced to divert around the
village centre.
Michael Woods stayed at Craigendarroch Hotel and Country Club, Ballater,
Royal Deeside AB3 5XA. Tel: 03397-55858. Royal Lochnagar Distillery is open
throughout the year. Tel: 03397-42273.
Several of Victoria's routes can be gleaned from Queen Victoria's Highland
Journals, published by Webb and Bower.
