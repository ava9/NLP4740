The Crown Jewels have been locked away in the Tower of London for over 600
years. Not the same jewels, of course: Oliver Cromwell melted down the
medieval regalia in 1649, with just one 12th century Coronation spoon
escaping the flames.
But from Charles II onwards, there has been a steady accumulation of crowns
and plate, of orbs and sceptres and rings and swords. The jewels on display
today record the triumph of the British Imperial adventure. What was lost of
medieval craftsmanship has been made good by the tribute, and loot, of
Empire.
For decades the Crown Jewels have been the pride and despair of the Tower.
They are its principal attraction and few of the 2.25m visitors a year have
given them a miss, even though it has meant queueing in the exposed wastes
of the Tower courtyards. Every few years the jewels have been moved, but
never with any lasting satisfaction. From today, however, they have a
splendid new home, built at a cost of Pounds 10m, which should see out our
generation, and more.
From one perspective the new Jewel House marks the second, and most
important, stage in the long term marketing strategy of that new commercial
enterprise, the Historic Royal Palaces; from another it is an impressive,
and most welcome, shrine for what could be regarded as the soul of the
nation made manifest in the most costly, rare, and abiding of earthly
treasures.
The millions have been spent unobtrusively, mainly on security. You enter
the stern doorway of the Waterloo Block, a 19th century barracks.
Immediately you realise you are in the grip of a system, a carefully
programmed 25 minute experience as you edge along the procession towards the
climax of the jewels. There are diversions on the way, most notably three
giant screens showing scenes from the Queen's Coronation. They are
surprisingly moving, especially as you realise that, despite the furore at
the time about an 'intrusive' televised Coronation, the actual moment of
crowning remains a mystery, the Archbishop's robes forming a protective
veil.
Historic Royal Palaces, an organisation created by the government to take
over responsibility for the upkeep of Britain's finest ancient buildings, is
in the business of painless education, and its justification for the new
Jewel House is to explain the purpose of the regalia, the ritual of
Coronation. So other rooms show film of the objects in use before they
finally come into view; first the maces, trumpets and swords, which would
head the traditional procession, then the anointing vessels and finally the
Crown Jewels themselves.
At peak times a moving pavement will be switched on, which allows an
over-brisk assessment, although there is nothing to stop you repeating the
ride, or examining the jewels from a raised gallery.
They are reassuringly awesome. Even those most sceptical about 'jewel fever'
and the lure of gold and precious stones would find it hard to be
indifferent to the largest diamond in the world, set atop the sceptre. Even
the most supercilious will speculate on the variety of the crowns - the tiny
crown of Mary of Modena; the miniscule diamond crown of Queen Victoria; the
large crown of the Queen Mother, which contains the Koh-i-Nor diamond, a
token of bad luck when worn by men, but harmless to women.
Then there is silver gilt plate by the van load, the Imperial Crown of India
and various curiosities before you reach the inevitable journey's end: the
shop. It is all rather breathless and claustrophobic, and anyone wanting to
make the most of the experience should repeat the journey. To keep the flow
moving, the jewels are not lavishly explained: for example there is no
attempt to point out the Koh-i-Nor, and unless you grab a Yeomen Warder, or
mug up well before hand, you are certain to topple out with questions
unanswered.
David Beeton, who runs Historic Royal Palaces, expects the new Jewel House
to attract an extra 250,000 visitors. The figure is bound to be higher,
despite an admission charge for the Tower raised from today to Pounds 7.95,
which includes access to everything.
With the Jewel House behind him, Beeton is turning his attention to the Big
One, the White Tower, the original Keep of London. He is using Pounds 20m
from the profits he has already harvested, mainly from the spruced up
Hampton Court, to sweeten the move of the Royal Amouries out of the Tower
and into a new museum in Leeds. He will then turn his attention to making
the White Tower customer friendly. He will want to hold on to some of its
greatest treasures, such as Henry VIII's jousting armour, but the wide open
spaces of the Tower offer wonderful opportunities for populist exploitation.
Some historical and cultural purists are horrified. They accept that Beeton
has done a good job with the jewels but they have taken against his first
enterprise at the Tower, the creation a year ago of a 'Medieval Palace' in
the 13th century buildings. They object to the replica furniture, to the
presence of attendants, medievally dressed, who attempt to explain life in
the 1270s.
But Beeton argues that no furniture of the period has survived and the
attendants are qualified historians. For the vast majority of the public,
the presence of a throne, of an adjacent oratory, of tables and fireplaces,
however conjectural, are preferable to the empty rooms and lifeless stones
of the recent past. The Tower has been knocked about for centuries and
hardly anything remains untouched by 18th and 19th century improvers. Few
visitors can imagine, unaided, the court life of Edward I.
Historic Royal Palaces' mission to explain might be in pursuit of profit but
it meets a genuine demand. The Tower of London has always been a place of
diversion, at least since it stopped being the last protective bolt hole for
the monarch in the 15th century. It was where Londoners came to marvel at
the King's weird animals, to gaze at his jewels, to consult the national
archives, to gaze at the planets from the first royal telescope, to drink in
the pubs that littered the Tower until the 19th century and, on high days,
to watch the executions.
Today's public may be more restrained - it is also predominantly foreign and
ill-informed - but there is no reason why it should not gain some enjoyment
from the hefty admission charge.
