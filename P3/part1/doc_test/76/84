When the students at Costa Mesa High School heard that they would be visited by 
British royalty, many envisioned a snooty couple sweeping onto the campus in a 
fleet of gleaming horse-drawn carriages, looking down upon and waving politely 
to the little people. 
</P>
<P>
Although Princess Alexandra of Britain and her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, did 
arrive at the school Monday in a fleet of gleaming Rolls-Royces, the students 
pronounced them anything but snooty. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to be all high and stuck-up, but they were nice," 
said ninth-grader Mike Curtis, 14. 
</P>
<P>
The royal couple, visiting Orange County as part of the Festival of Britain, 
ventured to Costa Mesa High after Princess Alexandra, 53, first cousin of Queen 
Elizabeth II, asked for a tour of a typical California high school. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty perched along a second-floor railing gazed down as the 
princess and her entourage arrived shortly after 11 a.m. to cheers ordinarily 
associated with the arrival of a pop musician or star athlete. 
</P>
<P>
While the princess and her husband took a brief tour of the school, teacher 
Phyllis McKown and her ninth-grade world history class nervously prepared for a 
skit in which nine of her 34 students presented an Elizabethan-era "telecast" 
of the "Renaissance News Network," focusing on battles with the Spanish Armada. 
</P>
<P>
The princess, with her entourage in tow, was led into Room 163, where McKown 
introduced her students to the couple and presented the princess with another 
bouquet of flowers. "Do you enjoy history?" the princess asked the class, which 
replied "yes" in unison but with an obvious degree of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in standard-issue plastic classroom chairs, Princess Alexandra and Sir 
Angus looked on as "anchorwoman" Tienna Rodriguez, 14, dressed in a bright 
green blazer, opened the "broadcast" and introduced "correspondent" Michelle 
Hitchcock, who, in turn, introduced "Queen Elizabeth I." 
</P>
<P>
The queen, portrayed by Julie Wooten, 14, resplendent in a floor-length white 
gown and tiara, delivered a soft-spoken but flawless address detailing the 
fight against the Armada. Her address was rebutted in Spanish by King Philip I 
of Spain, portrayed by Robert Rodriguez, 14, and translated by Dawn Fries, 14. 
</P>
<P>
McKown later said it was the students' idea to deliver speeches for the 
"newscast" in as many foreign languages as possible. After Robert Rodriguez -- 
who brought smiles to the faces of the royal couple after he proclaimed that 
"it is true that I had fallen in love with Queen Elizabeth, but we're bitter 
enemies now" -- delivered his address in Spanish, classmate Giancarlo Renella, 
14, portraying Pope Alexander, did his bit in Italian. Nancy Duigou, 15, 
presented France's perspective in French. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations -- well done!" Sir Angus told the performers. "Very 
enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of nervous," said Chad Van Sweden, 14, who interviewed "Pope 
Alexander" for the mock broadcast. "It was just a different feeling having 
reporters and royalty in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
"They were fabulous," said Nancy Duigou, who said she was pleased to learn that 
the princess speaks some French and was able to follow her presentation. "She 
was really nice, not like I expected." 
</P>
<P>
The entire school, it seemed, was similarly impressed by the royal couple. At 
their departure -- marked by a one-song recital by the school choir -- the 
princess stopped to shake a few hands and exchange pleasantries with a number 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
"Omigod, I talked to her!" one girl yelled after the princess stopped to say 
hello. "I talked to a princess!" TONY MARCANO
