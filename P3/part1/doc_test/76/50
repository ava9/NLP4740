THE MAKING OF VICTORIAN SEXUALITY by Michael Mason OUP Pounds 17.95, 338
pages
If we know one fact about Queen Victoria, it is that she was a prude who was
Not Amused. When the 15-year-old Prince of Wales kissed a girl on holiday,
Victoria was scandalised and the Prime Minister, Gladstone, made a public
statement regretting 'this squalid little debauch'. Around the same time,
the Queen invited the painter John Millais to court; but his wife Effie was
turned back at the gate, ostracised because she had formerly been Mrs
Ruskin. Yet so repressive was Victorian sexual culture that, when Ruskin had
declined to consummate the marriage, Effie had for years understood neither
that anything was wrong nor why she had no children.
Stories like these crystallise our view of a 19th century England fettered
by morality and bigotry. But what was the erotic life of the Victorians
really like? In this bold new book, Michael Mason reinterprets Victorian
sexual culture and unpicks some of its most common stereotypes.
Out for example, goes the myth of the shy courting couple who barely knew
each other: 40 per cent of Victorian brides were pregnant on their wedding
day. Out, too, goes the worn down wife who could not control her fertility -
contraception was widely used from the 1860s. Contrary to popular belief,
frustrated bourgeois husbands did not resort en masse to brothels -
prostitution declined in Victorian England - and table legs were not dressed
in frilly skirts for modesty's sake - that was a modern joke mistakenly
taken up as fact.
Twenty years ago, Michel Foucault pioneered the idea that the 19th and 20th
centuries were far more united in their obsession with sex than divided by
repressive and anti-repressive attitudes to it. This book develops
Foucault's theme. Mason sees the Victorian sexual code as progressive,
socially aware, governed by enlightened self-interest rather than narrow
moralism: in many ways close to our own. A key difference was the 19th
century belief in discipline and unobtrusiveness, values belonging to a
broad culture of social respectability and propriety. A surprising
similarity was a strong emphasis on sensual pleasure.
Explicit talk and bedroom boasts then were bad taste, but a first date was
often intimate.
When Nora Barnacle, at the turn of the century, first walked out with James
Joyce, she marched him to a quiet street, unbuttoned his trousers and
slipped in her hand. Women routinely watched men bathing nude in the sea -
often to be disappointed by 'the action of cold water'. And the Victorian
conviction that women only conceived if they reached orgasm - a view that
'dignifies female erotism' - intimated that wives were having a good time.
Mason fleshes out his arguments with statistics, medical records,
demographic data. Condoms were twice as expensive in relation to the average
wage as today, and were often advertised by direct mail to couples
announcing a birth in the press. Miners were the least likely workers to use
them. Chimney sweeps had the most short lived relations with their
concubines.
This is interesting, but it does not explain why Mrs Ruskin languished as a
virgin and the Prince of Wales got into trouble for a kiss. The serious
weakness of this study is that Mason rarely recounts stories of such human
interest. By ignoring them, he makes a potentially explosive book tepid and
unsatisfying, and misses out on crucial aspects of 19th century culture
which contributed to the making of Victorian sexuality. The result is a
viewpoint so engrossed in academic detail that it loses sight of major
issues.
The omissions are unforgiveable. There is no reference to Victorian England
as a pre-Freudian society which, unlike our own, did not regard sex as the
central human drive. No acknowledgment that the cult of female purity - see
characters such as Little Nell or Millais' 'Cherry Ripe' - tipped easily
into a code of ignorance and repression. No discussion of the effect of
popular restrictive works like Bowdler's expurgated Shakespeare. Not a
glance at the link between sexual restraint and social cohesion in the mind
of a middle-class terrified of godlessness and anarchy.
Anecdotes reveal such complex influences on sexual behaviour better than
theories and statistics. A few of them - Queen Victoria's account of 'being
clasped and held tight in the sacred hours of the night when the world
seemed only to be ourselves', say, to illustrate the happy sex life of a
famous prude - would have enormously enriched Mason's book. Without them, it
barely comes alive. Volume II about the sexual creeds of individuals is
promised, and may redress the balance. Meanwhile, Mason's thorough research
and original arguments are to be welcomed, but the field remains open for a
more comprehensive study of a fascinating subject.
