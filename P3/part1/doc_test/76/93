THE Queen is introducing performance-related pay for the whole of the royal
household, it was confirmed yesterday.
But some of the staff, who are relatively low-paid, are said to be angry at
the move.
Buckingham Palace said that the system would be introduced gradually for all
the Queen's staff. Those most affected will be the 400 domestics employed as
butlers, maids, footmen, gardeners and chefs.
Pay levels at Buckingham Palace and other royal establishments remain low
compared with wages outside royal households. Maids receive pre-tax earnings
of about Pounds 6,000 a year, and footmen Pounds 7,000. Chefs earn Pounds
13,000 a year.
Performance-related pay will replace the current pay system, which is based
on annual increments.
The palace said last night that nobody in the Queen's employment would
receive less pay as a result of performance-related pay, and that some would
receive more for exceptional service.
The introduction of the system would come on top of annual cost-of-living
increases. At present these rises are capped by the government's limit of
1.5 per cent for all public-sector employees, which is due to end in the
autumn.
The popularity of performance-related pay is spreading. The BBC is thought
to be introducing a performance-related-pay scheme on top of the existing
pay structure. Merit-pay schemes have been agreed in the past two months at
a number of insurance companies.
It has been suggested that many royal household staff will not benefit from
a system which might encourage departmental heads at the palace to reward
some staff at the expense of others.
But a Buckingham Palace official said last night: 'I have not heard anybody
complaining about it.'
There is no suggestion that performance-related pay might be extended from
the Queen's staff to the members of her own family.
