SOME COLLECTORS of royal memorabilia are already calling it 'black
December'.
Buckingham Palace has received just one request for permission to
commemorate today's wedding of the Princess Royal and Commander Tim
Laurence, compared with hundreds for previous royal nuptials.
The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, announced this week,
might be seen as a crowning blow for the royal memorabilia market, worth an
estimated Pounds 10m a year in Britain alone. But some dealers believe that
Charles and Diana memorabilia is likely to increase in value as a result.
'While it is still early days, we know that since Andrew and Sarah have
split up, the market for their memorabilia has increased markedly,' says Mr
Alan Margenroth, a dealer in royal commemorative china with Govier's of
Sidmouth, who refused to commission a cup commemorating the divorce of the
Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips.
Some collectors are happy at the prospect of a drop in demand for
memorabilia. Mr Steven Jackson, secretary of the Commemorative Collectors
Society, says: 'The market is slowly being returned to the serious
collectors.'
Manufacturers blame the short notice for the wedding - just seven days  -
for the lack of Anne and Tim memorabilia. Some also say there seems to be
little interest in the event.
'We didn't think anyone would want to buy Anne and Tim tea towels,' said one
manufacturer in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.
At Royal Doulton, which like the Financial Times is owned by Pearson, Ms
Anne Linscott, corporate communications director, says: 'We normally need at
least several months' notice to design and produce a limited edition set.'
The company that is making a mug and fine china beaker for today's wedding
is Peter Jones China of Wakefield, West Yorkshire.
Mugs retailing at Pounds 19.99 will be on sale next week with a limited
edition of 1,000 beakers at Pounds 39.95.
Commemorative, limited royal editions are often oversubscribed, ensuring an
immediate premium for investors. The Royal Crown Derby Queen Mother's 90th
birthday loving cup, of which 500 were issued in 1990 at Pounds 75, now
fetches Pounds 160.
Political memorabilia is also popular; the Margaret Thatcher loving cup,
celebrating her third general election victory in 1987, fetches more than
the cup celebrating the Queen's 60th birthday in 1986 of similar price and
edition size.
