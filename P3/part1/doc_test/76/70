AT 6 MONTHS OLD, England's wee Princess Beatrice, daughter of the Duke and 
Duchess of York, may be a bit too young to influence hair fashions, but her 
dapper little cousins, Prince William and Prince Harry, are already 
trend-setters. Their very traditional cuts have replaced last year's spiky-tyke 
styles as the look for kids in 1989. Instead of trying to look like wild-haired 
rock stars, many boys ages 4 to 12 are now getting cuts that are long in back, 
tapered only slightly at the nape and fairly long on top. The look is designed 
to keep the hair neat even when tousled. These "action cuts," as hairdresser 
Edward Jimenez calls them, fall right into place no matter how many tricks the 
kids do on their bikes. "It's not a military school look," says Jimenez, whose 
Sunset Boulevard salon caters to adults and children. "The length in back keeps 
it from looking too severe."

For girls, action-worthy styles, such as English bowl cuts and classic 
ponytails, pigtails and French braids, are all the rage. As Sherman Oaks 
children's stylist Pam Pepper explains: "Kids still don't want to look 
different from other kids -- no matter what their parents think. But the kids 
all say they want to look cool at the same time."

Easy care is a high priority for the elementary school set. "Low- to 
no-maintenance" is how Tina Cassaday, a Beverly Hills children's hairdresser, 
describes the trend. Cassaday not only makes house calls to snip the tresses of 
Michael Landon and his kids, but she also does her son Justin's entire 
second-grade class at Beverly Vista school.

Landon's 4-year-old daughter, Jennifer, "always worries that her bangs are too 
long," Cassaday says. Jennifer isn't alone. Most children dislike it when their 
hair gets in their eyes. "Bangs should never be long enough to be blinding," 
Jimenez says. "That's the No. 1 complaint from kids. Their mothers think long 
fringe is cute, but it drives the kids crazy." This year's favorite fringe is 
eyebrow-length in front, tapering longer at the temples,similar to the way that 
child actress Sarah Doroff wore her bangs in "Three Fugitives."

Last year, kids were asking for vibrant colors in their hair, but those 
requests have dwindled. Now the only call for color is from young actors and 
actresses who need highlights or a change of shade for a role. At her salon, 
Peppermints, Pepper says she prefers not to apply chemical treatments, such as 
hair color or perms, to children under 10. "The hair hasn't developed 
completely until then, so I can't guarantee successful results. Besides, it's 
just not healthy for young hair." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez adds that he has observed children as young as 5 years old with 
artificial highlights. "That's not the child's desire. That's the parent 
fulfilling some need," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Chemicals destroy the outer layers of the hair, making it weak and brittle, 
Cassaday says. If color is required, she chooses vegetable-based dyes that 
won't damage the hair shaft. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good that the young heirs to the British throne have not realized 
their impact on today's trends, but, as Cassaday says, "there just aren't that 
many children today who influence styles."

off a bowl-type cut. Hairdresser Pam Pepper cuts the one-length style so it 
falls back in place. "Most boys Justin's age are into sports -- hockey, T-ball, 
soccer. They need a haircut that can handle the action." Catanzaro / Mahdessian
