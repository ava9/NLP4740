John Harwood never thought to give his grandfather's old British uniform the 
royal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on more than one occasion, the uniform served as his Halloween 
costume. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd collect candies in the hat," Harwood recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the uniform that Harwood wore trick-or-treating is on display at the 
Robes of the Realm exhibit in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The exhibit, which 
coincides with the Festival of Britain starting Friday in Orange County, 
features British ceremonial robes and regalia, including the investiture robe 
of Prince Charles and, now, Harwood's Halloween costume. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood had no idea of the uniform's significance -- or its worth. He only knew 
that his grandfather, Sir Ralph Harwood, had worn it while serving as treasurer 
to King George V. 
</P>
<P>
Those in charge of the robes exhibit say the diplomatic uniform, as well as two 
additional jackets and accompanying medals not on display, are an important 
find. They indicate that Sir Ralph, as Harwood refers to his grandfather, was a 
key player in King George's court. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe we found these right here . . . ," says Greg McGroarty, 
president of the Robes of the Realm exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
One clue that makes McGroarty think Sir Ralph enjoyed a favored position at 
court is the gold embroidery that covers the front and back of the uniform. As 
a general rule, the more thread on one's uniform, the higher one's rank. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much room (on the jacket) for more embroidery," McGroarty says. 
"He'd have to rank right at the top." 
</P>
<P>
If Harwood finds the right buyer, McGroarty says, he could receive more than 
$500,000 for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid I didn't realize the value," says Harwood, who works as a building 
contractor and lives in Laguna Beach. "My son used one of the jackets to dress 
up like a penguin for a school play." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood's collection found its way to the exhibit after David Battersby, a 
career-guidance coordinator at Costa Mesa High School, heard that Princess 
Alexandra would visit the school while in Orange County for the Festival of 
Britain. Battersby remembered that Harwood, a neighbor, had a British uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were having a royal visit at my school, I thought we'd show the 
uniform to the kids and tell them what it meant," Battersby says. 
</P>
<P>
Even Battersby, a former world history teacher, looks a little sheepish when he 
admits that he dressed up a fellow administrator in the jacket for a day of 
show-and-tell with history students. 
</P>
<P>
He then wanted to put the collection on display. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (the collection) insured, and the school informed me they would cover 
it for $50," Battersby says. 
</P>
<P>
When a student told him about the Robes of the Realm exhibit, he decided to 
show the collection to McGroarty to see if he would be interested in including 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked in here with a big case and said, 'There's a robe in here I think 
you'd like to see,' " McGroarty says. "He opened this tin box and inside it 
said, 'Ede and Ravenscroft."' 
</P>
<P>
Ede and Ravenscroft have served as the royal robe makers since the reign of 
William and Mary in 1689 and produced all of the robes in the exhibit. The 
Robes of the Realm collection was assembled in honor of the company's 300-year 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
At first the clothes inside looked like nothing special -- the fine embroidery 
was hidden in the folds of fabric. Then Battersby pulled out a sword with a 
gold handle that also had the Ede and Ravenscroft name. McGroarty knew only a 
diplomat of very high rank would have a sword with a gold handle, instead of 
the standard silver. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my assistant put the jacket on the mannequin, and I saw all of the gold 
embroidery. I realized this had to belong to a really important person," 
McGroarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying medals were also impressive. 
</P>
<P>
They include the Order of the Bath, Victorian Order and Order of the British 
Empire, all rewards for outstanding service to the crown. In addition, the son 
of Queen Victoria honored Sir Ralph with five foreign Orders. McGroarty figures 
that Sir Ralph accompanied the Duke of Windsor to Iraq, Ethiopia, Romania, 
Afghanistan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"They're worth a fortune," McGroarty says. "I'm amazed there were these medals 
five minutes away at Costa Mesa High School." 
</P>
<P>
One medal, the Order of the Bath, could be worth up to $45,000. Students got to 
hold the medals when Battersby brought them to their classes. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood has two other jackets that belonged to his grandfather, one still 
adorned with a black arm band. Presumably Sir Ralph wore it to King George's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra visits Costa Mesa High School Monday morning, the 
Harwood collection will be temporarily displayed for her benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McGroarty has asked Britain's King of Arms in charge of genealogy to 
research Sir Ralph Harwood's past. Judging from the collection, Sir Ralph could 
have been keeper of his majesty's privy purse -- a kind of accountant to the 
king, McGroarty says. 
</P>
<P>
While the British fuss over the find, Harwood has already tired of the pomp and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really a royalist," he says. "I want to be me rather than Sir Ralph's 
grandson." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood moved to the United States 11 years ago. His mother brought over the 
box of memorabilia by plane from England three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It set off all of the (airport) metal detectors," Harwood says. 
</P>
<P>
He has picked up only bits and pieces of his grandfather's history from his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a genius mathematician. He used to put himself to sleep at night 
solving quadratic equations," Harwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although some would compare the find with winning the lottery, Harwood is far 
from elated. Once the festival ends Oct. 28, he must decide whether to sell off 
the collection or store it in a bank vault. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be fun. The kids loved to get it out and play with it. My son used 
to put his feet on the (Ede and Ravenscroft) box while playing Nintendo," 
Harwood said. "Now I've got to think about insurance."
