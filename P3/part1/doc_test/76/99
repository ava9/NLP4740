Marina Ogilvy, a close relative of Queen Elizabeth II whose pregnancy out of 
wedlock brought the British Royal Family unwelcome publicity, was married today 
with the queen's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old bride, four months pregnant, did not wear a traditional white 
dress, and there was none of the lavish spectacle normally associated with 
royal weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The private ceremony ended a dispute between Ogilvy and her parents, the 
queen's cousin Princess Alexandra and businessman Sir Angus Ogilvy, who she 
claimed had cut her off after she became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, 24th in line to the British throne, married Paul Mowatt, a 26-year-old 
photographer, at a 19th-Century church near her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 photographers and reporters jostled outside as the dark-haired Ogilvy 
arrived in a rust-colored bolero and mid-calf black velvet dress with matching 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Angus met his daughter with a kiss and asked, "How are you, darling?" She 
smiled and he led her down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
Their embrace signaled the end of a dispute which hit the headlines after 
Ogilvy told a newspaper in October that her parents tried to trick her into 
having an abortion or marrying by special license.
