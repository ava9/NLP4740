the commercial relevance of the sought-after royal warrant

MS JUNE KENTON knows the Queen better than most. She supplies her underwear.
'I have the most personal warrant there is,' says the proprietor of Rigby &amp;
Peller, corsetieres, who fits the Queen and several of the 'younger royals'
for bras and corsets.
She is just one of 890 royal warrant holders, permitted to style themselves
'By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen', and to display the royal arms on
their buildings, products and letterhead.
Holders range from BP, Boots, ICI, and Blue Circle Cement, to the post
office at Ballater, near Balmoral, the garden centre in Tetbury,
Gloucestershire - which supplies food for Prince William's rabbits - and
Deosan, a Northampton company that supplies sheep dips by appointment to the
Queen Mother.
The royal crest has traditionally been a mark of prestige but, 40 years on
from the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, how has the warrant system been
affected by the bad publicity that has surrounded the royal family for the
past year?
Commander Hugh Faulkner, secretary of the Royal Warrant Holders'
Association, said: 'We certainly haven't had anyone handing back their
warrants.
'The publicity has not made any difference to the eagerness with which
suppliers view the possibility of being granted a warrant. Thank God.'
The present system of granting royal warrants dates from the reign of Queen
Victoria.
Applicants must have supplied the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen
Mother or Prince Charles for at least three years.
Some companies have become almost synonymous with the royal family, giving a
substantial boost to their brand name. Mr Gerald Hamilton, managing director
of Fortnum &amp; Mason - sometimes known as the 'Queen's grocer' - says the
warrant 'is still seen to be an accolade. Even today you can hardly get a
better recommendation'.
Mr Hamilton says the royal crest helps to attract tourists and visitors to
the store, and has enhanced its image overseas, with exports accounting for
14 per cent of its business.
It is debatable how much the royal seal of approval boosts sales of everyday
brands such as Heinz baked beans or Kellogg's corn flakes. But for smaller
companies selling high-quality, often high-priced goods, the royal warrant
can open many doors.
Ms Kenton says royal associations proved invaluable when marketing in the
US.
'Having a royal warrant says you are a company of repute, of honour, and
that you work to a high standard,' she said. 'But you can't rely on a
warrant to bring you business. It's no meal ticket. You have to work at the
business all the time,' she says.
Mr Gerald Bodmer, managing director of Launer, which supplies the Queen's
handbags, says his company could never have grown at the same pace without
the royal warrant.
Launer has a niche market, selling real leather handbags at an average price
of Pounds 350. 'We don't even put 'real leather' or 'Made in England' on the
products. It's enough to have the royal crest.'
Mr Bodmer remembers fondly a visit from his most valued customer: 'She was
really interested and asked lots of questions. She's a very nice lady. Not
like the politicians.'
