IT WAS as close to a full house as Strasbourg ever gets, when Queen
Elizabeth II arrived to bestow her royal assent on 'this ever more important
Parliament of Europe'.
Downing Street previews of what Her Britannic Majesty was to tell Euro-MPs
had whipped up a fine froth of controversy, with Conservative Euro-sceptics
scenting a Foreign Office plot to sell the prerogatives of the mother of
parliaments down the Rhine to the mother-in-law of parliaments.
Labour European MP John Tomlinson, the inspiration behind previous
invitations to the Queen in 1988 and 1990 which Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
government had not seen fit to authorise, complained that the eve-of-visit
storm gave 'credibility today to a group of yesterday's men, wheeled out to
give knee-jerk reactions to things that everybody has now accepted'.
Lively, pre-speech discussion in Strasbourg on the insignificance of
national parliamentary traditions when set against the reconciling
enterprise of Europe - the bombshell allegedly embedded in the Queen's
address waiting to go off in Westminster - appeared to indicate the need for
an EC directive on the harmonisation of platitudes.
It either meant the Euro-sceptics' nightmare; or it meant there are not
really any significant differences in Europe's national systems; or it
paraphrased into 'please don't mind our parliamentary idiosyncrasies, which
are terribly useful when we want opt-outs of monetary union and the social
charter"; or perhaps even 'my ancestors gave up their sovereignty so why
can't they?' Once translated into the nine official languages of the
Community, the possibilities were likely to increase exponentially.
However, a 'Buckingham Palace spokesman' made clear that 'as a
constitutional monarch, Her Majesty speaks on the advice of her government'.
So that was the end of the bombshell story.
More than anything else, this visit by the only EC head of state not to have
addressed the parliament symbolised the transition from Thatcherite
hostility to the Community to the intention of Mr John Major, her successor,
to put the UK at 'the heart of Europe'.
The exercise went off without a hitch - unless it was the unsewn hem on the
Queen's blue coat, which prompted a 'hem, hem' from a noted royalist
newspaper.
The Queen drew up in the Renault model favoured by Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, who appeared in the chamber without
the emperor's crown Euro-sceptics assume him to covet, and was first to his
feet upon her entry.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the regal former French president, made his
entry after she had begun speaking - a tactic much favoured by his successor
Mr Francois Mitterrand at European summits.
She got a warm welcome from MEPs who spent part of yesterday squabbling
about seating arrangements. This row was triggered by the Euro-Conservative
adjunct of Her Majesty's government, which now that it has swelled the ranks
of the Christian Democrat bloc in Strasbourg has had to reseat (physically)
to the right of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's neo-fascist group.
The Queen's theme was the reconciliation of post-war Europe, strength in
diversity, and 'the necessary balance struck at Maastricht' enabling action
'on a European basis where the nature of a problem requires a European
response'. Enlargement of the EC and the nurture of eastern Europe were
emphasised - as much as anything by the 22 flags of the Council of Europe
flying where normally the 12 members of the EC club hang their pennants. But
unlike Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands at Maastricht, Queen Elizabeth did
not offer to 'sacrifice her head' (on the coinage of the realm) for European
Monetary Union.
It turned out to be 'differences of opinion and style' which were
'insignificant against the background of the proven commitment of Europeans
today to reconciliation and democracy', and the Buckingham Palace sources
insisted that no, there had been no change in the wording.
Her Majesty permitted herself a joke on the vigorous debating style British
members 'will no doubt have brought to the deliberations of this house . . .
a style which can be confrontational, as some of my ancestors found'.
Republican sentiment was wholly absent yesterday, however, and the Queen got
two ovations. At the lunch, the toast was 'Europe', washed down by Moet et
Chandon 1986. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the current Portuguese president of
the Council of Ministers, said he felt 'the European spirit was always there
(in the UK), but now it's slightly more visible.'
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner who prompted the UK
government's pre-Maastricht outburst about Commission meddling in national
'nooks and crannies', said he was 'moved and overcome by the presence of Her
Majesty the Queen'. One measure of her triumph was his decision to eschew
his habitual bright green-rimmed spectacles, and wear royal blue ones for
the occasion.
