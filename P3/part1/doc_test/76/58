WITH QUESTIONS of scandal and privacy echoing around the papers it is worth
noting how relative these things are: one nation's political scandal is
another nation's bore. In recent weeks Britain, France, and Germany have had
to face frightful revelations about their politicians. Italy does not count
since politicians there are expected to be frightful, and Italian newspapers
could not cope with the various Lamont 'scandals.'
The fact that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had inadvertently
rented his house to a 'sex therapist' was amusing enough, but the row over
his acceptance of a Treasury offer of a mere Pounds 4,000, which did not go
into his pocket anyway, was incomprehensible. The subsequent farcical
developments, involving the publication of his credit card account and
untrue stories relating to purchases of cheap champagne and cigarettes
ensured that all foreign interest evaporated.
And so to the tedium of the influence-peddling scandals in Germany. The
latest concerns the housing minister, Irmgard Schwaetzer, and a property
company, Germania. In a contribution to its house magazine the minister
seemed to be promoting the firm's interests. Earlier, the economics
minister, Jurgen Mollemann, had to resign because he had tried to help out
his wife's cousin over the matter of a patent on a supermarket trolley.
Because of their sublime banality, these typically German affairs attracted
little comment outside the country.
The only real horror story in this litany was the French blood contamination
affair. This involved hundreds of haemophiliacs who were infected with the
AIDS virus through state-run blood transfusions. French scandals have
considerable bearing on the current debate in Britain on the role of the
press. It is proposed, among other things, that there should be legal limits
on invasions of privacy.
The editor of the Sunday Times, Andrew Neill, said this would make Britain
like France, where, he elegantly argued, 'privacy laws have intimidated
newspapers from doing investigative journalism and made them poodles of the
political establishment.'
Maybe in the blood scandal the press could have acted sooner - but once the
story was rolling the media made a substantial contribution. The papers also
did some fine work on the blowing up of the Rainbow Warrior by French
security agents in New Zealand; the Pechiney share dealing racket would not
have emerged but for the work of the French press and Le Monde took on the
Socialist Party by helping to expose corruption there. French poodles even
bite their friends.
Their record compares favourably with the British bulldogs. It was not
heroic newspaper reporters who first shed light on the Guinness, BCCI,
Maxwell and Matrix-Churchill affairs. In France a restrictive law on
privacy, which allows 'public interest' as a defence, combines with a system
that makes libel cheap. This combination can help the press, if it is
interested in important matters rather than trivia - partly because it
discourages libel actions which perforce involve the plaintiff sacrificing
the otherwise guaranteed right of privacy.
Under the French system, means newspapers are fined if they reveal details
of the colours of the football team in which the minister of culture is
alleged to make love to his mistress. And they cannot publish pictures of
even English duchesses disporting themselves with their financial advisers
in a manner that falls short of the chaste standards that characterise the
English aristocracy. What they can do is to say that Monsieur Farfelu is a
crook and have a fair chance of getting away with it. In Britain the
situation is exactly the reverse thanks to the extraordinary strictness of
the libel laws which shield the guilty as well as the innocent and various
bits of secrecy legislation.
That has helped to ensure that the British debate on press freedom has
concentrated on the Royal Family for that is the story that is at risk. In
the great British theme park, the dream of happy royal marriages was
fabricated by the media and the royal press office. So when, as is now the
case, they turn out to be in the traditional mould there is a colossal row
which can, some say, lead to the destruction of the House of Windsor.
Had the press not connived at the new-fangled 'family values' vision of
royalty there would not be the trouble we are facing today. The real English
tradition is that the monarch and his or her spouse regard each other with
indifference or loathing. Queen Victoria notoriously broke with that
tradition in her relations with Prince Albert. She was not popular until
much later, after Prince Albert had died, which left the Queen 40 clear
years to achieve a sacred reputation unencumbered by fantasies of domestic
bliss. However, that does not now seem a likely prospect for the Prince of
Wales.
