GILBERT AND SULLIVAN by Michael Ffinch Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 294
pages
PENDING the archival biography of WS Gilbert himself on which an American
theatre historian has been busying herself for a decade, here is yet another
of those general books which from time to time re-scrutinise the Victorian
collaboration. Smoothly written, Michael Ffinch's text incorporates a
re-telling of the stories of the operettas and lengthy quotation from their
verses. He is in no doubt that the dramatist was 'a far greater man in every
way' than the composer.
Such a judgment, however, assumes a musical competence not evident in an
author who asserts that the title of Ruddigore 'is now often confused with
Verdi's Rigoletto'. The profusion of superscript figures and footnotes (or
rather back-notes) is, alas, a facade. With no scholarly evaluation of his
sources, Mr Ffinch reinstates a discredited anecdote on one page, yet cites
in another context the later work which did the discrediting.
The fictional stories that Sullivan's grandfather rose to the army rank of
sergeant and guarded Napoleon's heart on St Helena, and that Arthur Sullivan
himself as a boy chorister sang at the christening of the Duke of Albany
(Queen Victoria's youngest son) should have been nailed up for ever. On the
other hand, the author has failed to catch up with recent discoveries about
Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan's first, 'lost' joint work.
Repeatedly misnaming a character in The Grand Duke as 'Drummkopf' instead of
'Dummkopf', Mr Ffinch fails to perceive Gilbert's German joke. The misnaming
of one of Sullivan's non-Gilbert operettas as Hadden (for Haddon) Hall and
the misquotation from Trial by Jury likewise betray an uncertain foothold on
the terrain. The nineteen photo-illustrations are well chosen.
