FT  21 AUG 92 / Royal rebuke on Duchess photos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM PALACE yesterday criticised publication of photographs in the
Daily Mirror and other tabloid newspapers which showed the Duchess of York
with Mr John Bryan, a US friend, by a villa poolside in the south of France.
The intimate photographs, some of which were reproduced in The Sun and Today
newspapers from the Spanish magazine Hola, were taken with a long-distance
lens by an Italian paparazzi photographer.
In a statement understood to have the authority of the Queen and the Duke of
York, Buckingham Palace said: 'We strongly disapprove of the publication of
photographs taken in such circumstances.' The Duke and Duchess were
yesterday with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Balmoral.
Publication of the photographs has reopened the argument over privacy and
press freedom. Mr Bryan, a 37-year-old bachelor who has been described as
the Duchess's financial adviser, failed on Wednesday in a High Court attempt
to stop publication.
Mirror Group Newspapers said a further 80,000 copies were printed yesterday
after nearly 3.5m copies produced overnight had sold out by 9am. 'Many of
our regular readers have been unable to buy their copy,' it said. 'These
figures show that there is enormous public interest in the subject.'
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said yesterday
that he had yet to be approached with a formal complaint by Mr Bryan that
the publication was in breach of the press code of conduct. He told BBC
Radio that he would strongly resist calls for a tightening up of the law on
privacy.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Commons media committee chairman, said the pictures
appeared to be a 'flagrant breach of privacy', but should not prompt calls
for a legal clampdown. The only way forward was self-regulation overseen by
the commission.
Mr Richard Stott, Daily Mirror editor, defended publication of the pictures,
which appeared over seven pages. He said Mr Bryan had given countless
interviews saying the Duke of York and his wife only needed time to achieve
a reconciliation. 'He frequently said he was only the financial adviser,' Mr
Stott said.
