Asia-Pacific Region. Asia Can Make up for Russia's Losses in 
the West. Aleksandr Panov Ready To Give Helping Hand to Russian 
Businessmen for Asian Market"] 
  [Text] Russian politicians of the highest rank have 
repeatedly underlined that broader cooperation with the 
countries of Asia could plug some of the gaps in Russia's 
relations with the West. This equally applies to trade and 
economic relations, as well as political ones. Their 
invigoration will be discussed in the course of a tour of the 
countries of Central Asia, the Russian Far East, and China by 
Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is 
setting off on this trip on 24 January. Aleksandr Panov, who 
has recently changed his job from ambassador to Seoul to that of 
deputy minister of foreign affairs, kindly agreed to comment on 
the state of Russia's relations in the Asia-Pacific Region in an 
interview with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. 
<H5>  Russia Faces Asia </H5>
  In Mr. Panov's opinion, Russia has till this moment been 
paying its main attention to broader relations with the West. 
This can partially be explained by the fact that the more 
economically developed part of the Russian territory is in 
Europe. However, the diplomat believes, relations with Asia are 
extremely promising only if because of the current rapid 
economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Of no minor 
importance is also the fact that Asian countries are not 
refusing to buy finished products from Russia. Mr. Panov thinks 
that Moscow has been able to do much in recent years to expand 
trade and economic relations with the Asia-Pacific region: far 
from falling, the volume of trade has grown. Russia's political 
ties with countries in the region are also picking up: Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan took place after all, and he also went 
to South Korea, India, and China. This years opens with a visit 
to the PRC by Andrey Kozyrev. In Moscow, they are awaiting 
South Korea President Kim Yong-sam, and the head of Japan's 
cabinet, Morahiro Hosokawa. 
<H5>  Foreign Ministry Offers its Services to Russian Businessmen </H5>
  Mr. Panov believes that a stronger Russian position in the 
Asia- Pacific Region will be helped by its participation in 
regional organizations. Russia already today takes part in two 
of them: the Pacific Economic Council, which brings together 
private businesses; and the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council. Membership in these structures helps Russian 
entrepreneurs keep abreast of all important events in the 
region. According to the diplomat, entrepreneurs of the Russian 
Far East began to trade independently on Asia's markets in 
recent years. Today they account for nearly 50 percent 
($600-700 million) of Russia's trade with South Korea. The 
business contacts, however, are not always successful owing to 
unfamiliarity with the region. Mr. Panov therefore advises that 
Russian businessmen increasingly seek assistance from Russian 
embassies and trade missions which, in his words, are ready to 
help them find partners. 
  Mr. Panov thinks that membership in regional structures 
would 
help Russia avoid competition with countries like the United 
States and Japan that traditionally wield strong influence in 
the region and are naturally reluctant to yield ground to 
Moscow. The diplomat noted with regret, however, that real 
competition is a long way off because U.S. trade with 
Asia-Pacific countries is around $300 billion, while Russia's 
trade with the Asia-Pacific region has never exceeded $10-15 
billion. As for boosting these figures through arms exports, 
one should not expect contracts worth billions in the near 
future. Russia, he believes, lacks sufficient experience in 
this business. Besides, Asian markets, arms markets in 
particular, are traditionally geared to supplies from the United 
States, France, and Great Britain. 
<H5>  To Draw Borders With China Is Easier Than With Japan </H5>
  Mr. Panov thinks that, for the first time in decades, 
relations between Russia and China are simply normal: "In the 
past, we either fraternized or argued." Problems do exist, of 
course, but they are solvable. One is territorial. There is a 
widely held opinion that Russia is handing over its territories 
to the PRC unilaterally. What really is happening, according to 
him, is that Beijing also makes concessions. The diplomat also 
terms as promising Russia's recent proposal on the joint 
economic use of these border territories. The other problem is 
the transparency of the Russian- Chinese border. There too, the 
Russian Foreign Ministry is taking measures to limit no-visa 
entry by the Chinese. 
  As for Japan, in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Tokyo, the sides have in full measure come to realize the entire 
complexity of the territorial problem. Mr. Panov believes that 
one should not expect an appreciable progress in its solution in 
the near future. According to him, Russia and Japan will start 
a new round of talks in February, but a complete settlement of 
this question should be preceded by the process of rapprochement 
in the sides' positions on the entire set of both political and 
economic problems.
