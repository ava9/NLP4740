  [Text] Russia still insists that before imposing sanctions 
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], an 
international conference on resolving the nuclear crisis on the 
Korean peninsula should be convened. Russian Vice Foreign 
Minister Panov reiterated this view in a meeting with the 
Chinese ambassador in Moscow on Thursday [9 June]. He had a 
similar talk with the DPRK ambassador earlier. The idea of 
calling an international conference was proposed by President 
Yeltsin, who maintains that North Korea, South Korea, Russia, 
the U.S., Japan, and China should participate in the conference.
