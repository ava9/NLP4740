  [Text] Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- Juan Jose Leon 
Vega, Cuban Ambassador to Korea, Monday hosted a reception in 
celebration of the birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The ambassador in his speech said the dear leader Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il is energetically leading the overall affairs of the 
party and the state. "The new looks taken on by Pyongyang and 
many miracles wrought in all parts of the country are a 
brilliant fruition of his wise guidance," the ambassador stated. 
  "All the moves of the imperialists against the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea," he said, "will be frustrated by the 
might of the Korean people united in one mind behind the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il." 
  The ambassador further said: 
  "As they have great parties and great peoples and, notably, 
as they are guided by Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Fidel 
Castro Ruz, great leaders, Cuba and Korea will win surely." 
  He said the party, government and people of Cuba fully 
support the Korean people's just cause of the independent and 
peaceful reunification of the country, adding: "This support 
will be expressed continuously till the 70 million Korean people 
have raised stormy cheers of reunification at the Kim Il-song 
square." 
  Kang Song-san, Politburo member of the Central Committee of 
the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the Administration 
Council, in his speech said the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
has performed undying feats for the country and the nation, the 
times and mankind with his outstanding ideological and 
theoretical activities and wise guidance. 
  "Seeing the complicated and tragic developments in the 
international arena in recent years, the Korean and the Cuban 
people felt more keenly than anyone else the national pride and 
honor of making revolution under the guidance of great and 
illustrious leaders," he said, and continued: 
  "We express firm solidarity with the Cuban people, noting 
with high appreciation that they, rallied close around Comrade 
Fidel Castro, the supreme leader of their revolution, invariably 
abide by the revolutionary principle and advance along the road 
of socialism, courageously overcoming difficulties and trials. 
  "The Cuban people's cause of defending the motherland and 
revolution and socialism will certainly end in victory. 
  "We will make every effort to further deepen the bonds of 
friendship, solidarity and unity with the Cuban people, true to 
the instructions of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il that 
the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries 
should be held dear." 
  Invited to the reception were Kim Yong-nam, Politburo member 
of the WPK Central Committee and vice premier of the 
Administration Council and foreign minister, Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Chang-chol, vice premier 
of the Administration Council, and others.
