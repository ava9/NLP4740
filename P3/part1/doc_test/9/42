  [Text] Iraq has recently notified South Korea that it will 
temporarily close down its embassy in Seoul, citing poor 
economic conditions in the country caused by a long-standing 
U.N. trade embargo. 
  In the notification delivered to the Foreign Ministry April 
6, Baghdad hoped that despite the measure, "the friendly 
relations" between the two countries would be strengthened, said 
a ministry official. 
  He said the Iraqi government also promised to reopen its 
embassy here as soon as its economic conditions improve. 
  The Iraqi Embassy housed in a two-story building in 
Tongbinggo- tong, central Seoul, will be actually shut down late 
next month, said the official. 
  South Korea and Iraq established formal diplomatic ties in 
July 1989, upgrading the consulate-general in each others 
capital to an embassy. 
  The Seoul government, however, withdrew embassy staff, 
including the ambassador, from Baghdad in January 1991 when 
tensions were mounting in the Gulf region after the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait the previous year. 
  South Korean diplomats so far have not returned to Baghdad. 
  The ministry official said a South Korean diplomat who is 
working as acting ambassador to Iraq is now stationed in the 
Jordanian capital of Amman. 
  Since setting up diplomatic ties in 1989, Iraq has not 
assigned an ambassador to Seoul and has been represented by a 
charge d'affaires. 
  While Iraq cited its economic predicament as the reason for 
its decision to close down the embassy in Seoul, some diplomatic 
observers here suspect the decision may reflect Iraq's 
dissatisfaction with Seoul for not reopening its embassy in 
Baghdad. 
  When reached by phone, Taha H. Mohammed, Iraqi charge 
d'affaires, rebuffed the speculation. 
  He emphasized the decision was from a purely economic 
motivation. 
  "We'll be ready to come back and open our embassy again 
(when 
the Iraqi economy gets better)," he said. 
  "We have found Korean people and companies cooperative with 
Iraq and I hope good relationship will still be maintained 
between the two countries," he added. (KKH)
