<F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "North Korea Appointed Kim </F>
Il-song's Son for Finland"] 
  [Text] North Korea is sending Kim Pyong-il, the second son 
of leader Kim Il-song, to be ambassador to Finland. Kim Pyong-il 
was appointed ambassador already in the middle of last year and 
should have arrived in Helsinki by early March, but according to 
the Protocol Section of the Finnish Foreign Ministry, the new 
ambassador has not yet come. In a statement from the North 
Korean Embassy, the envoy will be in charge of conducting 
affairs. The previous ambassador left Helsinki in December. He 
was expected to handle affairs for only six months. Illness was 
given as the reason for his early departure. Kim Pyong-il has 
previously served as ambassador in Sofia. Kim Pyong-il is not as 
visible as his older brother Kim Chong-il, who is expected to 
succeed his father as North Korea's leader.
