<F P=106> [Interview with DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil by Sergey </F>
Turchenko, date and place not given: "Threat of Blockade: Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, Talks About the Provocative 
U.S. Policy on the Korean Peninsula"] 
  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has flared up 
again sharply recently. The reason for this is apparently an 
internal matter relating to the DPRK's domestic economic 
activity: The latter has decided to replace some fuel rods at an 
experimental nuclear reactor. IAEA experts were invited in good 
time to monitor this work. Hardly had they had time to begin 
work than people in the United States kicked up what is clearly 
a propaganda fuss about the impossibility of the technical 
inspection of the fuel rods and began voicing a priori 
suspicions that the DPRK is producing plutonium for nuclear 
weapons. And it is on these grounds that the "world policeman" 
is demanding an economic blockade of North Korea and other 
sanctions. What is behind this campaign? We put that question 
to Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK Ambassador to Russia. 
  [Son Song-pil] I want to stress that we immediately gave the 
IAEA experts all the documentation relating to the method for 
the technical inspection of the fuel rods. The same 
documentation was also sent to the U.S. side. They promised us 
that they would study it. We expressed a readiness for any 
compromise if our method failed to satisfy the specialists in 
any way. However, a calm solution of the question was clearly 
not in the U.S. side's plans. Without waiting for the 
specialists' assessment the politicians mounted a noisy 
propaganda campaign aimed at inclining the United Nations toward 
sanctions against our country. But the main task of the United 
States remains unchanged -- it is to stifle a socialist state in 
Northeast Asia. In this connection we state that if sanctions 
are imposed on us we will take appropriate measures. At the 
same time we state that we will regard the imposition of 
sanctions as a declaration of war against us. At the same time 
we stress that we do not want to aggravate the situation and we 
believe that the nuclear problem can be resolved only on the 
basis of a simultaneous and comprehensive solution of all the 
questions connected with it. 
  [Turchenko] Can you tell us in greater detail what kind of 
documents were handed over to the U.S. side, because for some 
reason the press is saying nothing about them? 
  [Son Song-pil] They contain a technical description of our 
methods of measuring fuel rods. These methods have been 
approved and fully correspond to our technical capabilities. In 
this connection I repeat that we have informed the United States 
of our readiness for compromise options. But we have not 
received any suggestions from the United States. Apart from a 
completely unjustified demand for the inspection of two military 
installations which have nothing to do with the reactor. And 
that, after all, is a flagrant violation of the country's 
sovereignty. We will not agree to such a step. 
  [Turchenko] Can you explain, please, what is meant by the 
simultaneous and comprehensive solution of the problem? 
  [Son Song-pil] The United States is demanding steps only 
from our side right now. We, however, propose that everything 
be resolved as a package. For our part we are ready to ensure 
the possibility of regular and random inspections under [po] 
nuclear guarantees. We are also ready to return to the 
framework of the nuclear weapon nonproliferation treaty, which 
the DPRK suspended in response to the high-handedness of the 
United States toward North Korea. This, so to speak, is our 
contribution to the settlement of the problem. But at the same 
time the Americans must renounce the threat to use nuclear 
weapons against our country. In this context the U.S. nuclear 
weapons and nuclear bases must be evacuated from South Korea. 
The "Team Spirit" military maneuvers directed against us must 
also be terminated. In addition to all this we demand the 
renunciation of the provocative policy toward the DPRK and the 
normalization of relations with our country. That is the U.S. 
contribution to a solution. 
  However, the Americans are demanding that we unilaterally 
accept their jurisdiction and then they will see whether it is 
worth fulfilling our demands. The problem cannot be resolved on 
that basis, which is, to put it mildly, unjust. 
  [Turchenko] You spoke of appropriate measures in response to 
the sanctions. What do you mean? 
  [Son Song-pil] Concrete sanctions will lead to concrete 
measures. It is difficult to make predictions just now. But we 
have stated that if any country takes part in sanctions we will 
view that as a declaration of war with all the consequences that 
such an action entails. 
  [Turchenko] How do you view Russia's proposal to convene an 
international conference on the solution of the Korean problem? 
  [Son Song-pil] A conference is a step toward the solution of 
the problem by peaceful means. Of course, we give the due 
assessment to this proposal. It has special significance also 
because the Americans have stated that it is impossible to 
continue the Korean-U.S. talks. If an international conference 
is held on a fair and equal basis we will support it. 
  [Turchenko] Apart form the general proposal, has the Russian 
side provided any materials which give concrete substance to the 
form and content of the conference? 
  [Son Song-pil] Unfortunately our side has not received any 
such materials to date. I recently had a conversation with 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov. The ideas suggested so 
far relate purely to the framework of this conference. It is 
to be hoped that this question will receive a positive 
development.
