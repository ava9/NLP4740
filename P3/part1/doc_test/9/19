  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb -- China and North Korea are moving 
toward improving their relations. While China's understanding 
of North Korea and its aid to the latter are indispensable for 
North Korea that is now beset with the nuclear issue and food 
shortages, China's maintenance of its influence on North Korea 
is an important card for China to play in diplomatic 
negotiations with Western nations, especially the United States. 
China-North Korea relations, that were once chilled by the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South 
Korea, are now moving toward improvement because of the 
coincidence of their interests and their policies on the 
"nuclear" issue and the complex international situation. 
  At one time, North Korea went so far as to criticize China 
as 
a revisionist and betrayer, but their relations appear to have 
normalized completely. As South Korean Ambassador to China 
Whang Pyung-tae explicitly stated in Seoul on 2 February, 
China-North Korea relations have improved substantially. 
  A visit by Whang Chang-yop, secretary of the Workers' Party 
of Korea (chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Foreign 
Affairs Committee) to China from mid-January to late January 
illustrated their improved relations. Mr. Whang was the 
highest-ranking North Korean official to visit China since 
August 1993, when China and South Korea established diplomatic 
relations. According to an informed source, Mr. Whang visited 
China in response to President Kim Il-song's intention to 
rebuild friendly relations with China. 
  At a meeting with Mr. Whang and his entourage, General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed the "friendship forged with 
blood." This expression is a barometer to gauge the 
friendliness of relations between the two countries and the 
expression has not been used since China and South Korea 
established diplomatic relations. 
  There are two reasons North Korea has decided to improve 
relations with China. First, China has persistently opposed any 
pressure or sanctions on North Korea. North Korea has no reason 
to see the Chinese attitude as negative. 
  Second, North Korea, which has been beset with economic 
stagnation and sluggish growth in food production, is in a 
situation where it is badly in need of China's aid. South 
Korean Ambassador Whang made it clear that "China is not asking 
North Korea to pay its imports from China in foreign currency as 
it has done in the past" out of consideration to North Korea. 
  According to the same source, North Korea is expected to 
strongly ask China for food aid and it is highly possible that 
President Kim Il-song and his son Secretary Kim Chong-il will 
visit China this year. 
  As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development, China believes that North Korea has no capability 
to develop nuclear weapons even if it intends to do so. China 
also considers the issue a very important agenda item in 
dialogue with Japan, the United States, and South Korea. It is 
unclear how much influence China holds over North Korea, but it 
is true that China is giving a great deal of consideration to 
North Korea in an attempt to secure its influence over North 
Korea. As an example, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has 
decided to defer his planned visit to South Korea despite South 
Korea's strong wish for his early visit.
