<F P=106> [Alberto Miguez report: "Spain Will Establish Relations with </F>
Macedonia in July"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Spanish Government is determined to 
give the Greek Government a "period of grace" to negotiate an 
agreement over the next six months with the "former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia" -- the name under which the new Balkan 
state is known at the United Nations. This period is also 
intended to facilitate the work of the Greek presidency of the 
European Union [EU], which began 1 January and ends 30 June. 
  Although Foreign Minister Javier Solana has diplomatically 
denied during several of his parliamentary appearances that the 
establishment of relations with Macedonia by six EU countries 
(Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, and 
Denmark) represents a major failure of the common foreign and 
security policy, it could hardly be interpreted otherwise when 
half the EU countries reject what the other six approve in an 
especially difficult situation such as that prevailing in the 
former Yugoslavia. To this must be added another affront which 
the Spanish Government will hardly forget: Chancellor Kohl 
publicly lied during the Spanish-German summit in Granada when 
-- asked at a news conference whether his country was preparing 
to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia 
-- he replied that the matter was not on his government's agenda 
for the next few months. Ten days later Bonn announced the 
exchange of ambassadors with Skopje. 
  For Spain and the other EU countries which did not support 
the French, British, and German initiative, the aim now is to 
facilitate the course of the Greek presidency, which looks like 
being difficult. "To send ambassadors to Skopje now will not 
resolve the political and security problem threatening that 
republic and the Kosovo region. The United Nations undertook a 
serious commitment by sending Blue Helmets to Macedonia, and 
Spain supports this decision. We must bide our time and hope 
that the Macedonians and Greeks will reach a compromise 
solution," a Spanish diplomatic source told LA VANGUARDIA. 
  The Spanish Government has been quite sensitive to the 
criticisms condemning it for not joining the group of the 
European "heavyweights" in establishing diplomatic relations 
with Macedonia. However, everything indicates that the exchange 
of ambassadors will not take place until midsummer.
