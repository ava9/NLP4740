  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
officials reaffirmed Monday that Washington will not hold 
further high-level dialogue with North Korea unless the latter 
allows satisfactory international nuclear inspections. 
  The inspection deadline is early May as indicated in last 
month's U.N. Security Council presidential statement, Kim 
Sam-hun, South Korea's ambassador on North Korean nuclear 
affairs, said after meeting his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci 
in high-level consultations here. 
  The two sides also reaffirmed the principle that 
inter-Korean 
dialogue is indispensable to fully clearing up the nuclear 
problem. 
  "The most immediate issue is getting North Korea to accept 
additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA)," Kim told reporters after nearly three hours of talks. 
  The next Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks will be the 
final opportunity to resolve the nuclear dispute, the ambassador 
said. "The South Korean and U.S. Governments are ready to 
discuss North Korea's interests and demands in the political, 
security and economic fields related to improving relations once 
the nuclear obstacle is out of the way." 
  Kim suggested adjustments in the North Korean-U.S. "small 
package deal" that included suspension of this year's "Team 
Spirit" military exercise that Seoul and Washington stage 
annually. 
  South Korea and the United States announced earlier the 
maneuvers would be cancelled this year on condition that North 
Korea allowed full nuclear checks. 
  "We can't say that the entire agreement is void, but 
adjustments are inevitable," said Kim. 
  Gallucci, assistant secretary of State who was appointed 
chairman of the newly established U.S. senior policy steering 
group on Korea, flew into Seoul on Sunday. 
  The consultations came immediately after Seoul announced 
last 
week that it would no longer demand inter-Korean dialogue as a 
precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks. 
  Kim was at pains to emphasize that Seoul has not given up on 
inter-Korean channels. 
  "The two countries confirmed the principle that the issues 
of 
the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear situation, have to 
be solved through inter-Korean dialogue," said Kim. 
  "We agreed that while South-North Korean and North 
Korean-U.S. talks should be harmonized, the two channels must be 
managed as complementary," he said. 
  But future South-North dialogue "will have to carry 
substance 
and be meaningful," he said. "The dialogue will be aimed 
specifically at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula." 
  The timing and format of the dialogue are under negotiation 
between Seoul and Washington, he said, citing the inter-Korean 
Joint Nuclear Control Commission and prime ministers' talks as 
possible examples. 
  The ambassador denied speculation that Washington may hold 
the next high-level meeting with Pyongyang just on North Korea's 
promise to permit further IAEA inspections. 
  "There must be full and complete additional inspections by 
the IAEA," he said. 
  Kim referred to the March 31 statement by the Security 
Council president which asked the IAEA to report back to the 
council on North Korea's nuclear program in a few weeks, which 
is tacitly understood as early May. 
  "You can assume that the period mentioned in the statement 
is, in actuality, the deadline," he said.
