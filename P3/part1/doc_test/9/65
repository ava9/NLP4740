"North Korea Has Promised `an Eye for an Eye...'"] 
  [Text] "We will respond to war with war! Our 
countermeasures will depend on the sanctions applied by the 
United States and other countries," Son Song-pil, North Korea's 
ambassador to Russia, declared yesterday at a session of the 
State Duma Committee for International Affairs. 
  The Korean representative called the whole Korean nuclear 
question "nuclear suspicions invented by the Americans," while 
the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, according 
to him, is "aimed at destroying North Korea's socialist system 
and the republic as a whole." 
  According to the ambassador's statement, North Korea wants 
to 
resolve the problem peacefully but, given the slightest pressure 
or threats from America or other states, Kim Il-song's country 
is prepared to counter one blow with another. 
  The DPRK's official representative took a great dislike to 
the Russian foreign minister's Friday Duma speech and to the 10 
June Kozyrev-Christopher joint news conference, at which the 
possibility of the simultaneous introduction of sanctions and 
holding of a peace conference on Korea was reported. 
  "There can be no question of simultaneous sanctions and a 
conference," Comrade Son Song-pil said, at the same time adding 
that the DPRK is seriously considering the Russian proposals and 
that meetings have already been held with representatives of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  According to the ambassador's report, during his stay in the 
DPRK ex-President Carter conveyed U.S. proposals which include 
the U.S. abandonment of sanctions, the provision of a light 
water reactor to the DPRK through third countries or through 
international organizations, and consent to a third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  "If these conditions are fulfilled, Korea is prepared to 
keep 
inspectors at the nuclear installations. But a full-scale 
inspection cannot be carried out during the talks, since this 
would signify the DPRK's return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty," the ambassador declared, resolutely emphasizing: "If 
the talks are held on our terms, the nuclear problem will be 
removed!"
