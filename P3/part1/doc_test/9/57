  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation 
from the post of Japanese prime minister and the expected 
formation of a new government in the near future will not lead 
to changes in Tokyo's policies toward Russia. This was clearly 
stated by the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, Koji Watanabe, in 
an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Policy 
toward Russia is one of the most important elements of Japanese 
diplomacy," he stressed. 
  The ambassador said that the Tokyo declaration, adopted by 
the leaders of the two countries during the visit by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to Japan last October had created "a new 
basis for further progress in Russo-Japanese relations." The 
diplomat said that "the continuation of constant efforts to 
develop relations, on the basis of this declaration, is the 
consistent and immutable policy of our country." 
  Koji Watanabe recalled that during the visit to Moscow last 
month by Tsutomu Hata, Japan's deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister -- who is regarded as the principal contender for the 
post of head of the new government -- the parties agreed to 
advance steadily toward a settlement of the territorial problem, 
based on the Tokyo declaration. The Russian side stressed its 
commitment to the policy of deepening reform, and the Japanese 
side emphasized that there would be no change in its policy of 
assisting these reforms. 
  The ambassador indirectly confirmed that the change in the 
Japanese cabinet would not remove from the agenda the question 
of a visit to Russia by the Japanese prime minister this year. 
He recalled that the invitation to make the visit, which 
Yeltsin conveyed to the Japanese prime minister last October, 
was confirmed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, the head of the Russian 
government, and Andrey Kozyrev, the foreign minister, during 
their recent meetings with Hata. "I think that when Japan has a 
new prime minister, a specific date for his visit to Russia will 
be agreed along diplomatic channels," the ambassador said. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from diplomatic sources that the 
Japanese premier's visit to Moscow this year may be preceded by 
a visit to Tokyo by Andrey Kozyrev in order to prepare for the 
summit meeting.
