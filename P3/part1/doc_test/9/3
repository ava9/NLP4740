Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] The forecast about personnel changes in Russia's 
Foreign Ministry, published by INTERFAX on New Year's eve, has 
been completely realized. On December 30, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin endorsed the appointment of three deputy foreign 
ministers. 
  Russia's former ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov, has been 
appointed to the post of first deputy foreign minister. The 
other deputy foreign ministers are Albert Chernyshov, 
ex-ambassador to Turkey, and Aleksandr Panov, ex-ambassador to 
the Republic of Korea. Panov has been replaced by former deputy 
foreign minister Georgiy Kunadze. 
  According to INTERFAX sources, Chernyshov and Panov will be 
in charge of Asian affairs (Panov - Japan and Asian and Pacific 
Region, and Chernyshov - the Middle East). 
  The letter of resignation handed to President Yeltsin by 
former first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
following his election to the State Duma as a representative of 
the Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin bloc makes it unclear what Ivanov 
will do, said a high-ranking Russian diplomat. 
  He said that according to initial plans, Kozyrev was to have 
two first deputies - Adamishin and Ivanov, the latter to be in 
charge of Europe. Now that Adamishin has decided to quit the 
Foreign Ministry, Ivanov's responsibilities are likely to be 
enlarged, he said. 
  In his opinion, the vacancy will be filled soon. 
  "Practice shows that the minister must have two first 
deputies," he added. 
  He found it difficult to say who exactly will become one of 
Kozyrev's first deputies. "The situation will become clear next 
week, when Kozyrev will resume his work following a brief 
leave," he said. 
  He also noted that the personnel changes should not be 
perceived as an alarm signal. "It is normal practice, allowing 
diplomats to develop," said the Russian diplomat.
