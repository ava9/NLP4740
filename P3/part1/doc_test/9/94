<F P=106> ["Cuba Is Interested in Increased Italian Investments, </F>
Trade, and Tourism" -- PRENSA LATINA headline] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 May (PL) -- Cuba's new ambassador to Italy, 
Mario Rodriguez, affirmed today in this capital that his country 
is interested in increased Italian investments, commerce, and 
tourism. 
  During a news conference on the occasion of presenting his 
credentials to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Cuban 
diplomat said that his mission is to make known and to earn 
respect for the situation in his fatherland through a ready 
dialogue with the local authorities. 
  Commenting on his meeting with the Italian president, 
Rodriguez said that he was pleasantly impressed by the attention 
Scalfaro pays to and the knowledge he has of Cuba and Latin 
America. 
  In explaining the absence of conflicts in bilateral 
relations 
between the two countries, the ambassador said that annually 
Cuba receives 70,000 tourists from Italy, the island's fourth 
most important source of tourists, after Canada, Mexico, and 
Spain. 
  Regarding investments, Rodriguez explained that one of every 
10 Cubans is either a technician or a professional, something 
that represents a guarantee to any nation, and that investors 
have legal guarantees that they can export their profits. 
  Cuba is heading for an economy capable of allowing the 
island 
to see through a political project that has been obstructed for 
35 years by a relentless U.S. economic blockade. 
  It is absurd to see, he said, how at the end of the century 
and after the occurrence of many international changes that 
produced political, geopolitical, and economic mutations, the 
embargo not only is being maintained, it is also being 
encouraged. 
  Until his designation as ambassador to Italy, Mario 
Rodriguez 
was vice minister of foreign relations and before that, from 
1986 to 1990, he headed the Cuban diplomatic mission in Prague.
