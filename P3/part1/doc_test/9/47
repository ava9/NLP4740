  [Text] As former U.S. president Jimmy Carter was in 
Pyongyang to defuse tensions sparked by the suspected North 
Korean nuclear weapons program yesterday, a crack appeared in 
the South Korea-U.S. tuning of nuclear strategy against the 
North. 
  An unusually heavy mood was felt at Chongwadae [presidential 
offices]. Even there were signs of embarrassment as Carter's 
first round of talks with North Korean leader Kim Il-song and 
subsequent press conference received a quick response from 
Washington indicating the resumption of dialogue. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide handling the North 
Korean nuclear issue, avoided reporters. He meets the press 
daily to give them background briefings at his office, a daily 
practice since tension over the nuclear standoff increased. 
  Instead, he huddled with his aides in charge of national 
security affairs, defense and diplomacy. 
  He had an unscheduled meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Korea 
James Laney. Chong was to receive a visit from Russian 
Ambassador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze who observers said was to 
explain to him his government's position on the U.S.-led draft 
sanctions resolution to be put to the United Nations Security 
Council. But he canceled the meeting with Kunadze to meet Laney. 
  Chongwadae appeared embarrassed to find out that Carter's 
visit to Pyongyang, which was billed as private and 
self-initiated, can in no way be viewed in that context. 
  In his June 10 telephone conversation with President Kim 
Yong-sam who was leery of possible adverse affects of Carter's 
planned visit to the North, Clinton assured him that the trip to 
Pyongyang was self-initiated and had nothing to do with his 
administration. 
  Clinton also assured President Kim that he will not change 
his mind in pursuing sanctions against the renegade communist 
country whatever conciliatory message Carter may bring from 
Pyongyang. 
  President Kim has stressed from time to time that no 
dialogue 
will be sought with the North until the first-phase of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions are imposed. He has also added that 
this position was agreed to by the United States. 
  Since Pyongyang's unilateral refueling of the 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor without monitoring by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), President Kim has held the belief that a 
lack of tough measures by Seoul and the international community 
has allowed the North to take the initiatives at every turn of 
developments. Now it is necessary to turn the tables around, 
stressing the need to impose sanctions. 
  However, yesterday's dispatches from Pyongyang quoting 
Carter 
and the quick response from the White House have Seoul and 
Washington turning toward dialogue rather than determined action 
by the international community. 
  During his two and a half hour dinner meeting with Carter on 
the eve of his departure for Pyongyang, President Kim reportedly 
said he did not want to add to the "burden" on Carter's 
shoulder, a position indicating that he did not ask Carter to 
convey any important message of his own to Kim Il-song. 
  He was said to have only explained in detail his 
government's 
position against the North's nuclear ambitions. 
  Apart from the discrepancies between Seoul and Washington, 
there are some mistakes in judgment on the part of Chongwadae 
staffers and officials of the National Unification Board. 
  They failed to give due weight to Carter's visit. 
  It was too late when a Chongwadae staffer learned that 
Carter 
would be greeted by Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong of North 
Korea at the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  Pointing out the fact, the official stressed the need to pay 
attention to Pyongyang's intention which he said is to regard 
Carter as a "political negotiator" not just a visitor on a 
private mission. 
  But this was not taken seriously by senior officials, it was 
said.
