  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Ambassador to China said on Tuesday that relations between North 
Korea and China, which had deteriorated shortly after the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and China, 
seem to have recovered. 
  Hwang Pyong-tae, here to attend the annual conference of 
Korean ambassadors and envoys, said at a bull session with 
journalists that the recent visit to Beijing by Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the North Korean Workers' Party, had helped to 
improve the two nations' relations. 
  North Korea had criticized China for being "revisionist" and 
even "a traitor" since Seoul formed diplomatic ties with Beijing 
in August 1992. 
  "North Korea recently sent many people to the Chinese cities 
of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to make them learn 
directly the Chinese way of reform and opening. North Korea 
seems to be changing now," he said. 
  Meanwhile, China's position on the North Korean nuclear 
issue 
is that if South Korea and the United States keep talking with 
North Korea, the problem will be solved, he said. 
  "Especially, China thinks that North Korea will push ahead 
with policies of reform and opening once its nuclear problem is 
solved." 
  Acknowledging the seriousness of the nuclear problem, 
Beijing 
is trying to persuade Pyongyang to settle the matter before Feb. 
21, when the Board of Governors' meeting of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is scheduled, he added. 
  On reports of a possible visit by Kim Il-song to Beijing, he 
said, "North Korean President Kim Il-song, who had visited China 
as many as 39 times, has not visited Beijing since 1992. I 
think it's about time for him to visit there, as relations 
between Pyongyang and Beijing have recovered." 
  Meanwhile, he expected that before President Kim Yong-sam's 
visit to China in late March, Seoul and Beijing will be able to 
conclude aviation, cultural cooperation, and double taxation 
avoidance agreements.
