  [Text] New Russian Ambassador Georgy Kunadze met with 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu for half an hour yesterday [12 
January] to give him a copy of the letter of credentials he will 
formally present to President Kim Yong-sam later. 
  Kunadze is no stranger to Han as the two have met several 
times as researcher and professor at academic conferences while 
the former was serving at the IMEMO (Institute of World Economy 
and International Relations). 
  He expressed a hope to learn the Korean language during 
talks 
with Minister Han, according to a ministry official who was 
present at the meeting. Majoring in Japanese at Moscow 
University, Kunadze is a fluent Japanese speaker. 
  The Russian envoy was quoted as saying that his government 
plans to send more diplomats to Seoul, adding that the Russian 
embassy is a little small. Touching on his official residence 
south of Mt. Namsan, he also said that the house is good as 
living quarters but small for social functions, as if suggesting 
early settlement of the ownership of the former Russian legation 
site in downtown Seoul, according to the ministry official. 
  Former ambassador Alexander Panov has started working as 
vice 
foreign minister in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs covering 
Korea, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Kunadze 
was quoted as saying. 
  While serving as vice minister, Kunadze was responsible for 
personnel and administration affairs in addition to Asia-Pacific 
and southwest Asian affairs. 
  He also met with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong for 
about 35 minutes. Vice Minister Hong had served as ambassador 
to Moscow for one year before he became vice minister last March. 
  He is expected to present the letter of credentials to 
President Kim late this month or early next month along with 
three other new ambassadors, the ministry official said.
