  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Talks between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his South Korean counterpart 
Han Sung-chu began in Moscow today. 
  The first item of the agenda is the preparation of a visit 
of 
President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam to Russia, which 
is scheduled for early June, Kozyrev said before the beginning 
of the talks. Speaking about the nuclear problem at the Korean 
Peninsula, Kozyrev pointed out that "unfortunately, bilateral 
efforts did not bring the desired results, and, I think, we 
should expand the range of consultations and consider some other 
approaches in order to get the problem out of a deadlock by 
joint efforts." 
  Han Sung-chu said in his turn that it was the fifth meeting 
of the Russian and South Korean foreign ministers, which is an 
indication of good relations between the two countries. 
  Han Sung-chu will tell Kozyrev about Kim Yong-sam's meetings 
with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and China's 
leader Jiang Zemin during his recent visits to those countries, 
Kim Sok-kyu, South Korea's ambassador to Russia, told ITAR-TASS. 
The Republic of Korea would like to establish close contacts 
with Russia on the nuclear problem of North Korea, the South 
Korean ambassador said. 
  According to Kim Sok-kyu, the ministers will discuss 
Moscow's 
proposals on holding an international conference on ensuring the 
security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula. 
The South Korean Government is highly appreciating the proposal 
and regarding it as a friendly step of Russia, aimed at settling 
problems of the Korean Peninsula. How, he continued, the issue 
is being examined by the U.N. Security Council, and it is 
worthwhile to wait and see how those problems will be settled 
within the U.N. framework.
