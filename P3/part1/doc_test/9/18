  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The chances that the third 
round of talks between North Korea and the United States will be 
held within the agreed upon time are very small, North Korean 
Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil said. 
  Meeting journalists in Moscow on Thursday, the ambassador 
blamed the American side for thwarting the meeting planned for 
March 21, saying that not a single obligation it has assumed 
under the February 25 agreement has been fulfilled. 
  He stressed that North Korea has done its best to observe 
the 
conditions of the agreement, particularly it allowed 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts into its 
nuclear facilities and started consultations with 
representatives of South Korea to prepare for the exchange of 
envoys. 
  Son Song-pil brushed off accusations that North Korea 
"treated IAEA exerts unsatisfactorily and did not grant them 
access to some nuclear facilities." He described such 
allegations as "a fabrication of the Western mass media." 
  The ambassador pointed out that recently the North Korean 
Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering received a telegram from 
the IAEA deputy director which claimed that North Korea had 
failed to provide normal conditions for the operation of IAEA 
experts and overpriced materials they used for analyses. 
  "From the very first day of their stay in North Korea all 
necessary conditions were created for their work," he said. 
However, "their demands were too high and corresponded to a 
large-scale rather than limited nuclear inspection which was 
approved by North Korea," the ambassador continued. The 
question of carrying out comprehensive inspection was due to be 
discussed at the upcoming round of U.S.-North Korean talks, he 
said. 
  Son Song-pil stressed that the fate of the third round of 
talks depends on the U.S. Administration which should abandon 
"unreasonable conditions" and strictly observe the agreements 
reached by the sides at their February meeting.
