  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 KYODO -- North Korean heir apparent 
Kim Chong-il's half-brother, Kim Pyong-il, has been named 
ambassador to Finland and is awaiting agreement from the Finnish 
Government, a western diplomatic in Seoul said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Kim Pyong-il, long considered a political rival of Kim 
Chong-il, was removed as envoy to Bulgaria in early December 
last year amid signs that his return may indicate that Kim 
Chong-il has resolved the leadership succession issue. He had 
been appointed to take up the post of North Korea's ambassador 
to Hungary in August 1988 but was reassigned to Bulgaria in 
December that year. 
  Meanwhile, the appointment of Kim Kwang-sop, husband of Kim 
Pyong-il's elder sister, Kim Kyong-chin, as North Korea's 
ambassador to Austria indicates that family members of Kim 
Pyong-il failed to occupy key posts in North Korea's power 
hierarchy. 
  Speculation was abuzz on whether Kim Chong-il's succession 
to 
power has come under challenge after Kim Pyong-il returned from 
an overseas mission and Kim Yong-chu, younger brother of North 
Korean President Kim Il-song, was named to the Politburo of the 
North Korean Workers' Party. 
  The appointment of Kim Pyong-il to an overseas diplomatic 
mission, however, showed that Kim Chong-il is still wary of his 
half-brother in securing his grip on power in the country, 
analysts said.
