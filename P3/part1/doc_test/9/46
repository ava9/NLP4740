<F P=106> [`Summary' of `exclusive' interview with Georgiy Kunadze, </F>
Russian ambassador to the ROK, by Kim Yong-kol on 8 February -- 
place not given] 
  [Text] [Kim Yong-kol] What is your view on North Korea's 
nuclear issue? 
  [Georgiy Kunadze] Russia is displeased with North Korea, 
which is trying to receive "special treatment" within the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT]. In March 1993 North 
Korea declared that it would withdraw from the NPT, but has 
withheld that decision. North Korea can choose on its own if it 
will withdraw or remain in the NPT. As long as it has decided 
to remain in the NPT, however, I believe that as a member of 
international society, North Korea must sincerely implement the 
duties of preventing nuclear proliferation. North Korea must 
show a clear attitude regarding this matter. 
  [Kim] It was learned recently that the Russian Government is 
showing moves to repay ROK's loan through the transfer of 
military technology. 
  [Kunadze] The Russian Government regards the ROK as an ally. 
Therefore, I believe that there will not be any big barrier in 
transferring military technology. I believe that this issue 
must proceed from a purely private level and in accordance with 
international practice. If the quality is good and the price 
satisfactory, I do not know of any reason for the ROK not to 
purchase Russian weapons. This can be carried out in the form 
of a direct trade or possibly through joint ventures. 
  [Kim] How do you view the bombing of the Korean Air Line 
plane in 1983 and the issue of repaying the ROK's loan, which 
are regarded as pending issues between the two countries? 
  [Kunadze] The Russian Government has cooperated to find out 
the truth about the Korean Air Line plane bombing incident. I 
believe that the Russian side is no longer politically 
responsible. I would like to express profound sympathy for the 
victims and the bereaved families. Even though experts from 
Russia, the ROK, and other related countries carried out an 
accurate investigation and reached a united result, I doubt that 
this will by any means be a consolation to the bereaved families. 
  The issue of repaying the ROK loan is a slightly delicate 
issue. When Russia was burdened with the old Soviet Union's 
foreign debt, it reached an agreement with the Western creditor 
group on the principle of repaying debt. A condition was 
attached in that Russia cannot repay its loan with any other 
country before receiving approval from the Western creditor 
group. I would like to reveal that repaying the $3 billion debt 
to the ROK side is not that big a burden to Russia, but Russia 
can suffer economic consequences from the Western creditor group 
if Russia repays the ROK. 
  [Kim] Do you have anything to say to the ROK Government? 
  [Kunadze] Most of all, I would like to discuss the issue of 
returning the embassy lot situated in Chong-tong, Chung-ku, 
which was used during the Czarist days. The embassy building 
that we are currently using is situated in Samsong-tong, 
Kangnam-ku and is too far away from the center of the city, thus 
causing difficulties in conducting our work. 
  During the Czarist days, all embassy buildings in the ROK 
were built from soil and building material brought from their 
native countries. This is why we have such an affection for our 
embassy lot. China and Vietnam have been allowed to use the 
embassy lot that was used by the former Taiwanese and Saigon 
governments. I would appreciate it if this was considered. 
  [Kim] What is your impression of being appointed ambassador 
to the ROK? 
  [Kunadze] I have visited the ROK on many occasions before, 
but this is the first time I have assumed the duty of 
ambassador. I am working to get accustomed to Korean customs. 
The ROK is a safe country at least in public peace and order 
because there are not that many crimes such as highway 
robberies. However, I believe that the ROK is faced with 
serious social problems, such as water contamination and traffic 
congestion.
