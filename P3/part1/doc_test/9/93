  [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov today described Russian-Chinese 
relations as a priority in the country's foreign policy. 
  Speaking in the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian 
Parliament) Panov said his ministry was implementing plans to 
strengthen bilateral ties with China and bring Russian-Chinese 
relations to a level of constructive partnership. 
  Panov, who is in charge of Asian affairs and a former 
ambassador to South Korea, dwelt at length on problems in 
Russian-Chinese relations, cautioning about the massive Chinese 
immigration into Russia. 
  He noted that a current agreement drastically cuts the 
number 
of people entitled to a visa-free entry to Russia. 
  In the light of the acute border issue which exists between 
the two, a joint Russian-Chinese commission is now actively 
working to resolve questions on ownership of disputed islands on 
border rivers. 
  Panov also told the State Duma that talks are in progress to 
agree on cutting the strength of Russian and Chinese troops in 
border areas. 
  He said he believed the infrastructure of the 
Russian-Chinese 
border should be further developed to promote trade and economic 
cooperation, adding that the turnover of border trade totalled 
2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  The deputy minister also stressed the need to help the 
modernization of Chinese industrial enterprises built with 
Soviet assistance in the 1950s.
