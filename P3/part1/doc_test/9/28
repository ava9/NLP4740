Closing a brief but contentious debate over President Bush's role in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday approved 
the nomination of Donald P. Gregg to be ambassador to South Korea, despite 
lingering questions about his relationship with former White House aide Oliver 
L. North. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 12 to 7, the panel recommended that the full Senate confirm the 
nomination of Gregg, who served as then-Vice President Bush's national security 
adviser during most of the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) had charged that Gregg, a former CIA officer, was 
involved in North's secret efforts to provide aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels 
during the period when Congress had prohibited such funding. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston also accused Gregg of "misleading" the committee by denying that he 
knew anything about North's covert operations in Central America during 1985 
and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregg insisted that despite several meetings with North and others involved 
in the operation -- and documents from those meetings that referred to supplies 
for the Contras -- he did not realize what was going on until news reports of 
the activities at the end of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being asked to reward a man many of us do not believe has been straight 
with us while under oath," Cranston said. "We are being asked to promote a man 
to a crucial diplomatic post whose judgment -- by his own admission -- has been 
so flawed that he twice offered to resign from then-Vice President Bush's 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gregg has not been straight with us," Cranston repeated. "The implications 
for Mr. Gregg -- and for the President -- are not pleasant ones." 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston failed to sway any of the panel's nine Republicans. Three 
Democrats -- Sens. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) and Terry 
Sanford (D-N.C.) -- also voted in favor of Gregg's confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Benefit of Doubt' 
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that Mr. Gregg and the President should be given the benefit 
of the doubt," said Pell, the committee's chairman and a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, a Southern moderate, said that he considers Gregg's account "as 
reasonable and believable as I think we could expect under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's evidence included two 1986 memos from Gregg to Bush setting up a 
briefing on "resupply of the Contras" and a 1985 entry in North's personal 
notebook that appears to record a meeting with Gregg to discuss the Contras' 
logistical needs. Gregg said that he did not know how the term "resupply of the 
Contras" had landed in his memo and denied that the briefing covered that 
issue. He also denied attending the meeting that was described in North's 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) said that he would attempt to block 
three of President Bush's other ambassadorial nominees on grounds that their 
only qualifications appeared to be large contributions to Republican political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Nominations 
</P>
<P>
He said he would fight the nominations of Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to 
Spain, Melvin F. Sembler to be ambassador to Australia, and Della M. Newman to 
be ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Newman was asked by a New Zealand newspaper after her nomination if she could 
name the country's prime minister -- David Lange -- and could not. Her husband, 
Wells McCurdy, was a fund raiser for Bush's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing, on occasion, to have to hold your nose and approve a 
nomination like this, but we're being asked to do it again and again and 
again," Sarbanes complained.
