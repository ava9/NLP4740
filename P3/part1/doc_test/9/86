Anatoly Adamishin, Russia's new ambassador to the court of St James, slipped
quietly into London last week and tackled his first task - smoothing the way
for President Boris Yeltsin, who arrives today for talks with prime minister
John Major.
His next job will be to ensure that all goes well next month when the Queen
pays a state visit to Russia - the first British monarch ever to do so.
Relations between Britain and Russia have not been as warm or as close for
decades. Adamishin, a career diplomat, who has been increasingly influential
in shaping Russian foreign policy, is welcomed in London as a man who
embodies the 'new thinking'. He has thus been much involved in Russia's
efforts to reintegrate into the wider world.
Adamishin, who served as ambassador to Italy and deputy foreign minister
before coming to London, says this process started when Britain's former
prime minister Margaret Thatcher, described Mikhail Gorbachev 'as a man I
can do business with.' This was several months before he became the last
communist ruler of the Soviet Union. However at about that time, Adamishin
himself was playing an important part in reshaping Russia's relations with
the rest of the world, during negotiations in a most unlikely place -
Africa.
The quietly-spoken diplomat, was at the centre of the international effort
in the mid-1980s to persuade the Cubans to remove their troops from Angola.
The Cuban withdrawal ended a military threat to South Africa's security and
persuaded Pretoria to grant independence to Nambibia This withdrawal was
thus an important condition for the eventual ending of apartheid in South
Africa.
During these negotiations, Adamishin made some unlikely friends, including
Pik Botha, South Africa's crusty former foreign minister.
During months of shuttle diplomacy, which took him back and forth to Luanda,
Brazzaville, Windhoek, New York and other more secret places, Adamishin
gained the respect and trust of some of the most influential people in
western diplomacy, including Sir Robin Renwick, now UK ambassador to
Washington.
'It was touch and go right to the end', Adamishin says. 'The night before we
were due to complete the agreement in New York the Cubans said they would
not sign. I told them in that case Moscow would not sign either. But then I
spelt out a whole series of negative consequences which would follow. In the
morning, they signed.'
Such a breakthrough would have been impossible had the veteran Soviet
foreign minister Andrei Gromyko still been in charge. But shortly after
Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Eduard Shevardnadze took over the foreign
ministry.
'New thinking' swept through the foreign policy establishment and Adamishin,
who had languished in Moscow for more than 20 years as a speech writer and
increasingly influential counsellor, following his return from a six-year
stint at the Rome embassy, was given a free hand to tackle an intractable
problem, albeit one low on Moscow's list of priorities.
The chance to use his talents fully in Africa arrived after years of
frustration for a man who passed the formative years of his career in Italy
and longed for the chance to help loosen and modernise the sclerotic Soviet
system.
By temperament and experience Adamishin is an unashamed 'westerniser' who
believes that 'partnership with the west is vital for our hopes of turning
Russia into a normal, economically prosperous and predictable country.'
Throughout Russia's history such men and such ideas have had to contend
against the 'Slavophiles' with their quasi-mystical belief in the uniqueness
of Russia and the Slav soul and their suspicion - and even hostility - to
the corrupting ideas and examples of the west.
But, in his first interview inside the sprawling white stucco embassy on
Kensington Palace Gardens, Adamishin said that 'western Europe has not yet
made up its mind whether to embrace Russia and hold her tight in a
democratic embrace - like Germany after the war or Spain and Greece - or
draw the boundaries at the Baltic states and Ukraine as if Russia is really
an Asian exile.'
However, he speaks rather more warmly of Britain: 'You have shown more
understanding of our problems than some others. You helped us to join the
Group of Seven and helped in other parts of the world. The UK is not a
simple partner to deal with, but we consider you as a reliable, long-term
partner.'
He is optimistic that relations with Britain and other western countries
will improve further. 'Our interests coincide 80 to 90 per cent of the time
and relations between Russia, western Europe and the US are moving in the
right direction. But we still have to find where a balance of interests
exists in the remaining 10-20 per cent of cases.'
Misunderstanding and disagreement could arise from Russia's 'peacekeeping'
role in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which
were formerly part of the Soviet Union, and from its relationship with Nato.
Moscow wants an equal partnership.
'We each need to recognise certain special interests, in our case we see the
CIS as an area in which we have a special interest. We were also displeased
to be faced by unilaterally taken decisions over Bosnia, although the
situation in that respect is also much better now,' he adds.
Adamishin was born of Russian parents in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine in
1934. This was the year in which Stalin ordered the assassination of Sergei
Kirov and then used the murder as an excuse to purge political opponents.
Adamishin, however, shows few of the characteristics of 'Soviet man.'
'I was too young to remember the purges,' he says. But he is part of the
generation which grew up under Stalin and then started their careers under
Khruschev.
He attributes his survival as a free spirit to the influence of his
grandparents, who brought him up during the war, and to a lucky break which
took him into diplomacy. He was trained as a mathematician and specialised
in the Italian economy. His room mate was Luigi Longo, son of the eponymous
former Italian communist party leader. 'Gigi was six years older than me. He
became my teacher in everything from marxism to sexology,' he recalls
affectionately. The two men remain close friends.
The Italian connection changed his fate. 'They needed Italian speakers and I
was taken on by the first European department of the foreign ministry
(devoted to western European affairs). I translated for Khruschev when an
Italian delegation came to Moscow. I remember how Giuseppe Pella, the then
Italian foreign minister, outraged Khruschev by asking whether it was true
that Khruschev drank water while plying vodka liberally to his guests.
Khruschev pushed his glass up to Pella's mouth and ordered him to drink. It
was vodka of course.'
Two years later Adamishin arrived in Rome as stazheur, apprentice at the
elegant palace which houses the Russian embassy, less than a mile from the
Vatican on the Gianicolo hill. There followed six years as interpreter and
counsellor to Ambassador Semyon Kozyrev, (no relation to the current foreign
minister).
'He treated me like a son, gave me my diplomatic schooling, and protected me
from the KGB snapping at my heels. Thanks to his protection I was able to
violate all the rules governing the behaviour of Soviet diplomats in Italy.'
Like so many foreigners, exposure to the subtle arts of Italian life and
politics inevitably influenced his thinking and style. But he insists that
the main formative elements were his unusual 'class origins' and the
influence of his grandparents.
His father, Leonid, was killed along with 1m other Soviet troops, in the
first Nazi encirclement of Kiev in 1941. Anatoly was then seven years old.
His mother was a modest functionary in the ministry of agriculture.
'I spent my childhood in the Ukrainian countryside looked after by my
grandfather, a graduate from St Petersburg University who had voluntarily
'returned to the people' to teach in the countryside, and my grandmother.
She had been educated at a gentlewomen's academy but learned how to milk and
grow crops.'
Both, he added, were what used to be called in Czarist times raznochinits,
the name given to the proud and hard working meritocracy which was not part
of the hereditary aristocracy, but rose through the ranks and served the
Czar with diligence and honour.
This combination of inherited grit and acquired Italian subtlety marked him
out and helped him to survive 25 years at the heart of the foreign ministry
interspersed by events such as the Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
and the collapse of detente after the invasion of Afghanistan and martial
law in Poland. It should also serve him well as he sets out on his declared
path 'of doing everything in my power to make sure that Anglo-Russian
relations will be confident and serene.'
