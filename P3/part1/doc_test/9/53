  [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Kim Yong-sop, North Korea's 
ambassador to Egypt, has stated that the Korean people are 
looking forward to President Husni Mubarak's visit to the 
country later this year. 
  The North Korean ambassador held a news conference at the 
North Korean Embassy in Cairo today to mark the 52d birthday of 
Kim Chong-il, chairman of the North Korean Defense Committee and 
son of the country's leader Kim Il-song. He spoke of the tense 
situation in the Korean peninsula and praised the friendly 
relations between Egypt and his country. [passage omitted] 
  On the situation in the Korean peninsula, he said that the 
tension has risen to an unprecedented level in the past few days 
and that his government is making intensive efforts to reunite 
the two parts of the country by peaceful means and through 
dialogue. He noted that the United States is not abiding by the 
clauses of several agreements it concluded with North Korea in 
recent negotiations and at the same time it is demanding that 
North Korea fulfill its commitments or face political and 
economic pressures. 
  Kim Yong-sop said that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency 
[IAEA] continues to use a double standard and although the 
United States decided to halt the Team Spirit maneuvers, it 
announced it will carry out another major military exercise. 
  He said: We demand that Washington halt these maneuvers, not 
merely change their names, in order to ease the tension and 
create an appropriate atmosphere for negotiations. 
  The ambassador said: The United States has announced it will 
deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, which would escalate the 
tension to the point of war, although we want peace. He 
asserted that if Washington does not fulfill its commitments, 
North Korea will also not abide by its pledges, will consider 
suspending its IAEA membership, and transform its current 
reactors which are employed for useful purposes into nuclear 
reactors [as received]. 
  He added that North Korea will not beg for a resumption of 
the negotiations, explaining: We agreed to negotiate in order 
to ease the tension. We can live without U.S. aid or 
assistance. If the United States resorts to sanctions, we will 
adopt the necessary measures in response. 
  Regarding the position adopted by South Korea and 
neighboring 
countries on these developments, the North Korean ambassador 
said that the South Korean authorities persist in depending on 
foreign forces and turn their backs on the Korean people in the 
north. 
  He remarked: We believe that if the problems between us and 
the United States are solved, our relationship with Seoul will 
automatically improve. 
  He said: Neighboring countries like China, Japan, and Russia 
have different attitudes on this issue. We respect the views of 
others and are trying to develop friendly ties with them. We 
hope that these countries will not escalate tension in this 
region.
