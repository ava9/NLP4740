  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- No North Korean logger has 
applied yet to come to South Korea or to settle in Russia, 
Moscow's ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze said Friday [13 
May]. 
  If there are any such requests, Moscow will handle them on a 
case-by-case basis, reviewing them carefully while taking into 
consideration the applicants' wishes from a humanitarian point 
of view, the ambassador said in an interview with YONHAP News 
Agency. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is scheduled to visit 
Russia in June. 
  On the timing of the first resettlement of North Korean 
loggers, Kunadze said that in addition to the screening process, 
a presidential decision is necessary on procedural matters and 
this always requires time. 
  Asked about North Korea's nuclear capability, the ambassador 
said that according to a recent special report by a Russian 
intelligence agency, there are no signs that Pyongyang has 
nuclear bombs or the ability to acquire them anytime soon. 
  But Moscow is concerned that the North Korean nuclear 
problem 
has been clouded by uncertainty for over a year. Kunadze 
expressed hope that the various channels of dialogue such as 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), North Korea and the United States, and South-North Korea 
will make progress and succeed. 
  On compensation for the victims of a downed Korean air 
plane, 
the envoy said his home government is preparing a reply which 
will come soon. 
  The ambassador then commented on the North Korea-Soviet 
Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty that stipulates Moscow 
will automatically intervene in case of a war involving 
Pyongyang, explaining that Moscow's position is that the treaty 
remains in effect. 
  But the automatic intervention clause applies only to 
unprovoked military incidents, he said, and it is up to Russia 
to decide whether an incident was provoked or not. 
  He predicted that the issue involving the return of the old 
Russian legation site in Chung-dong, Seoul, is unlikely to be 
solved by the time President Kim visits. 
  But he suggested that the two sides are near an agreement, 
saying the matter might be resolved in the near future. 
  The ambassador discussed South Korean-Russian technology 
cooperation in the defense industry, emphasizing that no 
obstacles exist and such links will be of mutual benefit. 
  But there should be no double standards and no political 
influence in trying to boost cooperation, he said.
