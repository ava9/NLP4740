<F P=106> [Report on interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Panov, </F>
deputy minister of foreign affairs, by Vladimir Abarinov; place 
and date not given: "The Asian Year of the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs: Aleksandr Panov: Power Politics Is 
Ineffective in the East"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Nikolayevich Panov is a career 
diplomat. His professional biography began with the position of 
reviewer in the Far East Department of the USSR Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in 1968. He then worked for several years as 
part of the permanent mission of the USSR at the United Nations 
in New York. In the period 1983-1988 he was first secretary and 
then counselor at the USSR Embassy in Japan. At the end of the 
1980's he worked at the Pacific and Southeast Asia Desk in the 
USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in the period 1990-1992, 
as chief of the desk. Prior to his appointment as deputy 
minister of foreign affairs, he was ambassador of Russia in the 
Republic of Korea. His diplomatic rank is ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary. He is a candidate of 
historical sciences. 
  This year will be the year of Asia for the Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of the Russian Federation, declared in an interview with 
our SEGODNYA correspondent. Russian diplomacy is setting itself 
the assignment here not only of maintaining good-neighbor 
relations with all Asian countries but also of becoming an 
active part of the economic life of the region and contributing 
to ensuring that Asia become a region of stability, security, 
and cooperation. An extensive program of exchanges of visits is 
planned. The minister of foreign affairs and then the chairman 
of the PRC, the president of the Republic of Korea, and the 
prime minister of India are expected in Moscow this year, and 
visits by the Vietnamese and Mongolian prime ministers are 
possible. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Government of the 
Russian Federation, will head for Beijing in June, and a Russian 
delegation will take part in an ASEAN ministerial session in 
Bangkok in July. The deputy minister observed that greater 
attention to the rapidly developing region has come to be paid 
by Russian private business, Far East business particularly. The 
new commercial structures are accounting for up to 50 percent of 
commodity turnover in trade with certain Asian countries. 
According to Aleksandr Panov, Russia could not export such a 
quantity of finished goods to any other region of the world. 
  The Russo-Japanese consultations at deputy foreign minister 
level which were held in Moscow recently, the diplomat said, 
showed that "quickly arriving at a peace treaty" and, 
consequently, resolving the territorial problem were impossible 
under the current conditions. The parties understand this and 
intend in the immediate future to concentrate on specific 
questions in order to gradually create a "new atmosphere" in 
bilateral relations. In the course of the consultations it was 
arranged, as we all know, that Tsutomo Hata, minister of foreign 
affairs of Japan, would visit Moscow in March. As was to be 
understood from the statements of Mr. Panov, no breakthroughs 
are to be expected from this visit. 
  To the correspondent's question as to how the Japanese side 
is reacting to Moscow's proposals concerning joint economic 
activity in the "Northern territories," the deputy minister 
responded that "the Japanese are giving our position a guarded 
reception": Joint ventures on the South Kurils must observe 
Russian legislation, and this, from Japan's viewpoint, is a 
violation of Japan's sovereignty. Mr. Panov disagreed that the 
numerous violations of Russia's border by Japanese fishermen 
were being perpetrated for political reasons and with the direct 
support of Tokyo officialdom. The border incidents, the diplomat 
declared, are explained primarily by economic factors. Moscow is 
raising the question of fishing in the area of the Kuril chain 
in strict terms, nonetheless, it is obvious that an economic 
solution needs to be found. A version of such a solution is 
already being applied in the area of Signalnyy Island, where the 
Japanese have obtained the right to procure sea kale on a 
compensation basis. 
  Things are comparatively better with respect to observance 
of 
the moratorium on fishing in the central Sea of Okhotsk. This 
area is not part of Russia's economic zone but Russia deemed it 
possible to announce last year a unilateral moratorium in 
connection with the fact that the reduction in the stocks of 
pollock had reached crisis point. At the present time neither 
Japan and nor South Korea are fishing, and China has reduced it 
25 percent and is prepared to examine the question of 
compensation, that is, the exchange of this area for another 
within Russia's economic zone. This leaves Poland, which is 
agreeing to no restrictions. 
  Aleksandr Panov is not disposed to dramatize the fact of 
Russia's nonaccession to the Prevention of Pollution of the Seas 
Convention. Moscow and Tokyo are conducting negotiations on 
assistance in the utilization [utilizatsiya] of Russia's liquid 
radioactive waste, specifically, the financing of the 
construction of a repository for such waste. Until there is a 
repository, there will be no further disposals, which has been 
stated clearly. 
  But the most serious problem of the region is undoubtedly 
the 
DPRK's nuclear program. It is being complicated by Pyongyang's 
hard-line negotiating position, Mr. Panov said. The North Korean 
side is endeavoring to compensate each positive step on its part 
with return concessions by Washington. As a result a specific 
situation has been created, the deputy minister observed. On the 
one hand inspections of nuclear facilities are the prerogative 
of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Authority], on the 
other, the DPRK is preferring to negotiate on this topic with 
the Americans. But there is a "third angle" also: the 
North-South negotiations on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. Untangling this knot is not easy, Mr. Panov said. 
Moscow, he declared, occupies a balanced position. The Sarajevo 
example has shown that a positive result cannot be achieved with 
ultimatums. Power politics will produce nothing in the East: 
History testifies that these countries are capable even in a 
difficult situation of sustaining quite strong political 
pressure. If, despite all the diplomatic efforts, the question 
is put to the UN Security Council for consideration, Russia will 
act circumspectly there also. 
  The Russian-North Korean intergovernmental agreement on the 
basis of which from 15,000 to 20,000 lumberjacks of the DPRK 
have been working at Khabarovsk Kray and Amur Oblast timber 
industry enterprises expired on 1 January. In this connection 
the SEGODNYA correspondent asked about the future of this 
document and, most importantly, about the legal status of the 
Korean timber industry enterprises, which are known for their 
mass violations of human rights. The agreement, the deputy 
minister observed, has expired and is operating now only "within 
a particular framework." But dropping it altogether would not 
seem possible: The local authorities maintain that they have no 
one with whom to replace the Koreans. A new negotiating 
position, with which we will resume negotiations in the very 
near future, is being shaped in the government at this time. In 
any event, whatever the economic agreements, the state within a 
state and the ex-territoriality of the Korean settlements have 
been done away with, was Aleksandr Panov's assurance. 
  The deputy minister commented on the reports of President 
Yeltsin's recent message to Indonesian President Suharto. The 
message, Mr. Panov reported, had been preceded by an appeal to 
Russia on the part of a number of members of the Nonaligned 
Movement proposing that it join the movement as an observer. 
Moscow deemed the proposal flattering and expedient. It is this 
that was the subject of Yeltsin's message sent to Suharto, as 
the present chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. According to 
the movement's charter, a member of the Security Council may not 
be a member, but is entitled to apply for observer status.
