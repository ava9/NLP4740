  [Text] Our country's ambassador O Song-hwan paid a farewell 
call to Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro on 29 April. At 
the meeting the ambassador conveyed the greetings of the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il to President Violeta Chamorro. 
  The president expressed deep thanks for the greetings and 
asked the ambassador to deliver his warm greetings to the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The president said that Korea's reality shows that the road 
of socialism chosen by the Workers' Party of Korea and the 
Korean people under President Kim Il-song's wise leadership is 
very just. He continued: The world admires the changes taking 
place in Korea today. Korea has become a most powerful country 
by embodying the principles of independence in politics, 
self-reliance in economics, and self-defense in national 
defense. The Korean people's potential is inexhaustible and no 
one can match the Korean people's strength. The development of 
friendly relations between Nicaragua and Korea will be eternal 
in the future. We will actively support in the future the 
Korean people's struggle for the realization of the country's 
reunification.
