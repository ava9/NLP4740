<F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Zhang Huimin: "Spectre of </F>
Aggression Still Haunts Japan"] 
  [Text] The moment I heard the statements, I knew I had to 
write something. But things happened too fast. Before I could 
turn my rage into action the event had already receded into the 
past. 
  Mr Shigeto Nagano's remarks on Japan's role and behaviour in 
World War II were published in the news media last Wednesday. 
He retracted his "inappropriate" comments on Friday. And then 
he resigned as Japan's justice minister on Saturday. 
  Nagano is down and out and his case seems to have already 
been forgotten. 
  But from a historical perspective, these comments must not 
be 
forgotten so soon. I know Nagano is not the first Japanese 
politician in recent years to make such "inappropriate" 
utterances regarding Japan's past, but I wonder if he will be 
the last. 
  In 1894, Japan defeated China's Qing Dynasty and wrested 
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China. This marked the first 
successful step of Japanese aggression against China in modern 
times. 
  With the 20th century ushered in, Japan's aim to devour all 
of China intensified and the methods diversified. 
  It imposed on a Chinese warlord then in power the Twenty-one 
Demands, which reduced China to a de facto colony of Japan. 
Then, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, it replaced 
Germany's interests in Shandong Province after World War I. It 
engineered the Jinan Incident slaughtering Chinese people in 
Shandong to deter Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expeditionary Army 
from pushing further north. And a bomb blast killed a warlord 
who ruled northeast China when he got in their way. 
  In 1931, Japan conquered China's three northeast provinces 
and set up the Machurian puppet regime; soon afterward, it 
seized the then Jehol Province in north China. 
  In 1937, it launched a full-scale invasion of China. In 
1941, it started the war in the Pacific with the bombing of 
Pearl Harbour. 
  Finally, in 1945, after a half-century effort to repel 
Japanese aggression, came Japan's unconditional surrender to the 
Allied Nations. The fond dreams of the Japanese militarists for 
world domination came to naught. 
  Their aggression brought untold misery to the victim 
countries, killing millions upon millions of people. It also 
grievously hurt the Japanese people themselves. Japan is the 
only country in the world to have been hit by atomic bombs. 
  Mr Nagano, now 71, is well educated enough that he was 
qualified to serve as Japan's justice minister. 
  He cannot be ignorant of his nation's past. 
  This being the case, any Japanese person with reason and 
sense should be able to form an objective view of Japan's role 
in Asia and the whole world in the first half of this century. 
  In 1972, when Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei came to 
China to re-establish diplomatic ties, he said that Japan had 
caused China trouble in the past, and for that, he was sorry. 
Mild as the wording was, it was meant as an apology 
nevertheless. 
  I remember resenting his understatement though I recognized 
that he was the first Japanese leader to apologize to China. 
  Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is the Japanese 
official who made the most candid and unbiased appraisal when he 
admitted that the events in the 1930's and 1940's were "a war of 
aggression and a wrong war." The apologies he made during 
official tours of South Korea and China were the most sincere 
and thorough any Japanese prime minister has ever made. 
  However, there is another crop of Japanese who still deny 
their past even though it is almost 50 years since Japan's 
aggression was completely defeated. 
  In the mid-1980's, a Japanese education minister had the 
audacity to defend Japan's infamous record in World War II. He 
won no open applause. Instead he evoked condemnation from the 
former victim nations as well as his own countrymen. 
Consequently, he too resigned dismally. 
  A few years later another cabinet member followed suit and 
met with the same wretched fate. And when a Japanese minister 
tried to whitewash the past by saying that the academic 
definition of the aggression should be left to the future 
historians, he was immediately trounced by angry critics. 
  The fact is that whenever a Japanese politician makes some 
"inappropriate" remark on Japan's past, he is bound to meet with 
indignant refutation at home and abroad. 
  Nagano claimed that the Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication. 
Let me remind him about a fact which he, as an old man of 71, 
must still remember. 
  Two young junior officers of the Japanese Army, on entering 
Nanjing in the winter of 1937, competed with each other on who 
would kill more Chinese civilians in one day. The result was 
that each killed more than 100. A photo of the two standing 
side by side with swords in their hands was published in the 
most influential newspaper in Japan with the caption praising 
the two as "heroes." 
  However, as the saying goes, the mills of God grind slowly, 
and 10 years later, these two Japanese butchers received justice 
in full measure in Nanjing. Ironically, the news report and the 
photo, once in honour of them, became damning evidence against 
them. 
  Mr Nagano, can you dismiss this as fabrication? 
  Nagano, as a shrewd politician, must have known what 
response 
his wild remarks would evoke. Nevertheless, he did not hesitate 
to make them. This makes me suspect that this former member of 
the Imperial Japanese Army is, from the bottom of his heart, 
still nostalgic for the glories of Japanese militarism. He 
simply could not contain the strong urge to vent his inner 
feelings, whatever consequence his mouthing off would bring. 
  Strong pressure forced Nagano to retract his erratic 
utterances and offer apologies in three day's time. This shows 
how unpopular his behaviour was even in his own country. 
  But his retraction is only lip service meant for appeasement 
so that he can get away. How can you expect to fundamentally 
change in only three days' time the deep-seated ideas of a 
politician? 
  The string of incidences simply indicates that the spectre 
of 
militarism still haunts some Japanese minds, especially the 
older ones. 
  Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the Japanese have 
conscientiously awakened to the inglorious past of their country. 
  When Nagano's behaviour aroused an uproar, Japan's new prime 
minister, Tsutomu Hata, lost no time to make known his stand. 
"Japan's past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, 
caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people," he 
said. He even pledged to communicate this solemn admission to 
future generations to affirm "Japan's commitment to the path of 
peace." 
  Only with this approach can Japan hope to win the respect of 
the world community and cultivate true friendship with other 
countries, including China.
