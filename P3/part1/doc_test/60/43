  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday [12 May] Japan's Constitution prohibits the 
country's involvement in collective security, brushing aside 
concerns that his government may move toward active military 
actions overseas. Hata said at a plenary session of the House 
of Representatives, "I think collective security is beyond the 
boundary of the Constitution, and it is in practice not 
permitted." 
  "I have no intention to change" the conventional 
interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese 
Government on the issue, he said. He was responding to a query 
by Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
No. 1 opposition party. 
  Hata's remarks were apparently designed to dodge criticism 
and ease apprehension among opposition lawmakers that his 
cabinet is moving toward more active involvement by Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts. 
  Although Japan, as a sovereign nation, has rights for 
collective security in terms of international law, Hata argued 
the war-denouncing Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum 
necessary" rights for self-defense. 
  Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed 
legislation to deal with international crises. The issue 
requires a "highly political judgment" and "should be considered 
cautiously," he said. 
  The statement is an apparent effort to distance himself from 
some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation 
for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Hata noted the importance of diplomatic efforts to solve the 
North Korea nuclear issue, while adding Japan should cooperate 
with any UN Security Council actions "within the framework of 
the Constitution." 
  On the question of alleged financial impropriety by his 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata tried to avoid any 
commitment to further action. 
  Calling it Hosokawa's "private problems," Hata suggested he 
is reluctant to consent to opposition calls for the former 
premier's Diet testimony over corruption charges that toppled 
him from office last month. 
  Hata also tried to heal the emotional wounds caused by 
former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks over Japan's 
role in World War II. He said the outcry by Japan's Asian 
neighbors over the remarks "renewed his acknowledgement that 
Japan's aggressive actions and colonial rule (during the war) 
inflicted unbearable pain and sorrow on some Asian people." 
  Nagano, who said the so-called Nanjing massacre was a 
"fabrication" and denied Japan waged an aggressive war on Asian 
nations, resigned last Saturday amid a diplomatic controversy 
over his remarks. Hata said he handled the problem without 
delay, and has sought and obtained "understanding" from 
infuriated Asian countries. 
  In an interview published May 4 in the mass-circulation 
daily 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Nagano said, "the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication." "I think it is wrong to define the war as a war 
of aggression (by Japan)...still, I doubt the Greater East Asia 
War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression." 
  Nagano, 71, a former chief of staff of the Ground 
Self-Defense Force, resigned Saturday after serving for only 10 
days as justice minister. He was succeeded by Hiroshi Nakai.
