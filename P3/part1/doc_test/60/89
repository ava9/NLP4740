  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
pledged Friday [13 May] that his government will adopt "perfect 
measures" to defend Japan's security if military conflict broke 
out on the Korean peninsula. 
  "If a serious contingency broke out, the government will 
counteract it with intragovernment solidarity and adopt perfect 
measures," he said in reply to an opposition query on a security 
threat from Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Hata was fielding a Diet interpellation from Takushi Hirai, 
a 
Liberal Democratic Party member, who pressed Hata to clarify 
Japan's response to U.S. requests to halt banking and cash 
remittance to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in 
Japan. 
  Hirai also pressed Hata to clarify whether the government 
would deploy Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force in times of a 
possible U.N. resolution to impose a naval blockade against 
North Korea to penalize it for its refusal to accept unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Hata refused to rule out possible Japanese participation 
into 
these sanction measures. 
  "Now that the international community is quietly pressing 
North Korea to open its window (to the inspection demand), I 
would like to avoid specifying (Japan's possible response to the 
contingency)," Hata said. 
  Hata later straddled the fence in the face of persistent 
opposition questions on whether Japan is ready to use forces to 
help its allies impose sanctions against North Korea if the 
international community moved to slap sanctions. 
  He said, "Although Japan is endowed by international laws 
with the right to use force to block a military offensive to a 
foreign country with a close tie with Japan, Japan's exercise of 
(its right to) collective security would overstep the boundary 
of the Constitution." 
  The premier rejected the allegation that his administration 
is trying to alter postwar governments' longtime constitutional 
interpretation that the Constitution bans Japan's involvement in 
collective security. 
  The coalition government "will firmly stick to the longtime 
interpretation that Japan is authorized to use only minimum 
necessary forces under the Article 9 of the Constitution," he 
said. 
  He made the remarks in response to questions from Social 
Democratic Party elder Koken Nosaka and new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Takemura pressed Hata to clarify the definition of the 
controversial phrase "universal security" that was incorporated 
into coalition parties' common policy document, inked by their 
leaders April 22 as a prerequisite for initiating the fresh 
coalition government. 
  The policy platform document says coalition parties 
"recognize the fact that the Japanese Constitution adopts as its 
ideal universal security to be ensured by the United Nations." 
  Hata replied, "universal security implies...U.N. actions for 
ensuring security that include measures provided for by the 
chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, taken in solidarity by the 
international community to counteract an invasion by a destroyer 
of peace." 
  The chapter 7 has been under Diet scrutiny, as it 
authorizes, 
among others, military actions including a blockade by military 
forces to restore peace in conflict-marred regions. 
  The SDP's Nosaka blasted Hata for defending former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano who resigned last Saturday after calling 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." 
  Nosaka was taking issue with Hata's remark that "Mr. Nagano 
is a man of excellent character and profound knowledge." 
  Hata said, "although Japan has sincerely dealt with the war 
reparation issue in the San Francisco treaty and bilateral 
treaties...I will consider how Japan can demonstrate its 
feelings of repentance and reflection (on Japan's World War II 
campaign.)"
