  [Text] Seoul, May 5 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed 
regret Thursday [5 May] over the remarks by Japanese Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano that his country was not an aggressor in 
World War II and the war was aimed at liberation of colonies. 
  The South Korean Government is looking into a real intention 
behind Nagano's remarks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
  The official said that he felt sorry for a cabinet minister 
of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and 
contribution to the international community to have such a 
consciousness of history. 
  "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to 
redress the past," he maintained. 
  Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 until Japan's World 
War II defeat in 1945. 
  Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the 
Japanese national newspaper MAINICHI Tuesday by claiming that 
the Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead 
designed for liberation of colonies and a Greater East Asia 
Co-Prosperity Sphere. 
  He also asserted that the "rape of Nanking" by Japanese 
soldiers in 1937 was a hoax. Nanking is presently spelled 
Nanjing. 
  However, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is on 
a visit in France, Wednesday described as "inappropriate" 
remarks made by his justice minister dismissing the killing of 
an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians by Japanese troops in 
1937 in Nanjing, the Chinese capital then. 
  "My view on the past history is that our past actions, 
including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable 
suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief 
statement shortly after arriving in Paris for a two-day official 
visit. 
  Nagano's remarks contrast sharply with the views of Japan's 
previous administration, which left office last week. Former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called World War II "a war of 
aggression" and said it was wrong. 
  Hosokawa reiterated this recognition by Japan when he 
visited 
China earlier this year.
