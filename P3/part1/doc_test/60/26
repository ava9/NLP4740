  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano resigned Saturday [7 May] over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor in World War II, and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of 
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. 
  Nagano, a 71-year-old former serviceman who served for only 
10 days as justice minister, submitted his resignation to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, who just returned from a six-day tour of 
four European countries. 
  Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor 
from 
the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition. Nagano is a member of 
Shinseito, a core party of the coalition led by the prime 
minister. 
  Nakai, 51, is a House of Representatives lawmaker and a 
former deputy secretary general of the DSP. 
  Nakai's appointment is scheduled to be attested by Emperor 
Akihito at 10 A.M. Sunday, government sources said. 
  Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his 
"inappropriate remarks" and vowed personal action to show that 
Japan will not start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata. 
  Nagano told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai earlier 
in the day that he would resign because his comments had caused 
so much turmoil among Japan's international relations. 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a 
"matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the LDP's 
diplomatic efforts with neighboring nations during its 38-year 
rule which ended last August. 
  Nagano said in an interview published Wednesday in major 
daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication." 
  He also said, "I think it is wrong to define the war as a 
war 
of aggression (by Japan) ... Still, I doubt the Greater East 
Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression." 
  Following criticism from China, North and South Korea and 
other Asian countries Japan invaded before and during World War 
II, Nagano retracted his remarks and apologized at a news 
conference Friday. 
  China estimates that imperial Japanese Army troops massacred 
more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of 
the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. But 
Japanese historians tend to give lower estimates -- mostly to 
the order of 100,000. 
  Nagano is the third minister to resign in eight years over 
similar remarks about the war. 
  In September 1986, Masayuki Fujio resigned as education 
minister under the administration of Yasuhiro Nakasone after 
provoking China and Korea with his remarks on Japan's prewar 
actions. 
  Fujio said Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 was based on 
an agreement between the two countries and justified the 
Japanese act of colonization of the Korean peninsula. He also 
criticized Nakasone for canceling his visit to Yasukuni Shrine, 
which is dedicated to 2.4 million war dead, including A-class 
war criminals. 
  Seisuke Okuno resigned as National Land Agency chief under 
the administration of Noboru Takeshita in May 1988 over his war 
remarks. 
  "Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety ... Asia 
was colonized by Caucasians at that time. Japan was by no means 
a nation of aggression," he said.
