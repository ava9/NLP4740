<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Spokesman Denies Nuke Aid to DPRK"] </F>
  [Text] A foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday refuted an 
allegation by a US official that China has aided the nuclear 
programme and ballistic missile development of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Wu Jianmin of the ministry called the charges by US 
Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord "groundless and irresponsible." 
  Lord made the statements before a US Senate Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee meeting on May 4. 
  He said China has assisted the DPRK in the development of 
ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. 
  Wu said China hopes all parties involved in the nuclear 
inspection crisis adopt constructive and positive attitudes to 
reach an early settlement through dialogue. 
  He also said at the briefing that China has noticed genuine 
concern in Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's statement that 
Japan's past aggression and colonial rule inflicted unbearable 
suffering on many people. 
  China appreciates his indications that history shall be 
treated correctly and the younger generation shall learn a 
correct historical view Wu said. 
  Wu also announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin will pay an official visit from May 26 
to 29, the first time a Russian premier will come to China. 
  Since President Boris Yeltsin's visit in February 1992, Wu 
said, Sino-Russian relations have undergone steady development 
in all fields. 
  He said Chernomyrdin's trip will bring new energy to 
existing 
ties, particularly economic and trade relations. 
  He also announced President Pascal Lissouba of the Republic 
of Congo will visit China from May 19 to 25 at the invitation of 
President Jiang Zemin.
