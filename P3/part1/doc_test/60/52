  [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The remarks by a Japanese 
cabinet member that the "rape of Nanking" was a "fabrication" 
and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II triggered 
indignation and protests across Taiwan Thursday [5 May]. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on Japanese 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks made in an interview 
published in the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday, said the Republic 
of China [ROC] Government "feels sorry and is indignant" about 
the remarks. 
  "We strongly protest against what Nagano said about the 
massacre in Nanking, which is an apparent distortion of history 
and has abused the feelings of all Chinese," the ministry said 
in a statement. 
  In the quoted remarks, Nagano said Japan's aim during the 
war 
was to free Asian nations from European colonialism. "It is 
wrong to say the war was a war of aggression," he was quoted as 
saying. "We thought seriously about the liberation of colonies, 
to liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." 
  Li Shou-kong, a retired professor in contemporary history at 
National Taiwan University, said the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in 
which at least 300,000 residents in the southern Chinese city 
were slaughtered, was a fact that could not be denied or 
whitewashed. "The only part of the tragedy that remains open to 
speculation is the number of the residents actually killed," Li 
added. 
  "As a matter of fact, the Japanese militarists killed and 
sexually abused the innocent victims in China not only in 
Nanking but widely and predatorily in many parts of the 
country," he said. 
  Japan whipped up a wave of anger in Taiwan, Mainland China, 
Korea, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia some 10 years ago by 
whitewashing in student textbooks its aggression in World War 
II. After that incident, the Japanese Education Ministry sent 
two officials to Taiwan to make apologies, Li said. 
  Meanwhile, Kuomintang [KMT] legislators, at an emergency 
interpellation session, demanded that Japan make public once 
again the truths surrounding the massacre in Nanking and Japan's 
behavior in Mainland China and other parts of Asia during the 
war. They also demanded an explanation for Nagano's remarks. 
  KMT legislator Wei Young called for close attention to be 
paid to the positions of new-generation Japanese politicians and 
their attempts at historical revisionism. He claimed that 
Nagano's statement on the issue was not an isolated incident. 
  Wei refuted Nagano's remarks about Japan's intention to 
liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as "absolutely 
unjustifiable." 
  He said Taiwan should demand across-the-board war 
reparations 
from Japan.
