  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano, who described days ago the 1937 Nanjing massacre as a 
"hoax," withdrew his remarks today in the face of mounting 
criticism both at home and abroad. 
  "My remarks on the historical incident (of the Nanjing 
massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I 
would like to retract them," he told a press conference in the 
Justice Ministry. 
  The newly appointed minister told the "MAINICHI SHIMBUN" in 
an interview Tuesday that he believed the Nanjing massacre "is a 
fabrication" and it was wrong to say "Japan's invasion of 
neighboring nations before and during the (Second World) War was 
an act of aggression." 
  The now-defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops killed more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing City of Jiangsu 
Province in east China in December 1937, historians say. 
  Nagano's comment denying the historical facts sparked sharp 
criticism from other Asian countries, which suffered bitterly 
under Japan's military heels. 
  "Yesterday, Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata said in Paris 
regarding our country's history that our country's aggression 
and colonial rule (of its Asian neighbors) inflicted unbearable 
suffering and sorrow on many people," the minister said. 
  He acknowledged that the massacre is an "undeniable fact." 
  Nagano, who is a member of Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), also said he "feels fully responsible" for the war 
remarks and was willing to accept Hata's decision over his 
future. 
  Hata, now on a four-nation European tour, criticized 
Nagano's 
remarks Wednesday as "inappropriate" and admitted Japan's 
wartime atrocities, saying the Japanese should not repeat such 
mistakes. 
  Earlier today, Japan's second largest opposition party, the 
Social Democratic Party, urged Hata to fire the justice minister 
for what he has said. 
  Nagano, 71,graduated in 1941 from a former elite Japanese 
military academy and took part in the 1937-1945 war of 
aggression against China as an Army officer. 
  He joined the Ground Self-Defense Force after the end of the 
war and moved up to the top rank of chief of staff before he 
retired from the military in 1980.
