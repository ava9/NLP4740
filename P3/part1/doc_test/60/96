  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today denied that he has the intention of 
succeeding Morihiro Hosokawa to become prime minister, KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE reported. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, told a hastily arranged 
press conference at the Foreign Ministry that he considers it is 
more important to make adjustments within the ruling coalition 
government than to become the next prime minister, KYODO said. 
  He also said the next cabinet must be a stable and 
full-fledged one, according to the news agency. 
  However, a senior member of Shinseito, a powerful party in 
the coalition government, said it would push for its leader Hata 
as the next premier, TV reports said. 
  But Hajime Funada, former state minister for economic 
planning, had this to add, "there is the question of how we 
should address this within the current coalition framework. It 
is a delicate thing to find a balance."
