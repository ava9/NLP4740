  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Cabinet ministers on Tuesday 
[10 May] criticized Shigeto Nagano, who was forced to resign 
Saturday as justice minister over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese Imperial Army was a 
fabrication. 
  Moriyoshi Sato, chief of the Hokkaido and Okinawa 
Development 
Agencies, said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting 
that the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "made the 
worst start. I'm ashamed of (such remarks) by our comrade. He 
resigned too late." Sato, like Nagano, belongs to Hata's 
Shinseito. 
  Referring to the responsibility of Hata, who appointed 
Nagano 
as justice minister, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi 
defined Nagano's resignation as a dismissal, saying that 
discharging the justice minister settled the matter. 
  Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami expressed regret over the 
remarks by Nagano, saying he and Nagano had different 
perceptions of history and it was "natural" for Nagano to resign. 
  Nagano, 71, who assumed the post of justice minister on 
April 
28 in the new Hata administration, in an interview May 3 with 
the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, one of the country's major dailies, said, 
"I think that the Nanjing incident was a fabrication." 
  Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more than 300,000 
Chinese civilians following the invasion of Nanjing in December 
1937, according to Chinese estimates. 
  Japanese historians tend to cite lower estimates and some 
argue the mass killings were caused by troops who got out of 
control. 
  Nagano also told the MAINICHI that it was wrong to call 
Japan 
an aggressor in World War II. 
  His remarks brought sharp criticism from neighboring 
countries, especially China and South and North Korea, which 
were invaded by Japan before the war. Nagano was replaced on 
Sunday by Hiroshi Nakai, a House of Representatives lawmaker of 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).
