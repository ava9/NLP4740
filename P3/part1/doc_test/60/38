  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam had 
a telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata Tuesday afternoon to exchange opinions mostly on the recent 
controversial remarks by former Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano. 
  In the telephone talks initiated by Premier Hata, President 
Kim said that Nagano's remarks on Japan's role during World War 
II have shocked and hurt the Korean people. 
  "There should be no recurrence of a similar incident. The 
Japanese cabinet member distorted the history of the past to 
inflict an injury on the Korean people," the president said. 
  The telephone conversation lasted about 20 minutes beginning 
5:15 PM. 
  Prime Minister Hata offered a regret over Nagano's remarks. 
"It is highly regrettable that former Justice Minister Nagano's 
remarks hurt the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries," 
Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Hata especially noted that at a Diet session earlier in the 
day, he regretted Nagano's remarks by saying that his statement 
had brought both sorrows and anger to many people in other Asian 
countries, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  According to Chu, President Kim stressed that what is 
important in the contemporary age is for South Korea and Japan 
to cooperate with each other closely toward a new history and 
march jointly onward toward common interests and peace in Asia. 
  The Japanese premier said Japan will continue to strive to 
build constructive relations between Japan and other Asian 
countries including South Korea based on a correct insight into 
the past.
