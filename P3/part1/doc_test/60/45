China and South Korea yesterday reacted angrily to claims by Mr Shigeto
Nagano, the new justice minister, that one of Japan's worst wartime
atrocities was a 'hoax.'
In an effort to defuse the row, Japan's prime minister Tsutomu Hata,
condemned Mr Nagano's claim that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fiction
as 'not appropriate.'
Mr Nagano is expected to issue a public apology today, according to reports
in the Japanese press.
Mr Hata said Japan's wartime actions 'including aggression and colonial
rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people; thus it is
essential ..to face the history squarely and share the determination not to
repeat them.'
China, Japan's second largest trade partner after the US, was 'shocked and
indignant,' said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. He urged the Tokyo
government earnestly and seriously to treat the issue with a view to
safeguarding bilateral relations,' an implied demand for Mr Nagano's
dismissal.
Japan last year stepped up a gradual campaign to improve relations with
Asian neighbours when former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a
series of apologies, admitting that the war was aggressive and wrong.
Officially, the new government wishes to continue that process, though a
right-wing minority supports Mr Nagano's stance, as reported in the Mainichi
newspaper.
Mr Nagano's gaffe has far more impact today than it might have had a few
years ago and damages Japan's current attempts at a reconciliation with
former colonies at a time when Tokyo is seeking to increase trade and
investment with them.
It also provides ammunition for the minority government's numerous
opponents, only a week after the Hata administration took office.
According to a post-war tribunal, Japanese troops killed 155,000 people in
the six weeks after taking Nanking, though Chinese accounts put the figure
at 300,000.
Mr Hata, on a European tour until the weekend, said he would ask Mr Nagano
what he meant by his remarks.
