  [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- A visiting delegation of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Japan's No. 2 opposition 
force, delivered a conciliatory message Monday [16 May] from 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata addressed to Chinese Communist Party 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, delegation members said. 
  The message, which touched on controversial remarks made 
early this month by then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, was 
delivered by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, leader of the 
group that arrived in Beijing on Sunday. 
  In the message, which was received by Li Shuzheng, head of 
the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department, 
Hata called for development of Sino-Japanese relations and 
reiterated his regret over Nagano's remarks. 
  The message followed a letter from Hata last week to Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, in which the prime minister tried to ameliorate 
the hurt caused by Nagano's denial of Japan's aggression during 
World War II and assertion that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a 
fabrication. Nagano has since resigned. 
  On Sunday, the SDP delegation met with Politburo Member Ding 
Guangen, chief of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department 
and a member of the secretariat of the Central Committee. 
  They conveyed to him Hata's assurances that Japan will 
remain 
mindful of its past aggression and colonial rule in Asia. 
  In Monday's talks with Li, Kubo urged that China assume a 
more active role in facilitating a resolution on the issue of 
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development. 
  Li, however, was quoted as saying China's leverage is 
limited 
and that a resolution of the issue should be achieved through 
dialogue between the parties directly concerned. 
  Kubo proposed that Japan and China participate in a 
six-nation forum on security issues in Northeast Asia, which 
would also include North and South Korea, the United States and 
Russia. 
  But Li was said to have expressed some reservation about 
U.S. 
participation in any future talks. 
  The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with Jiang, 
is 
on an eight-day visit at the invitation of the Chinese Communist 
Party to mark the 10th anniversary of exchanges between the two 
parties. 
  The mission will return home on May 22.
