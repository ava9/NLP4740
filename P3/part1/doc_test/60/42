  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
summoned Japanese Minister to Seoul Hiroshi Shigeta and 
protested Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's description of 
comfort women, who were forced to supply sex for Japanese 
soldiers during World War II, as "licensed prostitutes," Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said Saturday. 
  The ministry's Director-General of Asian Affairs, Yu 
Pyong-u, 
called in Minister Shigeta and expressed regret over Nagano's 
remark, which runs contrary to the Tokyo government's official 
position on comfort women stated last Aug. 8. 
  Nagano earlier enraged South Korea and other Asian countries 
by claiming in an interview with the MAINICHI newspaper that 
Japan was not an aggressor in the war and that the "rape of 
Nanjing," in which Japanese soldiers massacred thousands of 
Chinese civilians, was "a hoax." 
  In a separate interview with KYODO News Service, he said 
comfort women were licensed prostitutes and their use by 
Japanese soldiers therefore could not be considered an insult to 
women or discrimination against Koreans. 
  Minister Shigeta said he would report Seoul's protest to 
Tokyo. 
  Historians say some 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were 
forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers in 
front-line brothels between 1932 and 1945. Tokyo has formally 
admitted government involvement in running the brothels.
