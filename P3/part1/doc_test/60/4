  [Text] Seoul, May 7 KYODO -- A high-ranking South Korean 
Foreign Ministry official Saturday [7 May] night hailed Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to replace Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano for his controversial remarks over the 
1937 Nanjing massacre and Japan's role during World War II. 
  Yu Pyong-u, director general of the Asian Affairs Bureau, 
told reporters, "I greatly appreciate the courage and beliefs of 
Prime Minister Hata, who made a severe choice. I expect such a 
posture will turn out to be a driving force for improving South 
Korea-Japan relations." Yu added, "It is difficult for both the 
victim and the perpetrator to overcome the past." 
  Earlier the same day Japanese Ambassador to South Korea 
Toshio Goto met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to try to 
defuse some of the outrage over Nagano's remarks.
