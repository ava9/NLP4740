  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan informed China, South 
Korea and other Asian nations that Shigeto Nagano retracted his 
earlier statements on Japan's wartime actions and that he has 
resigned as justice minister, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko 
Saito said Monday [9 May]. 
  Saito told a press conference that the Japanese Government 
told the countries on Saturday about the contents of a news 
conference by Nagano in which he retracted earlier remarks that 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. 
  Japan also informed the countries of the contents of a 
separate press conference in Brussels by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata in which the premier said he regretted Nagano's statements, 
he said. 
  Nagano resigned on Saturday. 
  The Japanese Government is currently considering whether 
further diplomatic measures are necessary to cope with criticism 
by Asian nations, Saito said. 
  Saito said that Nagano's remarks were regrettable because it 
may result, even temporarily, in misunderstandings by other 
nations of Japan's position on its wartime activities. 
  Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered a frank 
apology for Japan's wartime aggression last August when he 
assumed the premiership. 
  Nagano said last week that the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication and that he still thinks it wrong to define the war 
as a war of aggression. His remarks touched off a wave of 
protest from Asian nations.
