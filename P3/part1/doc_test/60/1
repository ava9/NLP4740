  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that China appreciates 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's attitude toward the 
history of Japan's aggression against China, saying that his 
attitude is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of 
history. 
  Commenting on the letter from Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu 
Hata to Chinese leaders here this afternoon at the weekly press 
conference, the spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that on May 10, 
Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro Michihiko conveyed to 
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan a message from Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to Chinese Premier Li Peng on the remarks 
made by former Japanese minister of justice, Shigeto Nagano, in 
which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's aggression against 
China. 
  "We have taken note of the profound introspection expressed 
by Prime Minister Hata that Japan's aggression and colonial rule 
in the past have inflicted unbearable suffering on many 
peoples," Wu said. 
  In the letter, the Japanese prime minister promised that 
history shall be treated correctly and the young generation 
shall be educated with the correct historical views and 
determined to prevent the past unfortunate history form being 
repeated. 
  "This attitude of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is sensible 
and 
is in accordance with the trend of history. We appreciate 
that," said the spokesman.
