  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
spoke to his cabinet ministers Monday [9 May] about the need to 
express to future generations the importance of Japan's remorse 
for its former wartime aggression, government officials said. 
Hata outlined his basic position on Japan's behavior in World 
War II after former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano created an 
uproar last week with his denial of historical facts on Japanese 
aggression, the officials said. 
  "As the head of Shinseito during last year's general 
elections, I expressed (in speeches) my deep remorse and 
convictions over the Japanese military's aggressive behavior and 
colonial rule (in Asia)," Hata told the cabinet meeting. 
"Looking ahead to the 50th anniversary of the end of the war 
next year, we must express to future generations (our remorse)," 
Hata was quoted as saying. 
  On his decision to appoint Nagano as justice minister, Hata 
said that he had asked about his views of the war and got the 
reply that "war must not happen again." 
  When Nagano offered his resignation over his controversial 
remarks, including the charge that the Chinese account of the 
1937 Nanjing massacre is a "fabrication," Hata said he accepted 
the resignation without any special effort to dissuade Nagano. 
  At Monday's cabinet meeting, newly appointed Justice 
Minister 
Hiroshi Nakai greeted the ministers, but did not go on to offer 
his views of the war, the officials said. 
  During an extended Japanese holiday period last week while 
Hata was on a four-nation tour of Europe, the prime minister 
outlined his position on the war and Japanese colonial rule in a 
letter to the cabinet ministers. 
  Borrowing from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata 
wrote "In the past, the aggressive behavior and colonial rule of 
our nation inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on many 
people. I want to express anew my feelings of deep remorse and 
apology." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said he thought the 
cabinet ministers fully understood Hata's cautionary letter 
regarding Nagano's controversial remarks. 
  Meanwhile, Hata spoke at a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry 
to officially hand over the post of foreign minister to Koji 
Kakizawa, and said he is well aware that Japan's colonial policy 
and actions during World War II inflicted unbearable suffering 
upon neighboring and other Asian nations. 
  The prime minister said he wants to do his best to bring 
peace to the world based on remorse. 
  Hata called Nagano's remarks on Japan's wartime aggression 
very "regrettable" and that it was an "unexpected happening" 
since he personally had trust in Nagano. 
  Nagano resigned over the weekend due to international 
outrage 
over his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened 
and that Japan's invasion of China and other Asian nations was 
not an act of aggression but aimed at liberating these countries 
from colonialism. 
  Hata said that as a Japanese, he feels proud to apologize 
and 
show remorse about the fact that Japan caused pain to other 
nations. He urged Kakizawa to carry out diplomacy aimed at 
bringing peace to the world. 
  Kakizawa told the same ceremony he will carry forward Hata's 
diplomatic policy and work to create a Japan which can be 
trusted and loved by other nations.
