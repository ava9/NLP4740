  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiakuan 
agreed today that Tokyo and Beijing should strengthen bilateral 
relations with a view to the future and thus ensure that they 
served to make a contribution to the Asia-Pacific region and the 
world at large. 
  During a 15-minute meeting, Kakizawa told Tang that the 
Japanese Government would work hard for the development of 
Sino-Japanese relations, while reflecting on and atoning for 
Japan's past atrocities. 
  He referred to the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano who publicly denied last month that the former Imperial 
Japanese Army committed the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which many 
Chinese were killed. 
  Tang said the Chinese Government appreciated the "wise 
attitude" adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
over its perception of the past. Hata criticized Nagano for 
making the remarks and said Japan "inflicted unbearable pain and 
suffering on many people" in Asia during the war. 
  The visiting Chinese delegation headed by Tang is here for 
the 13rd round of regular consultations between the Foreign 
Ministries of the two countries. 
  On Wednesday [1 June], Tang and his Japanese counterpart 
Hiroshi Fukuda, who is leading the Japanese team, at a working 
level meeting discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and other international affairs.
