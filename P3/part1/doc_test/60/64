  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Shigeto Nagano Saturday 
resigned as justice minister of Japan in face of strong 
criticism at home and abroad, a news report from Tokyo said. 
  In an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper of Japan 
May 3, he said the Pacific war started by Japanese imperialism 
was not a war of aggression and that the Nanjing massacre was a 
"hoax." His remarks whitewashing the blood-stained history of 
aggression of Japanese imperialism and defending militarism 
greatly startled and angered the Korean people, Asian countries 
and the world public. The Japanese people and public circles 
strongly demanded his resignation. 
  Upset by this, Nagano at a "press conference" Friday 
"revoked" and "apologized" for what he had said and at last 
could not help resigning. 
  Nagano is not the first to resign as cabinet minister after 
letting out anachronistic militarist remarks. 
  The case is the same with former Education Minister Fujio 
who 
justified in 1986 the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea 
and with former director general of the land administration 
agency Okuno who said in 1988 that Japan had "no aggressive 
design" during World War II. Nagano had to resign in ten days 
after he was appointed justice minister in the Hata cabinet. 
  Through the shameful cases of those who resigned in face of 
strong protest and criticism at home and abroad for their 
attempt to revive the ghost of militarism, Japan must clearly 
know that militarist revival will lead to its own grave.
