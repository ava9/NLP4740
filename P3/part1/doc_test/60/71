<F P=106> [Bernt Conrad commentary: "Hata Wants To Cooperate"] </F>
  [Text] The new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is 
plagued with bad luck. Hardly had he been appointed Morihoto 
Hosokawa's successor when his grand coalition collapsed, and 
while he toured Europe in an effort to demonstrate his country's 
goodwill, his own justice minister, Shigeto Nagano, disgraced 
him with the most inappropriate comment that Japan never started 
a war against any Asian country in 1937-38. Indignation soared 
in China and South Korea. Hata had to call his unruly colleague 
from Paris and reprimand him, but he made up for this by saying 
that Japan has caused unbearable suffering in its recent history. 
  Germany's friend did not have to expect any trouble in Bonn. 
Naturally, just like Francis Mitterrand in Paris, his German 
interlocutors, Helmut Kohl and Klaus Kinkel, asked him to open 
up Japanese markets wider than before. Hata could not and would 
not contradict their arguments, for it is apparent that the 
sooner Japan facilitates access to its markets, the better will 
German-Japanese trade relations develop. The Japanese guest, 
therefore, promised an improvement. But whether he is able (or 
willing) to coax Japan's stubborn bureaucracy into a more open 
attitude remains doubtful. 
  In any case, during his talks on the Rhine, Hata appeared as 
a pleasant interlocutor who is willing to cooperate 
constructively with the Germans, whom he values so highly, as 
well as with other Europeans and the Americans. He will have a 
practical opportunity to do so at the world economic summit in 
Naples in early July, unless the parliamentary majority at home 
topples him before then.
