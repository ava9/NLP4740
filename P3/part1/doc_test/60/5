  [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign 
Ministry praised dismissal of Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano Sunday, calling it "appropriate" for building new South 
Korea-Japan relations. 
  "The dismissal of Minister Nagano was the result of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's determination and courage," a Ministry 
official said in a commentary, "it was an action reflecting 
Prime Minister Hata's awareness and efforts to build new South 
Korea-Japan relations." 
  Nagano resigned Saturday after his remarks on Japan's role 
in 
World War II ignited flurry of protest from Asian neighbors. He 
claimed Japan was not the aggressor in the war but was only 
trying to liberal Asian colonies from Europe. 
  He also belittled the rape of Nanjing as a made-up story.
