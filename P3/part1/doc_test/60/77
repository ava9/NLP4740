  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said here Monday [13 June] that his country is 
unable to participate in military missions around the world. 
  At a meeting of the committee for budget attached to the 
House of Councillors, Hata said that Japan can only take actions 
within the framework of the Constitution, including such 
activities as backup support and mine-sweeping during the Gulf 
war. 
  "It is very difficult for Japan to cooperate with the United 
States in the military aspect of possible sanctions against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea," the prime minister said 
while referring to the nuclear dispute on the Korean peninsula. 
  Before the routine meeting of the committee for budget, both 
the Japanese prime minister and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said Japan should keep in close touch with the United States, 
South Korea and China to strive for a peaceful settlement on the 
nuclear dispute in the Korean peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, measures put forward at the U.N. Security Council 
concerning the issue should be carried out step by step, they 
said.
