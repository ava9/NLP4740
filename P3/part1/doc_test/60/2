  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (AFP)--China expressed "shock and 
indignation" Thursday at a Japanese minister's assertion that 
the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication but stopped short of 
demanding an official apology from the new adminstration in 
Tokyo. Despite the obvious anger generated in China by Justice 
Minister Shiheto Nagano's remarks, analysts here said Beijing 
clearly wanted to avoid an emotive row with the government of 
Tsutomo Hata, who was only elected Japanese prime minister last 
month. 
  "A cabinet member of the Japanese Government has openly 
distorted history and denied the facts to justify the (1937-45) 
war of aggression and we feel shock and indignation at that," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  Nagano, who was appointed justice minister by Hata last 
week, 
said in an interview published Wednesday in a major Japanese 
daily, that the Nanjing Massacre was a "fabrication" and that it 
was "wrong to describe the war as a war of aggression." 
According to a Japanese source, the number two at the Japanese 
embassy here, Koichi Matsumoto, was summoned to the Foreign 
Ministry Thursday morning. "The representation made to Matsumoto 
was in line with the comments made by the ministry spokesman," 
the source said, adding that the Chinese side had asked the 
Japanese government to "deal seriously" with the matter. 
  Japanese troops occupied the eastern city of Nanjing in 1937 
and slaughtered citizens and prisoners of war. According to the 
Chinese authorities, some 300,000 people died in the massacre. 
  Hata, currently on a European tour, publicly criticised 
Nagano's remarks on Wednesday, caling them "inappropriate." "My 
view on the past history is that our past actions, including 
aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and 
sorrow for many people," Hata said. 
  Asked if Hata's remarks had sufficiently mollified the 
Chinese side, spokesman Wu said only: "We have taken note of 
Prime Minister Hata's attitude towards the history-distorting 
statement... and he also thinks it is inappropriate for the 
minister of justice to make such remarks."
