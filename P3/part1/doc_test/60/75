  [Text] Russia and Japan agree that their territorial 
dispute should be solved "step by step taking the Tokyo 
declaration as a basis," Japanese Vice Prime Minister, Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the results of his visit to 
Moscow. 
  As the main result of his visit, Hata pointed out the two 
sides' proven commitment to preserve Russo-Japanese relations on 
the level achieved after Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October 
and strictly observe the provisions of the Tokyo declaration 
signed during the visit. 
  Hata pointed out that his present visit to Russia had 
produced a number of openings which could lead to a conducive 
environment for the resolution of the territorial issue. In 
particular, the contacts between Japan and the four disputed 
islands will be further enhanced. 
  The Japanese minister said he was satisfied with Russia's 
commitment to the course of reforms. "The main thing now is to 
train personnel for the future Russian economy. This is why we 
agreed on Japan constructing a business college at Moscow 
University and setting up a Japanese management center there," 
Hata was quoted as saying. He also said the Japanese government 
planned to set aside $50 Mn to stimulate Russia's privatized 
businesses. Hata pointed out that Russia and Japan had 
exchanged opinions on a wide range of global-scale issues. 
"Russia has proved its weight in international affairs, and its 
involvement in the resolution of international issues is very 
important," Hata said. 
  According to the Japanese minister, the two sides reached a 
principal agreement to hold permanent consultations on defense 
and security issues. 
  Commenting on North Korea's refusal to admit IAEA experts 
and 
its threat to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 
Japanese minister pointed out that he had touched on the issue 
during his talk with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, 
and that he could confidently establish that the two countries 
were unanimous on the issue. Hata added that both Russia and 
Japan were deeply concerned over the North Korean issue, and "we 
demand this country admit IAEA experts and resume exchange of 
envoys with South Korea."
