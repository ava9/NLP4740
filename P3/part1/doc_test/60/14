  [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
appointed a lower house member Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] as justice minister early Sunday morning, 
replacing Shigeto Nagano for his controversial remarks over the 
1937 Nanjing massacre and Japan's role during World War II. 
  Emperor Akihito is scheduled to attest Nakai's appointment 
at 
10 A.M. Sunday at the Imperial House. 
  Prime Minister Hata explained his views on World War II to 
the new justice minister, saying that Japan's act of aggression 
as well as its colonial rule inflicted great pains on a number 
of people, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. 
Hata asked Nakai to conform to the prime minister's position, 
Kumagai added. 
  At a press conference early Sunday morning, Nakai said, "it 
is an undeniable fact that (the former Japanese Imperial Army) 
conducted cruel acts," when he was asked about the Nanjing 
massacre. 
  Political observers said that Prime Minister Hata apparently 
picked the new justice minister from the DSP in a bid to appease 
mounting criticisms against the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]- 
controlled cabinet in the wake of Nagano's controversial 
remarks. Nagano is a member of Shinseito, a key political party 
of the coalition. 
  The observers added Shinseito intends to show its remorse 
and 
responsibility over party member Nagano's remarks by handing 
over the ministerial post to the DSP. 
  Nagano, 71-year-old former chief of staff of Ground 
Self-Defense Force who served for only 10 days as justice 
minister, submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Hata 
shortly after he returned from a six-day tour of four European 
countries. 
  Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor 
from 
the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition, after about three 
hours of consultations with Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai and 
other members of the cabinet. 
  The 51-year-old Nakai, deputy secretary general of the DSP, 
is the youngest justice minister in postwar Japan. 
  Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his 
remarks and vowed personal action to show that Japan will not 
start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata. At a press 
conference following his resignation, Nagano reiterated his 
apology, saying "(My remarks) caused great shocks and angers 
among peoples in neighboring countries." 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a 
"matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the diplomatic 
efforts the LDP made to improve ties with neighboring nations as 
the ruling party for 38 years until last August. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
[of Japan -- SDPJ], former largest force in the coalition, said 
Nagano's resignation is only natural as it damaged the Japanese 
Government's international integrity. 
  Both the LDP and the SDP are ready to question the Hata 
cabinet over Nagano's war remarks in Diet deliberations slated 
to begin on Monday. Nagano said in an interview published 
Wednesday in the major daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "The Nanjing 
incident was a fabrication." He also said, "I think it is wrong 
to define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)... Still, I 
doubt the Greater East Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was 
aimed at aggression." 
  The remarks immediately drew harsh criticisms from China, 
North and South Korea and other Asian countries, making Nagano 
to retract his remarks and apologize at a news conference Friday. 
  The Nanjing incident refers to the massacre of a great 
number 
of Chinese by the defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops 
following the invasion of the then Chinese capital in December 
1937.
