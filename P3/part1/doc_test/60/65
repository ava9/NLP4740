  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, whose elders have repeatedly caused 
international stirs with comments sanitizing Japan's war crimes, 
criticized Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano on Friday [6 May] for 
making a "careless" remark on the 1937 Nanjing massacre. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said in a prepared 
statement, "the justice minister's comments were careless and 
the LDP cannot help saying he should have exerted greater 
caution as an incumbent cabinet minister." 
  Mori, the LDP's No. 2 man, "it must be Japan's basic 
political attitude in the eyes of domestic and international 
people to seek to build peace in order to prevent an unhappy war 
from being repeated." [paragraph as received] 
  His comments followed an international uproar triggered by 
Nagano's remark that the 1937 massacre at the then Chinese 
capital of Nanjing was a "fabrication." 
  Mori's comments contrasted sharply with those by some top 
LDP 
policymakers and elders after former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa described Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors in the 
1930s and 1940s as a "war of aggression." 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, at that time criticized Hosokawa's remarks as 
insensitive to the bereaved families of Japanese soldiers who 
perished in battlefields before and during World War II. "We 
don't want (the prime minister) to say something that might 
trigger repercussions," Hashimoto said.
