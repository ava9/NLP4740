  [Text] Moscow, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata left here for home after ending a busy 
Monday [21 March] of activity and his three-day Moscow visit. 
  Hata met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in 
the morning and later held talks with his Russian Counterpart 
Andrey Kozyrev. He also met with state Duma (lower house of 
parliament) Chairman Ivan Rybkin in the afternoon. 
  Discussing the outcome of his talks with Russian leaders in 
the final day of his visit, the Japanese minister confirmed that 
the two sides had agreed to promote economic cooperation. 
  Japan will grant Russia a credit of 200 million U.S. dollars 
through the export-import bank for the construction of a 
fiber-optic communication line between Moscow and Russia's far 
eastern city of Khabarovsk. 
  Hata told Russian leaders that Japan will aid Russia in 
creating a number of training centers for market reforms in 
Moscow and the Far East, and for developing oil and gas fields 
on the Sakhalin shelf. 
  He also said that Japan, together with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, will establish a 50 million 
dollar fund for aiding Russia's medium-sized and small 
enterprises. 
  Moreover, the two sides agreed in principle to hold defense 
and security exchanges, stressing that cooperation between Tokyo 
and Moscow will have a "favorable impact" not only on the Asia 
Pacific region, but also on the rest of the world. 
  Both sides shared the views on the current "alarming 
situation" caused by the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula, 
and said they stand for making the region a nuclear-free zone. 
  After their meeting, both Hata and Kozyrev told reporters 
they had "detailed and constructive talks on a broad spectrum of 
bilateral problems and some international issues, "stressing 
that Japan and Russia have developed "very good relations." 
  However, the long dispute over the northern territory issue 
was only touched upon and no progress was made. 
  "We do not avoid discussions on these problems," Kozyrev 
said, adding that these issues will be thoroughly discussed at 
future meetings on the basis of the "Tokyo declaration" signed 
during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. 
  The Japanese minister pointed out that in order to improve 
bilateral relations it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty 
and resolve the territorial dispute as soon as possible. 
  He called for a step by step advance toward a settlement of 
the territorial dispute. 
  Chernomyrdin told Hata during their morning talks that 
Russia 
"will not act with haste" in handling this dispute, left over 
from the Second World War. 
  The four islands were occupied by the Soviet troops towards 
the end of the war. 
  "One way or another we will move towards the signing of a 
peace treaty between our countries," the Russian premier stated. 
  Before leaving Russia, Hata also agreed to set a date for 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Moscow.
