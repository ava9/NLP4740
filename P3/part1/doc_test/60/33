  [Text] Brussels, May 6 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata reiterated Friday that Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano's remarks concerning Japan's role in World War II were 
"inappropriate" and said he regrets that they were made. 
Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Hata, who is on a 
tour of four European nations, said, "the remarks of Justice 
Minister Nagano were not appropriate. I frankly regret... I 
telephoned and reprimanded Justice Minister Nagano." 
  "Justice Minister Nagano said his remarks were inappropriate 
and he would retract them. He said his remarks hurt the 
sentiments of many people and repents," Hata said. 
  "I appointed him (as justice minister) because he is a man 
of 
noble character and has a sense of balance. I would like to 
accept his withdrawal of the remarks and apology seriously," he 
said. 
  Asked whether he will dismiss Nagano from the post, Hata 
said, "I will avoid referring to resignation at this point. 
(The government) is conveying the real intention (of Nagano) to 
various countries and I hope (they) will understand," he said. 
  Nagano said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday 
that 
Japan's role in the war was not aggression and the Nanjing 
massacre was a "fabrication." His remarks triggered an angry 
response from a number of Asian countries and he retracted them 
at a news conference Friday.
