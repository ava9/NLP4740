Reflection"] 
  [Text] It seemed to some outsiders that the distortion of 
history by Nagano, former justice minister of Japan, was just a 
short episode. On 3 May, Shigeto Nagano, who had just taken 
office in the new cabinet, openly asserted that the Nanjing 
Massacre was a "fabrication," and Japan's aggression against the 
Asian countries was aimed at "liberating the colonies." After 
such remarks aroused strong protests in the neighboring Asian 
countries and also evoked condemnations inside Japan, Nagano was 
forced to renounce what he had said, offer an "apology," and 
resign from office on 7 May. 
  Although the Nagano incident came to an end, the discussion 
caused by this incident are continuing in Japan. Not only will 
the responsibility for this event be further affixed by the 
Diet, but the general public in Japan is also reflecting on the 
incident. Public opinion around the Nagano incident encapsulates 
Japan's attitude toward the historical issues: 
  First, although the war was over for more than half a 
century 
ago, people deeply influenced by militarism still exist in a 
certain number. Such people have an abnormal mentality. They 
are discontented with the current situation and still indulge in 
the memory of the "brilliance of the empire" in history. 
Although they may openly express repentance, when getting tipsy 
they tend to express their true feelings. Nagano was a typical 
case. 
  Second, over a long period of time, Japan regarded its 
historical responsibility as "taboo." It did not dare nor want 
to touch this issue. A history professor said that Japan was 
just trying to evade its responsibility for the war. Only when 
it was facing external pressure and international condemnations 
would it do something perfunctory to free itself from the 
trouble. Some people questioned when Japan would move out of 
the cycle of "cabinet members distorting history--Asian 
countries protesting--the Japanese Government saying sorry and 
the cabinet members resigning." Because Japan cannot face 
history squarely, events hurting the feelings of other Asian 
peoples happened from time to time. This found expression in 
the fact that some war criminals could even become key 
government officials in the 1960's as well as the textbook 
incident in the early 1980's and the incident of the memorial 
ceremony attended by leading government officials in 1985 at 
Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine. 
  Third, some people of insight pointed out: Japan is trying 
to seek an "honorable position" in the world, and the key lies 
in whether it will win the trust of other Asian countries that 
were previously victims of its aggression. The necessary 
precondition for winning such trust is Japan's correct approach 
to its history. It is now the time that Japan should "totally 
repudiate" its past, not only in word but also in action. So 
far, Japan's reflection on the war remains "self-centered." It 
only stresses that Japan itself was the victim of the war, and 
seldom faces squarely the fact that Japan was first of all the 
party that did harm to other Asian nations. Yamasaki, author of 
the film "Home Watching," said that in order to understand the 
feelings of other Asian nations, Japan should show other 
nations' films about the Japanese invasion so that the Japanese 
people may be educated properly. 
  On many occasions, Prime Minister Hata recently expressed 
the 
need to make profound self-criticism of Japan's past. He said 
that Japan should be actually aware of the unbearable pain and 
misery caused by its aggression and colonial rule, should 
correctly approach its past, and should use a correct outlook on 
history to educate the younger generations in order to prevent 
the repetition of the history. This shows the foresight and 
insight of the politicians of the new generation.
