  [Text] Beijing, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to 
China Michihiko Kunihiro visited the Chinese Foreign Ministry on 
Saturday [7 May] to clarify his government's position on the 
Nagano affair, a Japanese official said. 
  Kunihiro told Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan that the 
basic stand of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa would be "to make great efforts for 
future-oriented relations between Japan and China," an embassy 
spokesman said. 
  Tang said the Chinese Government "was reacting with 
restraint" over the Nagano affair, but seeing the enormous 
political repercussions the issue has aroused, they "felt 
indignant and very concerned," the spokesman said. 
  The Chinese vice minister said his government will pay great 
attention "to the manner in which Japan deals with Nagano." 
  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano caused an uproar Wednesday 
when he denied that Japan waged a war of aggression in Asia 
during the 1930s and World War II and massacred hundreds of 
thousands of Chinese in Nanjing in 1937. 
  Chinese newspapers Saturday reported Nagano's public 
retraction of his remarks and apology on Friday and also the 
possibility of his resignation after Hata's return from a trip 
to Europe. 
  Tang told the Japanese ambassador to convey to the Japanese 
Government that Nagano's statements "greatly hurt and angered 
the people of China," the spokesman said.
