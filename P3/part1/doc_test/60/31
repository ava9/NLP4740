  [Text] Beijing, May 9 KYODO -- Japan has notified China of 
the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the Japanese 
Embassy said in a statement Monday [9 May]. 
  Japanese consular official Yasuyoshi Ichihashi notified 
Chinese Foreign Ministry official Qian Xianglin on Sunday of 
Nagano's resignation and the appointment of Hiroshi Nakai as new 
justice minister, the statement said. 
  Ichihashi also conveyed the stance of Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata concerning Japan's involvement in World War II. 
  "Our past action, including aggression and colonial rule, 
caused unbearable suffering and sorrow. It is essential for 
each one of us to face history squarely and to share in 
determination not to repeat it," Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Qian was quoted as responding, "I appreciate your 
notification and will soon report it to my superior." 
  Nagano resigned Saturday after causing an uproar over his 
comments denying Japan's aggression during World War II and 
calling the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese in 
Nanjing a "fabrication."
