  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Tsutomu Hata was 
elected Japan's prime minister here this afternoon in both 
houses of Parliament. 
  He won 274 votes in the 511-seat lower house, and 127 in the 
252-member upper chamber. 
  Hata, head of the second-largest party within Japan's ruling 
seven-party coalition, was thus chosen to succeed Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who stepped down because of a financial scandal on 
April 8. 
  Hata, 58 and foreign minister in Hosokawa's cabinet, is 
expected to form a new cabinet tonight, the second coalition 
government since last August.
