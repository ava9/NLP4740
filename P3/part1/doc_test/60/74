  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Visiting Japanese Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata formally 
proposed to North Korea here on Sunday [9 January] that the two 
countries resume their normalization talks suspended since 
November 1992. 
  In a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to 
China, Hata said, ``Japan hopes to resume the normalization 
talks at an early date.'' 
  The Japanese minister said that he discussed this offer 
during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, 
who he said welcomed it. 
  Western sources here said unofficial contacts had already 
begun between the Japanese and North Korean Embassies in Beijing 
on matters related to resuming the normalization talks. 
  They said Japan first expressed their willingness to resume 
the talks to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing toward the 
close of last year. 
  ``The time of the resumption of the talks could possibly be 
either next month or March,'' one of the sources said. 
  Regarding the North Korean nuclear issues, Minister Hata 
said 
Japan and China agreed that the recent substantial progress in 
U.S.- North Korea contacts was a welcome development. 
  Hata added he believes North Korea would not resort to any 
careless acts inasmuch as their nuclear question is directly 
linked to peace and stability in the whole region of Northeast 
Asia let alone the Korean peninsula.
