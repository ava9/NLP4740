  [Text] Beijing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman made the following statement in reply to 
questions raised by JIJI [JIJI PRESS] and AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS] 
correspondents stationed in Beijing in connection with Japanese 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on 3 May that the 
"Nanjing Massacre was fabricated": 
  The war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists in 
China in the past inflicted grave calamities to the Chinese 
people, and the Nanjing massacre was one of the heinous crimes 
committed by Japanese militarists. The international community 
has long drawn a conclusion on the aggressive nature of Japan's 
war against China and the historical facts surrounding the 
Nanjing massacre. 
  To correctly deal with historical questions is an important 
political foundation for developing friendly and cooperative 
relations between China and Japan. The Chinese Government has 
all along advocated the needs to adopt a forward-looking 
attitude regarding unfortunate segments of history and to draw 
lessons from history in jointly developing friendly and 
cooperative ties in the future. Such are also the common 
understandings and stance of many Japanese government leaders. 
Many of them have even expressed apologies and repentance for 
Japanese aggression abroad during World War II. 
  It has been nearly a half century since the war was ended. 
Today, as Sino-Japanese relations are entering a new stage of 
development, we are shocked and indignant that a Japanese 
cabinet member has gone so far as to openly tamper with history 
and deny facts to defend the aggressive act committed by 
Japanese militarists. We hoped that the Japanese Government 
will proceed from the overall interests of safeguarding 
bilateral relations in seriously handling this question.
