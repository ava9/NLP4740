  [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today sent best wishes to the new Japanese prime minister, 
describing Tsutomu Hata as "a well-known friend of the United 
States." 
  Hata "shared his predecessor's desire to implement reforms 
in 
Japan. We look forward to working with him on a wide range of 
issues," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. 
  "He was just elected this morning, so we'll have to wait to 
see how that situation shapes up domestically," she told a White 
House press briefing. 
  "We will work with Prime Minister Hata's new government," 
Myers said. 
  Hata, 58, was former foreign minister of Japan. He replaced 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned amid allegations of financial 
wrongdoing.
