  [Text] TOKYO, May 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
told a visitor from China on Wednesday [11 May] that Japan will 
broaden the teaching of history in schools to inform the younger 
generations about Japan's acts of aggression before and during 
World War II, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  In a meeting with Liu Peng, the visiting president of the 
All-China Youth Federation, Hata was quoted as saying, "Japan 
must tell the generations of its offspring that such incidents 
(acts of aggression) occurred." The two met at his official 
residence. 
  Liu told Hata he was "surprised" at the remark by former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who caused widespread anger by 
calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." Nagano 
resigned Saturday and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai. 
  "The remark was made by an elderly man and I know that 
Japanese youth does not have such a perception," Liu was quoted 
as saying. 
  In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN published May 4, Nagano said the actions of the Imperial 
Japanese Army was aimed at liberating Asian countries from 
Western colonialism. 
  Hata told Liu Japan "feels deep repentance" over the Nagano 
remarks and is determined not to repeat a war of aggression.
