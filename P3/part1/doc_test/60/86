  [Text] Tokyo, January 9 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata ended his 2-day visit to China today and 
returned to Tokyo this evening. 
  The Japanese media has been reacting favorably to the trip. 
Leading newspapers, news agencies and TV stations here have 
given prominent coverage to Hata's talks with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen and the meetings with Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. 
  As deputy prime minister, as well as foreign minister in the 
Hosokawa cabinet, Hata's China trip paves the way for the 
planned visit to China by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa this 
spring. 
  Political analysts have pointed out that Hata's journey to 
China has helped alleviate the bitter memories of the past, and 
renewed bilateral ties enabling a free exchange of opinion. 
  That the visit marks a major step forward in ushering in a 
new era for Sino-Japanese relations was a view widely expressed 
in the Japanese media.
