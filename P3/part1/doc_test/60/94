  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- A high-ranking Russian 
diplomat praised Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has 
been nominated for the post of the prime minister, for promoting 
normal relations with Russia. 
  "The Russian side considers that relations with Japan are 
developing normally, at a good speed. This is a big merit of 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata", 
Director of the Asian Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
Nikolay Solovev told TASS on Friday. 
  He added that Hata had supported Russian reforms during his 
recent visit to Moscow. Our two countries, he said, should 
proceed in developing relations which will give a possibility of 
solving problems on which it is hard to reach agreements so far. 
  A new Japanese prime minister is expected to be elected by 
parliament on Monday. The ruling coalition which nominated Hata 
has a majority of 265 out of 511 seats in the House of 
Representatives.
