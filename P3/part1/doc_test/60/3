  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said today that Japan should adopt a correct 
attitude toward its part in history of aggression and continue 
to seek development through peace. 
  The spokesman made this remark here today at a weekly press 
conference when commenting on Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's reported speech on the statement by Japanese Minister of 
Justice Shigeto Nagano that the Nanjing massacre was fabricated. 
  He said the Chinese side has already made representations 
with the Japanese side over the history distorting remarks made 
by Nagano and demanded that the Japanese Government treat this 
matter with all seriousness. 
  "We have taken note of Prime Minister Hata's attitude toward 
the history distorting statement made by Minister of Justice 
Shigeto Nagano," the spokesman said. 
  "It is in the interests of the Japanese people and of peace 
and stability in Asia for Japan to adopt a correct attitude 
toward its past history of aggression and continue to seek 
development through peace. 
  "Herein lies the important political foundation for 
Sino-Japanese friendly relations and cooperation," he added.
