  [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
urged Chinese and Japanese leaders to work together to ensure 
the long-term and steady growth of their bilateral ties. 
  Jiang, in an hour-long meeting with visiting Japanese Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, noted that 
remarkable progress has been made in promoting the Sino-Japanese 
relations in various fields, due to joint efforts. 
  He recalled his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro 
Hosokawa during the informal APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] summit in Seattle last November, saying that the 
two leaders reached agreement on many issues. 
  Jiang also stressed that it is very important for the 
Chinese 
and Japanese leaders to take a long-term point of view in 
reviewing and handling Sino-Japanese relations. 
  He said that a steady growth of such relations benefits both 
sides and is also useful to peace and development in the Asia- 
Pacific region and in the world at large. 
  Hata agreed with Jiang's assessment of the Sino-Japanese 
relations, saying that the furtherance of the relations produces 
a positive impact on peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region and in the whole world. 
  He also expressed admiration over China's economic growth 
and 
the successful reform and opening drive. 
  Present at the meeting was Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen.
