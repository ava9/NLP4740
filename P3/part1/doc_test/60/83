  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng exchanged views on Sino-Japanese relations and regional 
issues with visiting Japanese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata here this afternoon. 
  Li said he was pleased with the smooth development of Sino- 
Japanese relations in recent years. 
  "Sino-Japanese relations have made satisfactory achievements 
in every field of communication and cooperation," Li said. 
  "Cooperation in the economy, trade and technology has been 
on 
a track of steady development, with the volume of bilateral 
trade hitting 35 billion U.S. dollars last year, which is a 
result of joint efforts and symbolizes that Sino-Japanese 
relations have entered a new stage," said Premier Li peng. 
  He urged that both countries should exert further efforts to 
keep the momentum going. 
  "With the deepening of China's reform, and the growing of 
China's huge market, the prospects for Sino-Japanese cooperation 
is promising," Li said. 
  Tsutomu Hata arrived in Beijing this afternoon. 
  Li said Hata's two-day official visit to China will 
certainly 
strengthen Sino-Japanese relations. 
  "The purpose of reform is to develop productivity, and 
enhance people's living standard," Li said when briefing Hata on 
China's reform. 
  The years of practice had indicated that China had paid much 
attention to and was able to deal properly with problems arising 
in the process of reform and development, Li said. 
  "Whenever we are to adopt a new measure, we always take into 
consideration the endurance capability of the country, 
enterprises and people," Li said. 
  When talking about the Korean peninsula, Li emphasized that 
China supports the non-nuclear proposal and stability and peace 
there, and hoped the nuclear problem of the peninsula would be 
resolved through negotiations. 
  "We oppose any coercive way or embargo, which will 
inevitably 
make the problem more complicated," Li said. 
  Hata said Japan was satisfied with the current Japan-China 
relations, and expressed admiration for China's rapid economic 
growth. 
  Hata held that China's reforms are of great importance to 
Asia and the Pacific region. 
  Hata told Li that though a new government now ruled in 
Japan, 
the policy of Japan-China friendship will not be changed. 
  Li extended through Hata his invitation for Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa to visit China. 
  Hata said prime minister Hosokawa was looking forward to 
touring China soon. 
  Among those also taking part in the meeting were Deputy 
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and other high Chinese 
and Japanese officials.
