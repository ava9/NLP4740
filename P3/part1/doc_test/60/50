  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New Justice Minister Hiroshi 
Nakai expressed remorse Monday [9 May] over Japan's aggression 
and colonial rule in the first half of the century. But he 
refrained from criticizing his predecessor Shigeto Nagano, who 
quit over his controversial remarks about the war. "As one of 
the Japanese I must have a feeling of deep remorse and apology 
for the numerous acts of aggression, including colonization," 
Nakai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE at his office 
at the Justice Ministry. 
  Nakai replaced Nagano, who resigned as justice minister 
Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks, which were 
published in a newspaper last Wednesday. He said the 1937 
Nanjing massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with 
China and other countries was not aimed at aggression. 
  "It's correct that the Imperial Japanese Army after invading 
Nanjing at the time massacred ordinary Chinese people," Nakai 
said. 
  Unlike Nagano, who participated in the war with China as an 
army officer, Nakai, born in 1942 in China's Changchun, which 
then belonged to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, was 
still a child at the time the war ended. But as his family was 
repatriated in September 1946, Nakai said he is well aware of 
"the various implications Japan's utter defeat had." 
  Nakai, who was in the middle of a meeting with his election 
committee in Nabari, Mie Prefecture, when Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata called Saturday night to offer him the cabinet post, said 
he accepted out of understanding for "Hata's feelings in this 
very difficult situation." 
  Asked whether he plans to make use of his directional 
authority that allows the justice minister to intervene with the 
prosecution, Nakai said he "does not intend to take action to 
intervene in individual problems." 
  He declined to comment on the ongoing debate about whether 
the United Nations should impose sanctions on North Korea to 
enforce its request for full inspections of the country's 
nuclear facilities, saying he first wants to study relevant 
reports currently being prepared by various government 
institutions. 
  Stressing that the justice minister's duty is to maintain 
law 
and order, Nakai said he does not want to become involved in the 
discussion about the enactment of legislation covering 
emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to 
collective defense. 
  "It's quite right that everybody voices different views and 
standpoints, and that the Diet and political parties deliberate 
(this problem)...However, I don't want to anticipate this 
discussion," Nakai said.
