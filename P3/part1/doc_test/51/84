MALAWI magistrates' court yesterday charged pro-democracy campaigner
Chakufwa Chihana with three counts related to sedition, his lawyer, Mr
Bazuka Mhango, said, Reuter reports from Lusaka. The case had been referred
to the high court for trial.
'He has been charged with offences relating to sedition, the first one of
importing seditious publications, second, being found in possession of
seditious publications and third, preparing an act with seditious intent,'
Mr Mhango said. The penalty was a fine equal to Dollars 770 (Pounds 403) or
a five-year prison sentence.
Mr Chihana, 52, chairman of the Lusaka-based Interim Committee for a
Democratic Alliance, was arrested on April 6 when he returned to Malawi from
meetings with pro-democracy exiles in Zambia and South Africa.
He was freed after a high court judge granted him bail, the first in
Malawi's history of political detentions. Western governments have been
pressing President Kamuzu Banda to allow opposition parties in Malawi.
