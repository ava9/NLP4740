  [Text] Malawi's president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, has 
said he will have no problems in forming a coalition government 
with the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, if his party, the United 
Democratic Front, UDF, failed to win a majority in number of 
seats in Parliament. Addressing a press conference in Blantyre 
today, Mr, Muluzi ruled out the possibility of forming an 
alliance with the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] if his party 
failed to (?form) a majority in Parliament. But Mr. Muluzi 
disclosed that his government will look after the outgoing 
president, Dr. Kamuzu Banda. 
  On his government's policy on the economy, Mr. Muluzi said 
his priority will be to alleviate poverty. He said his 
government will attempt to improve social services, reduce the 
high infant mortality rate, and improve the education sector to 
reduce the illiteracy rate (?in the country). Mr. Muluzi also 
said that the UDF government would put emphasis on the 
enforcement of the rule of law. Mr. Muluzi will be sworn in as 
president on Saturday on May the 21st. 
  In his victory speech addressed to UDF supporters at the UDF 
national headquarters, Mr. Muluzi said all Malawians are winners 
because they have made it possible for this country to 
experience political transition [words indistinct] the only way 
of (?building) reconciliation and democracy is in Malawi to 
stay. [words indistinct] the UDF government was not a government 
of [words indistinct]. At this point, Mr. Muluzi called on the 
people to join hands [words indistinct] regardless of political 
affiliation, race, [words indistinct] or color [passage omitted 
including indistinct words]
