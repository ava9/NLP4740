  [Text] Malawians attending the inauguration of President 
Bakili Muluzi in Blantyre's football stadium have begun tearing 
down election posters and official portraits of former President 
Kamuzu Banda. The 60,000-strong crowd also removed the 
lettering of the words, Long Live Kamuzu, from the walls of the 
stadium. In a conciliatory gesture, Mr. Muluzi has told the 
former president that he may stay on in the glamorous Sanjika 
Palace for as long as he likes. With the results of five 
constituencies still outstanding, Mr. Muluzi's United Democratic 
Front has won 84 of the 177 seats, compared to the 52 of Mr. 
Banda's Congress Party.
