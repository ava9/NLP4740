  [Text] The president-elect of Malawi, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 
has pledged an open government and a close working relationship 
with opposition parties. Addressing a media conference in 
Blantyre, he said he held no grudge against the previous 
government of Dr. Kamuzu Banda, and that he did not believe in 
starting a witch-hunt against its members. 
  Mr. Muluzi said he would have no problem in seeking an 
alliance with Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy in 
the event of his party not gaining an outright majority. The 
final results of the elections are expected later today. 
  On relations with South Africa, Mr. Muluzi said he would 
seek 
close cooperation and pointed out that a formal trade agreement 
existed between the two countries. He said the alleviation of 
poverty in Malawi and environmental affairs would receive 
priority. His inauguration as president will take place in 
Blantyre on Saturday.
