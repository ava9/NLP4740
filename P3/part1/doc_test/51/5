  [Text] The man most likely to succeed Dr. Banda, as the 
current pattern of results continues, is the UDF [United 
Democratic Front] candidate Bakili Muluzi. On the line to 
Blantyre last night, I asked Mr. Muluzi whether he now expected 
to be Malawi's next president. 
  [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Well, I think so, from the look 
of 
the things. From the results that have already been counted, 
definitely yes. For your information, I had already a call from 
the vice president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] conveying 
congratulations from Dr. Banda and conceding defeat. 
  [Unidentified reporter] And what about in the parliamentary 
results. Do you also expect to hold a majority in parliament? 
  [Muluzi] Well, yes, we might just make it. You know that we 
actually have got most of the seats in the southern region and 
some seats in the central region; and definitely we might just 
make it for majority in parliament. 
  [Reporter] With things still not quite over yet, there is 
still a way to go. If it does emerge that you don't quite have 
enough of a majority in parliament, is it possible you would 
consider a coalition, and if so, who do you think that is likely 
to be with? 
  [Muluzi] Well, we haven't given a thought to that one, but 
if 
that comes to that kind of thing, we wouldn't mind talking to 
the other opposition parties. In this case, we are talking 
about Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. I have not had any word 
with our good friend, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, but if it comws to 
that, we will definitely be talking to them. After all, we 
fought this campaign, particularly the referendum, together. 
So, we definitely, would not mind talking to them at all. 
  [Reporter] So, in other words, would you rule out altogether 
any kind of a deal with MCP? 
  [Muluzi] Well, yes. Mind you, although it wasn't a fight as 
such, but I think we are fighting a system and that system was 
the Malawi Congress Party system. We definitely have not even 
thought about talking to Malawi Congress Party at all. The 
opposition that is leading at the moment, apart from the UDF, is 
Aford, and perhaps one would be more comfortable talking to 
Aford than MCP. 
  [Reporter] So, Mr. Muluzi, has your success in this election 
come as something of a surprise to you or not? 
  [Muluzi] I wouldn't say as a surprise. I think our party has 
been very popular. From the beginning, it was one of those 
parties which was well organized, and we had support in a quite 
a number of areas in our country. So, yes, a surprise, but not 
a lot of surprise. I think we definitely expected some kind of 
change. Let me just mention again that, I think, the mood in 
Malawi has been for change. I think people have been looking 
for a change for a long time. I think it is just time that 
people wanted change. 
  [Reporter] So, finally at this time, do you have any message 
for the man who is still, after all, the incumbent president in 
Malawi, President Banda? 
  [Muluzi] Well, let me just mention one thing to you -- that 
we definitely recognize the role that Dr. Banda played, you 
know, during the time he has been president. I mean, he has 
been president of Malawi for the last 30 years. Definitely, one 
perhaps would say, look, let him retire in peace. I personally 
had nothing personal to Dr. Banda [sentence as heard]. I think 
we are fighting his system of government. So, what I would like 
to say is that, you know, let him have a peaceful retirement. I 
would definitely want to thank him for whatever contribution he 
made to Malawi. I think it is just human to say that. [end
