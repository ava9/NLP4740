reform

ONE OF Africa's most extraordinary political careers came in effect to an
unheralded end this week.
Without fanfare, and in accordance with the constitution, executive power
passed from the hands of Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda to a
triumvirate drawn from the ranks of the ruling Malawi Congress party.
Dr Banda, who has presided over the country's fortunes since independence in
1964, is convalescing after brain surgery in a South African clinic, and
unlikely to make a political comeback. But the reforms he reluctantly set in
train now have a momentum of their own.
The country's transition from one-party rule to multi-party democracy, which
began last June when a substantial majority voted in a referendum to end
single-party rule, looks set to end in a general election next May.
Campaigning has yet to get formally under way, but the ruling party could
well retain office through a combination of shrewd tactics and a divided
opposition.
The former is illustrated by the party's choice for chairman of the
triumvirate: Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, a former cabinet minister, who came out of
prison in July after serving 13 years' hard labour for sedition. That he
should now be willing to lead the party which locked him up, followed by a
brief spell with the opposition United Democratic Front, may be seen as
opportunistic or pragmatic. It certainly took the opposition by surprise.
A party stalwart, Mr John Tembo, is also in the new triumvirate, the closest
minister to Mr Banda in recent years and long tipped as his successor. But
Mr Tembo appears to have moved with the times.
Few now think he will try to roll back the democratisation process that has
been urged on Malawi by the international community. The government has so
far honoured its pledge to work with opposition parties, represented on a
National Consultative Council on which they hold a majority, towards general
elections.
The current issue for the Congress party is not how to prevent political
pluralism but how to survive within it; and the indications are that the
party may yet have a political future despite a distinctly mixed past, with
a moderate to good record on economic management and a very poor one on
human rights.
Impoverished at independence, the country remains poor, with a per capita
GNP of Dollars 160 (Pounds 106), among the lowest in the world, reflected in
bad health and social indicators.
However, none of the economic challenges ahead have been seriously addressed
by Malawi's new and vociferous political classes, partly because they
recognise the constraints that will limit the policy choices of whoever is
in power.
Thus a round of strikes last month in pursuit of pay claims, many in excess
of 100 per cent, passed almost without comment from Mr Chakufwa Chihana,
leader of the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), or Mr Bakili Muluzi of the
rival United Democratic Front.
There is, it seems, a tacit agreement with the government that the country
cannot afford the inflationary pressure of wage settlements.
Instead, the main opposition groups prefer to keep attention focused on
their rival claims to be the most effective guarantors of human rights and
democracy.
Aford perhaps has the moral edge in the display of democratic credentials.
Mr Chihana has a trade union background and has thrice been imprisoned by
the Banda regime, whereas Mr Muluzi is a former cabinet minister and
secretary general of the Congress party.
UDF, however, has more evident support in the business community, more funds
and better organisation, and is better able to present itself as a serious
contender for government.
Both parties accept the broad terms of structural adjustment in progress in
Malawi since the late 1980s and are resigned to funding any new social or
productive programmes from rationalisation of existing government
expenditure.
Two much smaller opposition parties, the Malawi Democratic party and the
United Front for Multiparty Democracy, are hoping to pick up refugees from
the larger groups.
With little of substance yet to distinguish the main opposition contenders,
the clearest difference for most Malawians is their regional affiliation.
Aford's support lies predominantly in the north, UDF's in the south. Mr
Chihana and Mr Muluzi both aspire to address the whole country, but the
vaguer they are about what they stand for, the greater the perception of
regionalism becomes.
If this trend is consolidated, the Malawi Congress party may yet retain
support in the central region, with which it is primarily identified, or
even manage to project itself as the most truly national of the contenders
for power in the elections scheduled for May.
