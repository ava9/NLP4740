BLANTYRE, Malawi

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arriving in Malawi, whose economic self-sufficiency has been all but destroyed 
by a heavy influx of refugees from Mozambique, Pope John Paul II paid tribute 
Thursday to the remarkable selflessness of the people of this African country. 
</P>
<P>
"The international community applauds your generosity," the Pope said on the 
final stop of a nine-day visit to southern Africa. He will leave Saturday for 
Rome, having visited -- in addition to Malawi -- Madagascar, the French island 
of Reunion and Zambia since beginning the tour April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff was greeted at Blantyre airport by perhaps the most distinctive 
head of state he has encountered on this trip, H. Kamuzu Banda, the 
nonagenarian "president for life" of Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
Banda wasted no time in lecturing the Pope about his own accomplishments in 
leading this landlocked, resource-poor nation of 7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you've heard and read in the newspapers that Malawi has a very good 
name, especially in Europe, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the United 
States. . . ." He reeled off the name of virtually every major nation in his 
surprisingly firm baritone. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard and read that Malawi is one of the best-governed countries in 
Africa," he added, in what might apply more to the impeccable tidiness of 
Malawi's streets, the orderliness of its crowds and the precise orchestration 
of its presidential rallies than to its rock-bottom per capita spending on 
education and health, its declining literacy rate and its level of political 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
Banda has also lent his people something of his own religious background -- a 
Calvinist Presbyterianism that places them among Africa's most abstemious 
people. Although the country is a major exporter of tobacco, cigarette smokers 
are rare here. "Why consume what we can export for money?" a businessman 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catholics and Protestants 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of the population is Catholic and a third is Protestant, including 
members of some Presbyterian splinter sects found nowhere but in Scotland and 
Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
The welcoming ceremony was more notable for what went unsaid than for what was 
said. Absent from the pontiff's and president's remarks was any reference to 
apartheid, the racist policy of South Africa that was the subtext at almost 
every gathering on the Pope's previous stop, in Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
This was not surprising, for two African leaders could scarcely differ more in 
their approach to South Africa than do Banda and Zambia's President Kenneth D. 
Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, perhaps Africa's most obdurate foe of South Africa, maintains full 
diplomatic relations with the anti-apartheid African National Congress, and 
Banda's Malawi is the only sub-Saharan country that maintains full diplomatic 
relations with Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Banda has long held that normal relations are necessary because of the economic 
dependence of most southern African countries on South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the Pope's focus on Malawi's service to the Mozambicans was 
entirely appropriate. Malawi had been producing enough corn and other staples 
to feed itself before the vicious Mozambican guerrilla war began forcing 
refugees across the border three years ago. Today there are more than 600,000 
Mozambicans in Malawi, many of them occupying otherwise cultivable land. 
</P>
<P>
Now Malawi is an importer of food. The huge refugee population has denuded its 
forests in quest of firewood, leading to severe flooding in districts that had 
not been so inundated in more than 30 years. In the south, where the greatest 
concentrations of Mozambicans are found, roads crucial to the transport of farm 
goods have been shattered by the passage of heavy trucks carrying relief 
supplies.
