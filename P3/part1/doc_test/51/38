  [Text] The Malawi Congress Party, MCP, has expressed 
concern of the misdemeanor by UDF [United Democratic Front] 
supporters in some parts of the country, whom, it said, were 
harassing or committing violent acts against its supporters as 
they celebrated their party's victory. 
  In a statement issued in Lilongwe, spokesman for the MCP 
said 
in the capital city UDF supporters carried a mock coffin of His 
Excellency President Ngwazi [paramount] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, while 
six houses of MCP supporters have been destroyed in Balaka. The 
spokesman said a house belonging to an MCP functionary was 
stoned in Blantyre, while some village headmen and chiefs have 
been threatened with burning of their houses and dethronement in 
Nsanje, (Jaturu), and other districts in the southern region. 
  The spokesman said such acts and threats were unwarranted 
and 
called on the president-elect to put an immediate end to them. 
He said the MCP would hold the UDF and its leaders responsible 
for any damage to property and harm to the MCP supporters. The 
spokesman, however, reassured all MCP supporters not to feel 
intimidated by anyone because, he said, they are equally 
protected by the law and Constitution of this country.
