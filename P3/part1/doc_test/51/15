  [Text] The Electoral Commission has released the national 
results of the parliamentary and presidential elections. 
Announcing these in a press release, the Electoral Commission 
said in the presidential race, the final results are as follows: 
Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 1,404,754 votes; Dr. Kamuzu Banda, 996,363; 
Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, 552,862 votes; Mr. Kampelo Kaluwa, 
15,624. 
  In the parliamentary election the distribution of seats is 
84 
seats for UDF [United Democratic Front]; 65 seats for MCP 
[Malawi Congress Party] and 36 seats for Aford [Alliance for 
Democracy]; the rest of the contesting parties did not win a 
single seat. The Electoral Commission has also nullified the 
results in two constituencies in Nsanje, namely, Nsanje north 
and Nsanje southwest. This follows the commission's 
investigation of complaints of irregularities in these 
constituencies. The commission discovered that at one station 
figures kept by all monitors did not agree with the official 
figure and that some important documents like ballot paper 
counterfoils, original forms for results, were missing. 
  In another station, the ballot papers used during the 
elections were missing. The elections in the two constituencies 
will be rerun. The Electoral Commission will announce details 
of the by-elections later.
