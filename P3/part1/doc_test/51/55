  [Text] An unofficial report from Blantyre says a crack 
police unit saved the home affairs minister, Mr. Gwanda 
Chakuamba, from stoning by members of the opposition United 
Democratic Front Party after he addressed a rally of the ruling 
Malawi Congress Party yesterday. Several residents of Bangwe, 
one of Blantyre's biggest townships with over 150,000 people, 
told newsmen that Mr. Chakuamba, who is secretary general of the 
Malawi Congress Party, was stoned after upsetting opposition 
supporters by calling the president of the United Democratic 
Front, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, stupid.
