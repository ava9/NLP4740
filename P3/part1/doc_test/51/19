FT  17 MAY 94 / Regional divide marks Malawi poll: Lack of policy
differences has changed the contest

Nearly half Malawi's children are stunted by malnutrition, according to the
government's own figures. Seven out of ten women cannot read. Nearly half a
million families live on farms of less than an acre (less than 0.5ha) and
earn less than Dollars 50 a year in cash and kind.
This is the grim reality of the 'least developed' tag conferred by the UN on
a country that ranks among the 15 poorest in the world.
It is a reality that has received little attention on the hustings during
Malawi's first multi-party election campaign, because the contenders barely
differ on what to do about it.
Yesterday Malawi's parliament approved an interim constitution on the eve of
today's parliamentary and presidential elections that many analysts believe
will bring an end to 30 years of domination by the ailing President Hastings
Kamuzu Banda, believed to be in his mid-90s, and his Malawi Congress party
(MCP).
The interim constitution curtails the sweeping and absolute powers enjoyed
by President Banda and was worked out by an all-party panel earlier this
year after opposition parties, banned since 1966 in a crackdown on dissent,
were legalised.
President Banda's grip on power was evident when the MCP chose him as its
presidential candidate, despite his infirmity. But public impatience with
his dictatorial ways have showed up in the final days of the campaign, when
his rallies have drawn smaller numbers of supporters than those of the
opposition.
A small, land-locked country with negligible industry and an overwhelmingly
rural population, Malawi has relied since independence in 1964 on rain-fed
subsistence agriculture and cash-crops: tobacco, tea and sugar. This will
not change in the short term, although diversification into low-volume,
high-value crops is being encouraged.
In 1990, Mr Banda's government adopted a 'growth through poverty reduction'
strategy of allowing smallholders a share in the lucrative, export market
for Burley tobacco, previously dominated by large estates. Gradually the
economy has been liberalised through the reduction of import barriers,
divestment and privatisation of para-statals and the lifting of foreign
exchange controls.
All of this, the government believes, will enhance efficiency, boost exports
and attract foreign capital. The opposition agrees.
Two years ago, when trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the
opposition Alliance for Democracy (Aford), was imprisoned for his advocacy
of political pluralism and donors imposed an aid embargo to press for 'good
governance', political change seemed inevitable and Mr Chihana the likeliest
man to take the helm.
Now President Banda's MCP has accepted change, albeit grudgingly, and is
struggling to graft a new, democratic identity on to its 'Four Cornerstones'
of Unity, Obedience, Discipline and Loyalty.
One consequence is that Mr Chihana has lost the political initiative and
probably, with it, his chances of the presidency. For lack of policy
differences has, for many voters, turned the election into a contest between
the regions.
Aford is associated with the north, the MCP with the centre, and Mr Bakili
Muluzi's United Democratic Front with the south. If people vote along
regional lines, Mr Muluzi will win, because the south is the most populous.
Ethnically complex regional distinctions were embedded in the early colonial
period when British missionaries developed the best schooling in the north,
and consolidated the south's commercial orientation, which itself stemmed
from early Arab influence.
Censuses in the Banda era did not acknowledge tribal differences, merely
dividing the population into Africans, Asians and a diminishing number of
Europeans. Yet the north-south divide has remained marked with persistent
jockeying for regional advantage.
When President Banda was invited back to Malawi in 1958 to lead the
independence movement, after many years in the US, Britain, and Ghana, he,
as a native of the centre, was the compromise candidate between better-known
contenders from north and south. Since then he has favoured and developed
the centre, building a new capital city there and making its language,
Chichewa, an official, national language alongside English.
Mr Chihana could probably have transcended the regional divide by endorsing
the wage demands of striking private and public sector workers who brought
the country to a standstill last September.
But his 'trade unionist' label is deceptive. If he was ever drawn to
'African socialism', Mr Chihana is no longer. He not only embraces the
market but is committed to an austerity period to check the inflationary
pressures of devaluation, Aford's political secretary and chief ideologue,
Mr Mapopa Chipeta, identifies the future goal as 'developing a dynamic,
indigenous, capitalist class'.
Such talk echoes the first days of African independence, reflecting the
extent to which economic power in Malawi has remained in the hands of
President Banda and the family of his consort, 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira,
through their ownership of the enormous Press Group of companies, long
managed by British and South African expatriates.
That capitalism needs popularising and Africanising is also exactly what Mr
Muluzi and other UDF leaders believe. Moreover, several of them, as
medium-scale entrepreneurs frustrated by Mr Banda's grip on the economy, can
convincingly claim to be prototypes of the new capitalist class.
It is this class which will most clearly benefit from economic
liberalisation in Malawi. Mr Muluzi, as representative of it and of the
south, seems most likely to take the presidency, particularly if memories of
repression obliterate the MCP vote in the centre, and despite his own long
association with the MCP in the past.
But any new government will face two big problems. With regional divisions
exposed by the campaign after a long period when unity was enforced through
repression, it will not be easy to maintain national cohesion. Nor will it
be easy to explain to impoverished Malawians that democracy alone is no
guarantor of prosperity.
