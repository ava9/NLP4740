  [Text] The four-day national constitutional conference 
ended today at (Kwacha) International Conference Center in 
Blantyre, with delegates approving the draft constitution, but 
also calling on the NCC [National Consultative Council] to 
contribute to the issue. Our correspondent says the delegates, 
among other issues, urged the NCC to redouble its efforts to 
ensure that the constitution becomes effective immediately after 
the forthcoming multiparty general elections. The conference 
also recommended that Malawi's traditional and moral values be 
included in the constitution in such a way that they stand to 
take (?their turn). 
  And in their speeches during the closing session, leaders 
[words indistinct] representatives of the various political 
parties thanked the NCC for organizing the conference. They 
said the conference had rendered their parties the opportunity 
to contribute their views on the draft constitution. 
  In his remarks, the UNDP [UN Development Program] resident 
representative in Malawi, Mr. (Michael Haynes), said the 
conference was a historic moment for Malawi, because it has 
provided an opportunity for laying a foundation for a new 
constitution for the country.
