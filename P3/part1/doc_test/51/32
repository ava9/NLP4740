  [Text] As Malawians celebrate the birth of democracy, a 
debate is raging about the constitution of the new president's 
choice of ministers. It had been thought that President Bakili 
Muluzi, who leads the United Democratic Front [UDF], would have 
offered some important cabinet posts to Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's 
Aford [Alliance for Democracy] party who did not do as well as 
expected in the polls. But so far all the positions have gone 
only to Mr. Muluzi's UDF party, but the UDF did not secure a 
working majority in the elections. So, they will have to form a 
coalition and it had been widely anticipated that this will be 
with Aford. Mary Gregory asked Aford's secretary for legal and 
constitutional affairs, Mr. Bazuka Muhango, how the party felt 
about the cabinet appointments. 
  [Begin recording] [Muhango] It is very disappointing because 
the question about the seats we are talking about was something 
that was to arise after some negotiations for a coalition had 
been struck. We made certain demands, that is, the team from 
Aford made certain demands for a coalition participation. It 
looks like the UDF government was not interested in a coalition 
arrangement. They only wanted Aford to participate in 
government. 
  [Gregory] What demands did you make? 
  [Muhango] Well, we did make a demand of eight ministerial 
seats and we did make preferences taking into account, you know, 
the real effectiveness of participation in the coalition. 
  [Gregory] Negotiations between Aford and the UDF broke down 
on Tuesday [24 May]. So, what are you planning to do next? 
  [Muhango] We are assembling over the weekend -- I am talking 
about Aford now -- in order to reflect on the aftermath of this 
and a decision will be made when the assembly made up of elected 
members and the council members of Aford will have to assemble 
and deliberate on this matter. 
  [Gregory] There are still three seats vacant in the cabinet 
that haven't been allocated to anybody. So, if you are offered 
those three seats, will you accept them and will you be happy 
with just those three? 
  [Muhango] Well, I cannot decide for the council meeting, but 
obviously if you look at the ministries that are (?to be) 
filled, they are [words indistinct] type of ministries with very 
little consequences on governmental performance, and we think 
that it's really a joke that [words indistinct] reserving them 
in order to offer them to Aford. It can only show that they 
were not seriously [words indistinct] in any coalition 
arrangement with Aford. It would depend on what the council 
decides, but my personal feeling is that perhaps Aford would not 
really enter on an arrangement on the basis of that offer. 
  [Gregory] So, what solution do you see to this problem? 
  [Muhango] Well, our view was that given the results of the 
election the matter would have been resolved by actually getting 
consultations with all the parties that took part in the 
election and had some positive results because the split in the 
vote is such that you really can go across the country and see 
that each of the major parties have won in one of the regions. 
So, to avoid the fragmentation of the country, our view is that 
maybe we should proceed on the basis that we are to reconcile 
the different sections and regions of the country. Malawi 
requires to have a kind of a government of national unity, at 
least for some period. [end recording]
