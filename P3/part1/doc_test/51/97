  [Text] The chairman of the Disarmament Committee, 
Lieutenant General Manken Kigawa, has expressed concern that 
some members of the (?disbanded) Malawi Young Pioneers movement, 
MYP, and a substantial amount of arms and ammunition still 
remain unaccounted for. 
  Lt. Gen. Kigawa expressed this concern at the Army 
headquarters in Lilongwe when he briefed the press and diplomats 
on the progress so far made in disarming the MYP. He said it 
was sad that after receiving the MYP [word indistinct] and 
government efforts to find ways and means of absorbing some key 
members of the MYP, the question of repatriation of over 2,000 
former MYP believed to be in Mozambique, was still unresolved. 
  He said the Army was doing its best to ensure that the 
matter 
is resolved as soon as possible. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army 
will remain vigilant and will not tolerate any groups or 
individuals who may want to support violence in the country. He 
therefore advised the general public not to possess unlicensed 
arms. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army will ensure that the 
forthcoming presidential and parliamentary general elections are 
free and fair. 
  Also speaking at the press conference, the secretary for 
youth, sports and culture, Mr. (Michael Timotu) appealed to 
those who are in the MYP movement to identify themselves to the 
police for their assistance saying if they were caught with arms 
they would be prosecuted.
