  [Text] Malawi's preparations for the multiparty elections 
in May have got under way today with the beginning of voter 
registration and the start of three days of debate on the 
Constitution. For the last few months, the National 
Consultative Council, which has representatives from both the 
ruling Congress Party and the opposition, has been working on 
changes to the old one-party system and now a constitutional 
conference is being held in Blantyre, from where Willie Zinkhane 
reports: 
  [Begin Zinkhane recording] The constitutional conference 
opened on a hot note today in Blantyre, where 250 delegates from 
all walks have the difficult task of (?commenting) on the draft 
Constitution drawn up by the National Consultative Council. In 
the afternoon, the presidents of seven contesting parties had 
10-minute speeches to (?share) their expectations of the new 
Constitution. President Hastings Banda was represented by his 
deputy, Gwanda Chakuamba Phiri, who said the new Constitution 
should be a model that will work. From the speeches delivered 
this afternoon by the political party presidents, several 
critical points came out clearly: the new Constitution should 
reduce [word indistinct] the powers of the president, respect 
for human rights, independence of the judiciary, press freedom, 
land distribution, and the role of women and of the disabled. 
  Traditional chiefs, who did not have the floor today, looked 
excited about the developments. One traditional chief said: we 
are happy that we [words indistinct] in the new Constitution, 
unlike during the one-party system, when everything was dictated 
to us. 
  Meanwhile, the registration of voters has started in all the 
(?24) districts of Malawi. Reports from both rural and urban 
areas indicate that the turnout was good, but was mainly 
dominated by the youth, who rushed for the registration points. 
  With the voting age coming down from 21 to 18, many boys and 
girls look at the whole exercise with special interest. [end
