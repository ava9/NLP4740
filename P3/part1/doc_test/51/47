  [Text] As counting continues in the country's first 
multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections, unofficial 
results from various parts of the country show that the United 
Democratic Front, UDF, has made significant gains, especially in 
the southern region. Our correspondents covering the elections 
say that the Alliance for Democracy, AFORD, have taken most of 
the seats in the northern region but has failed badly in the 
central and southern region. 
  The correspondents say several ministers in the current 
cabinet have lost their parliamentary seats. These include the 
minister of justice and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore 
Munlo; the minister of forestry and natural resources, Hon. 
Mfunjo Mwanjasi Mwakikunga; the minister of energy and mining, 
Hon. Michael Mlambala; the vice president of the Malawi Congress 
Party, MCP, Hon. Bwanda Chakuamba; the minister at large, Hon. 
Sonnex Chitsonga; and the minister of labor, Hon. William Binali.
