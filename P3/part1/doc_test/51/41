  [Text] A memorandum of understanding was signed today in 
Lilongwe between the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, and Malawi 
Congress Party, MCP, under which the two parties will be working 
closer together to defend and preserve what they termed the 
endangered national unity and security of the country. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, the vice president of the 
MCP, Mr. Gwanda Chakuamba, urged people of this country to 
support the MPC-Aford national security initiative so as to 
achieve the desired result. Mr. Chakuamba gave credit to the 
Aford leadership for what he called their vision that the two 
parties should work together for the sake of national unity. 
  And in his remark at the same ceremony, the president of the 
Aford Party, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, pointed out that Aford and 
MCP had no intention of derailing the democratic change now in 
Malawi, and called on all the people to work together in 
creating what he called a common security for every Malawian. 
The Aford president said he was mindful that democracy is a 
delicate thing and that his conviction was that this country 
should not be divided just because someone wants to be a leader.
