  [Text] The National Consultative Council, which was formed 
last year to oversee Malawi's political transition to multiparty 
democracy, has been wound up. Speaking at the final press 
conference in Lilongwe, the chairman of the council for the 
month of May, Mr. Lovemore Munlo, commended the role of the 
council played during the transition period. He explained that 
the council was instrumental in changing the political scene in 
Malawi, thereby producing the first parliament and president in 
a multiparty system. 
  On the council's final discussions, Mr. Munlo said members 
had appealed to the newly-instituted government to consider 
funding political parties to pay their election monitors. He 
explained that it is a constitutional requirement that 
government should fund political parties, to ensure their 
continuity, and also allow competitive politics as a pillar of 
multiparty politics in Malawi. Mr. Munlo also said that the 
council had agreed to turn the (?returnee) committee into a 
commission which will cater not only for returnees but also for 
destitutes.
