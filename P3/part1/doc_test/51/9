  [Excerpts] The Alliance for Democracy, Aford, has today 
congratulated the president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, for 
winning the presidential vote, and wished him success in his new 
position. 
  The president of Aford, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, spoke to 
reporter (Francis Chicucuzeni) today, saying he was concerned 
about the regional fragmentation of this country in the 
elections. 
  [Begin Chihana recording] You are bringing a technical 
issue. I am concerned, I am worried that the country has been 
fragmented. Let me be very ordinary with you -- I was rather 
technical. Say, he has been voted overwhelmingly by the people 
of the south, southern region. And it seems the MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party] are holding the (?differential), and to my 
disappointment the people of the north have voted for AFORD. It 
will require a political acumen, leadership which is [word 
indistinct] to make sure that the country is back on track as a 
solely united country. Regardless of these factors which have 
been created by the result of the election, if I were Bakili I 
would definitely call on the MCP, the Alliance for Democracy for 
a get-together meeting to discuss this problem first before 
going to [word indistinct] [passage omitted]. 
  [(Chicucuzeni)] And what is your message now to the 
supporters of AFORD? 
  [Chihana] The supporters of AFORD, they must not worry. The 
country has chosen Bakili Muluzi as the next president in a 
democratic Malawi. I and my colleagues wish him all the best 
and we'll definitely support him. [end recording]
