  [Text] The British Government has assured the United 
Democratic Front [UDF] government of increased British economic 
and technical assistance as a way of helping it fulfill its 
programs of poverty alleviation and better economic management. 
The assurance was given in Blantyre today by the permanent 
secretary of the British Overseas Development Administration, 
Mr. (John Burke) when he held discussions with the vice 
president, the Right Honorable Justin Malewezi and the minister 
of finance, Hon. Aleke Banda. Speaking to MBC, Mr. (Burke) 
said his government was pleased with the peaceful transition in 
Malawi to a multiparty democracy and wishes to reaffirm its 
support for this country. Mr. (Burke), however, pointed out 
that further development aid will depend on the new government's 
determination to tighten controls in public spending, crack down 
on corruption, respect for human rights, liberalization of 
markets, and other initiatives which, he said, are crucial to 
all developing countries. 
  On his part, the vice president said the UDF government will 
exercise prudence in its accountability of public resources, as 
promised in its manifesto. Hon. Malewezi also disclosed that 
the government has already ordered the auditing of books in the 
civil service, a practice which, he said, was largely neglected 
in the former government.
