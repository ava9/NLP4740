  [Text] Talks between Malawi's two main opposition parties 
seem to have come to fruition today. The former ruling Malawi 
Congress Party, MCP, which was ousted in last month's elections, 
used to be the bete noire of the Alliance for Democracy, Aford. 
Aford's leader, Chakufwa Chihana, was jailed for several years 
under Dr. Banda and was at the forefront of the campaign for a 
multiparty system, but both lost out to the UDF [United 
Democratic Front], who formed the new government. After weeks 
of talks, the MCP and Aford have signed a memorandum of 
understanding. It was announced at a press conference at a 
Lilongwe hotel this afternoon. Willie Zingane was there. On 
the line Chris Green asked him what the memorandum says. 
  [Begin recording] [Zingane] It appears that the two parties 
in opposition would like to stick together in checking some of 
the issues that maybe the ruling United Democratic Front would 
be following, but the two leaders that signed the memorandum are 
Chakufwa Chihana, president of Aford, and vice president of the 
Malawi Congress Party, Gwanda Chakwamba, said that they saw the 
danger of tribalism in Malawi, and this could spark into 
violence. 
  [Green] What was the atmosphere like in today's 
announcement? 
  [Zinane] Well, from the people who have been at the 
conference, they belong to Malawi Congress Party and Aford, and 
so they were cheering the thing, but from outside, the United 
Democratic Front have also got their side of the story, and they 
feel that the two parties are just coming together to try and 
give them tough time in parliament. 
  [Green] There must be people inside Aford who regard talking 
to the Malawi Congress Party as akin to talking to the devil. 
  [Zingane] Yes, there are. There has been a rumor that some 
senior members of Aford didn't attend today's function because 
they are not happy, because this is the same party that they 
fought against. 
  [Green] Are there specific people that you would have 
expected to be present today who are conspicuous by their 
absence? 
  [Zingane] Well, the vice president of Aford, Reverend Peter 
Kaleso, was not there. The publicity secretary of Aford, Simon 
Pandule, who should have chaired the press conference is in 
Lilongwe, but did not come, and rumors are saying that they 
expressed reservation about this come together. 
  [Green] What do Malawians who don't belong to one of these 
three parties think of the antics since the elections? 
  [Zingane] The Malawians in general are a bit disturbed, 
because they are saying that they voted for change, and they 
have got it in the referendum against the one-party system and 
they won, and the next thing they voted in the general 
elections, and at least an opposition party won, and they are 
saying where is the change, if people are going to waste time 
arguing and quarreling about things they should solve even 
before parliament meets next week. [end recording]
