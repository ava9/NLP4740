  [Text] Blantyre, March 12 (AFP) -- The main opposition 
United Democratic Front said Saturday [12 March] it was pulling 
out of the all-party council managing Malawi's transition to 
democracy in protest over moves to bar its leader from running 
in May 17 general elections. 
  The party's vice-president, Aleke Banda, said at a press 
briefing that his party was quitting the National Consultative 
Council after failing to block a new constitutional provision 
barring politicians with criminal records from standing in the 
presidential and parliamentary elections in May. 
  The provision appeared aimed primarily at the front's 
president, Bakili Muluzi, who has been tipped to win the 
presidential election but who served a six month prison term 20 
years ago. 
  "This is wrong, there is no reason why such a rule should be 
build around an individual" Banda said. 
  The council, grouping Malawi's eight political parties, was 
formed to manage the country's transition to political pluralism 
after decades of rule by President Kamuzu Banda.
