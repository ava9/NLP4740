Malawi's new president, Mr Bakili Muluzi, is due to continue talks on
forming a coalition government, with five key parliamentary seats still in
dispute, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
Officials of Mr Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), which is just short
of a majority with 84 seats in the 177-member parliament, said they were
awaiting a response from a northern-based party on whether it wanted to join
in a coalition government.
'No talks have been opened with Aford (Alliance for Democracy). The position
of the UDF is that we have no major problem in working with Aford if they
are willing to work with us,' UDF publicity chief Kassam Chilumpha said.
AFORD, which won 36 seats in last Tuesday's elections, is led by veteran
trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, who draws support from his home area in
northern Malawi. Former President Hastings Banda's Malawi Congress party,
the sole legal party from independence in 1964 until the first multi-party
election last week, took 52 seats, mainly in central areas.
