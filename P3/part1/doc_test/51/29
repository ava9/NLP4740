  [Text] The victory of Bakili Muluzi and the United 
Democratic Front [UDF] in Malawi's elections has closed the book 
on 30 years of rule by Dr. Hastings Banda and the Malawi 
Congress Party [MCP]. In that time, Dr. Banda ruled Malawi with 
an iron grip, but he led the MCP in Tuesday's elections as their 
presidential candidate. Well now, the MCP must be holding 
postmortems to consider what went wrong for them at the polls. 
On the line to Lilongwe, Robin White spoke to Dr. Heatherwick 
Ntaba, the foreign minister of the outgoing MCP government, and 
asked him if he thought they had chosen the wrong presidential 
candidate. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntaba] No, I don't think so. That is 
completely out of the question. I don't think we had the wrong 
presidential candidate at all. 
  [White] Do you think that the truth might be that the 
electorate judged you on your record and they didn't like your 
record? 
  [Ntaba] No, I think that is speculation. I might just say at 
this point that if you look at the pattern of the results, they 
are completely regional. That is a matter of great concern to 
us. We no longer seem to have a national political movement any 
more. According to these results, the country seems to have 
fragmented into regions politically and I think we need to very 
carefully look at what happened and see how we can correct the 
trend to regionalize the country politically. This is our major 
concern, as well as being disappointed with the results at the 
moment. 
  [White] You yourself won your seat, I understand? 
  [Ntaba] I won my own seat very comfortably, yes. 
  [White] So, you will be now sitting on the opposition seat? 
  [Ntaba] Well, that is the reality. This is what the result 
of the elections mean. I have no serious reservations about 
serving this country politically or contributing to the 
political development of this country from the opposition. I 
believe the country, in the new democratic dispensation, needs a 
strong, solid, and very responsible opposition. I am ready and 
willing to serve in that capacity because that seems to be what 
the electorate wants. 
  [White] But it must be very hard to surrender power? 
  [Ntaba] As hard as naturally it can be for any human being, 
but nevertheless these are the realities of democratic 
elections, of political competition these days. It is not any 
more difficult for me to accept that than it would be for a 
politician in any other part of the world, I must assure you. 
But we, in the Malawi Congress Party, have adapted ourselves to 
the changed political climate. That is why we have had no 
problems issuing these concession statements from our leader, a 
thing which would have been completely different and has been 
different in many countries of the African continent. 
  [White] Have discussions already started with Mr. Muluzi to 
ensure that there is a smooth hand over of power? 
  [Ntaba] The UDF government or the UDF leadership have not 
yet 
approached us formally to discuss with us about the handing over 
of power and I am not sure how that is normally done. This is 
the first time we have had such an election in this country, as 
you know. I don't know who speaks to who first, but I suppose 
we all learn together on how power is handed over after a 
democratic election that has been considered free and fair by 
many observers. 
  [White] But in technical terms, are you still a minister or 
is somebody else a minister? 
  [Ntaba] I suppose you would have to say I am still a 
minister 
of foreign affairs because I have not heard an announcement from 
the president-elect yet of who his foreign minister is going to 
be. 
  [White] And when will the formal hand over take place? 
  [Ntaba] The president-elect is being sworn-in tomorrow and I 
suppose that marks the formal handing over of the power of 
government and I would assume that that would mark the formal 
handing over of the government. 
  [White] What is going to happen to President Banda? 
  [Ntaba] In what stance? He is simply not going to be 
involved in politics any more. He is not going to be involved 
in running the affairs of this country as head of state. He 
will certainly be retiring at some other place that he will 
choose and I can probably not tell you any more than that. 
  [White] Now, what about all his houses and palaces that he 
has had? Do you think he will be allowed to live in one of 
those? 
  [Ntaba] Well, he has a number of residences of his own, 
personally, which are quite suitable, quite comfortable. It is 
not a question of him being allowed to occupy one of those 
stately residences which he owns personally. 
  [White] What about the Sanjika Palace? Do you think it would 
be a good gesture of the government to allow him to stay there? 
  [Ntaba] That would indeed be a question for the 
president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, to answer and not mine. I 
would want you, I would you hope that you could put that 
question to him when you have a chance and see how he can answer 
it. 
  [White] But do you personally think that that would be a 
good 
idea? 
  [Ntaba] If I were in that position, I would certainly think 
it would be a good idea. I think a person of that caliber, a 
person who has ruled this country, politically stable for 31 
years, deserves a gesture of that nature. 
  [White] Do you have any complaints at all about the way the 
UDF, the winners, have behaved so far in victory? 
  [Ntaba] Yes, certainly. You recall that our leader conceded 
very gracefully yesterday and appealed to Malawians to behave 
like Malawians. He appealed to the winners to celebrate with 
understanding and without vengeance. We are very, very 
disappointed to see that the UDF supporters are committing acts 
of violence against the Malawi Congress Party supporters. They 
have destroyed six houses in Machinga district, in Balaka area. 
This is the president's-elect home district. They have 
destroyed six houses of the MCP supporters. In Blantyre, they 
have destroyed a house of one of the MCP lady supporters, for no 
other offense, but for being a vice district chairman for women 
in that area. We are also getting chiefs in the Lower Chire 
being harassed and being intimidated. All these acts are going 
on and we are not hearing any appeal from the president-elect to 
restrain his supporters or to have UDF supporters act in a 
restrained manner. So, we are very, very disappointed at what 
is happening from the UDF camp. [end recording]
