At least 16 people were killed when Malawian soldiers stormed into action
yesterday to disarm the country's Young Pioneers, the paramilitary wing of
the ruling Malawi Congress Party.
Troops assaulted the national headquarters and district offices of the Young
Pioneers. National offices of the Congress Party were also strafed with
gunfire, ransacked and looted by soldiers.
Thousands of civilians took to the streets of the capital, Lilongwe,
cheering the army.
They shouted: 'No more Banda, no more Tembo, no more Chakauamba' - referring
to former 'president for life' Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda and two members of a
presidential council that has shared power since Dr Banda's collapse with a
stroke in October.
The military strike against the Pioneers came after opposition politicians
had complained of a delay in disarming the paramilitary group.
A call to disarm the 2,000-strong Pioneers came two months ago from a
National Consultative Council, comprising government and opposition
representatives. The council was charged with overseeing Malawi's transition
to democracy following a referendum in June, when Malawians voted to switch
to a multi-party system of politics.
There has been long-running tension between the Pioneers, the police and the
politically neutral army. The government has pleaded the case for
integrating the Pioneers into the national security forces.
It was not immediately clear how far up the army hierarchy the order to
attack originated.
The operation began when 200 soldiers assaulted Youth House, the Pioneers'
headquarters in Lilongwe. Armed Pioneers initially returned fire but
resistance collapsed within minutes.
Two army helicopters circled low overhead, apparently in support of the
attack.
Army units then moved on to the Kamuzu Youth Institute, a training centre
for Pioneers, and to urban district offices. The institute was soon ablaze,
with civilians braving the fire to loot the premises.
Gunfire had died down in the city by late afternoon, although civilian
looting of commercial and government premises had begun. At the national
headquarters of the Malawi Congress Party, soldiers were systematically
removing anything of value.
