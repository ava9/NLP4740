  [Text] Today is just the second day of Bakili Muluzi's 
presidency, he was sworn-in on Saturday [22 May]. Putting 
together a working majority in Parliament looks like being his 
first big political test. According to the official figures 
published yesterday, his United Democratic Front [UDF] is just a 
handful of seats short of an outright majority, and it looks as 
if a coalition government is on the cards. On the line to 
Blantyre, Mary Harper asked the UDF secretary general, Harry 
Thompson, what they plan to do about it. 
  [Begin recording] [Thompson] What we are going to do now is, 
we are having a meeting today with the Aford [Alliance for 
Democracy] people, we will be listening to what they have to say 
to us, and take matters up from there. We are prepared to go 
into government even with a minority Parliament. 
  [Harper] And are you going to ask them to form an alliance 
with you in Parliament? 
  [Thompson] Well, we want to hear what it is that they want 
to 
say to us first. 
  [Harper] They must have told you already. 
  [Thompson] No, they didn't. They haven't told us. They are 
responding to an announcement made by our president when he had 
the victory speech to say that he was prepared to work with 
anybody who wants to work with us. 
  [Harper] And what about the MCP [Malawi Congress Party], 
have 
they approached you, or have you approached them? 
  [Thompson] No, they have not approached us, and I do not 
believe that we would work with them. I mean, we have been 
fighting them, and it would be foolish for us to go back and try 
and form an alliance, then we are getting back to the one party 
system again. 
  [Harper] But your relationship with Aford has hardly been 
particularly smooth. Over the past few months you have been 
fighting each other quite bitterly during the election campaign. 
  [Thompson] Yes, it was a bit of bruising and full of 
mudslinging. That is why we are rather saying, let us hear what 
Aford has to say to us. It may very well be that they will say 
that no, that was a battle, that was during the time of war, or 
[word indistinct], but now that it is over, in the interest of 
the nation, what have they got to offer us, what is it that they 
would like to talk to us about? 
  [Harper] Now, there is some concern that the UDF is 
basically 
a southern party. 
  [Thompson] I wouldn't go so far as to say it is 
southern-based. We have got some 15 or so seats in the central 
region, and I think that by the time our president announces the 
cabinet, it will be a cabinet of Malawians rather than regional 
people. 
  [Harper] Can you give any indication of who might be in this 
cabinet? 
  [Thompson] No, I cannot. I am afraid, you know, whatever I 
say would be guesswork at this stage. 
  [Harper] Are you planning to invite any opposition members 
into the cabinet? 
  [Thompson] That is the possibility, yes. 
  [Harper] And when is the president expected to announce his 
new cabinet? 
  [Thompson] The earliest will be tomorrow. [end recording]
