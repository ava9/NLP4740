  [Text] His Excellency the president, ngwazi [paramount 
chief] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, has conceded defeat in the country's 
first multiparty elections held on Tuesday. In a broadcast to 
the nation today, the president said although the results of the 
election have not been officially confirmed [words indistinct] 
every indication was that Mr. Bakili Muluzi was the clear winner 
in the contest for the Presidency of this country. He 
congratulated Mr. Muluzi and offered him his full support and 
cooperation as he takes over the presidency (?of the country). 
The ngwazi said as one of the incoming opposition parties, the 
Malawi Congress Party [MCP] will work with the United Democratic 
Party [UDP] government for building a better, democratic Malawi. 
  In his speech the president thanked all Malawians for having 
allowed him to be their leader for the past 31 years [words 
indistinct] upholding the four cornerstones of the MCP -- 
namely, unity, loyalty, experience, and (?discipline). He said 
the four cornerstones [words indistinct] for the long standing 
political stability and for the continuing social and economic 
development in this country. 
  The ngwazi also pointed out that the peaceful transition 
into 
multiparty democracy the country has undergone since last year 
has won Malawians respect. At this point, the president advised 
that despite the vigorous campaign during which many unkind 
things were told at [words indistinct] the political parties in 
this country should remain friends and not enemies. He urged 
all Malawians to bury their political differences and to work 
together for a united and prosperous new Malawi. The ngwazi 
then appealed to MCP supporters and those of other losing 
parties to accept their defeat honorably and [words indistinct] 
and advised members of the victorious United Democratic Party, 
UDF, to celebrate their victory with [words indistinct] and 
understanding and not with (?vengeance).
