  [Text] [Words indistinct] the Malawi Young Pioneers has 
been disarmed and disgraced, then President Banda himself has 
been proposing their rehabilitation. Opening parliament 
yesterday, he said the act that set them up would be repealed, 
but also suggested that the Young Pioneers who had fled the 
country should be recalled, and their misdeeds of the past 
forgiven and forgotten. He has even suggested that old civil 
servants could be retired and their jobs be given to the Young 
Pioneers. The disbandment of the Young Pioneers was, of course, 
one of the (?crying) demands of the opposition. Aleki Banda, 
first vice president of the opposition United Democratic Front, 
UDF, was himself instrumental years ago in setting up the Young 
Pioneers. On the line, Josephine Hazeley asked him if he was 
happy with the president's decision to repeal the Young Pioneers 
Act. 
  [Begin recording] [Banda] Not quite. You see, the issue of 
the Young Pioneers is a very important issue here. In the 
National Consultative Council what we have insisted on [words 
indistinct] is that first we want a full report of what has been 
done to delink the Malawi Young Pioneers from the MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party]. Secondly, a full report on the disarmament. 
Now, we have not received any report up to now. Therefore, we 
are not satisfied with any statements that are made unilaterally 
by the MCP and the Malawi Government. 
  [Hazeley] But surely, making them illegally, repealing the 
Young Pioneers Act is a step in the right direction, you must 
admit. 
  [Banda] Well, that is certainly a step in the right 
direction, except that, of course, he goes on to say what is 
going to be done about them, and various other matters. Now, 
all these are matters which we are deeply interested in. They 
have not involved us in the formulation of any of the policies 
which he has announced. 
  [Hazeley] The president has said he would like for everybody 
to embrace the Young Pioneers because after all they are your 
children. 
  [Banda] Well, we agree with that. We do agree that they are 
our children, they're our nephews and nieces. We ourselves have 
said that we have no desire to victimize them, except of course 
for those who may have committed crimes for which, of course, 
each individual would answer for. But we would still like to be 
involved in the formulation of policy regarding the future usage 
of these useful resources that we have. 
  [Hazeley] So, you don't find it distasteful to incorporate 
the Young Pioneers into the civil service? 
  [Banda] Well, probably as a general principle no. But it 
can't just be a wholesale incorporation of the Young Pioneers. 
We have to look at the numbers, at the various individuals to 
work out the most appropriate way of solving this problem. 
  [Hazeley] Now, the president has also suggested that as a 
matter of reconciliation, he would like to propose that those 
who are old members of the Young Pioneers should be retired and 
given full, terminal benefits. 
  [Banda] Well, as I say we are prepared to look at all those 
proposals, including retirement of those who are old, but we 
insist -- certainly on behalf of the UDF -- we would insist that 
we should be involved in all these decisions. We should discuss 
them. 
  [Hazeley] Aren't you just simply making a mountain out of a 
molehill as far as the Young Pioneers are concerned. The 
president has [words indistinct] with concrete ideas as to the 
future of these people, and you in the opposition haven't. 
  [Banda] Well, we are certainly not making a mountain out of 
a 
molehill because the Young Pioneers issue is a very sensitive 
transitional issue. The Young Pioneers did many things during 
the referendum process which were unacceptable. Now, this is a 
very important issue which really requires full consultation 
among all interested parties in this country in order to solve 
this problem in the best interests of Malawi. 
  [Hazeley] Some people say you, Aleki Banda, ought to be 
[words indistinct] because after all you had set these people up 
in the first place, the Young Pioneers. 
  [Banda] Oh, definitely. Well, I really understand I was the 
first commander of the Young Pioneers, and was commander for 10 
years. During the 10 years of my commandership, the main 
emphasis for the Young Pioneers was in development. The basic 
principles for which they were formed is still valid up to now, 
except that in later years the Malawi Congress Party misused 
them, or rather abused the movement in order to further their 
ends. [end recording]
