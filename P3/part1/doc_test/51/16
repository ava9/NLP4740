Congress party could extend its 30-year rule in elections on Tuesday

A recent electoral pact has consolidated the United Democratic Front's
position as opposition front-runner in Malawi's elections next Tuesday in a
campaign dominated by personalities rather than issues.
Although it is not the analysts' favourite, President Hastings Banda's
Malawi Congress party may yet extend its 30-year rule into the new,
democratic era by exploiting remaining opposition divisions.
Small parties, none of which has a distinctive political identity, have
withdrawn their presidential candidates in favour of the UDF's Mr Bakili
Muluzi.
Withdrawals have also been agreed in most constituencies where the small
parties were fielding candidates for the 177-seat parliament.
The UDF is expected to win most of the 76 seats in the populous southern
region. The central region, traditional heartland of the MCP, has 68 seats.
In the north, there are only 33 seats, and these are likely to be swept up
by the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), led by trade unionist Chakufwa
Chihana.
Campaigning has come up with little to persuade people to vote on other than
regional or ethnic lines. Mr Muluzi accepts that the three contenders are
'very close' on social and economic policy. He emphasises 'managed'
liberalisation, with some protection for national industries; whereas Mr
Chihana emphasises 'cushioning the impact on the poor' of structural
adjustment.
But both men favour export-led growth within a liberalised economy, which is
precisely the policy direction the MCP is already following, under pressure
from foreign donors.
Debate has therefore centred on qualifications for government. Mr Chihana,
who was thrice imprisoned by Dr Banda's government and who is closely
identified with the early campaign for democracy, describes the election as
'a contest between morality and the forces of darkness'.
His close aide and author of the Aford manifesto, Mr Mapopa Chipeta,
reflects that 'Banda used to boast at rallies that he had killed his
opponents. And people cheered, they thought it was normal. They laughed at
us when we said you can't do that. But now Malawi has changed.'
Pinning its hopes on a moral crusade, Aford has launched a vitriolic attack
on the character of Mr Muluzi. As an MCP government minister and secretary
general of the party in the 1970s, he is easy to denounce as a 'recycled'
politician, although he responds that he tried to work for change within the
system, enduring considerable personal risk as a result.
More damagingly, Aford has claimed that Mr Muluzi was convicted of petty
theft in 1968, and subsequently embezzled money from the MCP while in their
employ. Mr Muluzi has not denied the allegations, made in an Aford newspaper
which quoted court records and MCP memorandums. Although campaigning
vigorously on the hustings, he has become shy of the local press and
declined challenges to radio debates with other candidates. There have also
been ill-concealed attempts by other members of the UDF executive to unseat
him.
Aford's blow of moral superiority has been considerably undermined by
suggestions that, as a Moslem, Mr Muluzi would 'Islamicise' Malawi. His
status as a strictly secular politician is not in doubt.
Aford strategists believe that the anti-Muluzi campaign may win Mr Chihana
the presidency even if the UDF wins most parliamentary seats. But doubts
about Mr Muluzi are likely to favour the ruling party more than Aford.
Last June's referendum produced a 37 per cent pro-government vote: not
enough to keep the one-party state in place, but a solid support base on
which to build. Some believe that the vote then was influenced by MCP
intimidation, and that support has since crumbled.
Infused with new blood recruited from the opposition, the MCP has been
arguing that those responsible for past abuses have left - mostly to join
the UDF, whose leadership is dominated by MCP 'refugees'.
The argument does not address the popular belief that power has long lain
with the de facto prime minister John Tembo, uncle of President Banda's
consort 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira. Nor are the party's prospects improved by
the fact that Dr Banda is too elderly and frail to make more than rare and
brief public appearances.
But he has appeared often enough to endorse his running mate, Gwanda
Chakuamba, who served 13 years in jail for sedition, as apparent successor.
Dr Banda is not hated in Malawi. Most people blame his abuses on 'bad
advice'.
