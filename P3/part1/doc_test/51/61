  [Text] The veteran president of Malawi, Hastings Banda, has 
made a rare public appearance, attending a church service in the 
city of Blantyre. Dr. Banda went to a Roman Catholic church to 
commemorate those killed during the campaign for independence 
from Britain. Dr. Banda, who is officially in his late 80s, but 
widely believed to be much older, underwent brain surgery in 
South Africa last year. He returned home in October and was 
last seen in public on 1 January. Dr. Banda has ruled Malawi 
for some 30 years and he is a candidate in the country's first 
multiparty elections due to be held in May.
