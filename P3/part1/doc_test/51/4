Malawi's autocratic president Hastings Kamuzu Banda conceded victory
yesterday to opposition leader Bakili Muluzi after ruling the small central
African nation for more than 30 years.
In a halting voice, Dr Banda congratulated Mr Muluzi, a 51-year-old
businessman and leader of the opposition United Democratic Front, over state
radio for winning the country's first multi-party elections since
independence from Britain in 1964.
Tens of thousands of singing, chanting Malawians poured into the streets of
the commercial capital Blantyre in festive celebration, many waving the
yellow flag of the UDF.
Mr Muluzi, will seek to form a coalition government with Chakufwa Chihana's
Alliance for Democracy (Aford), if, as seems likely, he fails to secure an
overall majority in the 177 seat assembly.
Mr Maluzi said yesterday he was concerned about the north-south polarisation
demonstrated by the poll where most of the electorate voted along regional
lines.
'I don't want to be president of a divided country,' he said, adding that he
would rather work with Aford than lead a minority government or approach
President Banda's Malawi Congress Party.
Publication of final results was delayed by logistical problems in the count
and by allegations of rigging in three Shire Valley constituencies.
In the parliamentary ballot, Aford has taken all 33 seats in the northern
region, mostly by huge majorities. The MCP vote held up well in rural areas
of the centre, but urban areas fell to the UDF, which swept most seats in
its southern base.
With counting nearing completion a spokesman for the Electoral Commission
said that 'unofficial figures' give Mr Muluzi's party 85 seats against 57
for the MCP and 35 for Aford.
The danger of the north becoming futher isolated may encourage Mr Muluzi to
offer Mr Chihana the vice presidency. This is in Mr Muluzi's gift, since he
did not name a running mate, apparently trying to avoid conflict between
various contenders within his own camp. But Mr Chihana stated before the
election he would not accept a UDF cabinet post because the party leadership
was tainted by former association with the MCP.
