  [Text] Talks on forming a coalition government in Malawi 
after the country's first democratic elections have collapsed. 
  The talks were held between the victorious Democratic Front, 
or UDF, of President Bakili Muluzi and the Alliance for 
Democracy, or Aford, led by Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Interviewed 
in Blantyre, Aford's second president, Mr. Peter (Kaleso), said 
the UDF had failed to meet his party's demands. Mr. (Kaleso) 
said Aford had demanded that Mr. Chihana be appointed second 
vice president and, in addition, be in charge of either the 
foreign or home affairs ministries. Furthermore, Aford wanted 
seven ministerial portfolios including Justice, Works and 
Supplies, and Agriculture. 
  Aford, which won all 33 parliamentary seats in Malawi's 
northern region during last week's general elections, sought a 
coalition with UDF which won 84 of the 177 seats in Parliament. 
The Malawi Congress Party of defeated President Kamuzu Banda 
won 55 seats, but the UDF said it would not form a coalition 
with it.
