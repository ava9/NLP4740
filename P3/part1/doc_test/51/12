DR Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Malawi's elderly life-president, has been flown to
South Africa for medical treatment, it was learnt last night, prompting
opposition parties to prepare to help fill a possible power vacuum.
Full details of the president's condition have been withheld from the
public. Malawians have been told only that Dr Banda, thought to have
suffered a heart attack last Thursday, had been confined to bed.
However, Mr John Tembo, a senior minister long tipped as Dr Banda's
successor, confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times that the
president was in South Africa: 'I do not know what is wrong but I hear he is
doing better down there'.
President Banda's exact age is not certain, but he is thought to be in his
mid-90s. He failed to attend the annual convention of the ruling Malawi
Congress Party (MCP), in the capital Lilongwe, yesterday. His opening
address, which advocated close working relations with opposition parties in
the transition to democracy now under way, was read by a minister.
This is the first time in Dr Bandas 29-year presidency that he has been
officially acknowledged to be in ill health.
Opposition parties, believing a power vacuum is about to arise, are anxious
about the consequences Dr Banda's death might have for the democratic
process which has gone smoothly since last June, when a decisive majority of
Malawians voted in favour of political pluralism and an end to the country's
one-party system.
A National Consultative Committee, on which opposition representatives hold
a majority, has been drawing up a new electoral law and a timetable for
elections. It has been expected that their recommendations would be endorsed
by the ruling Malawi Congress Party in parliament in October.
The two chief opposition groups are Mr Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for
Democracy (Aford), associated with the north of the country, and Mr Bakili
Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), associated with the south.
Aford officials say they would prefer the Congress Party to appoint an
interim president, if necessary, until a general election.
The UDF is likely to press for an election earlier than the proposed May
1994 date.
Mr Muluzi last night called for 'all the parties to play a role in selecting
a caretaker president, if necessary'.
