<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi </F>
Mtewa) by Dan Issacs on 18 May, place not given; from the 
"Network Africa" program--recorded] 
  [Text] As predicted, the other main opposition grouping, 
Aford [Alliance for Democracy], headed by Chakufwa Chihana, has 
gained solid support in the north of the country, but that is 
seemingly not enough to seriously challenge the current front 
runner, the UDF [United Democratic Front]. On the line to 
Malawi, I asked Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi Mtewa) whether 
he was disappointed with the results so far. 
  [(Mtewa)] No, we are satisfied with the results, as expected 
in the north. We did expect on the basis of our strategy to 
make sure that the north was an absolute Aford stronghold. We 
did expect a favorable comfortable seat in the center region. 
Now, there was, as a result of the pick-ups we have made, that 
you can says does fall short of our expectations in the center. 
We had a high estimation of seats in the south, in those places 
where we did do quite a successful campaign, but our margins of 
gain in those were comfortable, but not strong enough to cause 
an upset of the UDF [words indistinct]. 
  [Isaacs] Do you regret the fact that the opposition in 
Malawi 
is divided along these regional lines, where obviously you could 
have presented a more of a united front and come out ahead very 
more on top than you have done? 
  [(Mtewa)] It is pure coincidental that the parties do follow 
the original homes of the current leaders. My president, 
Chakufwa Chihana, from [word indistinct] and therefore the 
north, Bakili Muluzi is birth place Machinga in the South, and 
Kamuzu Banda's location in the Center, Kasungu. Pure 
coincidental. 
  [Isaacs] Now, having actually broken away from the UDF to 
fight the election, would you now, in light of what has happened 
in the results, would you consider joining up forces again, in 
some kind of a coalition, if you were asked? 
  [(Mtewa)] First, the assumption probably would be that at 
least we were united at one time. Historically, we were united 
in the fight, of course, for the multiparty referendum. You are 
correct, but since the referendum last year, June, of course, 
the need was for the singular parties to have a separate 
identity and to fight the elections and [words indistinct] as a 
party plurality of the organizations quite independent of each 
other. That has happened and the result of this election is to 
maintain that plurality and we have advanced the view that, of 
course, cooperation in other means and other measures of 
national policy are all right. 
  Now, in the interest of forming a government of national 
unity as the result of the elections probably do foretell, that 
is something that we, as Aford, would be interested in 
considering and sitting down, of course, with any one of the 
parties to define [words indistinct] and to be able to say that 
whatever is the outcome [words indistinct] advance the agenda 
for democracy, as people in this country did fight for.
