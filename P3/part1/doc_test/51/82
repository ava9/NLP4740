<F P=106> [Speech by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda on 9 May; place </F>
not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Bwanas and donas [ladies and gentlemen], good 
evening. Tonight I am speaking to you [word indistinct] joy and 
indeed with a sense of satisfaction for what we have 
accomplished in this country so far. I say this for a number of 
reasons. Next week, on Tuesday, that is on May the 17th, we 
shall be holding our general elections where Malawians will be 
exercising their democratic rights to elect those that will 
govern this country for the next five years. 
  Malawians will vote freely for the presidential and 
parliamentary candidates of their choice. I therefore wish to 
appeal to all registered voters to come in their large numbers 
on 17 May to cast their votes. They should not feel intimidated 
by anyone for any reason whatsoever. I want to assure every 
Malawian that the police and the Army will be vigilant on that 
day to ensure that no one disrupts the elections. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is understandable that as 17 May gets closer, passions in 
the political debates and in public meetings tend to get 
intensified. The political tensions that can result if such 
passions are not properly checked or handled can be most 
unfortunate, most unfortunate. As a people, who have been 
united, for all these years and have enjoyed peace and calm for 
31 continuous years, it would be most unfortunate if we allowed 
our [word indistinct] political differences to disturb our 
long-standing political stability. It is important that we 
remain united, peaceful, and calm. 
  We must always remember that despite our political 
differences we are all Malawians. We have lived together very 
peacefully for a long time, despite our tribal and cultural 
differences. There is, therefore, nothing to stop us from 
cohabiting happily as members of different political parties. 
We should behave like members of the same family who will 
always maintain family unity during difficult times, no matter 
how intense their differences or rivalry may be. As we approach 
the election day next week, the eyes of the world are focused on 
us. They are working to see if we can maintain our national 
peace and hold on to our long-standing political stability as we 
go through this period of vigorous political campaign and 
elections. I therefore appeal to all Malawians to behave like 
ladies and gentlemen during these elections as we have always 
done in equally sensitive situations in the past. We have 
already gone through the transition period so far in a peaceful 
and most commendable manner. Of course there have been some 
disturbances here and there, but these have been of a minor 
nature and to some extent have been understandable. [passage 
omitted] 
  The outside observers have commended us for the manner in 
which we have managed our transitions. [passage omitted] In some 
countries in our continent the tendencies of losing political 
parties have been to refuse to accept their defeat at the polls. 
Losing parties have challenged the results of free and fair 
elections. I think this was most unfortunate. I want all 
political leaders in this country to understand that contrary to 
the wishes of all of us, some political parties will (?instead) 
lose on 17 May. This is the nature of political competition in 
democracy. Political parties must, therefore, be realistic and 
accept their defeat gracefully, and the winning parties 
(?should) celebrate their victory with sympathy, understanding, 
and a high degree of political tolerance. [passage omitted] 
  I want them [international observers] to know that my 
government is committed and determined to have free and fair 
elections in this country. I hope that the external and 
internal observers intend to be objective and unbiased in their 
observations and reports on political events in this country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Similarly, I wish to acknowledge the presence of both the 
local and external press among us. We are indeed happy that we 
now have a free press in this country. We are glad that our 
young local pressmen and women are cooperating with their 
experienced colleagues from outside. During this critical 
period, it is my hope that the media will inform (?first) 
Malawians and the international public truthfully so that people 
are able to have unbiased opinions on the political process in 
this country. 
  Let me now end by thanking the various friendly governments, 
countries and international organizations who have helped us 
financially and materially with the smooth running of the 
transition and the coming elections themselves, by sponsoring 
seminars and workshops organized either by the government, the 
national consultative council, the electoral commission or other 
related committees. [passage omitted].
