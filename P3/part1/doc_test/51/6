  [Text] Blantyre May 21 Sapa -- Fifty-one-year-old 
newly-elected Malawian President Bakili Muluzi was given a 
standing ovation on Saturday when he announced a general amnesty 
for all political prisoners, and commuted to life imprisonment 
the death sentences of ordinary prisoners. Mr Muluzi made the 
announcement in his first speech to the nation shortly after his 
presidential inauguration. The inauguration followed the 
country's first multiparty election, which stripped one of 
Africa's longest serving autocrats, Dr Kamuzu Banda, of power. 
  A crowd of 60,000 supporters packed the Kamuzu stadium to 
hear Mr Muluzi and to witness the birth of the new Malawi. They 
chanted: "Scenes have changed in Malawi." 
  The amnesty and life imprisonment sentences will take 
immediate effect. 
  Along with these measures President Muluzi also ordered 
immediate closure of the country's three notorious political 
detention camps. Amid wild applause from the crowd he said these 
camps were closely associated with the "shameful" violation of 
human rights under the rule of Dr Banda's Malawi Congress Party. 
  The president also invited all international human rights 
organisations to Malawi, saying: "They are free to visit this 
country and inspect our prisons as they wish." 
  Mr Muluzi said the 300 million kwacha State House built by 
Dr 
Banda in Lilongwe should be turned into a parliamentary chamber. 
  He said Malawi could not afford the luxury of having state 
residences in each of the country's 24 districts. A committee 
would be set up to work towards disposing of all the unwanted 
state residences. 
  Mr Muluzi said the day was a special and memorable occasion 
which would be cherished forever as the moment that ushered real 
change into Malawi. "We have earned our freedom from the 
autocratic ruler who oppressed us and pounced on our rights 
ruthlessly." 
  He pledged to uphold the principle of genuine democracy and 
to work for the betterment of all the people irrespective of 
their tribal, political, or ethnic differences. 
  It is expected Mr Muluzi, whose party won 84 of the 177 
parliamentary seats, will now need to form a coalition 
government with the Alliance for Democracy, headed by Mr 
Chakufwa Chihana, 55. He has already chosen former civil servant 
Justin Malewezi, who was booted out as secretary to the 
president and cabinet during Dr Banda's regime, as 
vice-president. The choice apparently dashed the expectations of 
many Malawians, who hoped this position would go to Mr Chihana 
in a bid to bring about national unity. 
  Results of the general election have clearly shown that 
Malawi is a divided nation, desperately in need of someone who 
can unite it.
