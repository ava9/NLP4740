  [Text] Fears of a guerrilla war waged by young supporters 
of ousted Malawian President Kamuzu Banda have resurfaced in 
Malawi following this week's inauguration of President Bakili 
Muluzi. 
  Although Dr. Banda was toppled in last week's elections, the 
election results also showed that Dr. Banda and his Malawi 
Congress Party [MCP] are still a powerful force in the country. 
With five seats still undeclared, the MCP has won 52 seats and 
will be the second-largest party in Parliament after Mr. 
Muluzi's United Democratic Front, which captured 84 seats. Dr. 
Banda also came second in the race for president. Fuelling the 
fears of guerrilla war are reports that at least 2,000 armed 
members of the MCP youth wing, the Young Pioneers, are in hiding 
in Mozambique. President Muluzi, who once commanded the Young 
Pioneers when he was an aid to Dr. Banda, said last week he was 
very concerned about these armed young men hiding in Mozambique 
and that he expected that they would be a source of violence. 
  He said his government would seek their immediate return 
home 
by appealing to Mozambique's government and the Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] movement, whose camps the 
pioneers are alleged to be using as a repayment for Dr. Banda's 
staunch support for Renamo in the 1980's.
