Kendall Gill scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds Saturday as fourth-ranked 
Illinois defeated No. 15 Memphis State, 83-71, in the championship of the Old 
Style tournament at Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Gill's defense that kept Illinois (10-0) undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Gill, a 6-foot-6 senior, was instrumental in holding Memphis State's Elliot 
Perry to 17 points in a matchup of two of the country's best guards. Perry had 
scored 33 in Memphis State's overtime victory over Ball State Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Perry hurt us that much," Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "We 
did as good a job on Perry as you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said he wanted to keep Perry on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to not let him drive too much," said Gill, who was voted the 
tournament MVP. "He's a good ballplayer. . . . I think he hurt himself a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State Coach Larry Finch said Perry was fatigued after playing 43 
minutes in the first-round game late Friday night. Perry, a junior, had to 
leave the game with a leg cramp for 2 1/2 minutes in the second half as the 
Tigers were trying to rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little tired . . . but that is no excuse for not playing up to our 
ability," Perry said. "No matter how tired you are, you still have to go out 
and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Liberty scored 25 points and Illinois held a 44-33 rebounding edge as 
6-foot-7 center-forward Ervin Small had 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gill scored 16 points in the first half and Liberty added 12 as Illinois took 
control early. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State's only lead came at the start on Todd Mundt's two free throws. 
Illinois scored the next nine points before Memphis State closed to 18-13. The 
Illini then went on a 14-5 run over the next six minutes.
