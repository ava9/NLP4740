USC EAGER TO BOUNCE BACK AGAINST CARDINAL

<P>
Finally, a game. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of soothing their wounds, defending their conduct and reassessing 
their season, after seven days of charges and countercharges concerning their 
bitter defeat at Notre Dame and the brawl that preceded it, the USC Trojans get 
a chance to take their frustrations out to the field when they return to the 
Coliseum today to play Stanford at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the Cardinal needs. Deep into its own season of frustration, Stanford 
finds itself facing a team that figures to be chomping at the bit and looking 
for revenge after a painful knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
This was a season that began with high hopes for Stanford, before the roof 
caved in. 
</P>
<P>
Figuratively and literally. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stanford was coming off a 3-6-2 season, the hiring of Dennis Green, 
former San Francisco 49er assistant, as coach created excitement and optimism 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the losses, both on the field and on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Among the injured are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back Jon Volpe. All-Pac-10 last season, he remains out with a 
sprained ankle, suffered in Stanford's second game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anticipated starter Charlie Young, another running back. He suffered a knee 
injury in spring practice and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halfback J.J. Lasley. Having sprained a knee a month ago, he may play 
today, but won't start. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Rob Hinckley. Bothered by a lower back problem, he has been at 
full strength in only one game. He's questionable today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Brian Johnson. Suffering from shoulder and knee injuries, he 
did not make the trip. Although redshirt freshman Steve Smith has started six 
games for Stanford, Johnson was the starter in the Cardinal's only victory, an 
18-17 win over Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offensive lineman Chris Dalman. He suffered a season-ending neck injury 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free safety Tony Trousett. He started the first five games before going 
down with a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensive tackle Lester Archambeau. He will be playing today on a bad knee. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles in the training room were followed by troubles on the field. 
Stanford has lost three of four conference games, six of seven overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in five football games that have come down to the last series of 
the game," Green said. "When you play 60 minutes, there's about two or three 
minutes where one team or the other has the opportunity to take charge. That's 
what we haven't done and that's been the most significant thing that has hurt 
us. A lot of that is experience, a lot of it is learning and a lot of it is 
developing a certain leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich has compensated for his lack of seasoning with talent, 
surprising maturity and a balanced attack to lead USC to five wins in seven 
games, a 3-0 record in conference play and to the brink of victory over 
top-ranked Notre Dame last week in South Bend, Ind. He has come up lacking on 
occasion, as he did last week where three key passes were intercepted, but he 
has never lacked for confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure? If Marinovich feels it, he's a good actor. How many other freshmen 
would deliberately bump an opposing lineman on the defending national 
championship team in defiance after throwing a touchdown pass as Marinovich did 
last week in South Bend? 
</P>
<P>
Smith hasn't exactly been shy with a ball in his hands, either. He has 
completed 56.4% of his passes for 1,214 yards and seven touchdowns in 
Stanford's pass-oriented attack, but he has also thrown nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve has made a significant amount of improvement," Green said. "He 
suffers from two things. No. 1 is our inability to have a halfback attack. That 
could take a lot of pressure off. The other thing is, we haven't been throwing 
the ball very much to our halfbacks. That's put more pressure on our split end, 
Ed McCaffrey, and I think Steve has forced the ball a little too much. But I 
think he definitely has a big-time arm." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Irish. Against Notre Dame several weeks ago, Smith threw 68 
passes, a conference record, completing 39. 
</P>
<P>
In USC, Smith will be facing a defense that led the nation against the rush 
until facing Tony Rice and his friends in South Bend. Although their yardage 
allowed per game jumped from 36.7 to 69.4 after the Notre Dame game, the 
Trojans are still third in the nation and best in the conference against the 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
Among those trying to keep USC off Smith's back will be freshman offensive 
lineman Bob Whitfield from Banning High School. The 6-foot-7, 300-pounder has 
started all seven games and made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a whale of a football player," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "He'll be an 
All-American, I'll tell you right now. He's big and fast and strong and he does 
not get beat." 
</P>
<P>
First the injuries for Stanford, then the losses. And then, the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the Bay Area quake left 15 players, living in a dorm, homeless. 
They have since found housing. 
</P>
<P>
So has Green, who has been forced to spend several days a week in the Stanford 
area because of damage to the highway that he normally takes to reach his Santa 
Cruz home, a home that also suffered some damage. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the record: The letter of apology, promised by Notre Dame officials after 
last week's pregame brawl, has yet to arrive at USC. . . . Today's homecoming 
game is expected to draw a crowd of about 74,000. . . . Trojan running back 
Aaron Emanuel, recovering from a shoulder separation, will be available if 
needed. "The doctors say he could really use another week off," said Coach 
Larry Smith. . . . Tailback Scott Lockwood, out since opening night with a 
dislocated thumb, is not expected to play.
