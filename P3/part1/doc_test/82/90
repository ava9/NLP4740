On the Right Track: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jason Miller, who was 
arrested in October for being disorderly on board a plane flight, says he's 
getting back on track by completing an alcohol rehabilitation program. Miller 
issued a statement in connection with being fined last week after he and a 
companion pleaded guilty to public intoxication and disorderly conduct.

The charges against Miller resulted from an Oct. 22 incident when he was flying 
from South Bend, Ind., to his home in Scranton after attending the Miami-Notre 
Dame football game. Miller, 51, said both men are sorry. "This incident made me 
realize that I had a problem and I have taken steps to get back on the right 
track," Miller said. He is scheduled to begin rehearsals Jan. 2 for a Los 
Angeles production of "Inherit the Wind," in which he will play Clarence 
Darrow. CLAUDIA PUIG
