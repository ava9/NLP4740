</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Stonebreaker, a junior All-American linebacker for national champion 
Notre Dame, was injured early Saturday when his car struck a utility pole near 
the South Bend, Ind., campus. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula M. Garzia, of Foxboro, Mass., a passenger in the car, was listed in 
serious condition with internal injuries at Memorial Hospital. She is a student 
at St. Mary's, a women's college located near Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker, who underwent surgery for a broken right kneecap and was treated 
for a dislocated right hip, is listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Larry Miller of the Roseland Police Department said tests showed 
Stonebreaker had a blood-alcohol level of .157% immediately after the accident. 
In Indiana, the legal level for intoxication is .10%. No charges have been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
A Notre Dame spokesman said the couple attended a campus dance Friday night, 
and Stonebreaker told university officials they stopped at a restaurant just 
before the 2:30 a.m. accident.
