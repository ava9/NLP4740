No. 16 Louisiana State missed the front end of 10 consecutive one-and-one 
free-throw opportunities, and Georgia made the free throws it needed to beat 
the Tigers, 94-92, in overtime Wednesday in a Southeastern Conference game at 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Although LSU's Chris Jackson scored 45 points, he couldn't offset the Tigers' 
(12-4, 4-3 in conference play) poor free-throw shooting in the last seven 
minutes of regulation and first three minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that free-throw shooting was our Achilles' heel," LSU Coach Dale Brown 
said. "And last year, we were the best free-throw shooting team in the league 
and No. 4 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they should get their tails out there a little early and practice 
shooting free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson missed a 48-foot shot at the end of regulation and two three-point 
attempts with 20 seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (11-5, 4-3) sent the game into overtime tied at 79-79 when Rod Cole 
made three free throws with four seconds left. Cole was fouled on a three-point 
attempt that missed and, under Southeastern Conference rules, was awarded three 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs got 27 points from Alec Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Duke 85, North Carolina State 82 -- Phil Henderson scored 25 points and 
the victorious Blue Devils made their first three shots in overtime in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner of Duke (15-3, 5-1), scored on a tip-in with 17 seconds left 
in regulation to tie it, 74-74. N.C. State (13-5, 2-3), which rallied from an 
11-point deficit in the second half, never led in overtime. The Wolfpack was 
led by Rodney Monroe, who hit only six of 26 attempts but scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Oklahoma 107, Iowa State 96 -- Damon Patterson and Skeeter Henry sparked 
a late 10-3 run at Norman, Okla., that helped the Sooners (13-2, 2-1) win a Big 
Eight Conference game over the Cyclones (6-9, 1-2). 
</P>

Michigan State 75, No. 12 Indiana 57 -- Kirk Manns scored 25 points and the

overall and 134-25 in Big Ten play.

The Spartans (15-3, 4-1) used a 29-11 spurt in the first half to take a 35-27 
lead at halftime. Indiana is 13-3, 3-3.

Auburn 74, Kentucky 70 -- Derrick Dennison scored 27 points, including two on

Auburn (6-11, 3-4) tied the score, 70-70, on two free throws by Chris Brandt

The Gators (6-8, 2-5), playing without suspended 7-foot-2 center Dwayne 
Schintzius, lost their third consecutive game.

his return to the team, but DeVoe has not announced whether Schintzius has been 
reinstated. 
</P>
