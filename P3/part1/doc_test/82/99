About 5,000 people who were forced to flee a fast-moving forest fire near here 
began returning to their homes Monday as the danger subsided, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Awbrey Mountain fire, six miles southwest of Bend, a town of about 17,000 
people, destroyed 28 homes, and burned across 3,300 acres of forest, grass and 
brush, said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Jim Unterwegner.

<P>
The blaze was contained but still smoldered about a mile from the homes, 
Unterwegner said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 firefighters were expected to surround the fire with a 
containment line by tonight, he said. At least five other fires are burning in 
central and southern Oregon. The largest of them, the 1,300-acre Newberry 
Crater fire about 90 miles south of Bend, forced dozens of vacationers to flee 
area parks and resorts.
