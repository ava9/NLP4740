Neither his team nor the quarterback out of El Toro played very well in their 
trouncing by Arizona at Tucson. He was intercepted twice and his 11 completions 
(in 22 attempts) gained only 135 yards, his lowest output of the season. He 
also, for the first time this season, failed to throw a touchdown pass.

The Capistrano Valley High product will be thrown into a pressure-packed 
situation Saturday when the Trojans travel to South Bend for a meeting with 
unbeaten, top-ranked Notre Dame. He goes into that game off a fine performance 
against Cal-16 completions in 26 attempts for 206 yards-in which he threw for 
one touchdown and ran for another.
