The USC-Notre Dame series, which resumes Saturday night at the Coliseum, has 
been dominated in recent years by Notre Dame, which hasn't lost to the Trojans 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great seven years if you're a Notre Dame fan," Irish nose tackle 
Chris Zorich told Frank Welch of the San Gabriel Valley Tribune after last 
year's 28-24 victory at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of streak where the other team thinks it's jinxed. We've had 
some lucky breaks, but don't the great teams get most of the breaks, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun because our beating them has become an annual thing." 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in USC's 45-42 victory over UCLA was a third-quarter field 
goal by Quin Rodriguez, which provided the margin of victory and enabled 
Rodriguez to set a school record with the 52nd field goal of his Trojan career.
