Those faint fright tremors jolting most major-college football offices about 
the country just now are similar to what hits particular corporate board rooms 
each time IBM gets inspirational. Notre Dame (Gulp!) is back. Even more 
unsettling, Coach Lou Holtz is worried. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz is a witty man. After a loss at Arkansas once, he opened his television 
show by saying: "Welcome to the Lou Holtz Show. Unfortunately, I'm Lou Holtz." 
A golfer, the closest he says he has ever come to a hole in one is bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the most laughter Holtz generated during a press conference the morning 
Notre Dame officially became national champion was for saying: "I'll be shocked 
if we have a good year (next season)." 
</P>
<P>
When the chuckles stopped, Holtz quickly apologized. He knew us sainted scribes 
could be fooled about a lot of things; he'd done a fair amount of the 
slickering himself during this 12-0 season and before drubbing West Virginia in 
the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The sly coach said he understood how paid skeptics could recoil at such 
apparent folly, that he would be startled if the gifted and experienced Irish 
did much more next season than get each cleat on the proper foot. 
</P>
<P>
He'd have laughed, too, Holtz admitted. Then he asked his frequent foils to 
understand his position, which he never bothered to explain because he already 
had done that a half-hour earlier. Indirectly. By quoting a high-school coach. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had talked about recruiting a player for Notre Dame. During a visit with 
the prospect's coach, Holtz asked why he had enjoyed such uninterrupted 
success. That nationally obscure high-school coach said: "We don't get bored 
watching us run the same play over and over." 
</P>
<P>
Boredom is the crabgrass of careers -- and Holtz knows it. That's why he rails 
at his players, pushes his staff and himself so hard. He also says: "If we're 
No. 1, I don't care who's No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
To stay on top, Holtz has got to remain infatuated over the possibilities with 
a football, even though all you can really do is throw it, catch it, run it, 
keep from dropping it and make sure the other guys don't spike it in the end 
zone too often. 
</P>
<P>
With regards to that last thing, Holtz wants a kinder, gentler Notre Dame 
defense than the one nailed for so much unsportsmanlike conduct during the 
34-21 rout of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The coach even got a penalty, for dashing onto the field in the final minutes, 
with victory well in hand. He was not grasping for Irish necks, only for the 
source of that rare lack of Irish poise. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said his players were angry over being held, and frustrated that the 
officials seemed so inattentive. The coach said his players were wrong, but not 
cheap-shotters. Except for once, when a West Virginia player caught a touchdown 
pass and the Notre Dame defender tried to shove him into Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise you this," Holtz said. "You won't see that again." 
</P>
<P>
To keep the supply line of pure hearts, massive bodies, swift feet and keen 
minds moving toward South Bend, Ind., Holts must remember to forget a popular 
notion: Notre Dame doesn't recruit so much as it crooks a finger. 
</P>
<P>
If Holtz wants to claim a national title on the field somewhere down the line, 
he must be a winner in the right living rooms these next several weeks. Every 
mother's meal must be a classic; no father's botched effort at humor can bring 
anything but merriment from a master storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz stays lean, he jokes, so he'll be easier to carry off the field. 
Actually, he admits, the reason for all those pre-game milkshakes is a problem 
with low blood sugar. Whatever, he looks hungry and talks as though near 
starvation about next season. 
</P>
<P>
"In everything we do," he said, "we've got to raise it a notch." With that in 
mind, Holtz phoned prospects not long after the victory that kept Notre Dame 
atop the polls; he met with quarterback Tony Rice early the next morning and 
used a sermon he also will preach often to others: 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll find out how we all handle success." The team, and Rice most 
especially, "won't be in the background any more." 
</P>
<P>
The coach has been tough on Rice during practice and severe about him in 
public. Rice ought to be flattered, in a way, because the coach treats his 
quarterback in public no less affectionately than the coach does his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz has said: "We were at a beach one summer, and I had a bathing suit on. My 
wife looked at me and said: 'Boy, you are skinny, aren't you?' I said: 'Honey, 
I'd like to remind you that it was minor defects like this that kept me from 
getting a better wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
The team also was a tease, late in the third quarter against West Virginia. Two 
plays after surrendering a touchdown that had narrowed the lead to 26-13, Rice 
threw an interception that gave the Mountaineers the ball at the Notre Dame 26. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia had the ball for three plays. It didn't get a touchdown; it 
didn't get a field goal. What happened was a Mountaineers' trip backwards that 
ended with, of all deflating things, a punt followed by an 80-yard Notre Dame 
burst for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had fussed before the game: "We cannot flinch." Nobody did, and Holtz 
will have trouble fooling even the dullest minds from now on. 
</P>
<P>
He might try and hide his obsession behind self-deprecating one-liners, but who 
will believe him? Holtz insists he never dreamed of winning a national title, 
yet he had a bailout clause in his contract at Minnesota for the job he now 
has. 
</P>
<P>
Any coach who wants so badly to coach at Notre Dame also wants to join Rockne 
and Leahy in Notre Dame history. The ordinary-looking fellow with Olympian 
ambition seems to be saying, as Notre Damers did when they peeked behind those 
thick glasses and saw genius: let the gains begin.
