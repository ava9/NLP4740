A funnel cloud was reported in Indiana on Sunday, the second day that 
Midwestern states were raked by severe weather.

The National Guard on Sunday patrolled areas of southern Indiana hit hardest 
overnight by tornadoes that left 10 people dead and hundreds injured in five 
states.

In Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky, homes were sucked from their 
foundations, tractor-trailers were blown from highways and countless utility 
poles were toppled late Saturday and early Sunday, cutting off electrical 
service to thousands of homes, authorities said.

Eight people were killed in Indiana and one in Illinois.

On Sunday high winds at a campground in a state park in south-central Wisconsin 
toppled a tree onto a tent, killing one woman and injuring another, authorities 
said.

The National Weather Service said a funnel cloud was seen near Lafayette, Ind., 
Sunday afternoon as thunderstorms and high winds continued to plague the state. 
The severe weather Sunday uprooted trees, downed power lines and was blamed for 
an 18-vehicle accident near South Bend. No serious injuries were reported.

The Indiana National Guard moved into the hardest-hit towns in the southern 
part of the state Sunday to prevent looting and provide medical assistance 
after Gov. Evan Bayh declared an emergency Saturday night. Officials said it 
was the worst outbreak of tornadoes in Indiana since April, 1974, when 48 
deaths were reported.

The weather service said 44 tornadoes moved through Indiana on Saturday night, 
sparing only the northwestern part of the state. The twisters touched down at 
least 50 times, said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management 
Agency. More than 200 were injured in the state.

Severe thunderstorms also spawned 22 tornadoes in Illinois and 14 in Kentucky 
on Saturday night and early Sunday, the weather service said.

Six people were injured in Kentucky when the twisters roared through the state, 
causing more than $1 million in damage to about 30 homes, authorities said. 
Some mobile homes in Trimble County were thrown into a road by high winds, and 
mobile homes in other areas were destroyed.
