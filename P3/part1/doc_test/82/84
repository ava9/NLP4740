In reading letters (Jan. 11) from Carl Boronkay of the Metropolitan Water 
District and others on the water shortages in Southern California, it is 
obvious that some of the Great Lakes region's bountiful fresh water should be 
piped to the upper basin states.

This could soften the competition between that area and California for Colorado 
River water.

For decades the Southwest has sold affordable gas and vegetables to the 
Midwest. It has also been a refuge for weaklings who cannot hack the frigid 
winters and muggy summers which cause our verdant landscape. This emigration 
has kept our area from becoming overcrowded. So, watching the Saint Joseph 
River flow past my home, towards Notre Dame du Lac in South Bend, on its way to 
Lake Michigan, I feel that sharing this fresh water is a fair part of the 
solution to the Sunbelt's thirst.

Where steel mills once stood in southeast Chicago could be the wellhead for 
some aqueducts fanning out towards Dallas, Denver and Phoenix. The steel to 
make these aqueducts, from the carcinogenic-plagued Pacific Rim, would keep 
California ports busy. This could be the public works project for the 1990s, 
rivaling the interstate highway system in magnitude, lessening the Sunbelt's 
dependence upon snowfalls in the Rockies and the Sierra.

After all, we are one nation and you should be welcome to some of the water as 
long as you don't forget where you got it.
