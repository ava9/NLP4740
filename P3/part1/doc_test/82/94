Arctic air gripped much of the nation Saturday and knifed as far south as 
Mexico, driving temperatures to record lows in at least 58 cities in 17 states, 
grounding planes and snarling traffic in areas burdened by howling winds and 
snow as deep as 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Blinding windblown snow forced a temporary halt to the aerial search for a 
private plane carrying three people that disappeared Friday in a snowstorm near 
the Catskill Mountains about 30 miles south of Albany, N.Y., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cold forced a one-day postponement of a candlelight ceremony scheduled for 
Saturday evening at Antietam National Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Md. The wind 
chill was expected to be 25 to 30 degrees below zero. Organizers planned to 
light 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or missing after the 
Civil War's bloodiest single-day battle. 
</P>
<P>
Snow was falling in parts of the West, Northeast, Southwest and Midwest -- 
including many spots hit by the snow a day or two earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The cold air system sent temperatures plummeting below the freezing mark as far 
south as Texas, where the Dec. 16 record was broken or tied in 13 cities. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury hit 9 in Abilene, 12 in Ft. Worth, 17 in Austin and San Antonio and 
33 in Brownsville, on the Mexican border. At 24 degrees, Corpus Christi 
recorded its coldest morning since February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Subzero readings greeted early risers as far south as North Carolina and 
Arkansas, where 13 cities and towns set or equaled records for the date. 
</P>
<P>
Subzero record temperatures were reported in Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, 
West Virginia, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. New records above zero were set in 
Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
No records were set in Illinois for the first time in several days, but 
whistling winds dropped the minus-11 recorded in several cities to wind chills 
of nearly 40 below. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, the wind chill in Kentucky was 10 to 20 below, keeping many 
roads icy. Lows around Tennessee were mostly in the single digits early 
Saturday and were generally about 30 degrees below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Wind chill readings reaching 20 below zero sent Philadelphia's homeless 
scrambling into overcrowded shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Some parts of Upstate New York had their first heavy snow in two years, ranging 
up to 11 inches in the southern Adirondacks about 60 miles north of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters predicted snowfall of 8 to 12 inches in Vermont, New Hampshire and 
Maine by the time the storm ended. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials reported 30 inches of snow by morning in New Carlisle, 
Ind., about 8 miles west of South Bend, which was the warmest spot in the state 
with a reading of 10 degrees above zero.

including two Amish boys in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County, left -- were 
simply savoring the snow. Associated Press
