Although many of the great classical music works were composed expressly for 
religious rituals, they are rarely performed in that context today. This is 
particularly true of full-scale renditions of the Roman Catholic Mass, which 
are far more likely to be heard in the concert hall than in a church. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday evening at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic Church in Encino, 
Beethoven's Mass in C will be presented in the manner in which it was intended. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a religious work, after all, so we wanted to do it as an actual Mass," 
said William Beck, music director of St. Cyril's. "But it is a large 
undertaking for a church, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
The Mass, which is to be celebrated by the church's pastor, Rev. Monsignor 
Cyril Navin, will be performed by a 40-piece orchestra, a 50-member choir and 
four soloists, all to be conducted by Beck. 
</P>
<P>
It was scheduled as part of the church's regular performing arts series, with 
an important difference. Although the cost of performing the work will be 
approximately $5,000 (most of which is for musicians' fees), the church will 
not be charging admission or asking those attending for the traditional 
"suggested donation." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't," Beck said, "because this is being done as a religious service. It's 
free to anyone who wants to come." As in any regular service, however, the 
plate will be passed for free-will offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Additional music will include the "Hallelujah" section of Beethoven's "Christ 
on the Mount of Olives" oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's Mass in C will be celebrated at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic 
Church, 15520 Ventura Blvd., Encino, at 7:30 p.m. Sunday. For information, call 
(818) 986-8234.
