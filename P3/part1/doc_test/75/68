Just under a year ago at the Wigmore Hall, French-Canadian pianist
Marc-Andre Hamelin was Sophie Rolland's partner in Beethoven's cello
sonatas. He offered a striking complement to her gentler muse: confident,
big-boned, imaginative playing, perfectly apt for the young Beethoven, and
yet always solicitous for the cello's softer voice. On Friday, his dazzling
solo recital in St. John's showed just how remarkable a pianist he is.
It consisted merely (merely]) of Schumanns's Carnaval and the concerto for
Piano Sola by Charles-Valentin Alkan, that obscure, obsessive
composer-pianist whose works took virtuoso writing almost beyond any
performer's limits. Just getting through the Concerto with a decent
proportion of the right notes, especially in public, is a trial so fearsome
that hardly anyone tries. Even with a seasoned Alkan champion like Ronald
Smith, the sense of reckless courage in the face of ever-present danger is a
constant feature of the performance.
Hamelin's account of Carnaval was rich and satisfying, marked out with bold
contrasts, interpretatively on sound, cultivated lines. His fingers were
more than equal to all Schumann's demands (his 'Paganini' was uncommonly
brilliant), and he also scaled down beautifully for the small, intimate
confessions. There were many things to admire and enjoy; but one was never
actually surprised, never made to hear something in a radically unexpected
way. Hamelin isn't that kind of virtuoso - and so much the better, some
would say.
With Alkan's Concerto, he demonstrated what kind of virtuoso he is. It is a
rare kind indeed: viz the kind for whom Alkan's mounting, torrential
challenges are so completely, even comfortably in hand that he can give his
full attention to expounding the music - lyrically, structurally,
intellectually - as if it were just as serious as Beethoven. Nothing sounded
'grotesque': rampant and slightly mad, yes, but cogent enough to justify its
monstrous scale. After such a performance, a swift collapse in the
green-room would be natural. In fact Hamelin plunged at once, superbly, into
encores of the same order, like Godowsky's left-hand version of Chopin's
E-flat minor Etude. Extraordinary.

On Sunday the Queen Elizabeth Hall played host to Janina Fialkowska, latest
participant in the South Bank's current 'International Piano Series'. Her
programme choice was, among other things, a reminder that she has been an
Artur Rubinstein competition prizewinner in the early 1970s, and that
Rubinstein was her mentor in the last years of his life. A large selection
of Chopin in the second half and the choice of Szymanowski's Variations on a
Polish Folk Theme in the first - both of these were composers to whom
Rubinstein showed particular devotion - also served to highlight her special
strengths: crystalline articulation, absolute control in layering textures
and varying colours, formidable strength and speed in bravura passages.
Fialkowska is such a superbly gifted and musicianly pianist that her
intermittent failure to hold a listener's attention seemed puzzling. At this
stage in her career, strangely fluctuating tendencies can be sensed in
musical commitment - sometimes her performances come across as fully
'personal', mature and richly absorbed, sometimes merely facile (and, odder
still, sometimes unpredictably both).
The opener, Liszt's piano transcription of his BACH Prelude and Fugue for
organ, was flashy, not interesting. In the Mozart A minor Sonata, K310, the
approach was miniaturised, brittle, detached from any sparking engagement
with Classical discourse - and this in spite of numerous slow-movement
felicities. A piece called In the Stillness of the Seventh Autumn by the
pianist's fellow Canadian Brian Cherney proved a dispiriting combination of
eclectic modernism and droopy sensitivity.
My overall impression was of a remarkable technician who has yet to come
fully into her own as an artist. Throughout the recital there were
tantalising hints of how exciting it will be when she does.
