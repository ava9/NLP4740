It is hard to believe that yet another new set of Beethoven symphonies can
produce fresh insights, but John Eliot Gardiner's magnificent version with
the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (Archiv Produktion) will surely
set new standards of excellence for future performances. Exploiting the
clarity and precision of period instruments, Gardiner has used recent work
by textual scholars to try to get closer to the composer's final thoughts on
these canonic pieces, resulting in some radical re-fashioning of tempi which
are barely recognisable from some of the lumbering recordings of the past.
If you like your Beethoven sprightly, listen and enjoy the work of a great
interpreter.
Before the designer suits and the Royal Albert Hall, Eric Clapton used to
play the blues. From the Cradle (Reprise) is an entirely logical follow-up
to the success of his Unplugged album, which proved definitively that there
was a new generation interested in the music which Clapton grew up with.
They are all here - Willie Dixon, Elmore James, a lovely 'How Long Blues'
and great guitar-playing all round - but there is also a distinct shortage
of surprises.
Sinead O'Connor (below), on the other hand, would rather grow her hair long
than produce a predictable album. Universal Mother (Ensign) has the most
cringe-worthy moments on an album since John Lennon's Primal Scream period,
but she shares with him a raw and passionate intensity which is hard to
ignore. Motherhood is her pre-occupation this time round, although grief,
Irish political history and Kurt Cobain also get a look in.
A new batch of rare jazz recordings has been re-issued by EMI on their Blue
Note Connoisseur series. Pick of the current crop is True Blue by Tina
Brooks, a talented and unjustly neglected tenor saxophonist, who teams up in
this 1960 session with Freddie Hubbard and Duke Jordan.
Esa-Pekka Salonen, conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic, continues his
efforts to popularise modern music with his world premiere recording of
Witold Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, coupled with the same composer's Third
Symphony and Les Espaces du Sommeil (Sony).
Latest move to bring affordable classical recordings to an ever-expanding
audience is EMI's partnership with WH Smith in producing a range of
compilations of Gilbert and Sullivan, Bach, Beethoven, Maria Callas, early
hymns and psalms, as well as themed collections on
'Vienna', 'the spirit of Russia' and more.
