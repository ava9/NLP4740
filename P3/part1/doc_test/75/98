Imagine listening to a compact disc and simultaneously having access to a 
computerized, user-friendly, verbal and visual encyclopedia about the music. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you're listening to Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 and the 
computer program -- in a chapter about musical pitches -- informs you: 
"Musicians eventually became frustrated. Picture the situation: Wonderful tunes 
were invented, became Top 40 chants, but suddenly were forgotten because 
someone's memory lapsed. No wonder Gregorian chants were simple -- what else 
was a poor monk to do." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of IMCDs: interactive, multimedia compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many people know they exist, and few have the equipment on which to 
play them. But they and their equivalents are destined to play a role in home 
entertainment of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Allan Ayars, director of multimedia industry services for 
Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, probably fewer than 10,000 of 
these systems exist. But by 1994, Ayars expects the market for the systems to 
reach half a million, driven by the rapidly increasing number of software 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why companies are lavishing thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands 
of dollars on so few potential customers. To Santa Monica-based Voyager Co., 
it's all about publishing. "Our goal is to be the Random House of tomorrow," 
spokesman Bob Stein says. "But tomorrow isn't here yet. What we're trying to do 
now is to establish our position and survive." 
</P>
<P>
To Warner New Media, the issue is keeping competitive in an uncertain future. 
Company president Stan Cornyn says, "If you're a large corporation, you don't 
want to be blindsided by new technology," but he adds that "I would like to see 
more players out there. It's kind of strange to be making a lot of phonograph 
records for a universe where there are no phonographs." 
</P>
<P>
IMCDs are played on a CD-ROM player hooked up to a Macintosh personal computer 
and an audio playback system. The most visible IMCDs to date, classical music 
presentations from Voyager and Warner New Media, demonstrate the medium's 
potential to such great effect that both the home electronics and the computer 
industries are convinced that these classical music IMCDs have opened a window 
onto the future. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs allow people to manipulate audio and visual information with 
the power they previously had only over words and numbers," says Peter Bloch, 
president of Interactive Production Associates in Santa Monica, whose company 
made the interactive programs on illuminated manuscripts that you can see at 
the Getty Museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare the multimedia programs with books, and you can see that we're 
offering an entertaining, gamelike environment. If a picture is worth a 
thousand words, an interactive multimedia environment containing words and 
pictures is worth ten thousand." 
</P>
<P>
Interactive multimedia has been around since the '70s for industrial and 
educational purposes. Until late 1988, however, it was too expensive for the 
home. That changed in late 1988, with the development of sound generating 
software for CD-ROMs (read-only memory compact discs with massive storage 
capacities). Since then, most of the world's major entertainment and computer 
companies, including Sony, Philips, IBM, Intel, Yamaha, Apple, Commodore and 
NEC, have embraced the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The system recommended by both Voyager and Warner New Media consists of an 
Apple Macintosh computer with at least one megabyte of memory, an 
Apple-compatible hard drive with at least five megabytes of free space, an 
Apple-compatible CD-ROM drive, and an audio playback system. Prices for the 
computer components have fallen as low as $1,700 (down from $3,200 just 12 
months ago), but getting into this new technology may still be too expensive 
for many otherwise interested consumers. The alternative, unfortunately, is an 
indefinite waiting time, until the Voyager and Warner Media programs are made 
available for MS-DOS setups and such specific players as Commodore's CDTV, due 
this fall, and Sony-Philips' CDI machine, due in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Why classical music? Laura Boddine, president of Tiger Media in Downey, whose 
first interactive multimedia program, Airwave Adventures, the Case of the 
Cautious Condor, was recently named Best Adventure program in Japan, explains: 
"Classical music is a niche market. When CD audio came out, classical music 
products were important because there was a ready market, even though it was a 
small one. 
</P>
<P>
"Interactive multimedia is a very expensive medium to work in, there's no 
installed base. But there's lots of public-domain content available and no 
royalties have to be paid to Beethoven or Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
More important is Apple's Macintosh, an ideal computer on which to develop a 
multimedia product -- its graphics-based environment and HyperCard software 
suited to recording, connecting, relating and remembering the staggering number 
of words, pictures and sounds that the interactive medium requires. 
</P>
<P>
Each classical IMCD contains a complete audio recording plus information on the 
music's history, technical features and stylistic content in the form of text 
and pictures, viewed on the computer's screen, and additional musical examples 
and audio commentaries. A "mouse," the Macintosh's interactive pointing device, 
is used to move from one information screen to another with a technique called 
"clicking." You can simply listen to the music straight through with or without 
reading the screens, or concentrate on individual movements or even single 
chords that you can repeat over and over. 
</P>
<P>
The first classical IMCD was Beethoven's Ninth, using Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt's 
Vienna Philharmonic recording. It was written by UCLA professor Robert Winter 
and published in 1989 by Voyager as the first title in its CD Companion Series 
($99). Apple CEO John Sculley was impressed: In his opening remarks to the 
MacWorld Conference last fall, he heralded the Ninth as a key to the future of 
computing. Consumers have been impressed: They have bought more than 6,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Turning on the Macintosh and calling up the programs reveals an index card-like 
screen with a picture of Beethoven and a table of contents. "Each of the five 
chapters," Winter explains, "takes the user to a different level of complexity. 
The simplest level is called 'The Pocket Map,' which lays the four movements 
out with structural guideposts so that you have a sense of where you're going. 
You can click on, say, 'First movement, second theme,' and hear the music 
immediately. You can stay at this level for 20 minutes or more, having fun 
going here and there, making connections at a very basic level." 
</P>
<P>
The second level, called "Beethoven's World," supplies cultural, political and 
social background on Vienna of the 1820s, where Beethoven wrote the Ninth 
Symphony. Again, many of the graphics, musical instruments for example, are 
linked to passages in the music that can be listened to nearly instantaneously. 
The third stack, called "The Art of Listening," explains the musical 
architecture of the Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like with a painting," Winter explains, "where bits of color, shape and 
form interrelate, Beethoven's Ninth consists of hundreds of individual sounds. 
If you were to scramble them, the piece would not be very impressive. It is the 
way in which they grow, develop, come together and unfold that the music gains 
its power." 
</P>
<P>
At the fourth level, "A Close Reading," the Ninth plays through in its entirety 
while everything happening in the music is being explained in vivid, clear 
English with the persuasive authority of a world-class scholar ("Just when it 
does not seem possible to generate more excitement, the . . . choral entries do 
just that, enlivened by a series of electrifying orchestral trills," Winter 
writes of a section in the fourth movement). 
</P>
<P>
The last level, "Fun &amp; Games," is a "Jeopardy"-like series of questions 
exploiting the relationship between ideas and sound. The computer, of course, 
keeps score. 
</P>
<P>
At any moment, at any level, you can jump from movement to movement, from 
section to section, simply by clicking with the mouse. And, any time there's a 
technical term -- even one as basic as "movement," a clear, down to earth 
explanation is only a mouse click away, often with a musical example. According 
to Winter, "A reasonably alert 8-year-old will be able to use the CD Companion 
as well as a seasoned 80-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
The second classical IMCD was Mozart's "Magic Flute," using Nikolaus 
Harnoncourt's 1988 Zurich recording. It was written by a team supervised by Cal 
State Fullerton's Irene Gurtin and published three months ago by Burbank-based 
Warner New Media as the first title in its Audio Notes series ($66). Customers 
at Tower's Sunset Strip classical store were impressed. The store has sold out 
two shipments and is waiting for its third. 
</P>
<P>
Although the "Flute" operates in exactly the same way as Beethoven's Ninth -- 
using a mouse to move from screen to screen, exploring relationships between 
music and information -- there are more than minor cosmetic differences. Warner 
New Media head Stan Cornyn explains that "Voyager's is at this point looked 
upon as a Robert Winter vehicle, in the best sense. His Beethoven Ninth 
therefore was an attempt to communicate what he had to say about Beethoven's 
Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a different approach, putting all sorts of extra audio on. We have 
narrators talking, Florence Foster Jenkins singing, and so on. Our HyperCard 
stack, between 7,000 and 10,000 cards, is much larger and tends to encompass a 
great deal more. We are trying not to take one man's idiosyncratic view of 
anything, but trying to present a broader sense of things. Theirs is the auteur 
approach, ours the generalist's." 
</P>
<P>
Given the lively sense of competition between the two companies (Cornyn and 
Winter worked together at one point), it's not surprising that their new titles 
share such enhancements as audio commentaries and graphic representations. 
Previewing Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" from Voyager, using the Charles 
Dutoit/Montreal Symphony recording and written by Winter (scheduled for release 
this month), and Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14 from Warner New Media, using 
the Vermeer Quartet's recording and written by a team supervised by 
editor-in-chief Cynthia Woll (scheduled for September), revealed improved 
production values and greater ease of handling. 
</P>
<P>
Woll's Beethoven Quartet ($50) also reveals more personality than the "Magic 
Flute," combining authoritative eloquence with a delightful sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Its five main levels (called "Spines" as if they were the spines of books) 
allow real-time, full-length analyses of the work from levels suitable for 
beginners to levels suitable to experienced listeners. The "Blueprint" spine 
contains graphic representation of the music and the "Notebook" spine allows 
the user to enter his or her own thoughts. At all times, "hotkey" options 
appear on screen like sidebars in magazines. When you're reading the "Tempo 
Guide" screen, for example, you can "hotkey" (the Warner nomenclature for mouse 
clicking) to "Beethoven &amp; The Metronome," "Quartet Map," or "Index"; while 
reading an "Exploring the Music" screen, you can "hotkey" to "About Melody," 
"Chamber Music Lovers" or "About Chamber Music." 
</P>
<P>
Although Voyager's new "Sacre du Printemps" ($99.95) is also expanded and 
improved, the format is the same: The opening screen offers menu choices 
including "A Pocket Guide" (a one-screen orientation to the entire work); 
"Stravinsky's World" (on the composer's life and times); "Rite Listening" (a 
chatty introduction to the music); "Dancing the Rite" (discussing the actual 
production); "A Close Reading," a real-time commentary, and "The Rite Game." 
</P>
<P>
If, after listening to the opening bassoon solo, you want to hear a bassoon all 
by itself, you go to the glossary, click on bassoon and the bassoon plays 
alone. You can access all the instruments of the orchestra, each with a 
characteristic audio excerpt from "Sacre." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager does offer a unique product, the CD AudioStack, a stand-alone program 
retailing for $99.95 that allows CD-ROM users to play and precisely control 
off-the-shelf CDs. It's like making your own CD Companion. 
</P>
<P>
The future? Voyager has Winter doing the first three Brandenburg Concertos and 
histories of early jazz and mid-'50s rock in the planning stages, while, later 
this month, he and the Angeles Quartet will do a five-camera shoot of Mozart's 
Quartet K. 465, for the first time adding video to the menu of options. Warner 
New Media's schedule includes Brahms' German Requiem, Berlioz's "Symphonie 
Fantastique," Benjamin Britten's "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" and 
Arnold Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire," the last written by Schoenberg Institute 
head Leonard Stein. 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt that both Mozart and Beethoven would have been eager and 
consummate multimedia authors. Not only was Mozart a superb writer, as attested 
to by his voluminous letters, but he was an avid game player who invented a 
do-it-yourself composing method using dice. And, adds Winter, "Beethoven called 
himself a Tonkunstler, a painter with tones. Even in his time, a composer was 
considered both an artist and a scientist, someone with great skill in 
manipulating materials."
