THE SECOND instalment of Sony Classical's Glenn Gould Edition is if anything
even more consistently treasurable than the first, which appeared last year.
True to its principle of comprehensiveness the new batch of discs includes
Gould's second recording of the Goldberg Variations made in 1981, 25 years
after the version that first established his reputation and which has
already been included in the CD edition. The later account remains, though,
the consummate achievement, one of Gould's finest performances, in which his
astonishing powers of articulation and control are harnessed to a view of
the variations that holds structural coherence, contrapuntal rigour and
poetic expression in perfect balance.
The other Bach here is the collection of Two-Part and Three-Part Inventions
assembled in the mid 1960s. If alongside the Goldberg they seem plain,
unadorned, much more confined in their tonal range and expressive potential,
they represent nevertheless a vital aspect of Gould's creative thinking,
which held that the bare essentials of Bachian counterpoint were to be just
as highly regarded as the grandest organic conceptions.
With Gould's pair of Brahms discs the common ground between performer and
listener becomes a little less firm. He was a pianist who was congenitally
incapable of being uninteresting, but sometimes his illogicality and
wilfulness are hard to follow. Among poised, lucid accounts of some of the
pieces here are strange, unexpected discursions  - the central section of
the first of the Op. 10 Ballades (recorded a few months before his death in
1982) slowed down almost to a standstill, the the E flat Intermezzo from Op.
117 made so prosaic that all its poetry seeps away, the B minor piece from
Op. 119 full of ripples and flurries, with the pianist's omnipresent
crooning more intrusive than usual.
The eclecticism of Gould's repertory is represented by Hindemith and by his
magisterial version of Liszt's transcription of the Pastoral Symphony. This
becomes Beethoven filtered through the sensibility of two keyboard giants to
emerge as an exploration of modern piano texture and figuration which only
Gould, among the pianists of our time, could make so fascinating and
revelatory. Hindemith is the other unfashionable favourite here; the three
piano sonatas receive muscular, committed performances. Winning would not be
the word I would use describe this music, but Gould's accounts come as near
as any interpreter could to making them seem like vitally important works in
the 20th-century piano literature.
Alongside such eccentric brilliance Maria Joao Pires' collection of three
Mozart sonatas could seem plain fare indeed. There is nothing startling or
unconventional about her playing; it is not the supremely elegant style of
Mozart interpretation which makes Mitsulo Uchida's Mozart sonata cycle so
enduring, but something altogether more straightforward and ultimately
endearing. It is, though, skilled, highly sophisticated playing, full of
careful grading and shading and with a punctilious correctness about its
rhythmic shaping. Nothing is pushed too hard, there are no specious claims
to profundity; the music emerges naturally and easily.
In the Beaux Arts Trio's integral set of Schumann's piano trios the piano
playing of Menahem Pressler takes pride of place. Indeed Pressler's
propulsive, brittle approach gives the familiar Beaux Arts character to
these performances, which may not be ideal (the account of the D minor Trio,
for instance, cannot hold a candle to the famous version that Rubinstein
recorded with Heifetz and Piatigorsky) but which in works that are too often
neglected are much more than simply serviceable. The tone of violinist
Isidore Cohen has got wirier and less supple over the years, that of the
cellist Peter Wiley is less assertive than that of his predecessor in the
group Bernard Greenhouse. But the energy of the playing is unmistakable and
the surge it gives to Schumann's melodies hard to gainsay.
Finally a curiosity. The irrepressible Mahler enthusiast and scholar Gilbert
Kaplan has sponsored and produced a realisation of four piano rolls made by
his hero for the new Welte-Mignon system in 1905: the songs 'Ging heut'
morgens uber Feld' and 'Ich ging mit Lust durch einen grunen Wald', the
fourth movement of the Fourth Symphony and the opening movement of the
Fifth. The disc also includes alternative versions of the three vocal items
with solo vocal lines added by the soprano Yvonne Kenny and mezzo Claudine
Carlson.
On this evidence Mahler was not a great composer-pianist; the performances
are full of scumbled passage work and muddy figuration. But they do give an
uncanny sense of his energy as an interpreter; his tempi are generally
faster than those of conventional performances today, and he seems to have
obtained emotional weighting through contrasts of mood and dynamic much more
than by languorous expressivo. The realisations have been carried out
immaculately; for Mahlerians this is doubtless an essential issue.
