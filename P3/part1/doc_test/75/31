Every once in a while, some not-so-good Samaritan comes along and puts a head 
on the "Winged Victory" or provides the missing limbs for the Venus de Milo or 
completes Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Gimmickry invariably looms with each such effort. So does inevitable failure. 
Nevertheless, the fleeting PR value carries its own irresistible reward. 
</P>
<P>
This season's most modish mock-revelation has been billed as Beethoven's 10th 
Symphony. Actually, it is nothing of the kind -- just a little orchestral essay 
in the late-Beethoven manner "realized," rather clumsily and dutifully, from 
assorted quasi-authentic sketches by a Scottish musicologist named Barry 
Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic ventured the much-ballyhooed and 
little-appreciated premiere last October. This was followed by disappointing 
but well-publicized performances in London and New York, not to mention a 
breathlessly hyped recording. 
</P>
<P>
The unreasonable facsimile offered by the Pacific Symphony under Keith Clark 
Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was heralded as the 
West Coast premiere. Actually, that dubious honor had already fallen to San 
Jose, which heard the ersatz symphony back in November. 
</P>
<P>
Premiere or no premiere, the so-called 10th is a cautious and inconsequential 
exercise in musical guesswork. It meanders prettily and naively for a while in 
lyrical circles, then pops off for the obligatory contrast of some dramatic 
naivete before returning meekly to andante basics. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the piece sounds like Beethoven salvaged from the cutting-room floor. 
Much of it sounds like the throat-clearing of a dull Beethoven imitator who is 
forced to vamp until ready. At 16 minutes, this is a short piece but a long 
vamp. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and his charges gave it a ragged introductory reading. Significantly, 
perhaps, the audience couldn't muster enough enthusiasm to recall the music 
director for a single bow. 
</P>
<P>
Matters improved in the major challenge of the evening, Brahms' First Piano 
Concerto. The odd acoustical ambiance of Segerstrom Hall reduced much of the 
rhetoric to mush. The orchestral impulses threatened to get flabby whenever 
agitation beckoned. Internal intonation was often questionable. Still, the 
spirit was willing and, most important, Horacio Gutierrez illuminated the solo 
utterances with urgency, fluidity and rhapsodic grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece on the program took the unaccustomed form of Joseph 
Schwantner's "New Morning for the World," a setting of speeches by Martin 
Luther King, Jr. First performed in Rochester six years ago -- with none other 
than Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates as narrator -- it allows the 
orchestra to vacillate between movie-music slush and instant bombast while the 
soloist recites some poignant historical texts. 
</P>
<P>
The intentions are obviously lofty. Unfortunately, Schwantner did little but 
crank out prosaic busy-music to surround the uplifting prose. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, William Warfield spoke the uplifting prose with clarity and 
emotional point. The affect was intensified by understatement but compromised 
by microphone echoes. 
</P>
<P>
Clark exhorted the orchestra to make a mighty accompanying noise. The noise, 
not incidentally, sounded blurry and distorted beyond the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the specter of amplification clouded aesthetic and musical issues 
in Orange County.
