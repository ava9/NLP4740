On the face of it, a small-orchestra programme of Beethoven, Haydn and
Schumann would seem unlikely to fill the Barbican Hall. On Saturday,
however, the band was the crack Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and their
conductor was the period specialist Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He is better known
for his Bach and Monteverdi, but he has strong convictions about performing
styles in later music too. Nothing in this programme was less than crisp and
vivid.
That was true even of the little Haydn violin concerto in G, called 'no. 2'
 -but possibly not by Haydn at all. The orchestra's leader, Marieke
Blankestijn, was the coolly assured soloist; the accompanying strings
addressed their music in strictly pre-Romantic style. For Beethoven's First
Symphony and Schumann's Third, the 'Rhenish', there were smallish period
timpani, dry and effective, and in the earlier work fine valveless trumpets.
The trumpeters returned for the Schumann with instruments of a later model,
and a perfectly balanced trio of trombones spoke beautifully in the 'Cologne
Cathedral' movement. But all the parts of the orchestra gleamed in that
work: instead of the lush, plush sound of a big modern band, we had a lithe
polyphony of voices, all colourfully distinct. Harnoncourt's beat can be
slightly unrelenting, but for the pawky Landler movement - the so-called
Scherzo - he relaxed to wholly disarming effect. The string of little dances
took on a comic mock-innocence.
In the Beethoven Harnoncourt was severer, in his more usual manner. He
insisted upon clean, sharp dynamic extremes - bracing, sometimes even
disconcerting, but convincing. If his treatment was occasionally stiff, the
exuberant brio of his players went a long way toward compensating for it.
