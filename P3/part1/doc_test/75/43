FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Beethoven rolls over for King's - Promenade Concerts

The tradition whereby the penultimate night of the Proms was given over to
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony seems well and truly broken. It has to be right
that other composers occupy this prestigious date and the choice fell this
year on two of England's finest, Byrd and Purcell.
It also - surprisingly - marked the first ever appearance at the Proms by
the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. One venerable English institution
meets another, the choir being the more venerable by some centuries as it
dates back to the time of Henry VI. (Interesting to note that the
residential choir school at King's and the Royal Albert Hall both date from
the 1870s, when the Victorian patronage of music was at its height.)
There is a point to this historical background. For decades after the war,
and even longer before, it was the cathedral and college choirs of Britain
that kept the flame burning for the sacred music of composers like Byrd and
Purcell. But no more: small, fully professional choirs, such as the Tallis
Scholars and the Sixteen, have risen to dominance in this repertoire,
particularly in recordings.
To hear the King's choir again at Friday's Prom in a selection of Byrd's
early Latin pieces came as quite a surprise, not necessarily an unpleasant
one. The traditional college sound (sweet treble tone, youthful light
basses) is not as focused or concentrated as the professional groups, but it
has a natural feel to it. Byrd is hardly likely to have heard his music sung
by bands of hand-picked, well-drilled, potential soloists.
Under the direction of Stephen Cleobury, its director of music, the choir
gave mostly tidy and sensitive performances of the Byrd and Purcell's Come,
ye sons of art. The King's style has never involved much digging for
expression and its Purcell was on the wan side, light, stylish, agreeable on
the surface, but needing a bit more straightforward punch. Of the soloists,
Stephen Varcoe bit into his words with most determination.
In between, London Baroque under Charles Medlam played Handel's Concerto
Grosso Op. 6 No. 6 and accompanied the soprano Lynne Dawson in his motet
Silete venti - well contrasted pieces, which gave a relatively long
programme plenty of variety. Beethoven was not missed.
