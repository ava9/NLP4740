THE audience for Mahler has not changed since he became popular in the
Sixties. Last Friday, the Albert Hall was packed to the rafters and it was a
sea of young faces, the second generation to have been raised on the
composer's gigantic symphonies.
It can be a problem to know what to put with the larger of them, but this
programme neatly paired the Fifth Symphony with Berg's Violin Concerto,
which can claim a direct Mahlerian line of descent. The soloist was
Anne-Sophie Mutter, who has spent the past year on sabbatical. The Berg
concerto is the work with which she has chosen to make her return, and her
tender performance of it could almost have been intended to link with the
favourite Mahler adagietto to come.
In recent recordings of concertos by Bartok and Mozart, Anne-Sophie Mutter's
playing had started to sound larger-than-life to an unpleasing degree, but
this Berg marked a return to a subtler kind of musicianship. The quiet
playing shimmered with colours. The portamentos, of which she is fond, were
delicately done. Recent research has claimed to find a hidden
autobiographical programme behind this concerto and in Mutter's performance
it was possible to believe that this is indeed music of a secret love.
After the interval, the symphony revealed few hidden charms. Michael Tilson
Thomas likes his Mahler to be crisp and alert, if not going so far as to be
a mere orchestral showpiece. On that level, his ideas about the Fifth
Symphony are well sorted out and the performance might have succeeded if the
London Symphony Orchestra's playing had been as consistently brilliant as he
needed.
It is good to hear the LSO away from the Barbican, but on this showing it
did not sound a great orchestra. The best passages were the latter part of
the scherzo and the finale, where conductor and orchestra alike were in a
high state of alertness. The adagietto also started well, brisk, purposeful,
unsentimental, although it lost momentum later. But in the rest, tension was
relaxed and the ensemble lost the edge which was the performance's raison
d'etre.
On Saturday, another capacity audience gathered to hear a second big,
romantic symphony. Last year, Gunter Wand was forced to cancel a concert of
Bruckner's Eighth Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra because of
ill-health. Those who were disappointed then will have been delighted that
he was able to take up the same programme at this season's Proms.
At the age of 80, Wand is in no hurry to score points off the music he
conducts. His performance of the Eighth Symphony was patient and spacious,
although not excessively slow judged against the history of Bruckner
interpretation.
It was the music-making of a man who has spent his life working in the
Austro-German musical tradition, who knows what is important and what is
not. Listening at home on the radio, I found the resonant Albert Hall sound
almost ideal.
                         *      *      *
Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony, his Ninth, is an indispensable Prom offering.
On Sunday, Vladimir Ashkenazy conducted it, apparently to mark Britain's
turn at the EC presidency, with the Berlin Radio Symphony, the London
Symphony and Brighton Festival choruses, and four solo singers from EC
countries. By way of a more specific salaam, Ashkenazy prefaced it with
Elgar's Falstaff, a near-hermetically English piece. I thought its jauntily
skewed rhythms never quite found a convincing pulse here, but Ashkenazy paid
tender attention to its crepuscular details.
The 'Choral', in his open-hearted treatment, sounded more cheerful than
visionary. His tempi were brisk: the first movement went at a lithe allegro
with little hint of 'maestoso', the great adagio sang sweetly and steadily.
With sterling soloists in Margaret Price, Martine Mahe, Jan Blinkhof and
Kurt Moll, as well as the intrepid choirs, the finale made the stirring
effect that it usually does in the Albert Hall. Ashkenazy's tearaway ending,
however, sounded like a last-minute bid to add glitter to an honest,
good-natured performance. As a pianist, he can show his true mettle as a
Beethoven interpreter better than on the podium.
