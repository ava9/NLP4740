At 7.am: rise; and shine; and write about yesterday.
10.10 am: a 20-minute walk along the links and the meadows towards the
Queens Hall and breakfast. The longer I work each morning, the later I set
off, and the less time for coffee and croissants. On some occasions my mouth
has still been full as the morning's artist ascends the platform.
11 am Queen's Hall. (Official Festival.) Or, on this occasion, four artists:
the Borodin Quartet. This year, at Edinburgh, is Beethoven year, and the
Borodin players are giving morning and evening all-Beethoven recitals. This
has its fascinations, especially in comparing early Beethoven with late. One
music-critic chum, however, says 'I can't bear the moral certainty of
Beethoven and the Germans'. I don't agree, since Beethoven's music to my ear
has plenty of questioning, not least in the quartets; and, anyway, I am
enough of an idealist or zealot to be a sucker for what moral certainties
that he does offer - as in Fidelio or the Fifth Symphony. But debates about
such matters are part of why I love coming to the festival. It might be
better if the debate was helped along by programming Beethoven in context -
in particular of Haydn and Mozart, and of Schubert and Schumann. Still, an
all-Beethoven concert contents me much (and the all-Fidelio day thrilled me
to the marrow).
12.30 am The music critic who cannot abide Beethoven also cannot abide
Indian food: in which case it is no-go to the excellent Indian vegetarian
restaurant near the Queen's Hall. Today, we plump for echt Scottish food in
the Grassmarket: for me, haggis with tatties and neeps.
2 pm Assembly Rooms. Off Out. (Festival Fringe.) All about prostitutes and
their men. Are most fringe plays about sex? If not, I have an uncanny knack
in avoiding the chaste ones. This year has a bumper crop of smutty titles -
Ilsa, Queen of the Nazi Love Camp, Dudes with Dicks, etc . . . Several of
those with harmless titles turn out to cover one or more variety of sexual
perversion. (When clocking in at the Fringe press office this year, I said
'I can't wait to see Vampire Girlie Poofs of Sodom.' A press officer said
'Oh, are you going to all four vampire shows this year?') For Off Out, the
author is Gill Adams, the company is Hull Truck. Those of us who do not
frequent the company of prostitutes may find an occasional dose of this kind
of thing salutary; my dosage, however, has been quite regular, and though
this play is sound enough it takes me nowhere other plays have not taken me
before.
3.30. pm. Walking from the New Town to the Old, I bump into several
colleagues in succession. 'Have you seen anything wonderful?' comes the
question. 'Not so far,' I reply.
4.30 pm. Pleasance. A Midsummer Night's Dream (Fringe.) I have also been
told on no account to miss the Ukrainian company Theatre-on-Podol. In the
queue to see its 100-minute version of Shakespeare's comedy, I meet two
Canadians whom I told of the good word about Podol last night. They tell me
that they're glad I'm here because if it's no good they'll lynch me. Oh
dear. Well, it is A Midsummer Night's Dream, but the further it departs from
Shakespeare the more enthralling it becomes. (An odd touch comes when the
rustics switch from Ukrainian into Shakespearian English for Pyramus and
Thisbe: eg: 'I zank zou, Moon, for zy glattering beams,' etc . . .) Theseus
is sick; he and his court dream the story of erotic magic and fairies in the
wood. Later, when Bottom &amp; Co. play Pyramus and Thisbe at court, Theseus
suddenly takes cruel revenge on Bottom for having made it (even if in ass's
form) with Hippolyta-Titania; he stops the play and hands Bottom-Pyramus a
real sword to kill himself with. So Bottom-Pyramus dies the noble Athenian
way, and Flute-Thisbe follows suit; Hippolyta is aghast but powerless.
Suddenly, however, Bottom and Flute spring back to life; they were good
enough actors to fake death; and the joke, or dream, was on the nobles. All
which turns the play into a Marivaux-type play about heart and
heartlessness. The lights go up. Oh dear. The Canadians are tetchy. They are
in Edinburgh because of Robert Lepage and his new Seven Streams of the River
Ota. They think Lepage's Dream was definitive and poetic and Shakespearian,
and they are cross because the Podel version is not. Nervously, I encourage
them to talk Lepage, but this does not help matters. Like most people, they
did not like The Seven Streams. I scarper before they decide to lynch me
after all.
7.30. pm. Playhouse Theatre. Miami City Ballet dancing Balanchine.
(Official.) To say that this year's festival includes the only three dance
companies in the world I now care about is to exaggerate, but not much.
(Mark Morris and Merce Cunningham are the other two.) Tonight reminds me
what I had almost forgotten: that Balanchine ballets are, or should be,
constantly dramatic and poetic illuminations of space itself. Also of music.
11 pm Traverse Theatre. Killer Joe. (Fringe.) More sex. Also, in this case,
a hired killer, nudity, adultery, and double-crossing. There is even that
rarest Fringe commodity, virginity - though not for long. The play ends with
the ex-virgin going berserk with a gun. After she has shot most of her
nearest and dearest she aims the gun at the hired killer who she meant to
marry and announces 'I'm pregnant.' It is acted, well, by Hired Gun Theatre
from Chicago, and set in a trailer park in Texas. My date, a New Yorker,
tells me: 'All Chicago theatre is like that.' She explains why, but l am too
tired to take it in. We stagger home. There are a million messages on the
answering machine, all from fringe companies doing vampire shows at
half-past-midnight this week. But at 1 am, my head hits the pillow like
lead.
