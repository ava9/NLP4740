68TH BOWL SEASON LOOMS LARGE

<P>
With 63 concerts this year, growth has become a way of life at Hollywood Bowl, 
the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, when Philharmonic General Director Ernest Fleischmann had his third 
summer there, he supervised 35 events that attracted a total attendance of 
250,000 -- attendance of 2,000 or less was not uncommon in the 18,000-capacity 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
In the record-breaking summer last year, he oversaw 58 concerts, given before a 
total audience of 761,199. 
</P>
<P>
This year's season, running July 3 to Sept. 16, will be the 68th musical summer 
at the Bowl. Highlights of this 11-week season include guest appearances by the 
Montreal Symphony, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Boston Pops Esplanade 
Orchestra; a five-concert jazz series; appearances by conductors Yuri 
Temirkanov, L.A. Philharmonic Music Director Andre Previn, Edo de Waart, Neeme 
Jarvi, Henry Mancini, John Williams and David Zinman, among others, and 
numerous pianists, violinists, singers and instrumental soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of activity at the outdoor amphitheater, Fleischmann told The Times 
in a phone interview Tuesday, "helps reduce" the stress of the L.A. 
Philharmonic Assn.'s financial situation. In a budget in excess of $26 million, 
the Bowl operation accounts for 40% of that budget, while bringing in "60% of 
our revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Those revenues include, Fleischmann said, large contributions from the 1989 
corporate sponsors and donors: American Airlines (sponsoring six concerts); E. 
Nakamichi Foundation (activities of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute); 
JVC (JVC Jazz at the Bowl concert); W.M. Keck Foundation (Open House at 
Hollywood Bowl); KFAC-FM (two concerts); Southern California Nissan Dealers), 
and Warnaco Inc. (uniforms for Bowl ushers and service personnel, contributed 
by Chaps by Ralph Lauren). 
</P>
<P>
None of these contributions pay totally for any single event, Fleischmann 
specified. "In total, these are contributions in the hundreds of thousands, not 
in the millions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann, who shares responsibility for the operation of the Bowl with 
outgoing Philharmonic General Manager Robert Harth, also commented that the 
price of success in these two decades is sometimes a negative: "As a physical 
facility, the Bowl is beginning to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five to 10 years, it will take a tremendous amount of dollars 
and refurbishing just to maintain the integrity of the place." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of outdoor entertaining, Michael Auten, the owner of Fiddler 
Enterprises, which operates the Hollywood Bowl Patio Restaurant and all Bowl 
food concessions, said food service has increased to the point where "we are 
serving more meals now in a typical busy weekend -- 15,000 to 18,000 meals 
total on Friday and Saturday -- than the previous food management used to serve 
all summer long."
