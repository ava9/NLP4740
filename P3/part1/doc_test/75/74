Any equation that includes Robert Shaw, chorus, and orchestra as components is 
likely to balance with musical felicity. The maestro, recently named the San 
Diego Symphony's resident guest conductor, brought his special touch to 
Symphony Hall Friday night, leading the symphony and the San Diego Master 
Chorale in "Gloria" settings by Vivaldi, Beethoven and Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
The program began equivocally, however, with an understated, overly deliberate 
reading of Vivaldi's familiar "Gloria." Although it was easy to admire the 
Master Chorale's purity of blend, balance, and precise articulation, their 
entrances were unduly timid and they appeared to labor mightily for modest 
musical effect. Shaw had aptly scaled down both orchestra and chorus for this 
Baroque gem, but his interpretive approach was not a wise one for the concert 
hall. In a Baroque cathedral, Shaw's subtle shadings would have been surrounded 
by a halo of bright, flattering acoustics. In Symphony Hall, the cantata merely 
sounded muted. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the mood shifted radically for Poulenc's "Gloria." Shaw has 
frequently acknowledged his admiration for the French composer, and he 
successfully turned his appreciation into a memorable performance of Poulenc's 
final choral composition. Shaw pressed lively but well-controlled tempos, 
relished the work's dramatic surprises, and tastefully underscored the score's 
playful instrumentation. It would be difficult to imagine a more persuasive 
reading of the work.

<P>
While both orchestra and chorus responded with sympathetic brio, Virginia 
Sublett took the honors as soprano soloist. Whether floating a shimmering line 
above the chorus or following the composer's angular dives into a soprano's 
treacherous lower range, Sublett retained her luminous timbre and graceful 
line. Best of all, she always communicated the text with conviction and 
complete confidence. While the lavish ornamentation and Baroque fioritura of 
her solos in the Vivaldi "Gloria" fit her voice more idiomatically, she made 
the Poulenc, which she was not originally scheduled to sing, her own. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpting the "Gloria" movement from Beethoven's grandiose "Missa Solemnis" 
may not be orthodox programming, but it did end Friday's choral program with 
gusto. Shaw let out all the stops in a vibrant but tasteful reading. Notable 
were the chorus's swift, spirited fugues -- Master Chorale director Frank 
Almond had prepared his ensemble diligently -- and the orchestra's robust 
accompaniment. The quartet of vocal soloists, soprano Lorna Haywood, mezzo 
Michele Henderson, tenor Jon Hymphrey and bass Eric Edlund, sang with balance, 
fervor and an appropriately bright timbre.
