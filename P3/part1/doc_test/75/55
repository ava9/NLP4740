There is some choice, but not much, in what violinists are asked to play on 
their audition tapes and at the ensuing live audition for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, applicants get to play a portion -- either all or part of the 
first movement -- from any of the following concerti: 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelssohn 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven 
</P>
<P>
Brahms 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Bartok No. 2 
</P>
<P>
Sibelius 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The rest of the format is set in stone. Each violinist must play the following 
music:
