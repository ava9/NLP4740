 ALL OF BEETHOVEN'S SONATAS IN 10 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his 32 piano sonatas over a span of 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Haag plans to play them all in 10 hours from memory Saturday at El 
Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"The world won't collapse over my doing this, but it will be fun," said Haag, a 
concert pianist and dean at the college who has been playing the sonatas for 25 
years -- but never before at one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
While piano marathons are not new -- the world's record of 1,218 hours was set 
in Australia in 1982 -- Haag believes his keyboard marathon will be a first for 
the Beethoven piano works. 
</P>
<P>
"They were done three or four years ago in New York, but in two segments," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The musical stunt has a practical purpose. Not only will Haag season the 
college's new, nine-foot Steinway concert grand, but he hopes to recoup the 
$40,000 price from people who pledge money to hear the music.
