Leonard Bernstein will conduct Christmas performances of Beethoven's Ninth 
Symphony on both sides of the Berlin Wall in celebration of universal 
brotherhood, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Carson, a spokesman for the conductor-composer, said the first concert 
will be held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a World War II ruin in West 
Berlin, on Dec. 23 and the second will be held Christmas Day at the 
Schauspielhaus theater in East Berlin. Both are near the Berlin Wall, which 
until recently divided the city. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the concerts originated with Bernstein after the wall was opened 
by East German authorities and East Germans streamed into West Berlin, Carson 
said. Bernstein has conducted peace concerts in Hiroshima, Japan, Warsaw and 
other cities in the past several years and has been active in efforts to end 
world conflict. 
</P>
<P>
He has organized a multinational orchestra and chorus to perform the Beethoven 
work, which has a thrilling choral finale known as the "Ode to Joy." Although 
most of the musicians will be from the Bavarian Radio Symphony, there will be 
players from New York, London, Paris, Dresden and possibly Leningrad, 
representing both West and East Germany and the four Allied powers that 
occupied Berlin after World War II, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein sent word from his home in Connecticut that the celebration was 
inspired by "Schiller! Beethoven! Freude (joy)! Bruder (brother)! Freiheit 
(freedom)!" 
</P>
<P>
"It's all coming true! Hooray!" he said.
