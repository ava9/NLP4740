FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: The 'wrong man' wins at Leeds - Piano competition

There was a melodramatic surprise-ending to the final round of the Harveys
Leeds International Pianoforte Competition this weekend: on the official
jury's vote, the wrong man won.
Popular myth says that Leeds often picks the wrong man (no woman has won
yet). But popular myth is wrong: since the 1966 contest, when Hans Keller
detonated a public row about his fellow-jurors preferring flashy Rafael
Orozco over the deeply musical Victoria Postnikova, there have been just two
years, 1981 and 1984, when there was serious doubt about the winner's
superiority - arguable superiority, anyway - to some of the runners-up.
This time, however, the lucky 'wrong man' was Ricardo Castro, a 28-year-old
Brazilian with strong fingers and sound tempi, good sense and good taste,
but little evident personality. For the finals he chose Beethoven's
monumental 'Emperor' Concerto - a strange competition-choice. Alone among
Beethoven's piano concerti, it was not composed for himself as soloist, for
by then he was deaf. Roughly speaking, either you can play it or you can't
(Castro could); if you can, it still takes a major artist to give it an
individual stamp, and this pianist did not.
Just as in his semi-final recital - his excellent Schumann let down by an
un-buoyant finale, his thrill-free Liszt - Castro met all the requirements
creditably but delivered no bonuses. Nothing to challenge the wit and
brilliance of Leon McCawley's Beethoven First; still less the mature
breadth, power and deep feeling of Mark Anderson's Brahms First; and both
those artists had offered memorable playing in the semi-finals too.
Either the jury (mostly piano-teachers, including Castro's own) was
prescient beyond our ken, in which case he may learn to open up and become
exciting while he fulfils all the engagements that now await him; or else,
as one suspects, he was a compromise choice.
BBC2 outdid itself. Do viewers realise how vastly better such BBC coverage
is than comparable TV elsewhere? The camera-work was faultless, the editing
geared faithfully to the progress of the music (director: Rodney Greenberg).
The composer Michael Berkeley was again a canny, sympathetic presenter, the
pianist Paul Crossley a perceptive - and bracingly candid - unofficial
assessor of the performances.
Mischievously, BBC2 held its own phone-in ballot: of about 35,000 votes
12,000 went to Anderson, 10,000 to McCawley and 6,000 to Maxim Philippov -
but Berkeley was too polite to report the remainder.
Young Philippov played Rakhmaninov's Third Concerto with splendid passion
and very few rough patches, more impressive than most of his solo recital
earlier. Justifiably, he won the Rakhmaninov prize donated by the composer's
grandson. Margarita Schevchenko was charming in the Beethoven First, still
employing her all-purpose expressive manner (after the climactic note in
most phrases a swift wilt, ever so delicate). Filippo Gamba offered a sturdy
Beethoven Third, somewhat dour. For all these pianists Rattle was a superbly
supportive, creative partner - abetted by the CBSO's first oboe, who is a
treasure.
