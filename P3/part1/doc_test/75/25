"Dear Uncle, something terrible has happened. A madman has moved into our 
house!" So begins "Beethoven Lives Upstairs," winner of Canada's Juno award for 
best children's recording and part of the exceptional new "Classical Kids" 
audiocassette series. 
</P>
<P>
The first offerings in the series, "Beethoven Lives Upstairs" and "Mr. Bach 
Comes to Visit," draw children into another century with entertaining and 
literate biographical drama, featuring a child as the central character. 
</P>
<P>
Each composer's music -- a rich selection of familiar and unfamiliar works -- 
is interwoven into the story and comes alive, demystified and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Creator Susan Hammond, a pianist, mother and teacher, designed the series to 
"take classical music out of its black clothes and have it speak naturally to 
children, the way it was first heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Children, especially, experience music on an emotional level," Hammond said 
from her home in Canada, "not an intellectual one. For some reason, we treat 
classical music with a hands-off approach and we lose so much. Music was not 
composed in that spirit." 
</P>
<P>
In "Mr. Bach Comes to Call," the composer has taken a time trip to the present 
to visit a young piano student. "Mr. Bach explains his music with joy and love 
and fun," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
With Beethoven, Hammond and writer Barbara Nichol get "closer to the music and 
the man. "We try to wrap a whole culture around the music, open up an 
un-20th-Century world." Young listeners are also gradually made aware of the 
tragedy of Beethoven's deafness. The recording ends with his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Death "is part of life," Hammond said. "We're showing the glow of what was left 
because that person lived. They see the sadness, but they see what was left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Dry facts won't lead children to classical music," she added. "They've got to 
feel it. We want kids to like these composers, enjoy their humor, and life. The 
heart follows the mind." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said the cassettes are structured "in layers of meaning and complexity. 
A 5-year-old loves the drama. Ages 6 or 7 and up will notice a particular 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
A third release, "Mozart's Magic Fantasy," due out in late January, takes yet 
another tack. It's "a wild romp through 'The Magic Flute,' " Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
Available on the Children's Group/BMG label at Tower Records, the Wherehouse 
and Children's Book and Music Center in Santa Monica. Cassette: $9.98. CD: 
$14.98.
