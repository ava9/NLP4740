ON THE RECORD: ASHKENAZY'S MOSTLY MOSCOW SESSIONS

On the same weekend last year that East Berliners were beginning literally to 
start chipping at the Wall, Vladimir Ashkenazy returned to his native Soviet 
Union for the first time in a quarter-century, along with London's Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he is music director. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion, rapturously received by the Moscow public and not at all bad for 
the Soviets' improving image in the West, offered first-class music-making -- 
perhaps Ashkenazy's finest accomplishments to date as a conductor, a calling in 
which he is a relative novice. 
</P>
<P>
The purported bulk of what was heard in the acoustically sumptuous Great Hall 
of the Moscow Conservatory on Nov. 11 and 12, 1989, is preserved on a pair of 
compact discs, issued in this country by MCA Classics (Vol. I, MCAD-6466; Vol. 
II, MCAD-10099). 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the broad-ranging repertory offered here disabuses at least one 
listener of the notion that hiring conductor Ashkenazy is the price one pays 
for getting pianist Ashkenazy. If the Moscow concerts are typical, one is 
fortunate to encounter him in either capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Volume I presents familiar fare: Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina" Prelude in the 
Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement, a sort of Moscow municipal anthem -- delicately, 
evocatively delivered; the Beethoven Third Piano Concerto directed from the 
keyboard; and the Second "Daphnis et Chloe" Suite by Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy is in characteristically cool, agile form as a Beethoven pianist 
while maintaining keenly balanced rapport with his responsive orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The RPO gives its virtuoso all in the Ravel, disdaining the final measure of 
heat and noise in the pursuit of textural clarity. A wise, winning decision. 
</P>
<P>
The real excitement, however, is in Volume II, an attractive program of 
20th-Century British music, dazzlingly executed. 
</P>
<P>
Three big works are offered, of which Walton's Second Symphony (1960) is 
particularly impressive. Ashkenazy does much to illuminate this undervalued 
score, which in its few previous recorded outings (live hearings are rare even 
in the U.K.) has tended to sound like a near-frantic attempt to recall the 
thrills of the composer's thunderous First Symphony, written a quarter-century 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy, presumably not steeped in Walton's music, brings a fresh, questing 
ear and eye to the later score. Without denying its more bombastic and 
melodramatic elements, he elicits clarity of line (which does not happen by 
itself) throughout and patiently exposes the dynamic subtleties and 
considerable lyric beauties of the slow movement. The orchestral execution is 
on the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Knussen's Third Symphony (1979) is brawny, snarly, showy, nervously 
fragmented stuff in which thematic ideas tumble out seemingly at will, pushing 
each other aside rather than being developed. The RPO and its enthusiastic 
conductor fully exploit the symphony's built-in wow factor, to the audible 
delight of the Moscow audience. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining work is Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings -- its 
fourth recording this year -- in an interpretation of extraordinary 
reflectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Martyn Hill's whitish, well-tuned tenor and immaculate diction (in his second 
recorded go at the work this year) are employed to excellent effect and the 
horn solo is executed with stunning aplomb by RPO principal Jeffrey Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while long on sensitivity Ashkenazy's interpretation does not 
consistently maintain momentum, bogging down rather severely in the closing 
portion of the first song and in the whole of the Dirge. 
</P>
<P>
But this didn't happen in Moscow. Reading some small, tucked- away print in 
MCA's notes verifies a listener's suspicions that the Britten -- in a wholly 
different acoustic, at a lower volume level and with no audience noise -- is a 
studio job. It was recorded, as it turns out, at Abbey Road three months after 
the Moscow concerts.
