For Tuesday's LPO concert Christoph von Dohnanyi chose a piquant programme:
Webern's temperate little Symphony op. 21 before Beethoven's first and
least-favoured piano concerto, the so-called 'Second', and then Schoenberg's
Five Orchestral Pieces, op. 16, as prelude to the Fourth Symphony of
Schumann. But for the Webern, it worked surprisingly well.
In Beethoven's B-flat Concerto, Emanuel Ax outdid himself. Operating in
something like the Schiff/Uchida mode - pearly and unforced, but digitally
super-articulate - he found chiaroscuro delights in even the most
surface-routine passages. None of that sounded imposed on the music; as
interpretation it was knowingly pawky but never arch, and always elegant. I
do not remember hearing the delicate humours of the piece so wittily spelt
out. Ax maintained the illusion of keeping the pianistic scale within period
limits, but after a notably subtle, tender Adagio he attacked the Rondo with
tingling brio.
Dohnanyi's orchestral accompaniment - for with such an engaging soloist,
that was what it became - was a model of alert tact and sweet reason. In the
Schoenberg pieces after the interval he gave full value to their far more
lurid palette, but also the most judicious attention to their harmonic
sense: strong confirmation of Schoenberg's claim, cited by Eric Mason in his
programme-notes, that there was 'a remorseless, if unconscious, logic in the
harmonic construction'.
Among the Five Pieces Dohnanyi realised 'Vergangenes', the second, with
lovely cogency, dovetailing its soft overlap of voices with a sure hand. He
did as much for the final 'Obbligato Recitative' too, revealing much more
intricate musical argument than we usually hear. The orchestral balance was
scrupulously gauged.
The Schoenberg tuned our ears very well for Dohnanyi's close-focus
examination of Schumann's 'Fourth'. Though it wasn't a particularly tender
reading - some other conductors make it sing more affectingly - it had
sterling dramatic proportions, and sovereign clarity. His main executive
feat was to render the freehand 'development' of the first movement entirely
compelling, not just a profusion of amiable ideas; but the darkling hues of
the Romanze were remarkable too, and the brusque cut-and-thrust of the
Scherzo, much steelier than mere bucolic fun.
For such a sharp-eared reading Schumann's leaner original orchestration,
without his second-guess doublings, would have been a further asset. It
pre-dated his 'Second' and 'Third' symphonies; this one counts as his
'Fourth' only because the revised version was made after them. There is
surely a musical case - as against musicological fussing about
'authenticity' - for retaining the tauter structure of the later version,
but trimming its adipose instrumental tissue back to the clean lines
Schumann first imagined.
