Offbeat and contemporary repertory is the particular province of the Bavarian 
Radio Symphony, Sir Colin Davis, told a reporter last week. "We have a very 
large repertory, but it is not the standard one," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ensemble from Munich, under Davis, played a standard program 
at its second appearance in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Tuesday night. The 
agenda: Brahms' Third Symphony and Beethoven's Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
After a strident, weirdly unfocused run-through of the opening Allegro, Davis 
and his Muncheners gave glowing, autumnal readings to the inner movements 
before making climactic noises in the finale. Despite moments of genuine 
musical cohesion, the impression this orchestra leaves is of provincial 
achievement. Certainly, many of the sounds emerging from brass and woodwinds do 
not meet an international standard. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's C-minor Symphony elicited a fine and successful ensemble effort. 
Davis' compelling musical perspective kept all elements in balance, contrasts 
between movements remained sharp, and the triumph of the conclusion had been 
thoroughly prepared. DANIEL CARIAGA
