THE European Community Youth Orchestra has been in existence for 14 years,
drawing its members from music colleges and conservatoires across the
community and coming together twice yearly for rehearsals and tours. Out of
its ranks have grown the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the Gustav Mahler
Jugendorchester, as well as a host of smaller groups.
From the beginning, the ECYO's standards have been astonishingly high, and
its roster of conductors matches that of any orchestra in the world  - from
Abbado (who was the first artistic director) and Karajan to Bernstein, Solti
and Haitink.
The current tour is shared between Carlo Maria Giulini and Mstislav
Rostropovich. Giulini conducted performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
in Switzerland and the Low Countries, while Rostropovich's concerts take him
from Luxembourg to Britain to Greece and back to France and Italy.
His two programmes consist of works by the composers with whom he has been
most closely associated as cellist and conductor, Britten, Prokofiev and
Shostakovich. The Britten is the War Requiem, which the ECYO brought to
Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Monday. The soloists were Makvala Kasrashvili,
Ian Caley and David Wilson-Johnson, with the London Symphony Chorus, the St
Michael's Singers and the boy choristers of Coventry Cathedral.
It was a bold, thrilling performance, full of grandeur and drama, starkly
characterised by Rostropovich. He concentrated his efforts entirely on the
chorus and main orchestra, recruiting Christopher Bell to direct the chamber
ensemble and male soloists.
There were a few problems of continuity; in the second half of the requiem,
always difficult to sustain after the fury of the Dies Irae has passed, the
performance had to ride some awkward gear changes. Invariably, Rostropovich
was able to raise the emotional temperature in the noisiest passages but
nevertheless the impression this time was of an artful patchwork, almost
formulaic in its use of the Wilfred Owen poems to undercut the blandishments
of the Latin mass. The very best versions of the War Requiem manage to
disguise that weakness entirely.
Ms Kasrashvili's wide vibrato and fearsome attack were well matched to
soprano lines conceived by Britten for the Slavonic timbre of Galina
Vishnevskaya, Rostropovich's wife. Caley's thin, reedy tenor was more
pleasing in duet than in the solo settings, but Wilson-Johnson was
magnificent, concentrating attention on every word, judging the nuances of
the text perfectly, wringing out their irony and anguish.
Both male soloists were placed well to the right of the Symphony Hall
platform, and revealed an unexpected directional bias in the acoustics: when
Wilson-Johnson in particular sang straight ahead his voice appeared blurred;
only when he turned slightly towards the centre did it snap into sharp
focus. Against that blemish however, must be set the wonderful handling of
the choral sound, absolutely distinct from triple piano to the loudest
forte, and the wealth of luminous detail in the orchestral textures.
* * * Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony was the main work in the ECYO's Prom
on Saturday, a serious, intense account which was a fine illustration of the
way in which Rostropovich's approach as a conductor has settled and matured.
It is not damning with faint praise to describe the Eleventh as the best of
Shostakovich's neglected symphonies; it was written to celebrate the events
of 1905 in St Petersburg when the Tsar's troops fired on unarmed
demonstrators, and no doubt its socialist realism has told against it in
some quarters. Leaving aside the programme, though, it stands as a coherent
symphonic structure in its own right - four hefty movements built around
fragments of political songs, with a grave funeral march at its core, and a
finale of urgent drama.
The ECYO conveyed it magnificently - the orchestra's brass section was
outstanding here and in the Britten - and provided the accompaniment for a
startling performance of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. The soloist was
Martha Argerich on her most electrifying form, defying the conductor and
orchestra to outdo her in vividness and attack. That they failed to meet the
challenge was no disgrace at all; this was playing of a quality that few
living pianists could approach in this work.
