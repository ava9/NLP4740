A PLACE FOR BEETHOVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 25 years ago when the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra moved to the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from its old hall at Fifth and Olive, it left behind 
in the north end of adjacent Pershing Square the statue of Ludwig van 
Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Sculpted by A. Foerster and dedicated to William Andrews Clark Jr., founder of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it was erected by the personnel of the orchestra 
and presented to the people of Los Angeles in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
The statue of this most famous and respected composer deserves a place of 
honor, not in a square named for a military general but rather at the Los 
Angeles County Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Philharmonic will move into the Walt Disney Hall, to be constructed in 
the Music Center complex. Surely the Disney Hall committee will now seize the 
opportunity to relocate the Beethoven statue to the grounds of the facility.
