Speech is coming to the personal computer. After more than a decade of being
unable to produce anything more than a bong or boom to accompany computer
games, full-blown stereo sound, speech and a wide variety of sound effects
are now being included with the modern PC.
Compaq Computer is the latest PC manufacturer to join the 'sound' trend,
with the launch of its 'Business Audio' feature - building a microphone and
sound technology into a number of its new desktop PCs.
According to Compaq chairman Ben Rosen, the audio capabilities were a way of
'adding customer benefit at no extra cost'.
Compaq's idea was by no means original. Apple, NeXT and several other
non-PC-compatible computer manufacturers have offered microphones and sound
capabilities on their systems for several years and hundreds of local
'store-brand' PCs have for some months been offered with third-party sound
add-ons and CD-Rom players in special 'multimedia bundles'.
Still the question remains whether people can be convinced of the value of
this technology.
Proponents of PC sound claim that a direct, spoken comment is more powerful
and more personal than a typed text message on-screen - and that if you can
incorporate spoken comments into your desktop presentations, spreadsheet
models and word-processed documents, they will be more effective in getting
your message across.
As with many such innovations, the first big manufacturer to offer this
capability in full was Apple Computer, which included a microphone and
built-in sound capabilities with the systems it introduced in October 1990.
Since then, sound has become a natural partner to many Apple Macintosh
applications - particularly when used with CD-Rom digital storage technology
(based on CD audio technology and offering the ability to play CD audio
disks as well as specialised multimedia CD-Rom software).
Sound is also an integral part of multimedia applications - which mix sound,
graphics, text and on-screen animation together using sound in partnership
with CD-Rom technology. Sound add-ons are often sold with CD-Rom systems as
part of a complete multimedia upgrade kit - which in the US typically sells
for less than Dollars 800 (Pounds 400).
Given that CD-Rom storage systems can store more than 10 times the amount of
information held on the average PC hard disk - and that this is all
contained on a slim, inexpensive, removable plastic disk - the medium is
ideal for producing computer-based educational and reference materials. That
is why encyclopedias, several world atlases, dictionaries, children's books
and even film guides are now being offered on CD-Rom.
Microsoft, for example, offers a CD-Rom application about composer Ludwig
van Beethoven. Not only does it offer on-screen representations of Beethoven
scores, pictures of the composer and scenes from his life - but also many
digital recordings of his classic works that can be played in full stereo
from the computer. There is also a spoken 'narration' that is offered
throughout this guide.
While all these applications are interesting, at the moment they are hardly
mainstream business requirements. That is why hardware companies such as
Compaq and Apple - and software firms like Microsoft and Lotus Development -
are trying so hard to sell users on the idea of business audio.
Rosen says he is optimistic about it. 'As people start annotating documents
with audio, it will really catch on,' he predicts, although he admits that
you cannot force a technology on people who see no use for it. 'You can
produce the dog food, but you have to get the dogs to eat it,' he concludes.
