<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society had the good fortune to host the 
Southland debut Saturday of the hugely successful, controversial London 
Classical Players under conductor Roger Norrington. 
</P>
<P>
Norrington &amp; Co. are part of a movement dedicated to respecting long-dead 
composers' presumed intentions by scraping obfuscating interpretive overlay 
from their scores. 
</P>
<P>
With this particular ensemble, there is a difference: Its hackle-raising 
specialty is taking popular 19th-Century repertory -- on Saturday by Beethoven, 
Schubert and Mendelssohn -- rather than the relative esoterica of the Baroque 
and Classical eras and subjecting it to thorough cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
Apparent in the welcoming acoustics of the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
was that the Classical Players' sound is less alien live than on recordings. 
Such on-disc elements as the overbearing shotgun blasts of the old timpani, 
played with hard sticks, retain their impact in the hall but are better 
integrated with the ensemble, while the gut strings sound less pinched, more 
sweetly plaintive and the brass less raucous. 
</P>
<P>
Balances are just, but instrumental choirs retain their individual timbres and 
the light-toned solo winds sound clearly in Norrington's well-thought-out 
seating arrangement: horns and trumpets (valve-less, of course) on opposite 
edges of the stage, basses divided in half over a similar span, winds at top 
center, first violins to his left, seconds to his right. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of orchestral detail heard in Mendelssohn's once-familiar-in-concert 
and, as was proven Saturday, still-ravishing "Scottish" Symphony was startling. 
Here, too, Norrington blasted the canard that he is a compulsive speedster. The 
slow movement sang gently, elegantly, the vibrato-less strings' quick attack 
and release maintaining the lyric line where usually their sound hangs 
endlessly in the air, obscuring pitch and impeding momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Other memorable ingredients in the Mendelssohn: Lisa Beznosiuk's firm and 
gentle flute solos, Colin Lawson's piercing, bucolic clarinet, and the assured 
blatting of the horns in the spectacular crescendo that Norrington -- and 
Mendelssohn -- built for the gathering-of-the-clans finale. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Norrington and his crew fleetly dispatched Schubert's Fourth Symphony 
("Tragic"), attentive not to the Romantic images conjured up by the nickname or 
imagined Beethoven associations, but rather to the outer movements' ancestry in 
Sturm und Drang Haydn. 
</P>
<P>
To these ears, the program-opening "Egmont" Overture of Beethoven sounded too 
determinedly un-monumental, as if to deny Beethoven any connection with 
Romanticism. However, the encore, Beethoven's dashing "Prometheus" Overture, 
was a rollicking, spirited delight.
