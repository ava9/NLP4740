Franz Welser-Most conducted the LPO in a curious programme last night:
Dvorak's little-played The Golden Spinning Wheel and his compatriot
Martinu's Fifth Symphony, and between them a very black-and-white
performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto no. 3. There was nevertheless a
well-filled house - perhaps because the pianist was Piotr Anderszewski, the
young Pole who beat a sensational retreat from the 1990 Leeds Competition.
That was during his recital in the semi-finals, when after delivering
Beethoven's gigantic 'Diabelli' Variations with with an intellectual control
and authority far beyond his years, he faltered in Webern's brief Variations
and abruptly left the platform, never to return. This time his Beethoven was
not so remarkable - except for definiteness of intention, which was striking
enough; but Anderszewski's intentions were plain and austere, in a work
which invites more generous and indeed Romantic responses.
This was a tight, narrow-gauge reading. Every note penetrated clearly, so
that when he missed one - just a couple of times - it was unmissable. What
he meant for every section was unmissable too; but stark black-and-white
contrasts do not necessarily generate drama, and they leave scant room for
nuances.
Surely the C minor concerto presupposes some personal input from its
performer, some effect of a piano with an individual voice. Treating it with
the detached reverence that can illuminate the huge 'Diabelli' structure
rather diminished it: one admired the thoughtful planning, but longed for
some vital stamp of character to enliven it.
One of Dvorak's most inventive orchestral studies, The Golden Spinning Wheel
was pleasant to hear - particularly with Anthony Burton's detailed matching
of folk-tale with music in the programme book. I hadn't known that the
scenario was so specific. None the less, the piece lacks the symphonic
drawing-of-threads-together that would make it memorable. Much the same is
true of Martinu's Fifth Symphony, composed just after the Second War.
As artfully conducted by Welser-Most, and delivered with bright verve by the
LPO, it too fell attractively upon the ear. In (one of) Martinu's standard
manners, the triple woodwinds crackled and warbled high; most of the music
kept up a motorised canter, kicked lightly along by percussion; from time to
time there were svelte paragraphs with broadish tunes and cosmopolitan
between-the-wars airs.
As often with Martinu, it was utterly unclear what it should add up to: it
chattered engagingly for just under a half-hour, with 'symphonic' patterns
of development and reprise, and then stopped. Where it had arrived, if
anywhere, remained a mystery.
