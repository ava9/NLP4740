Was there just a hint of guilt in the splendid performance the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic gave Thursday night, when music director Andre Previn returned to 
the podium at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center? 
</P>
<P>
Like a guilty spouse who has had a little fling while the marriage partner was 
out of town, our Philharmonic seemed on terribly good behavior at this reunion 
with its recently absent leader. 
</P>
<P>
Was that merely because the players were happy to see Previn back at the 
podium? Or was it an afterglow from the carryings-on with a guest conductor for 
the past two weeks? Will we ever know? 
</P>
<P>
The program that Previn is conducting this week (ending Sunday afternoon) is a 
bread-and-butter agenda, beginning with Beethoven's Overture to "Fidelio" and 
First Piano Concerto and culminating in Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
What made it special at this performance was the solidity and jauntiness in the 
music director's bracing approach to Beethoven and the clear conviction he 
brought to the manic-depressiveness of the "Pathetique" Symphony. And the 
orchestra's willingness to give Previn near-complete cooperation in bringing 
these scores to life. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the turgid textures in Tchaikovsky's emotional Sixth emerged 
clarified, or transparent. But the sweep of feeling, and many of the 
corroborative instrumental details, held it all together, even with occasional 
blatting of tone in the climaxes. And the lush string sounds one wants and 
expects at the lyric heights of the work materialized handsomely and 
eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the 35th anniversary of her Philharmonic debut, Alicia de Larrocha 
gave as well-spoken and elegant a reading of Beethoven's C-major Concerto as 
one might ever wish to hear. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish musician -- who made her first United States appearances here in 
February, 1954, with then-music director Alfred Wallenstein and the 
Philharmonic -- continues to serve as a role model for thinking pianists who 
believe in the power of the instrument to produce myriad shades of color and 
specific qualities of tone. She is as much an inspiration today as she was at 
that long-ago but well-remembered series of debut appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Previn and the orchestra provided stylish and attentive support, particularly 
in a generously laid-out and richly songful slow movement.
