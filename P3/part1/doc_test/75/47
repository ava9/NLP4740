CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In calling for the abolition of the NEA, Meese and Fein ask if there are any 
NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Beethoven met with the same sort of Philistinism that faces many of today's 
adventurous artists. The players to whom he took his string quartet, Op. 59. 
No. 1, thought he was playing a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely you do not consider these works to be music?" asked Muzio Clementi. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not for you, but for a later age," replied the composer. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for us music lovers, Meese and Fein weren't around then, or symphony 
programs today might consist of Hummel and Salieri instead of Beethoven and 
Mozart.
