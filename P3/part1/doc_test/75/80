A living room set and artwork that graced Ludwig von Beethoven's salon goes on 
the auction block in Paris next week. Dorotheum of Vienna and French auctioneer 
Jacques Tajan are collaborating on a next-Monday-through-March-7 sale of 19th- 
and 20th-Century Austrian art objects, including paintings, drawings and 
etchings by masters Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. The 
furniture set, which is estimated to sell for at least $10,000, was owned by 
Beethoven until his death in 1827 and was part of his estate. Shauna Snow
