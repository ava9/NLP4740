Sometimes the best things come in less conspicuous packages. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at McGaugh School Auditorium in Seal Beach, Alan Parker 
conducted the 29-member Haydn Orchestra in an ambitious program that consisted 
of Beethoven's light-in-character but difficult-to-perform Symphony No. 8, 
Mozart's boyish but virtuosic Violin Concerto No. 5, and a popular short 
opener, Rossini's "L'Italiana in Algeri" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
And for this penultimate concert of the 15th annual Seal Beach Chamber Music 
Festival, it was the modest Rossini overture that shone above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The winds supplied crisp articulation, the strings phrased each passage with 
lucidity, and Parker led with careful attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the players revealed his or her expertise with confidence and 
extraordinary control, resulting in a clean, satisfying performance. During the 
Beethoven, the ensemble bravely met the challenges presented by the many 
intricacies and eccentricities of the score. In taking all the repeats, Parker 
managed to make the pace fresh and vital. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it was a successful performance, but there were a few scattered lapses 
in focus that led to shortcomings in accuracy. There also was less brio than is 
usually associated with the piece, although the ensemble's gentler approach 
worked nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium demonstrated its unflattering dryness throughout. This problem 
didn't faze the players, which is all the more to their credit, as a chamber 
orchestra playing a Beethoven symphony offers an easy opportunity to expose any 
untidiness. 
</P>
<P>
Concertmaster Jean Hugo was soloist for the Mozart. Her performance, if a bit 
stiff at times (perhaps because of nervousness) was nonetheless engaging.
