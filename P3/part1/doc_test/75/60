The challenges of presenting a monument such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are 
legion. Too much reverence may induce somnolence, but a jaunty approach risks 
reducing lofty aspirations to catchy jingles. Even in its own era, the "Choral" 
Symphony's naive, homely themes invited critical derision as mere back alley 
tunes. It takes a seasoned hand to shape this mighty, sprawling work and probe 
the depth of the composer's vision. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the San Diego Symphony secured the services of Robert Shaw to 
conduct the local orchestra and San Diego Master Chorale in the Ninth. Still 
effervescent and curious as he approaches his 72nd year, Shaw brought the best 
of both worlds to his conducting. The Atlanta Symphony's conductor laureate 
displayed the vigor of a youthful spirit and the security of a mature 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Symphony Hall the Shaw trademarks were evident in abundance: 
crisp diction from the chorus and precise rhythmic inflection from both singers 
and instrumentalists; brisk but not breakneck tempos, and a broad palette of 
finely-tuned dynamic levels. Most rewarding to the listener was the dramatic 
tension he built from the opening phrase of every movement, which he carefully 
tended and sustained through the widest arches of the composer's architecture. 
He conducted as if no motif were superfluous and every idea had a unique 
calling in the ultimate scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If such analyses appear unduly fussy, it is only because the level of 
conducting practiced on this orchestra's podium over the last two seasons 
leaves so much to be desired from the twin perspectives of technique and 
inspiration. Guest conductors routinely drive through scores on auto pilot, or 
engage in displays of cute choreography that add nothing to the music but 
visual distraction. Shaw's solid stance and clean-cut motions put the prancers 
and dancers to shame. 
</P>
<P>
It was a great night for the Master Chorale, which sounded fresh and 
enthusiastic after sitting through the lengthy opening movements. Slightly 
augmented with additional voices for this concert, the chorale gave the maestro 
the lithe, disciplined sound he asked for. Their German was more than 
recognizable, but their timbre lacked richness and they did not muster a 
thrilling forte. But they have room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the orchestra put its best foot forward for Shaw. Execution of those 
delicate little fugues for strings, especially in the second movement, exposed 
those sections' lack of precision and nervous entrances. Surprisingly, the 
usually reliable cellos fell short of tonal perfection in their solos at the 
opening of the finale. However, the orchestra's solid ensemble and well-focused 
energy left an overriding positive impression. 
</P>
<P>
Among the quartet of vocal soloists, bass-baritone Terry Cook's stentorian 
lyricism and soprano Lorna Haywood's luminous, arched phrases made solid 
impressions. Tenor Jon Garrison sounded a trifle forced, and mezzo Shirley Love 
seemed unduly buried by the other voices, although the entire quartet was 
placed at the far side of the stage -- hardly a favorable position from which 
to sing over the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw opened the evening with the overture from Bach's Third Orchestral Suite. 
Oddly, he reduced the number of players for the Bach, then urged them to push 
out more volume. This notion was not successful; it only made the Baroque work 
sound tense and distorted. For the Beethoven it was an unnecessary prelude.
