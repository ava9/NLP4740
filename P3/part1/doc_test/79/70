Assassins firing submachine guns from a moving car Friday killed the new 
government's most senior Cabinet minister and two bodyguards as they drove from 
the minister's home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces and leaders of the governing right-wing Republican Nationalist 
Alliance blamed leftist guerrillas who have pledged to make the country 
ungovernable. Rebels did not immediately claim responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, 73, who was minister of the presidency and 
President Alfredo Cristiani's closest adviser, died shortly after arriving at 
Zaldivar Hospital, a nurse said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the bodyguards, one of whom was driving the bulletproof 
car, died at the scene. Machinegun fire can penetrate so-called bulletproof 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Walker called it "a truly lamentable and senseless 
event." 
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously appalled by this act of mindless terror; shocked that anyone 
would attempt to project their political will by gunning down, in cold 
premeditated blood, a 73-year-old man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive "fits the pattern of other recent terrorist attacks and killings," 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Party President Armando Calderon Sol said the minister was ambushed just after 
leaving his home in a western neighborhood of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, however, said four men traveling in a red vehicle fired in front of 
Rodriguez's house before the car was started. They said they heard five or six 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was the first Cabinet member killed in the nine-year guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was the first on an official of the party, known as Arena, since 
Cristiani took office June 1. It was the fourth attack on party officials this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas recently offered to halt 
attacks if the new government eliminated death squads. The proposal was 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson, an Arena 
legislator who has been linked to the squads that killed thousands of suspected 
leftists in the early 1980s. He denies the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Sigifrido Ochoa, another Arena leader, called for action against the 
slayers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confronting brazen terrorism, commanders and communists," he said. "We 
either let ourselves be killed like cowardly rats, or we organize to defend the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon Sol told reporters: "A man who defended law and justice has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, also a founding member of the party, was a vice minister in the 
1940s, a member of the civilian-military junta in 1961 and foreign minister in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
His assassination came on the third day of a new guerrilla campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, rebels bombed a gasoline station in the capital and attacked 
troops in central and eastern El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, they attacked nine military posts and the army said 21 rebels 
and three soldiers died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cristiani Initiative Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The intensified fighting follows the guerrillas' rejection of Cristiani's 
proposal for dialogue. An estimated 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been 
killed in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Chile, a former air force officer who allegedly led a death squad 
that killed more than a dozen opponents of the military government was 
assassinated Friday outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination came as President Augusto Pinochet proposed an amnesty for 
people accused of human rights violations after the September, 1973, coup that 
brought the strong-arm general to power. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said Roberto Fuentes Morrison died instantly after being hit 
several times by automatic gunfire from five assailants who fled the scene in a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes Morrison was accused in 1984 by an air force deserter of directing the 
"Joint Command," a death squad that took part in widespread oppression against 
the left during 1975 and 1976.
