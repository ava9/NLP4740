Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, identifies with 
Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say he has committed any murders in Scotland, or that he has his 
eyes on a throne. But "Macbeth," which McAnuff directs for a Sunday-night 
opening at the Mandell Weiss Theatre, is, by his own admission, one of his 
favorite plays. He has been reading and rereading it since he was 11, when he 
was introduced to the story via a Classic comic book. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, I remember the pose of Macduff standing with his foot over the 
body of Macbeth," McAnuff recalled outside the Mandell Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
He can't say why he has been drawn to that play ever since, but, like a gem 
that turns to show its different facets, it has presented more sides to explore 
as he himself has grown, McAnuff said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I directed it, I thought of it as a transition from pre-feudal 
to feudal society," he said. "I was also interested in the whole notion of what 
happens to a country when assassinations are unraveling a society. I grew up in 
the '60s, when the Kennedy assassinations hit close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose, at 37, you have a slightly different reaction than you did at 29. 
This is a play about two people who love each other profoundly. I think the 
difference is that I feel more for the couple." 
</P>
<P>
Six years between productions of "Macbeth" have seen much ground covered for 
McAnuff professionally as well. 
</P>
<P>
He first directed it for the Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare Festival in 1983, 
just before he moved to San Diego to take over the artistic helm at the 
playhouse. In the ensuing seven seasons, he has directed two playhouse shows on 
Broadway: "A Walk in the Woods" and "Big River," for which he won a Tony for 
best director of a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the La Jolla Playhouse has become one of the country's 
leading regional theaters. Since 1986, however, it has also been accumulating a 
deficit, leading to a recent public declaration that it will cancel its 1990 
season if it can't raise $500,000 by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff and the theater's business manager, Alan Levey, say the financial 
problems are due in large part to the difficulty in sharing theater space 
during the school year with UC San Diego. The arrangement means the playhouse 
has the shortest season and fewest seats per season of any League of Resident 
Theaters in its category. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem arises in doing shows at the Mandell Weiss and the smaller 
Warren Theatre, also at UCSD. The playhouse can sell only enough season tickets 
to fill the 248-seat Warren but some of the plays in the season will be shown 
at the 492-seat Mandell Weiss. That means the playhouse must rely on separate 
sales to fill shows at the larger venue. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is suggesting that the reception of "Macbeth" will make or 
break the playhouse's fund-raising drive, this couldn't be a better time for 
the theater to have a hit on its hands. "Macbeth," the final show for the 1989 
season, extends the playhouse season into November for the first time -- giving 
the theater a chance to show that San Diego audiences will support the 
playhouse as more than a summer theater. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, this may be the first time since 1986 in which the playhouse 
ends the season in the black and reduces its standing deficit. That, according 
to Levey, would be "a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, McAnuff does not want to talk about budgets, which he said 
will not affect his plans for "Macbeth." The budget for the show was set at the 
beginning of the season, so it will be performed, as planned, by 26 actors in 
the era it was written for, 11th-Century Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff just wants to talk about "Macbeth" the play, and about relationships 
that last, including his marriage to actress Susan Berman. They two have no 
children, and he said that gives him some insight into the Macbeths. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a play about two people who love each other profoundly and don't have 
a child. If you don't have a child, then the career of one of those people 
becomes the child. In 'Macbeth,' it drives them to actual murder." 
</P>
<P>
Long-term relationships with professional associates are also important to 
McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
John Vickery, who stars as Macbeth, was first hired by McAnuff to play the lead 
in his play "The Death of Von Richthofen as Witnessed From Earth" in 1980. 
Vickery had to dye his dark hair blonde for that one. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McAnuff has directed him in "Henry IV, Part 1" at the Delacorte 
Theatre in New York, and Vickery has starred in four La Jolla Playhouse 
productions: "A Mad World, My Masters," "Romeo and Juliet," "A Man's a Man" and 
"The Sea Gull." 
</P>
<P>
Both McAnuff and Vickery appreciate the shorthand in communication that comes 
from working with someone for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a relationship, it helps because you have a lot to do in five 
weeks," McAnuff said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Vickery: "Over the years, we've had several conversations which go, 'I 
think,' 'You know,' 'I know what you mean.' " 
</P>
<P>
Both men reject the theatrical notion that "Macbeth" is an unlucky play. The 
work, often referred to as "the Scottish play" by skittish actors, is supposed 
to bring bad luck to those who use what is called the "M" word in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Vickery, who comes from Scottish ancestry, has no problem with saying the word 
Macbeth in his dressing room, and has a theory on why others do. He figures 
that, because of all the sword play in "Macbeth," actors tend to get hurt and 
so they associate the work with bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
But the playhouse is definitely looking to "Macbeth" as a potential source of 
good luck. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the special agreement that allows it to use the Mandell Weiss during 
the school year, the playhouse will be using seven acting students, three 
designers, two assistant directors and a production assistant from UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Students will not only be on stage, but in the theater seats. The playhouse is 
finding a new audience in the UCSD and San Diego State University students 
whose classes are, for the first time, in full session during the playhouse 
season, Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that it is a good time of year to be operating because the 
schools are fully operational," he said. "We see October and November as prime 
months to be marketing theater. We've seen a strong response from the student 
body in terms of sales of student-priced tickets." 
</P>
<P>
If sales and support, in the form of contributed income, result in the 
playhouse producing at this time next year, this may be the first "Macbeth" in 
history with a happy ending.
