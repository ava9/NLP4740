Sousa marches and patriotic medleys are as requisite to a Fourth of July pops 
program as potato salad and cold fried chicken are to the traditional holiday 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Hospitality Point, guest conductor Carl Hermanns and the San 
Diego Symphony pops orchestra did not flout tradition: The unmistakable martial 
cadences of Sousa surrounded a parade of flag-waving odes, ably assisted by the 
120 massed voices of San Diego's Sweet Adelines vocal ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
For those ears too jaded to respond to Sousa's "El Capitan" and "Washington 
Post" marches or to the time-worn Peter J. Wilhousky arrangement of the "Battle 
Hymn of the Republic," Hermanns programmed Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait" 
and Herbert L. Clarke's "Bride of the Waves," transcribed for euphonium. 
</P>
<P>
In his usual chatty way, Hermanns described the euphonium as a kind of "baby 
tuba." 
</P>
<P>
Although the "Lincoln Portrait" is not exactly obscure, it is no pops staple. 
</P>
<P>
From the subdued opening to its brassy finale, Hermanns pressed the piece 
forward with a steady hand, and the players responded with their cleanest 
playing of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's narrator for the 3,167 concert-goers was City Councilman Bruce 
Henderson, who earnestly intoned the bold, awkwardly chiseled words of Abraham 
Lincoln expounding the need for national resolve to eradicate the evils of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
This aptly nationalistic program runs through Saturday, and, each evening, a 
different local politician assumes the narrator's role. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Buchman, the orchestra's principal trombone, performed the euphonium 
solo in "Bride of the Waves," a novel idea that no doubt looked better on paper 
than it sounded in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Although Buchman coaxed a sweet, mellow sound from the valved instrument that 
gently gurgles in the tenor range, she could not make it spring through the 
agile figuration of the piece, which was of course intended for the cornet, 
Clarke's own instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the conductor's difficulty in keeping soloist and orchestra 
together through the quick transitions of this variation cycle, the quaint 
period piece fizzled like a damp firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
Director Kim Hulbert's energetic Sweet Adelines sounded best in their 
unaccompanied songs, especially a snappy arrangement of Cy Coleman and Michael 
Stewart's upbeat "Come Follow the Band." 
</P>
<P>
Although the well-disciplined chorus projected the characteristic sonority of 
women's barbershop harmony -- an intensely bright and shallow sound -- this 
writer agrees with the wag who labeled it "cruel and not sufficiently unusual 
punishment."
