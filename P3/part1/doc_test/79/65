A car bomb was exploded by remote control as the spiritual leader of Lebanon's 
Sunni Muslims drove by Tuesday, killing him and 21 other people, police said. 
Seventy-five others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Muslim West Beirut occurred as Arab League mediators were 
trying to consolidate a cease-fire in the latest round of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Hassan Khaled was a leading voice for moderation in a country devastated 
by 14 years of sectarian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Both Christians and Muslims denounced the assassination. There was no claim of 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Khaled was being driven home from his office for lunch when the 
bomb went off in a crowded residential district. Reporters at the scene said 
the explosion destroyed the fronts of buildings at a major road intersection, 
setting nearby cars on fire. 
</P>
<P>
The blast also shattered windows in the residence of Premier Salim Hoss, the 
head of one of Lebanon's rival Cabinets, 100 yards from the scene. It was not 
clear who or what was the target of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers had to break the doors of Khaled's smashed black limousine to remove 
his body and those of his driver, his brother-in-law and an unidentified 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our beloved Mufti is murdered!" a police officer screamed through tears as he 
took the blood-stained white turban of the Grand Mufti from the crumpled car. 
Among others killed nearby were four bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
"The assassin, or assassins, used a remote control device to detonate the car 
bomb, which was rigged with more than 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of TNT," a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United 
States was "revolted by the cold-blooded killing" and described Khaled as "a 
selfless leader." 
</P>
<P>
Khaled, 68, was spiritual leader of Lebanon's 900,000 Sunni Muslims and was the 
nation's highest-ranking Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
He guided the economically powerful, minority Sunni sect into advocating 
coexistence with Christians and shunning a fighting role in the sectarian war. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's majority Shiite Muslims are believed to hold most of the foreigners 
missing in Lebanon. Sunnis are not believed to be involved in hostage-taking. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in the southern port of Sidon said two West German relief 
workers were apparently kidnaped for the third time. They last disappeared for 
several hours 12 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gunmen stopped Heinrich Struebig, 48, and Petra Schnitzler, 26, and a third 
West German, who was not identified, between their office and the Miye ou Miye 
refugee camp, police said. Schnitzler was later released, but she declined to 
give details about the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the latest seizure, but it came as a West 
German court prepared to pass judgment on Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese 
Shiite Muslim accused of murdering an American passenger during the hijacking 
of a TWA airliner in 1985.
