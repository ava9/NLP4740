Arrested: Steve Gobie, the former paid lover of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), 
was arrested in Washington on charges of marijuana possession and destruction 
of property, police said Thursday. The charges stemmed from an incident 
Wednesday in which Gobie confronted an off-duty female police officer who was 
driving her personal car. The officer said Gobie was driving erratically and 
later jumped on the roof of her car. Frank admitted that he in the past paid 
Gobie for sexual favors.

Grave Dispute: According to historical letters released Wednesday in 
Springfield, Ill., Abraham Lincoln was almost buried in Washington, D.C. rather 
than Illinois. Mary Todd Lincoln was prepared to move the President's remains 
to the nation's capital if Gov. Richard Oglesby insisted on the President being 
interred several miles from Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, where Lincoln is 
in fact buried. "They began to build a vault . . . before Mrs. Lincoln finally 
convinced them Oak Ridge was the place where she wanted the body to be," said a 
spokesman for the state's historical agency.
