Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Monday that he intends to launch "a 
far-reaching, two-pronged civil and criminal investigation" into troubled 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to move ahead with a full-fledged investigation follows several 
months of congressional and legislative hearings into the events that led to a 
federal takeover of Lincoln last April following the collapse of the S&amp;L's 
parent company, American Continental Corp. Salvaging the Irvine-based Lincoln 
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion -- making it the most expensive 
S&amp;L bailout in history. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Van de Kamp was asked by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) to investigate Lincoln. But the attorney general hesitated, citing 
a conflict between his role as the state's top prosecutor and his job as 
attorney for the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp described the conflict "as a delicate matter because of legal 
barriers against taking actions counter to a clients' interests." On the one 
hand, he has an obligation to prosecute possible government wrongdoers. But he 
may also have to defend the actions of the same individuals in a suit filed 
against the state and others by more than 22,000 customers of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Those customers -- many of them Southern California retirees -- bought an 
estimated $250 million in American Continental bonds through the S&amp;L's 
branches. When the company entered bankruptcy proceedings, the bonds became 
virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
"My office is representing the California Department of Savings and Loan and 
the Department of Corporations in civil litigation where the state Treasury 
faces a potential liability of a quarter of a billion dollars," Van de Kamp 
said two weeks ago. At the same time, he noted that he had begun a criminal 
investigation into allegations that unlicensed employees of Lincoln had sold 
the bonds in violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Peterson, a spokesman for Van de Kamp, said the attorney general will 
spell out the details of his investigation at a press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that it took "lots of legal research and some innovative 
thinking" to resolve Van de Kamp's conflict-of-interest problem but that the 
issue had been resolved.
