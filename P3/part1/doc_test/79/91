Several years ago I escorted a group of American college students to an 
interview with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. The Speaker's 
schedule dictated that the meeting take place in the ornate dressing room where 
he was being enrobed before assuming his place on the dais that dominates the 
debating well between the tiered House benches. Arriving a bit late, we saw the 
back of a tall figure already mantled in a black gown. Attendants fluttered 
about him, draping various accouterments on his lanky frame. 
</P>
<P>
As he turned to greet us, an almost undetectable flicker of surprise ruffled 
his dignified composure. Then he surveyed the assemblage of young Americans, 
wearing shorts, T-shirts, sandals and baseball caps, being ushered into the 
vestment chamber of the Speaker of the Mother of Parliaments, and he proceeded 
to deliver a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
The lecture was not about dress standards -- though I've always suspected it 
was the students' attire that prompted it. It was about taking things for 
granted. More particularly, it was about taking freedom for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have died for your freedom," he said in his booming Welsh baritone. The 
students looked as if they had just been slapped with a wet towel. Did real 
people talk like that? They had heard that sort of thing only in movies -- 
mostly black-and-white movies, the boring kind. What odd and sentimental folk 
these Brits were! 
</P>
<P>
Americans have had many occasions in recent months to witness this unsettling 
foreign tendency to speak with unabashed reverence about things like freedom 
and democracy. What's more, foreigners have adopted the discomforting habit of 
invoking our national icons and quoting our historic heroes in defense of 
liberty. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia and Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki of Poland display easy familiarity with Thomas Jefferson; Lech 
Walesa as well as Soviet reformers and Romanian rebels cite Abraham Lincoln; 
Nelson Mandela lays a wreath at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., and, in the 
most dramatic cultural expropriation of all, Chinese students in Tian An Men 
Square parade a replica of Lady Liberty -- herself a gift to the United States 
from the people of France. 
</P>
<P>
Surely we are all proud that our national symbols, and the values for which 
they stand, are honored by other peoples. But many Americans also find the 
practice rather quaint, a kind of unsophisticated incantation by simple-minded 
foreigners who know our history only superficially and therefore have not yet 
acquired our worldly attitudes of iconoclasm and, especially, hero-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors may gaze on the statuary in the Capitol and see the emblems of 
elemental political forces and powerful cultural values; we see some enmarbled 
guys -- and a few women -- whose latter-day handlers managed to pull off a neat 
media stunt that got them turned into permanent tourist attractions. We know 
that all those characters pulled their trousers on one leg at a time, that they 
had their full quota of human frailties, that there are no giants on the earth. 
Familiarity may not breed contempt, but it surely demystifies. We are too well 
acquainted with our historical selves to be awed. Perhaps our self-knowledge 
has robbed us of the capacity to be inspired. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in an arresting inversion of the behavior that finds our own prophets 
more honored in other lands, we have recently poured our own adulation 
unrestrainedly over two visitors from abroad: Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mandela. 
Gorbachev's visit to Stanford University in June elicited the kind of frenzied 
adoration once tendered only by mobs of pubescent women to rock megastars. In a 
great university committed to cultivating the domain of reason, all classes 
were canceled and throngs of jostling, shouting, waving people surged behind 
the police barricades, aching for a glimpse of the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller but no less passionate crowds greeted Mandela wherever he appeared. No 
imaginable American political figure could command such displays of affection 
and enthusiasm. Indeed, public figures from Jesse Jackson to George Deukmejian 
clamored to get in the same camera-frame with Mandela and Gorbachev, just to 
bask in their reflected glory. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Americans are justifiably enthused about Gorbachev's attempt to reshape 
Soviet society, and Mandela's struggle to bring racial justice to South Africa. 
But why are we so passive and jaded about appeals to modernize our own rickety 
social infrastructure, or rutted streets and crowded schools? Why are we 
increasingly so cantankerous and confrontational about our own racial problems? 
Why so intent on demythologizing all our national heroes, so fiercely resistant 
to affording to any living American the claim to be able to inspire us? 
</P>
<P>
Just as we find the world's excitement about our political values to be a kind 
of flattering curiosity, so do we seem more willing to cheer political change 
at a distance than close at hand, more apt to lionize the visitors, not the 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Partly, one supposes, we cheer Havel and Gorbachev and 
Mandela with abandon because we are emotionally invested exclusively in their 
success. It won't be for us to suffer the disemployment and inflation and 
uncertainty and, quite possibly, the violence that will in all likelihood 
attend their various struggles to transform their countries. For us, their 
efforts will be gain without pain. At home, in contrast, we sense the real 
discomfort that change must entail -- higher taxes; ragged, tiring 
argumentation; close, demanding inter-racial dialogue and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
This much history we do know: However attractive democracy might be in the 
abstract, it has proved a messy and painful business in practice. And that's 
why we need periodically to re-trim the vessel that is carrying us on our 
national journey. The sober idealism of Jefferson and Lincoln and King is 
weighty ballast for the ship of state, both in stormy seas and in periods, like 
the present, of sullen calm. We need their visionary captaincy now as much as 
ever. Those struggling to launch democracies know this, and we who should be 
trying to stay the course shouldn't forget it. This is one thing that cannot be 
taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
As that black-gowned Welshman said to my students, some things are worth dying 
for. We may not be called upon to do the actual dying, but if we don't reckon 
democracy that kind of value, democracy itself surely will.
