  [Text] AL-SHA'B has learned that Israel has prepared a plan 
to assassinate Hamas leaders in response to the hostile 
operations Hamas mujahidin have carried out inside the occupied 
territories that have killed and wounded scores of Israelis 
during the past two weeks. 
  The Israeli security services, military intelligence, and 
Mosad last week approved the final plan, which consists of 
several phases. The first phase envisages the assassination of 
200 Hamas leaders while the second phase envisages the 
assassination of 400 leaders. The assassination operations will 
target Hamas leaders in Britain, Jordan, Sudan, Lebanon and 
other countries. New methods will be used in these operations. 
  The Israeli military intelligence service has agreed to 
finance a number of Jewish terrorist organizations that will 
carry out these operations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved the plan. 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry has asked its embassies abroad to 
gather the necessary information to carry out the 
assassinations. The Israeli Embassy in Cairo has been asked to 
gather information on the movements of Hamas leaders in 
neighboring Arab countries.
