Comparing Richard M. Nixon to King David and Abraham Lincoln, the Rev. Billy 
Graham on Wednesday said Nixon is not a "tragic figure" but a leader whose 
failings and defeats were greatly magnified by the glare of television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, the worldwide evangelist said he is still 
baffled by the Watergate controversy that forced the resignation of his 
longtime friend and golfing buddy 16 years ago. He predicted that future 
historians will not consider Watergate a constitutional crisis as Nixon's foes 
did in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothered me about the whole thing was the language that he 
used on the tapes," Graham said, referring to transcripts of secretly recorded 
conversations in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes provided what some considered evidence of Nixon's attempt to cover up 
the Watergate break-in and revealed the former President's use of profanity. 
The phrase "expletive deleted" -- substituted for profanity by transcribers of 
the tapes -- became a popular joke throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know and none of his close friends ever knew that he even knew some 
of those words," Graham said. "I feel it wasn't the real Nixon. And, of course, 
I believe in supernatural powers, of both good and evil, and I think some of 
these were at work at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Such struggles are not unusual for national leaders, said Graham, who flew to 
Southern California to offer the dedicatory prayer at the Richard M. Nixon 
Library and Birthplace today in Yorba Linda. He said he considered the opening 
of the library to be the pinnacle of Nixon's career and a manifestation that 
most of the American people have forgiven the once-disgraced leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the history of Israel, the leaders of Judah and Israel were always 
up and down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet none of the Old Testament patriarchs or Lincoln were, like Nixon, forced to 
contend with a relentless press corps that broadcasted political problems and 
personal failings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at David," Graham said of the biblical hero who slew the giant Goliath. 
"He had to run and hide. And then he committed a murder and he committed 
adultery, which was abhorrent to God. But God forgave David and David is 
considered one of the greatest kings that ever lived in the history of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have had the cameras on David in those days, they might have 
rebelled against him. We would have had black headlines." 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years, Graham said, the American public is still confused about what 
drove Nixon from office. 
</P>
<P>
"I have read a lot about Watergate, but I still don't understand it," Graham 
said. "I don't understand why it became such a big thing, and neither do the 
people around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Graham first met Nixon in 1950, when the then-California congressman asked the 
evangelist to join him for a game of golf. Over the years, Graham said, the 
friendship grew to the point where he gave the invocation at Nixon's 
inauguration, held private White House church services during the Vietnam War 
and gave the eulogy for Nixon's mother, Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the friendship, the dark days of Watergate resulted in a breach in the 
relationship, Graham said. Nixon steadfastly refused to take his calls or to 
see him, even when he flew to Washington three days before the former President 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon continued to refuse his calls in the ensuing months, when he lay near 
death in a San Clemente hospital after a bout of phlebitis. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife rented an airplane, and it had a sign on it, 'Nixon: God loves you and 
so do we,' and flew it back and forth in front of the hospital," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
About six months after Nixon left office, Graham said, the former President 
unexpectedly called and invited him for a visit in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a natural evening," Graham said. "He's a man that can rebound very 
fast from defeats and problems like that. I think he took it in its historical 
stride."
