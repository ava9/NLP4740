25 YEARS LATER: A FIX OR A FIST?; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: WHEN MUHAMMAD ALI KNOCKED OUT SONNY LISTON IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THEIR 
REMATCH, MANY AT RINGSIDE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS A LEGITIMATE FIGHT. SOME STILL 
DON'T.

<P>
Twenty-five years ago today, 4,200 people in a Lewiston, Me., high school 
hockey rink saw either boxing's most shameful charade or, depending on where 
they were sitting, a tired, old heavyweight knocked out by a perfectly 
legitimate punch. 
</P>
<P>
The Shame in Maine, some still call it. Others call it much ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It was Clay-Liston II, a rematch of the controversial Cassius Clay-Sonny Liston 
fight 15 months earlier at the Miami Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, the sports world had been shocked by the sight of the seemingly 
indomitable Liston, a 7-1 favorite, quitting on his stool after the sixth 
round, claiming an injured shoulder. Thus the heavyweight championship passed 
into the hands of Cassius Clay, who the following day announced that he had 
joined the Muslim faith and had a new name, Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
But while shock and disbelief greeted the Clay-Liston I result, the outcome of 
their second bout was greeted with outrage and fury. 
</P>
<P>
Fans in the Central Maine Youth Center surged toward the ring, demanding 
refunds and screaming, "Fix!" and "Fake!" The next day, grandstanding 
politicians across the United States were summoning TV cameras and proposing 
that boxing be banned. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days, it seemed like an even bet as to whether professional boxing 
would make it through 1965. The May 26 headline in The Times read: 
</P>
<P>
"IT ONLY TAKES MINUTE TO KILL BOXING." 
</P>
<P>
In the eye of the firestorm was a harmless-looking, countering right-hand punch 
that Ali, 23, a 13-10 underdog, employed to knock out Liston, believed to be at 
least 33, in the first round. To most, it looked more like a slap. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spanked my kids harder," was an oft-said line. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century later, opinions held by those who were there, even two 
columnists from this newspaper, differ sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jim Murray: "I saw the punch, and it was a good one. But the point is, 
Sonny was old and out of shape -- I don't think he could've beaten a 10 count 
if he'd tripped over his shoelaces." 
</P>
<P>
Says Melvin Durslag, who then wrote for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner: "I've 
covered a lot of championship fights, and that one was the only one I didn't 
think was sanitary. In my opinion, Liston either took money to go down, or the 
Muslims had him scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
The fight had tighter security than a Presidential visit. Everyone entering the 
hockey rink that night was searched. Durslag recalls that security men took 
away his wife's steel knitting needles. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before the fight, there was a rumor that Muslim followers of 
Malcolm X, who had been assassinated, were bent on revenge and planned an 
assassination attempt on Ali. 
</P>
<P>
The fight's closed-circuit TV promoter, Sportsvision, in effect laid odds of 
1,000 to 1 on Ali -- to live through the fight. The firm took out a three-day, 
$1-million life insurance policy on him for $1,000. Sportsvision beamed the 
fight to 258 closed-circuit locations. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Bingham, then a training camp aide to Ali, recently recalled bizarre 
daybreak roadwork sessions, accompanied by slow-moving policemen. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd run at sunup, the two of us, and the cops would start out running with us 
but couldn't keep up," Bingham said. "One of them would hand me a gun, then 
they'd wave us on." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who interviewed Ali at his Lewiston Holiday Inn campsite had to first 
pass patdowns by uniformed policemen and Ali's own security people. At the 
weigh-in, police guarded every door and surrounded the fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee, still reacts angrily to those who suggest it was 
a rigged fight. "He got him with a solid punch," Dundee said recently. "Look at 
the film. Sonny's left foot jumps off the canvas just as Ali hits him. It was a 
flash right hand. Ali hurt a lot of guys with it. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was not backing up when he hit him, like so many guys wrote. He was 
sliding laterally. One thing about boxing, it's the shots you never see that 
hurt you the most. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who say that fight was fixed should have seen Sonny's eyes like I 
did, right after. A few seconds after it's over, I felt kind of sorry for the 
guy and I walked up to him and said: 'Tough, Sonny.' His eyes looked right 
through me. He didn't see nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
Both Murray and HBO boxing commentator Larry Merchant, then a sportswriter with 
the Philadelphia Daily News, recall hearing reports in Lewiston before the 
fight that things weren't right in Liston's camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hearing that Sonny's sparring partners were being paid extra to hold 
back," Merchant said. "My own view is that Sonny was simply an old heavyweight, 
waiting to get knocked out. I believe it was a solid punch. It was such a shock 
at that time to see Sonny Liston on the canvas. No one had ever seen that 
before." 
</P>
<P>
To Mark Kram, who covered the fight for Sports Illustrated, the aftermath was a 
case of members of the media rushing to judgment over a punch most of them 
didn't see. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a perfectly valid, stunning right-hand punch to the side of the head, 
and (Ali) won without benefit of a fix," wrote Kram, in his first paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people," Kram reported, "failed to see the short, fast right to the jaw 
that nailed Liston, and among them were numerous reporters. . . . (There is) no 
shred of evidence or plausibility to support the suggestion that this was 
anything but an honest fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The knockout punch itself was thrown with the amazing speed that makes Clay 
different from any other heavyweight. He leaned away from one of Liston's 
pawing, ponderous jabs, planted himself solidly and whipped his right arm over 
Liston's left arm and into the side of Liston's jaw." 
</P>
<P>
Kram also reported that Amos Lincoln, a sparring partner of Liston's, had been 
"carefully coached" to be "well battered" at Liston's Poland Spring Hotel camp 
in the days before the fight. For several weeks before that, he had routinely 
connected with Liston's head with right crosses, according to Kram. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote the New York Times' Arthur Daley of the knockout punch: "The punch looked 
good, but not great. Certainly, it didn't appear thunderous enough to fell the 
oak-thewed Sonny." 
</P>
<P>
Daley also commented on a report in a Boston newspaper afterward that Lincoln 
had been paid an extra $100 to let Liston batter him in final sparring 
sessions. "He gave Lincoln a pretty good thumping, but his camp followers were 
not misled," Daley wrote. "They knew in their hearts the old man didn't have it 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hand, who covered the fight for the Associated Press, didn't think much of 
the punch. "I saw it and I thought it was a glancing blow," Hand said recently. 
"I was surprised Liston went down and even more surprised he didn't get up. I 
remember hearing Terry Downes, the British middleweight, saying that night: 
'I've hit my daughter harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Murray Rose compiled the round-by-round summary for the AP that night and was 
as mystified as Hand. "It looked like a phantom punch to me," he said. "I saw 
him swinging, but I just didn't see it connect. I remember some writers saying 
they'd seen a solid punch, though." 
</P>
<P>
After Lewiston, Liston won 14 consecutive fights, 13 by knockout. Some pointed 
to that streak as evidence that Liston had done business with someone in 
Lewiston. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the fighters he met after Lewiston were ranked fighters, until he met 
Leotis Martin, who knocked him out (in 1969)," Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
Liston fought once more after the Martin bout, winning a tough, bloody fight 
with Chuck Wepner in June 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Ali went on to have one of boxing's great careers. Yet to come were his 
memorable bouts with Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, his upset of George Foreman in 
Zaire, and his dramatic regaining of the championship, at 36, from Leon Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
Ali-Liston II probably still leads the league in rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all kinds of things in Lewiston," Durslag recalled. "One theory was 
that the Muslims were very anxious to keep the title, that they'd told Sonny: 
'Be a good boy and take the money.' Then we heard that Sonny was scared to 
death that he'd be hit by stray gunfire (meant for Ali) during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember Ali immediately afterward, as mystified as anyone, being vague 
about the punch. Then, after he'd showered, his line was it was an 'anchor 
punch,' taught to him by Stepin Fetchit, who was in his camp then." 
</P>
<P>
One ringside observer, former heavyweight champion Jim Braddock, said the 
suspect Ali right hand merely finished up what an earlier punch had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that this guy (Ali) is a lot better than any of us gave him 
credit for," Braddock told Daley. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the knockout punch that sticks in my mind as much as a punch he let 
go (earlier). . . . It was a right to Liston's jaw and it shook him to his 
shoetops. For all we know, it could have been the one that set up the 
knockout." 
</P>
<P>
Another former champion, the late Rocky Marciano, changed his view about the 
knockout punch after seeing videotape the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was a powerful punch when I saw the fight from ringside," 
Marciano said. "Now (after seeing video) I think Clay, seeing the opening, 
snapped the punch the last six inches." 
</P>
<P>
If there are dark secrets still untold from Lewiston, they won't be told by 
Sonny Liston. He died on Dec. 30, 1970, under somewhat mysterious circumstances 
in Las Vegas. His wife, who had been gone several days, found his body on their 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
The police report indicated that small amounts of marijuana and heroin were 
found near the body, but those who knew Liston maintain to this day that he 
never used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In his final years as a fighter, Liston's manager was Johnny Tocco, who at 79 
runs a Las Vegas gym. Recently, Tocco recalled a conversation he had with 
Liston shortly before he died. 
</P>
<P>
"I never asked Sonny about things I didn't think he wanted to talk about," 
Tocco said. "But I'd heard from someone who was once in his camp that Sonny had 
been told before the second Ali fight that if Ali didn't win, Sonny's son would 
be kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him about it, and all Sonny told me was: 'Let's not talk about that -- 
it was the way the fight had to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ali, 48, lives on his 88-acre farm at Berrien Springs, Mich. He is afflicted 
with a form of Parkinson's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Maine Youth Center in downtown Lewiston stands, and its owners are 
contemplating adding a second rink to accommodate the children of the 
hockey-crazed region. The building is also used for weekend swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of Lewiston, Ring magazine columnist Dan Daniel 
seems today to have been closer to the truth than most when he wrote after the 
fight: "Did Liston go into the tank at Lewiston? Who knows? What happened in 
Maine was in the nature of a fever. As Lincoln said, while Gettysburg was 
raging, 'This, too, will pass.' "
