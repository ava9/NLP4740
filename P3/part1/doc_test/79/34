<F P=106> [Interview with Plan and Economy Minister Augustin </F>
Ngirabatware by Eugene Lambene in Libreville on 27 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Ngirabatware] I brought a message from the 
president of the Republic, which I delivered yesterday, and I am 
going on to another African country. However, I am not on an 
African tour. This is not a media campaign because we do not 
have the time yet to undertake such actions. It is absolutely 
necessary for us to explain some issues concerning the political 
and military situation in our country. The Rwandan Patriotic 
Front's [RPF] media campaign and that of its acolytes is such 
that -- if I can say so -- the world has received information 
solely from the RPF which, we know, is often full of lies. Our 
experiences gained since the beginning of the war in October 
1990 can testify to this. 
  [Lambene] What is your government saying about the 
massacres? 
  [Ngirabatware] The RPF is directly and indirectly 
responsible 
for these massacres. Undeniably, the RPF -- probably with 
external support -- assassinated President Habyarimana. All the 
other massacres that followed in Rwanda and the ethnic troubles 
originated from the assassination of the president of the 
Republic. A private radio in Rwanda had mentioned the 
assassination plot earlier and people (?argued) that the 
president knew very well that he was being trailed and that he 
was running the risk of falling victim to a very fatal 
assassination plot. The only difference is that he never knew 
whether it was going to happen on the road, in his house, in the 
office, or in the air. At any rate, people never thought of it 
happening in an aircraft, especially as Kigali International 
Airport and its suburbs were under the control of the Belgian 
contingents of the UN peacekeeping force. 
  [Lambene] Investigations are going on. Are there any facts 
so far to establish which side is responsible? 
  [Ngirabatware] Up until now, the Rwandan Government has not 
accused any side. However, many factors can be put together to 
establish that the RPF, with the support of others, is 
responsible for this assassination. 
  [Lambene] Which supporters, for example? 
  [Ngirabatware] We cannot mention them just like that, but 
what we do know is that the RPF's military equipment does not 
include SAM-7 missiles which were used in killing the president 
of the Republic. We also know that the RPF does not have 
specialists who can handle such missiles and we have noticed 
that on the battlefield even white soldiers were counted among 
the dead. So, there is other external support apart from the 
usual support from Uganda. Certainly, the RPF has other 
supporters, probably mercenaries or supporters from other 
circles. 
  [Lambene] Presently, the massacres are continuing in the 
field and unfortunately enough, they will continue further. The 
problem is, it is easy to enter a civil war but it is very 
difficult to get out of it. What steps have you taken to get 
out of it? 
  [Ngirabatware] Getting out of this civil war in Rwanda will 
be a complex issue. We are saying this because, now, the 
civilians are clearly behind the soldiers, behind the Rwandan 
Armed Forces. This means that, even if a great number of 
civilians are armed with cut and thrust weapons and with modern 
weapons, the ultimate goal of this provisional government is to 
get out of this conflict. The first objective of the present 
transitional government headed by Prime Minister (Jean Kambanda) 
is to renegotiate with the RPF to which he has offered a 
cease-fire. Second, we want to bring peace to the country 
because there is fire on almost all the hills of Rwanda. We 
adhere entirely to the Arusha peace agreements even if there are 
still imperfections in this agreement. Nevertheless, we believe 
that it is only through negotiation and peace that lasting peace 
can be achieved in Rwanda. We are also telling the RPF to cease 
fire first and to let us sit around the same negotiating table 
so that we can talk about peace again in Rwanda, especially as 
the government is convinced that the RPF cannot take power in 
Rwanda by the force of arms. [end recording]
