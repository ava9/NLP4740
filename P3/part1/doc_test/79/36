If your kids can be noisier than buzz saws and rowdier than a pack of cowhands, 
tonight's their night to shine. 
</P>
<P>
'Long about sundown, that rootin', tootin' cowboy Pecos Bill will mosey into 
Anaheim's Pearson Park to present "The Pecos Bill Show," a romp through 
American folklore that brings youngsters face to face with a barrelful of 
colorful characters. Geared for preschoolers on up, the audience-participation 
show completes the park's "Just for Kids" series with a 7:30 p.m. performance 
in the park amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pecos Bill Show," presented by three members of the Imagination Company, a 
Los Angeles-based children's theater troupe, brings to life tall tales of the 
Old West in a series of short scenes. During the 40-minute show, audiences meet 
naturalist Johnny Appleseed and see Paul Bunyan match lumberjack skills with a 
city slicker, and Annie Oakely take on Frank Butler in a pea-shooting contest. 
To keep things hopping, Pecos lassoes audience volunteers who, aided by simple 
props and sound effects, are transformed into a whiring buzz saw, a couple of 
cowhands and even a shootin' match target. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Imagination Company shows, the success of "Pecos Bill" relies more 
on the active imaginations of children than it does on fancy props and 
costumes, said co-founder Tom Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect children to fill in a lot of the blanks, and they always do it 
beautifully," said Provenzano, who formed the company in 1984 with actor-writer 
Teresa Love. "While there are a lot of good things about elaborately staged 
children's theater, this show brings the kids into a whole different kind of 
creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
Imagination Company may not be the most widely recognized children's group in 
the state, but it is among the busiest, Provenzano said. In the past seven 
years, the troupe, which ranges in size from 5 to 25 actors, has staged over 
3,000 performances primarily in Southern California schools. The group recently 
added a Northern California office and will soon offer shows in Washington, 
Oregon and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
As the group's artistic director, Love has created nearly 20 original plays 
geared for students in preschool through high school. In addition to "Pecos 
Bill," there are tributes to American leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., 
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Last year, the troupe premiered its 
first bilingual show, "Celebracion de Mexico," and in 1991 will salute the 
Chinese New Year with "Gung Hay Fat Choy, in the Year of the Goat." At all 
school performances, teachers receive study guides that suggest a variety of 
pre- and post-performance classroom activities. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Provenzano doesn't see this as an educational group. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is entertainment, with the understanding that everything in our 
shows is based on historical figures or classical literature. It's meant to be 
fun, but if we all learn something along the way, that's wonderful, too."
