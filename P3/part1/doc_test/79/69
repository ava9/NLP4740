<F P=106> [Interview with opposition leader Faustin Twagiramungu by </F>
Christophe Boisbouvier; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Our guest this morning is the Rwandan opposition 
leader Faustin Twagiramungu, who is interviewed by Christophe 
Boisbouvier. There has been no news of this key Rwandan figure 
since 7 April. I remind you that he was designated to lead the 
future transitional government in accordance with the Arusha 
agreement. Faustin Twagiramungu succeeded in escaping from the 
soldiers of the Presidential Guard who were looking for him in 
the streets of Kigali. Today he is in a safe place and for the 
first time he gives us his account of the events that followed 
the assassination of President Habyarimana. Christophe 
Boisbouvier spoke to him: 
  [Twangiramungu] The shooting started at 0505 on the morning 
of 7 April. I had a conversation with the prime minister. She 
told me that her house was surrounded and that she wanted to go 
to speak on the radio but could not do so, because it seems that 
the people were very serious and that she feared for her life. 
We talked throughout that morning and we exchanged points of 
view on the situation until 0830. At 0830 the gendarmes 
informed me that the situation was becoming very serious; I 
thank the French ambassador for having communicated with UNAMIR 
[UN Mission in Rwanda]. UNAMIR then sent me an armored vehicle 
which picked me up at around 1230, and at that very moment I 
heard the news of the assassination of the prime minister by the 
Presidential Guard. I remained cut off from the outside world 
from 7 April until I was invited to escape with the UNAMIR 
staff, which is what I did. 
  [Boisbouvier] Was the assassination of opposition leaders 
ordered at the highest level, or was it decided by low-level 
authority in the Presidential Guard? 
  [Twangiramungu] It was not a low-level authority in the 
Presidential Guard which decided that a massacre of opposition 
leaders should be carried out. It seems to me that it had 
already been decided upon a long time before, because the 
political authorities of the [word indistinct] party had decided 
to distribute weapons to the militia of the MRND [National 
Revolutionary Movement for Development]. I don't understand how 
the Presidential Guard could have found everyone in their homes 
and everyone's address. This was done and planned by extremists 
within the army. They are extremists of [word indistinct] who 
are now using other personalities to lead international public 
opinion into thinking that the conflict is of an ethnic nature. 
This is not the case. If this were an interethnic conflict why 
then would all opposition leaders, Tutsi and Hutu alike, have 
been assassinated? 
  [Boisbouvier] Who do you think is behind the attack on 
President Habyarimana's plane? 
  [Twangiramungu] I don't personally think that the president 
was assassinated by the Belgians. What for? Nor do I think 
that this method was used by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. 
I think the president was assassinated by extremist soldiers 
within the Presidential Guard or simply by soldiers within his 
circle, soldiers forming a clan within the army. Why? Because 
extremist soldiers wanted the president to resume war [with the 
RPF]. The president had merely wanted to use delaying tactics 
by refusing the formation of a transitional government. 
Extremist soldiers did not accept these delaying tactics. They 
purely and simply preferred to eliminate him in order to 
continue to enjoy their privileges if, of course, they succeed 
in winning such a war. [passage omitted]
