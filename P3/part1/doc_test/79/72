A $600,000 stretch Lincoln limousine was delivered to President Reagan on 
Thursday but will be used for the first time by President-elect George Bush on 
Inauguration Day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-foot black armored presidential limousine was built from the ground up 
under Secret Service specifications during the past three years, said Jerald F. 
terHorst, Ford's director of national public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Roberts, vice president and general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury 
division of Ford Motor Co., made the presentation to Reagan in Bush's presence. 
"It's mine for a few days George, then it will be yours," Reagan told Bush. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a presidential limousine has been custom-built. Others 
have been transformed to meet White House needs. 
</P>
<P>
TerHorst, who was White House spokesman for former President Gerald Ford, said 
he expected that Bush would use the limousine when he goes to the White House 
Jan. 20 to pick up President Reagan. They will ride down Pennsylvania Avenue 
together to the Capitol. Bush and his wife, Barbara, will also ride in the 
Lincoln to start the inaugural parade. 
</P>
<P>
The new White House limousine "has all the latest communications gear that a 
president could possibly want," TerHorst said. It seats three persons in the 
rear and has three jump seats. The vehicle's interior is dark blue and adorned 
with the presidential seal inside and outside. 
</P>
<P>
The last Lincoln presidential limousine was used from 1972 to 1982. The White 
House since has leased Cadillacs from General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ford has leased its limousines to the White House but the federal 
government purchased the new model for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential limousine is always used on overseas presidential trips. It is 
expected to be flown to Japan for use by Bush when he attends the Feb. 24 
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
