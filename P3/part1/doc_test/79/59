<P>
The city's famed collection of municipally owned public artworks -- ranging 
from 19th-Century monuments to cutting-edge sculpture and painting -- largely 
escaped serious damage in last week's earthquake, city arts officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But an inventory of municipal art and citywide arts-damage assessment scheduled 
to be presented today to Mayor Art Agnos found that public art at San Francisco 
International Airport sustained some major losses and that some museums, 
theaters and galleries face daunting challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the first postquake arts catastrophe analysis were provided by 
Claire Isaacs, director of cultural affairs at the Arts Commission of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said that while museum- and publicly owned art objects fared 
comparatively well in the quake, the most significant lasting effect for the 
local arts community may turn out to be in the problems posed by canceled or 
postponed performances, exhibition openings and fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she hoped that the city's collective pluck -- showcased by the 
tenacity of its arts institutions in resuming normal operations -- may have a 
major benefit for San Francisco. She said she has been concerned about erosion 
of the city's self-image in the aftermath of the assassination of former Mayor 
George Moscone and the AIDS crisis, in particular, which has cast San Francisco 
in an unfamiliar morbid role in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"The tradition of San Francisco has been that we sip wine while the world is 
falling apart," she said. Through the arts, she said, "San Francisco shows the 
world that it's OK. We need for the world to know that." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park 
reopened, with plywood and 2-by-4 braces shoring up four archways just inside 
the front entrance. The California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln 
Park may reopen next week after engineers complete an inspection of heavily 
damaged interior decorative columns in the building's rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
Two small private galleries were condemned by building inspectors and will have 
to be demolished, Isaacs said, and the city's Asian Museum of Art, which 
adjoins the de Young, must cope with both damage to 31 important objects in its 
collection and with the suspected release of asbestos fibers in the air in its 
storage spaces -- apparently from pipes whose coverings disintegrated in the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said officials conducted a hurried citywide inspection of nearly all of 
the municipal collections. The city owns several thousand art pieces, Isaacs 
said, ranging from large outdoor sculptures to paintings and small objects in 
individual city offices. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection emphasized 262 of the most important pieces in the city 
collection, including such things as Depression-era paintings and frescoes in 
Coit Tower, the Vaillancourt Fountain, George Segal's Holocaust Memorial at the 
California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park and Rodin's "The 
Thinker" in the same location. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said there was no damage apparent to any of the city artworks -- except 
for at least three major contemporary pieces at the airport. They are among 64 
airport artworks. Major damage was sustained after ceiling materials in the 
United Airlines area of the airport's North Terminal collapsed and the quake 
motion set off fire sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
A huge untitled acrylic-on-canvas painting by Sam Francis suffered heavy water 
damage and was partially torn. A fragile paper and bamboo hanging sculpture by 
Nance O'Banion was devastated when it was hit by sprinkler water, which warped 
some of the wood and caused one piece of the sculpture to fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A large acrylic hanging sculpture by Freda Koblick was not damaged, said 
Isaacs, but will have to undergo costly removal so workers can repair damaged 
ceiling structures above it. All three works are in the United boarding-gate 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said initial fears of massive damage to the collection of the Mexican 
Museum in the Fort Mason Center turned out to be greater than actual losses, 
but she said the museum's gift shop -- a key revenue center -- was severely 
hit.
