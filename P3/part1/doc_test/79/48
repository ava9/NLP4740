The White House helped 500 local schoolchildren celebrate Halloween on Tuesday, 
and along with the treats the youngsters got an admonition from President Bush 
to beware of something truly scary -- illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife, Barbara, emerged through the mouth of a 15-foot 
jack-o-lantern erected over the staid diplomatic entrance of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the White House collected pledge cards from the children 
forswearing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"You know they say that there's a ghost in this old house, and the most famous 
one is Abraham Lincoln," Bush told the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara and I haven't seen the ghost of Abraham Lincoln walking the halls, but 
this is our first Halloween in the White House, so maybe we'll see him 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The President added: "Halloween is a time for ghosts and goblins, for haunted 
houses and scary stories." But there is one "scary story that isn't 
make-believe. You know what I'm talking about . . . illegal drugs and how they 
hurt people, how they hurt families, hurt kids, some of them just like you."
