The Army's top lawyer has concluded that military strikes against terrorists 
can be justified legally without running afoul of a 1976 presidential order 
banning assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the Army's judge advocate general, argues in an 
eight-page draft memorandum that America's diplomatic and military 
bureaucracies have failed for too long to define the term assassination and 
that thanks to changes in "the nature of the threat," action against terrorists 
can be justified under the legal concept of national self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The employment of military force against a terrorist or terrorist organization 
to protect U.S. citizens or the national security of the United States is a 
legitimate exercise of the international legal right of self-defense and does 
not constitute assassination," Overholt concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the Overholt memorandum was first reported Monday by a trade 
publication, Defense Week, and quickly acknowledged by Army officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman, explained that the service had been 
encouraging legal debate within the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and other 
agencies in hopes of producing a common definition of assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges said the Army's basic "Law of Land Warfare" manual, last revised in 
1956, has a definition of assassination that dates back to The Hague Convention 
of 1907. 
</P>
<P>
That definition states, "It is especially forbidden to kill or wound 
treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army." 
</P>
<P>
The Overholt memo notes that war, in essence, legalizes the "killing of the 
enemy," but in peacetime, the standards of conduct must be defined under the 
U.N. Charter -- "which recognizes the inherent right of self-defense of 
nations" -- and domestic laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, then-President Gerald R. Ford signed a presidential order banning 
attempts to assassinate foreign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening 13 years, "the nature of the threat has changed, rather than 
the international legal right to respond to the threat," Overholt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"It is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations envisaged as 
appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed response by U.S. military forces 
are well-financed, highly organized paramilitary structures engaged full-time 
in the illegal use of force," the memo concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"A national decision to employ military force in self-defense against a 
legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that employed in response to an 
overt conventional threat."
