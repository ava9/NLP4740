Historic Movie House May Close: The Texas Theater, the Dallas movie house where 
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested after the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy, may be closing soon. The 60-year-old theater was built by Howard 
Hughes but its current owner, United Artists, wants to shut it down because 
it's losing money. The Texas Theater Historical Assn. is trying to declare the 
theater a historical landmark and has asked director Oliver Stone to consider 
allowing a special screening at the theater of his new film, "Born on the 
Fourth of July," which was filmed in the same neighborhood. Claudia Puig
