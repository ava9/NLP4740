The Cave is Steve Reich and Beryl Korot's ambitious, technologically
dazzling, theatre piece: three hours of music, video images and computer
graphics which gnaw away at our received definitions of what theatre, opera
or music theatre ought to be. It received its first performance a month ago
in Vienna, moved on to Berlin and then for the first week of the Holland
Festival to Amsterdam, where it was presented in the wonderfully flexible
space of the Goederenbeurszaal in the old stock exchange building. In August
it moves to London for a season at the Royal Festival Hall.
The Cave is an exploration of Reich and Korot's Jewish heritage, or more
precisely the way in which part of that heritage, the story of Abraham and
Sarah and their sons Isaac and Ishmael, is retained and shared in the
memories of present-day Israelis, Palestinians and New Yorkers. The basis of
each of the three acts is a set of video interviews with prominent citizens
in West and East Jerusalem, and in New York; the images and the speech
provide the starting point for both Reich's music and Korot's visual
collages, as details of both are taken up and used as the jumping-off points
for detailed development.
Both sets of processes are fascinatingly worked out, and neatly
complementary; as the talking heads are projected on to one or more of the
five video screens that dominate the 'set' for The Cave, decorative details
from the images may be shown alongside them or computer-generated texts
reeled off in parallel in French, German, English or Arabic. Meanwhile the
performers - four singers and the 13 instrumentalists of the Steve Reich
Ensemble (conducted by Paul Hillier) - take up words, phrases, speech
rhythms or pitch collections from the video voices and weave around them
commentary and accompaniment.
The music produced is characteristic of recent Reich: Different Trains, the
string quartet he wrote for the Kronos Quartet and which also used archive
interviews, is the most obvious point of reference. The score is muscular,
intricately worked, carefully judged. Each of the first two acts kicks off
from the respective Jewish and Islamic responses to a set of questions that
begins with 'Who is Abraham?' and 'Who is Sarah?'. 'Abraham for me is my
ancestor' offers the first interviewee; 'Ibrahim was neither Jew nor
Christian, but a Muslim' asserts a Palestinian in the second act.
Both sets of responses are underpinned by the sound of the string quartet,
though when in both codas the focus changes and the screens offer a
travelogue showing Jerusalem and Hebron today, keyboards begin to colour the
sound world. The third act is altogether tighter and more colourful as the
American responses set up all kinds of allusions - 'Abraham Lincoln High
School, high on the hill midst sand and sea, that's as far's I trace
Abraham', admits Richard Serra. The whole ensemble is brought in, and the
musical climax is reached with a retelling of the story of Abraham and
Isaac, when the music darkens and becomes overtly expressive. The ending is
abrupt, matter of fact.
Reich and Korot have invented a richly woven tapestry, novel in its
presentation, delicately balanced in the issues it raises. There are no
overt political messages, but the historical undertow is inevitable in the
first two acts - 'The Cave' of the title is the place in which Abraham and
the patriarchs are reputed to be buried; it is now the site of a mosque. And
the sense of the US as hermetically sealed, cut off from that bundle of
racial and religious issues half way across the world, is tellingly conveyed
in the third.
The third act, indeed, just over half an hour long, is a bracing and
thrilling creation, fast-paced and full of wonderful visual and musical
invention. The first two acts, though, are too long, especially the opening
one, which takes 65 minutes to lay down the biblical background, and set up
the compositional techniques. With insufficient contrast of approach between
Acts 1 and 2, only (only]) the change of religious emphasis, the cumulative
musical impression is too diffuse; the audience has cottoned on to the use
of the video images and the computer keyboards rapping out text.
Yet so much about the concept of The Cave is thoughtful and fresh that one
almost forgives its longueurs. Reich has sought out a genuinely new
synthesis of sound and image. By the third act he and Korot are making it
work, and that final half an hour more than justifies his faith and the
audience's patience.
Performances of The Cave at the Royal Festival Hall, London run from August
18 to 23.
