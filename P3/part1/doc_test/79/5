<TEXT>
<P>
Forget Gary Hart and Donna Rice -- you don't always need a politician and the 
other woman to titillate the imagination. Sometimes what goes on between a 
lawmaker and his wife is just as interesting. 
</P>
<P>
And no less than the Library of Congress is offering a peep through the 
keyhole. 
</P>
<P>
From September to March, the library will display some of the most personal 
mail that ever traveled between members of Congress and their wives over the 
last 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there was sex in Washington in the nation's formative years. It's 
described by Rep. Job Pierson (D-N.Y.) to his wife, Clarissa, on Dec. 17, 1834. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Mrs. Pierson's brother, a U.S. senator, seduced a maid the first week 
of her employment and "co-habitated with her during the whole session." 
</P>
<P>
"The other boarders were angry at this monopoly," Pierson wrote. "They enticed 
some four or five girls from a house of ill-fame . . . who came there every 
night" until the landladies "ordered the servants to bar the doors against 
their admission." 
</P>
<P>
Other letters radiate laughter, sadness, courage, love, poignancy, fear and 
that old bromide that a gal stands by her man. There is only one woman -- the 
late Rep. Clare Booth Luce (R-Conn.) -- among the lawmakers featured in the 
exhibit, which is part of the library's bicentennial celebration of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The letters discuss: 
</P>
<P>
* The role of women. "Always be sunshine and flowers," Pierson counseled 
Clarissa on Feb. 12, 1833, but never worry about "the price of wheat" because 
"such matters should be provided and regulated by the other sex." 
</P>
<P>
* Spousal wit. "Mark my magnanimity," Elizabeth Woodbury wrote her Jacksonian 
Democrat husband, Sen. Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire, on Jan. 3, 1830. "I here 
invest you with a carte-blanche, to bow to, to smile upon, or to flatter any 
lady you please, without doing penance for it on paper. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
* Spousal support. "You have rendered the world the greatest service . . . you 
have used the power and opportunity . . . for humanity and democracy," Belle 
Case La Follette wrote Sen. Robert M. La Follette (R-Wis.) on March 5, 1917. It 
was the eve of America's entry into World War I and La Follette had just fought 
bitterly, under tremendous pressure, against President Woodrow Wilson's 
proposal to arm U.S. merchant ships. 
</P>
<P>
* Society ladies. Sen. Woodbury writing to Elizabeth on Dec. 19, 1829, that 
Miss Silsbee was "flat as a pancake." Mrs. Munroe resembled "the elephant -- 
her step an earthquake and her breath a storm." And Mrs. Polk? "Thin as a 
hatchet and grown almost positively ugly." 
</P>
<P>
* The congressional pay raise of 1873. It was "pushed through the Senate during 
the final night using all sorts of parliamentary tricks," according to Sen. 
Carl Schurz (R-Mo.). He wrote his wife, Margarethe, on March 5, 1873, "The 
entire operation was so shameless. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Unflattering views of Congress by those who served. "We dayly go to the Capitol 
at about eleven o'clock, do little or nothing and return at about three o'clock 
to dine," Sen. Simeon Olcott wrote wife Tryphena, back in New Hampshire, on New 
Year's Day 1802. Twenty-two years later Andrew Jackson, then a Democratic 
senator from Tennessee, wrote his wife, Rachel, "I am truly wearied with 
lounging here; doing nothing, but feeding on the public funds." 
</P>
<P>
John J. McDonough, a manuscript historian at the library, said the exhibit will 
attempt to "bring in the personal, more intimate aspect" of lawmakers' lives 
into public view. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the letters were written when members "didn't bring their wives to 
Washington," said Marvin Kranz, an American history specialist. 
</P>
<P>
As the Civil War approached on Dec. 7, 1860, Whig Rep. Justin Smith Morrill 
informed his wife, Ruth, "I am put on the great committee to save the Union but 
I do not think it can be saved and I shall on Monday decline to serve. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The war was under way when Electa Dawes wrote Rep. Henry L. Dawes of 
Massachusetts, on July 25, 1861, that "right will prevail" and "the colored man 
will have rights which will be recognized and respected." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, on April 16, 1865, Dawes wrote his wife that he had attempted 
to call on President Abraham Lincoln two nights earlier, but "found he had gone 
to the theater." 
</P>
<P>
The news of the assassination arrived just as Dawes arrived home and he wrote, 
sadly, "I am at a funeral and the nation are mourners." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opens Sept. 13 in the foyer of the Library of Congress in 
Washington. It will run through March 17, 1991.
