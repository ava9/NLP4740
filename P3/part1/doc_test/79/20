Q: Now that Professor Elizabeth Newson and 24 other 'experts' have offered
the opinion that there is a link between violent crime and video nasties, is
it not time that television and the broadcasters began to accept some
responsibility?
A: Blaming broadcasters and television is about as sensible as blaming
plastics manufacturers on the grounds that cassettes are made from their
materials. Video nasties may be viewed via television sets but they are
produced by the cinema industry and rented out by video shops. They are not
made by broadcasters, nor shown on British television channels.
Surely these 'experts' are only confirming, finally, what anyone with common
sense could always see: that many violent deeds committed in real life are
imitations of deeds in video nasties or on television programmes.
This ignores the fact that mankind has always been violent. Were there no
murders before television? No wars? Doubtless Ronald Reagan's would-be
assassin did indeed copy the methods he saw in a video, but that is not to
say that without the video he would not have attempted the assassination.
What about all the other people who saw that video; why didn't they try to
assassinate Reagan? Presumably because they were not murderous lunatics. Did
Abraham Lincoln's assassin copy a video?
What about the James Bulger case which finally drove Professor Newson to
declare her change of mind?
What about it? No evidence in that case was ever given to show that either
of the two 10-year-old boys found guilty of the murder had seen a video
nasty. A comment from the judge to the effect that the father of one boy had
rented many video nasties has been widely publicised by people who
desperately want to blame something other than man's violent nature for
man's violence. What about 11-year-old Mary Hayley Bell - who killed two
boys aged four and three in 1968 - did she watch videos? What about the
princes in the tower - would they have survived but for the videos watched
by their killers?
You cannot pretend that it is sheer coincidence that violent deeds are done
so often by people who watch a lot of violent videos.
Of course it is not coincidence, any more than it is coincidence that Steve
Cram, Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett all watched countless athletics videos
and all became top athletes. Would you attribute their prowess to their
abnormal intake of videos or argue that they watch the videos because they
have an abnormal interest in athletics? Videos cannot make you a champion
any more than videos can make you a murderer, though they may give you ideas
about technique: a longer stride pattern, a sawn-off shotgun and a black
balaclava. If you doubt this and believe that screen violence really can
turn non-murderers into murderers, would you apply this to yourself or
merely to everyone else?
Given all the money that advertisers spend on commercials, how can you argue
that screen violence does not 'sell' violence?
Do advertisers sell sausages to vegetarians? Cars to non-drivers? Tampons to
men? Television commercials sell products to those already predisposed to
buy. They are largely concerned with winning market share, not with
converting people, which is extremely difficult. Furthermore, the intent of
the advertiser is of paramount importance, and if programme makers intended
to 'sell violence' and used all the tricks of the trade to make it appear
attractive then we should, indeed, be in trouble. To the extent that modern
programme makers have lost sight of the traditional black hat/white hat
morality and are themselves confused, we are in trouble. That, however,
stems from a confusion in society generally and not from a box of electronic
tricks in the corner of the sitting room. If you doubt the crucial
importance of the intent behind the image, you have to explain why
impressionable young (or old) people don't rush around crucifying one
another, given that the most familiar violent image in the Christian world
for the last few hundred years has been that of a man nailed to a cross.
However sceptical you may be about cause and effect, it is surely a good
idea to control children's access to extremely violent material?
Yes, just as it is a good idea to control children's access to pans of
boiling chip fat and bottles of weedkiller. Professor Newson and her
colleagues may have changed their opinions, yet the existence of a direct
causal connection between screen images and crime is still arguable, whereas
we know for a fact that chip fat and weedkiller are frequent killers. Yet
they are not banned: we continue to allow a free market in chip fat and
weedkiller because people want them, and adults are expected to be
responsible for protecting children. The same principle should apply to
violent screen material, from King Lear to Driller Killer.
Has there been any progress in this debate over the past 20 years?
Yes. Even the most bigoted now seem to have stopped tacking the word 'sex'
onto the word 'violence'.
