WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two strangers, one with a broken leg, arrived at the Maryland farmhouse of Dr. 
Samuel Mudd early on April 15, 1865. Dr. Mudd set the injured man's leg and 
afterward invited his patient and guest to rest in a spare bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The patient was John Wilkes Booth, who hours earlier had fatally shot President 
Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., about 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
For setting the leg of Lincoln's assassin, Dr. Mudd was tried and found guilty 
of conspiracy to murder Lincoln and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mudd's wood-frame house still stands, as does Ford's Theater and other 
major sites where Booth stopped on his escape from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by the Crime 
</P>
<P>
Because of so much interest in the crime the Surratt Society, a volunteer 
organization operating the Surratt Tavern, another Booth-related landmark, 
sponsors bus tours retracing Booth's steps from Ford's Theater to the site of 
Garrett's Farm, where Booth died. 
</P>
<P>
The John Wilkes Booth Escape Route Tour is offered twice a year, during April 
and September. Tours are generally booked far in advance, and third and fourth 
tours are sometimes scheduled to accommodate those on waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to guide yourself through Booth's escape route. Many of the 
roads traveled by Booth still exist, and four buildings associated with the 
assassination are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln went to Ford's Theater to see "Our American Cousin." Booth sneaked into 
the President's box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination was part of a conspiracy. Initially, Booth and six others met 
in the Surratt Boarding House on H Street in Washington, and plotted to kidnap 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
One was John Surratt Jr., son of the owner of the house, Mary Surratt. 
</P>
<P>
After those plans went awry, three conspirators, including Surratt, bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Plot Turned 
</P>
<P>
As the Civil War came to an end the plot turned from kidnaping to murder. Booth 
schemed to kill Lincoln while his compatriots would murder Vice President 
Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Only Booth was 
successful, shooting Lincoln at 10:15 p.m. on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the assassination, owner John T. Ford planned to reopen his 
theater, but an indignant public protested. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the brick showplace on 10th Street wasn't reopened as a theater 
until 1968. Thanks to a painstaking restoration during the 1960s, it looks as 
it did the night of April 14, 1865. 
</P>
<P>
Reproduction American flags drape the presidential box, where the President and 
Mary Lincoln sat with two guests. An original framed engraving of George 
Washington hangs from the box as it did that night. 
</P>
<P>
You can't enter the presidential box today but can peer inside through a glass 
panel. Crimson damask furniture, including an original sofa, set off the box. 
Lincoln sat in a rocker like the one near the door, within easy reach of 
Booth's outstretched arm. 
</P>
<P>
Booth escaped by jumping from the presidential box to the stage floor and 
running out a back door. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the 11-foot, 6-inch jump would have been easy for the agile Booth. But 
he caught a spur on a flag draping the box, lost his balance and broke the 
lower bone in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
If you visit at the right time, take a seat in the balcony and listen to a 
National Park Service guide weave the tale of that infamous night and the 
idiosyncrasies of the theater that Booth knew so well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Grisly Relics 
</P>
<P>
The basement museum, however, is being refurbished and will not reopen until 
April of next year. All the grisly relics, such as Booth's single-shot 
derringer pistol and the suit Lincoln wore to the theater, are in storage. 
</P>
<P>
While Booth was riding horseback toward the Navy Yard Bridge and Maryland, the 
President was carried across the street to William Peterson's house, a narrow, 
red-brick structure typical of many in Washington at that time. 
</P>
<P>
After Lincoln died in a rear bedroom, Victorian era tourists continually 
paraded by, hoping for a peek inside. Finally, in 1880, Congress began efforts 
to memorialize it. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 years later the curious come for the same reason. What they see 
is a home that looks virtually as it did in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
In the bedroom where the President died the muted brownish wallpaper duplicates 
what was there in 1865. The furniture is of the same period, while the pillow, 
protected by a plastic cover, is the one on which Lincoln's head rested. 
</P>
<P>
Coats and a hat hang on hooks, and the rocking chair is similar to the one in 
which Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles sat for hours watching over the dying 
Chief Executive. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lincoln spent a miserable night, grieving on the sofa in the front parlor. 
By midnight Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton began interviewing witnesses in 
the adjacent rear parlor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time John Wilkes Booth and an accomplice, David Herold, were 
already 10 miles away in Surrattsville, now Clinton, Md., at the Surratt 
Tavern, picking up a carbine and field glasses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Boarding House 
</P>
<P>
The tavern was operated through a lease by Mary Surratt, the same woman who ran 
the H Street boarding house where the conspirators met. 
</P>
<P>
The tavern also served as a polling place and post office; original letters to 
Surrattsville are sorted and still waiting to be collected. 
</P>
<P>
But look in a small storage room over the kitchen and you'll see something a 
little more foreboding -- a carbine like the one Booth meant to take on his 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Herold took a gun but Booth declined, claiming he couldn't carry one because of 
his broken leg, which forced him to stop at Dr. Mudd's house at about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the staff at the Surratt Tavern, which takes no sides regarding the 
guilt or innocence of the conspirators, the Mudd Society offers tours of Dr. 
Mudd's Waldorf, Md., home from the premise that he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of April 15, 1865, after the doctor set Booth's leg on the 
velvet sofa in the parlor he sent him upstairs to rest in the spare bedroom now 
called the Booth Room. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Mudd should have been sent to prison is still being debated by 
historians. Booth apparently knew the doctor's name when he knocked on the door 
that April morning, and evidence shows that the two had met before. 
</P>
<P>
It is also known that Booth wore false whiskers when he arrived at the doctor's 
house after shooting Lincoln, and it is possible that Mudd didn't recognize 
Booth. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, after serving four years of a life term Mudd was pardoned by 
President Andrew Johnson in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
The law finally caught up with Booth at Garrett's Farm four miles outside Port 
Royal, Va. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused. Although some historians 
claim that he committed suicide, he most likely was shot and killed by Union 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The only tangible evidence of Booth's Waterloo is a historic marker in the 
median strip of U.S. 301. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Garrett place where John Wilkes Booth, assassin of Lincoln, was 
cornered by Union soldiers and killed April 26, 1865. The house stood a short 
distance from this spot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
