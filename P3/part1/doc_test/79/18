Children tend to regard nonfiction books as spinach or lima beans. They may be 
good for you, but they're hard going down. 
</P>
<P>
Too often the children are right. Although the nonfiction written for them may 
be as full of significant facts as spinach is of vitamins, frequently the books 
are dry, boring and unappetizing. 
</P>
<P>
In the right hands, though, nonfiction for children can be as riveting and 
dramatic as any storybook or novel.

Take Aliki's The King's Day: Louis XIV of France (Thomas Y. Crowell: $13.95; 32 
pp.), a picture book aimed for 7 to 11-year-olds. The author-illustrator 
examines life in 17th-Century France by following the brilliant and pampered 
Sun King during a typical day at Versailles. While the facts may be true, the 
story reads like a fairy tale. "Louis XIV was every inch a king," begins Aliki. 
"He wore the curliest wigs, the richest robes, the rarest jewels, and the 
fanciest shoes in all of France." The rituals of Louis' court are as 
fascinating as the king's extravagance, which Aliki captures in her charming 
drawings -- full of plumes and buttons and lace. Like all good fairy tales, the 
book even has an implicit moral: It is better to be a king than a courtier.

The California Gold Rush of 1848-1852 is another historical period in which 
life was as colorful and mythical as fiction. Rhoda Blumberg, an award-winning 
author of history books for children, brings this subject to vivid life in The 
Great American Gold Rush (Bradbury Press: $16.95; 144 pp.). During the Gold 
Rush, the 19th-Century equivalent of today's lottery, argonauts dug up a 
quarter of a billion dollars of gold. Like those who play the lottery, though, 
most wound up with only hard-luck stories for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Blumberg quotes from the letter of one disappointed miner: "Say to all my 
friends: Stay at home. Tell my enemies to come." The author describes the many 
hardships the gold-seekers faced, especially the difficulties of crossing the 
continent to California, either overland by wagon train, around the Cape Horn 
by ship, or by ship and mule or canoe in "shortcuts" through Panama and 
Nicaragua. Blumberg is more interested in the broad sweep of the Gold Rush than 
she is in individual stories, but she quotes from diaries and letters to give 
the era color and detail. The book is also richly illustrated with paintings, 
sketches, and cartoons of the period. 
</P>

The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) is as romantic a historical event as the 
California Gold Rush, but one that American history textbooks scarcely mention. 
Few high school students know that about 3,000 idealistic Americans joined 
volunteers from around the world to help save the republic of Spain from a 
Fascist takeover. More than half the American volunteers were killed or 
seriously wounded in the fight to preserve Spain's democracy and warn the world 
of the Nazi danger menacing Europe. Two new books for older children recount 
this often neglected chapter of our history: Don Lawson's The Abraham Lincoln 
Brigade: Americans Fighting Fascism in the Spanish Civil War (Thomas Y. 
Crowell: $11.95; 160 pp.) and William Loren Katz and Marc Crawford's The 
Lincoln Brigade: A Picture History (Atheneum: $14.95; 84 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
In this case words tell the story better than pictures. Lawson not only 
provides a richer historical context for understanding the Americans' 
experience in Spain, but his decision to focus on one American couple who 
volunteered -- Robert Merriman and his wife Marion -- makes his book more 
compelling reading. Merriman, who was killed in the Spanish civil war, was also 
the model for the fictional Robert Jordan in Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell 
Tolls." Merriman's personal story gives Lawson's history an intimacy and 
tension that Katz and Crawford's book lacks. Their book, however, quotes a 
broader range of volunteers and is particularly good in describing the racial 
harmony of the Lincoln Brigade, which was the first fully integrated U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
The bravery and idealism of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade inspired a generation 
of young Americans in the '30s. A half-century later the brigade still stands 
as a powerful example of sacrifice and heroism.

The columnist Erma Bombeck and photographer-writer Jill Krementz have found 
role models of courage closer to home -- in children fighting life-threatening 
diseases. In I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to 
Boise(Harper &amp; Row: $16.95; 185 pp.), Bombeck writes about children 
surviving cancer. In How It Feels to Fight for Your Life (Little, Brown: 
$15.95; 132 pp.), Krementz interviews and photographs children with serious 
illnesses or disabilities. Both books portray the emotional resilience of 
children and demonstrate the importance of attitude in fighting sickness and 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bombeck started out writing a pamphlet to show that not every child who gets 
cancer dies. Two years later she has written a moving book about "children 
fighting a disease some of them can't even spell." Although many people persist 
in thinking of cancer and death as synonymous, the fact is, today, 40-to-90% of 
kids with cancer survive. Bombeck set out to find the strength and optimism 
that enables children to conquer the disease. 
</P>
<P>
She is particularly drawn to the dark humor and zany antics that children 
employ to cope with their illness: the artificial-limb jokes, the contest to 
see who can wait the longest to throw up during chemo, the crazy answers to 
explain what happened to their hair. Bombeck's breezy style is well suited to 
conveying the gutsiness of the cancer patients, who deserve, she writes, 
"better than buckets of tears and public pity." In her effort to be "upbeat" 
and "optimistic," she sometimes slights the pain, fear and bewilderment of the 
cancer experience, but her interviews, and the many letters she quotes from 
children and their families, provide real examples of hope and courage. 
</P>
<P>
Krementz's book has no good jokes or kooky stories, but it is a more balanced 
book about children facing illness. Ten-to-15% of children in the United States 
have some form of chronic health impairment. Krementz focuses on 14, with 
illnesses ranging from asthma and diabetes to epilepsy and cancer. One boy 
suffers from accidental burns, another from a gunshot wound that severed his 
spinal cord. Whatever the specifics of their illness or disability, the 
children have many emotional reactions in common: They talk about feelings of 
aloneness, helplessness, and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Children suffering from severe or chronic health problems will especially 
appreciate Krementz's book, for it captures truths about illness that only 
young patients can convey. One thoughtful, articulate young girl suffering from 
cancer emphasizes how important it was for her to meet and talk with another 
young girl who had just completed chemotherapy treatments. "One of the 
requirements for a medical degree should be to have had a serious illness," she 
comments later. Another 14-year-old boy with congenital heart problems says 
about his open-heart surgery: "One thing I can say for sure is that now I know 
how to fight for my life and never give up hope." 
</P>
<P>
The power of these witnesses is not just their insight and courage, but that 
they have survived. Inspiration for adults as well as children.
