Take notice that on October 21, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;32&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon certain pipelines, measurement and regulating stations, compressor
stations, and rights-of-way as well as certain firm transportation points, all located within Boone, Kanawha and
Raleigh Counties, West Virginia by sale to Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation (Cabot), all as more fully set forth in the
application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The facilities that CNGT proposes to abandon were transferred to CNGT from its predecessor, (now Hope Gas, Inc.) effective
January 1, 1984. The transfer and classification of assets was approved by the Commission in Docket No. CP80&hyph;346&hyph;000
on December 20, 1983. Facilities constructed since 1984 have been added under CNGT's blanket certificate granted

The facilities are currently used to gather and transport gas for CNGT's system supply and to render interruptible
transportation service for various shippers. In addition, CNGT provides firm transportation for Hope Gas, Inc.
(Hope), an affiliate of CNGT. Hope makes sales to individual consumers along the facilities and has its own distribution
facilities connected to the facilities. No interruption of Hope's consumer service will occur.
