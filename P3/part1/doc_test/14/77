FUNNYMAN STEVE ALLEN FINDS AMERICA'S 'DUMBTH' ANYTHING BUT FUNNY

What's the world coming to? A lot of Americans don't know where Mexico is. They 
think Delaware is a city. Asked to name a tribe that has invaded England, they 
answer, "The Aztecs." They ask actor Robert Young for medical advice, just 
because he played Dr. Marcus Welby on television, and they write letters to 
Kentucky Derby winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Not the jockey, not the trainer, but the horse," said an incredulous Steve 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
With a look of inspired mystification, the veteran comedian-author-songwriter 
paused in his description, bolstered by studies and personal experiences, of 
creeping dumbness in America to picture somebody actually writing a letter to a 
horse. "Something like, 'Dear Seabiscuit. . . . Thanks for winning the Kentucky 
Derby. I won 28 bucks on you. Keep up the good work. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Allen's audience at Caltech chortled appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people are dumber now than they have been in a very long time," 
said Allen, who has written a book called "Dumbth" on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 68, has come a long way since he commanded a squad of wacky characters 
in the NBC Studios in New York, on the original "The Tonight Show." In those 
days, more than 30 years ago, Allen might have traded gibes with some New 
Jersey cheerleaders in the audience, hooked himself up to a vibrating 
girth-reducing machine or chatted amiably with entertainers Steve Lawrence and 
Eydie Gorme, before diving into a nine-foot vat of Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the Beckman, Caltech's airy, wedding cake-shaped auditorium. The 
antic "Steverino" (as one character on "The Tonight Show" used to call him) of 
the 1950s and 1960s seems to have given way in this sedate hall to a pleasant, 
thoughtful social critic. He's here to talk about a deterioration of basic 
intelligence in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Dumbth" (Allen's own term) is a spreading incompetence, illiteracy and 
gullibility across the land. "It's a combination of ignorance and stupidity, 
plus some unidentified ingredients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't any New Jersey cheerleaders here tonight. The sold-out audience of 
1,164 is mostly middle-aged -- many of them scientists, teachers and 
technicians -- with enough concentrated brainpower to turn out an encyclopedia 
in two hours flat. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics, sat in the same row with Paul 
MacCready, the visionary inventor of a human-powered airplane and solar-powered 
car. Caltech faculty and members of Southern California Skeptics, co-sponsor of 
the event and recipient of its proceeds, jammed the center of the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow or other, though, the laughs just kept bubbling up from somewhere in 
Allen's restless psyche. 
</P>
<P>
He handled some written questions from the audience, talking about the sources 
of his inspiration (he doesn't know what they are), his syndicated show "Host 
To Host," shown locally on KABC-TV, and the things that make him laugh (Dan 
Quayle). 
</P>
<P>
"As a group, you're a little on the flaky side," he said, riffling through a 
stack of question cards. He read one of them. " 'What is a semiconductor?' I'll 
give you a definition by example. I would say Lawrence Welk." 
</P>
<P>
Another one, purportedly from Jesus Morales of Tijuana, asked: "If Jesus was 
Jewish, how come he had a Mexican name?" 
</P>
<P>
Then he did what he always appeared most comfortable doing on stage (or screen) 
-- noodling on the Steinway while he gabs into a microphone. "Every few years, 
there's a hit song or two in which the singer's heart is breaking because 
something reminds him of a lost love," Allen said, playing a few bars of "These 
Foolish Things." "But why is it that nobody writes about the bad memories?" 
</P>
<P>
Somebody has, of course. Allen launches into his own version of the 1936 
standard. "A greasy meatball that's all cold and moldy . . . A stupid song 
that's now a golden oldie. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The audience responds as delightedly as if it were 1956 and they had all 
traveled on a lark to the television studio at Rockefeller Center, taking the 
bus through the Lincoln Tunnel or riding the subway in from Brooklyn -- which 
some of them, at earlier times in their lives, actually had done. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised on Steve Allen," said retired physics professor Herb Segall, a 
transplanted New Yorker, after the show. "He was spontaneous, he was witty. . . 
. " Actually, Allen, an owlish man in a plaid jacket, long ago staked a claim 
on the affections of the thinking public. Besides his late-night television 
high jinks, he has written books, scores for musicals, hit songs and a play, 
"The Wake," which won a Los Angeles drama critics' nomination as the best play 
of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who snapped up the tickets for the performance at the Beckman 
remembered him most fondly for creating and hosting the PBS-TV series "Meeting 
of Minds," in which historical figures such as Galileo, Cleopatra, Darwin, 
Ulysses S. Grant and Marie Antoinette talked and debated about international 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always serious, but people didn't know about it," Allen said. "If you do 
a comic monologue, you may be seen by 27 million people, whereas, if you write 
a serious book or a serious song, you may be home alone with a tape recorder or 
a piano."
