<P>
NASA's long-delayed shuttle launch of the Galileo mission to Jupiter, already 
several years behind schedule because of the Challenger disaster, now faces a 
legal battle that could jeopardize next month's scheduled launch. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington-based public interest law firm, the Christic Institute, and 
several other organizations plan to file suit today in Washington in an effort 
to block the launch. The suit -- which climaxes several months of growing 
concern over the safety of the launch -- will argue that the launch will 
endanger the public because an accident could release 48 pounds of highly 
radioactive plutonium 238 carried aboard Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
The plutonium is used to generate electric power to run Galileo's many 
components. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was a terrible idea" to launch the shuttle Atlantis with Galileo 
and its radioactive generators in its cargo bay, said Lanny Sinkin, an attorney 
with the institute. National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials 
have said the plutonium is packaged in such a way that even an explosion like 
the one that destroyed Challenger would not likely release significant amounts 
of the deadly substance, but Sinkin believes the risk is just too great. 
</P>
<P>
The battle promises to be a bitter one, and it has even divided the community 
that would normally be expected to stand united against a launch carrying 
radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
"After going through mountains of material and soul-searching, I am comfortable 
with the launch," said Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst with the 
Federation of American Scientists. Aftergood, who has led the fight to block 
the use of orbiting nuclear reactors, has personally watched some of the many 
tests that NASA has used to evaluate the safety of the generators. He said he 
is "persuaded that the safety risks are small and the scientific payoffs are 
large." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to see it go forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is safe or we wouldn't propose to launch," said John Casani, 
longtime manager of the Galileo program and now a top executive with NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Williams, who will command the Atlantis, said he isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have looked at this quite a lot, and I'm convinced in my own mind 
that it's absolutely safe to fly," Williams said at a recent Florida press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Challenger explosion, Chernobyl and the Valdez accident, we have 
learned that technology can go terribly wrong," Bruce Gagnon of the Florida 
Coalition for Peace and Justice said. The coalition is expected to be a party 
to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will challenge the adequacy of NASA's environmental impact report, 
which declares the risk minimal. A federal interagency panel, however, does not 
rule out the possibility that some cancer deaths could occur if the plutonium 
is somehow pulverized and released into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis is scheduled for launch Oct. 12. If the suit delays the launch 
past Nov. 24, the mission will have to be postponed for 18 months because it 
will be that long before the planets are aligned in a way that would make the 
encounter possible. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the White House Office of Science and Technology formally 
approved the launch, setting the stage for the coming legal skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's opposition has been motivated partly by the space agency's lack of 
credibility in the field of risk-benefit analysis, as demonstrated by the 
Challenger disaster, and partly by defection by some respected members of the 
space community. Richard Cuddihy, a radiation expert and a member of the panel 
that recommended that the White House give its required approval for the 
launch, has filed a minority report claiming that the launch "puts a large 
number of people at risk." 
</P>
<P>
"Our real bottom line is, go find an alternative to the plutonium," Sinkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But NASA and independent experts contend that there is no alternative. Galileo, 
like 22 other space probes launched with radioactive generators, will operate 
in areas so far from the sun that solar energy is not practicable. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo will have two "radioisotope thermoelectric generators," each powered by 
24 pounds of plutonium 238. As it decays, the plutonium gives off heat that is 
converted directly to electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The same type of power plant was used aboard the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which 
recently capped a 12-year tour of four outer planets last month when it zipped 
past Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike all the other space probes with nuclear generators, Galileo is to be 
the first launched by the shuttle. The fight to block the launch is fueled 
largely by memories of the Challenger fireball over the Florida coast four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although 22 spacecraft using a total of 38 radioisotope generators have been 
launched, the record is not without its blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. navigational satellite failed to reach orbit April 21, 1964, and its 
power supply disintegrated in the atmosphere "as it was designed to do in case 
of re-entry," Aftergood noted in a position paper on Galileo. The accident 
"tripled the worldwide inventory" of plutonium 238 and "increased the total 
world environmental burden from all plutonium isotopes by about 4%." A federal 
report predicted that six fatal cancers would develop as a result of that 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
NASA maintains, however, that it has taken great precautions with the Galileo 
probe, significantly reducing any risk to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Plutonium is most dangerous when it is in the form of a fine powder because it 
is most harmful when it is inhaled. Once inhaled, a single particle can produce 
fatal cancer by irradiating nearby cells. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce that danger, the plutonium carried aboard Galileo is in 72 solid fuel 
pellets encased in metal. The fuel itself is in a ceramic form, so even if the 
generator is destroyed the debris should consist mainly of larger particles 
that if ingested by humans will tend to be excreted, safety officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the space agency, the federal Department of Energy has subjected 
generators to pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square inch, although the 
maximum explosion in the Challenger has been estimated at 400 pounds per square 
inch, and the coating that surrounds the pellets remained intact, according to 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The generators have been shot with bullets made of material that would simulate 
fragments from various shuttle components. They have been exposed to intense 
fire for up to 10 minutes and slammed into steel and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The tests show that under some circumstances, some fuel would be released, so 
the space agency's own findings do not rule out the possibility of some hazard 
in the event of a major accident. NASA has maintained that the risk is 
extremely low, and even an explosion on the launch pad would release only 
enough radiation to cause "0.7 fatalities." 
</P>
<P>
However, a federal Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel found NASA's 
estimates too low and concluded that a launch accident could result in 80 fatal 
cancers. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest risk could come months after a successful launch. 
</P>
<P>
The space probe's solid-fuel rocket propulsion system is not powerful enough 
for Galileo to fly directly to Jupiter, so the spacecraft will fly first to 
Venus and then pass by the Earth twice, using the two planets' gravitational 
fields to boost its speed so that it can venture far out into the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
The second near-Earth encounter will bring the probe within 200 miles of the 
surface, and if the craft should somehow re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and 
break up in a fireball, more plutonium could be released in a more hazardous 
powdery form than even a massive explosion on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
The interagency panel estimated that an accidental re-entry into the Earth's 
atmosphere could produce from zero to 2,000 cancer fatalities.
