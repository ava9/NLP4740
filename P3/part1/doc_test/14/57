FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Frederick Douglass - New Jersey State Opera

Newark is a romantic and vital place, easily reached from New York by
overground or underground train, architecturally explorable, ethnically
diverse. The biggest Portuguese community outside Lisbon lives there.
Italians abound. And opera in Newark is attended by an eager audience in
which English is the last language overheard.
The only big new opera to have been staged in or around New York this season
is Ulysses Kay's Frederick Douglass, which was put on by the New Jersey
State Opera for a single performance in Newark's Town Hall. It's a grand
Roman theatre, seating 2,700. One of the company's specialities is verismo -
Iris, Lodoletta, Zanetto, L'amico Fritz - performed under a conductor,
Alfredo Silipigni, who knows the traditions. Another is loyalty to singers
abandoned by the Met: it was in Newark that I heard Birgit Nilsson sing her
last Turandot, with Licia Albanese as Liu; and an Attila with Jerome Hines.
This season a Carmen with Fiorenza Cossotto was billed, but it fell through.
So did the second performance of a star-cast Lombardi, Bergonzi the tenor; I
made the trek to Newark only to find a 'Performance cancelled' sign on the
door. Money had run out, as in this country it is running out for musical
enterprise of all kinds.
But Frederick Douglass reached the stage, if only for a single performance.
The Mayor of Newark, Sharpe James,appeared as a super. I wish I could write
that it was a triumph; instead, I can find nothing to praise. I thought it
an incompetent opera. Douglass - a hundred years ago this identifying would
not be necessary - was an escaped slave whose oratory and whose published
Narrative (Penguin keeps it in print) stirred both the US and Europe. The
Narrative tells of a youth whose free, active mind rejected the notion that
he and his fellows should be lifelong a white man's owned chattels. William
Garrison, the great abolitionist, wrote truly that 'he who can peruse it
without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit, must have a
flinty heart.'
David Blake's Toussaint, Thea Musgrave's Harriet, and Anthony Davis's X have
given differing examples of how such matter can be more worthily treated. By
comparison with those operas, Frederick Douglass seems cheap and unworthy.
Kay and his librettist, Donald Dorr, concocted a clumsy, long-winded drama -
untrue to history, crudely and conventionally 'operatic', wholly
unconvincing - about how Douglass in his last years, ambassador to Haiti,
was brought low by a conspiracy of Washingtonians resentful of a black man's
eminence. Donizetti and Verdi would had have rejected it as ineffectual.
The libretto is poetastry, and Kay's music drones on and on in Puccinian
arioso without Puccini's command of melodic gesture. Kevin Maynor sang the
title role, and the veteran dramatic soprano Klara Barlow was Mrs Douglass.
Should we hail the show as homage to an elderly black composer (Kay was born
in 1917), or deplore it as time, money and talent spent on something
artistically worthless and unworthy?
