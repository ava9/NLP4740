The space shuttle Atlantis may have been damaged when a 70-pound metal beam 
mistakenly left in the craft's engine room fell as the orbiter was being 
hoisted into the launch position, sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
With the shuttle Discovery on track for blastoff Saturday, Atlantis is 
scheduled for launch around Nov. 7 to ferry a military satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-billion space plane was moved from its hangar to the Vehicle Assembly 
Building earlier this week for attachment to a pair of solid-fuel boosters and 
an external fuel tank before rollout to launch pad 39A next week. 
</P>
<P>
A massive yellow sling was attached to Atlantis on Wednesday and two powerful 
overhead cranes picked the shuttle up and then rotated it into a vertical 
position so it could be bolted to its tank and boosters. 
</P>
<P>
But as the nose of the shuttle rose, engineers heard at least three distinct 
thuds apparently coming from inside Atlantis' engine compartment, according to 
the sources. 
</P>
<P>
When engineers were able to gain access to the shuttle's engine room, they 
found a yellow, nine-foot, 70-pound I-beam resting near the floor of the 
cramped compartment. 
</P>
<P>
The metal beam, apparently left inside the engine room by mistake, fell through 
the compartment as Atlantis was rotated into vertical position.
