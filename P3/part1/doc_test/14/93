METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE SEEK INFORMATION ON ELDERLY MISSING 
MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendora police are seeking information from the public that might help them 
find an 81-year-old Glendora man who has Alzheimer's disease, and who has been 
missing since Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses Sheridan Stanton wandered away from his Wabash Street home wearing a 
white straw hat with a red hat band, a pale green silk shirt with a navy blue 
neck tie, blue pants and a charcoal colored suit coat. He also had on brown 
dress shoes, said his daughter, Betty Millican. 
</P>
<P>
"He usually doesn't go anywhere by himself," Millican said. "He walked out the 
door while my mom was making him lunch. He sometimes gets confused and doesn't 
know where he is when he is in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton usually goes by the name Stan, Millican said, but he often does not 
remember his name or his family. He is 5-feet-7, weighs 150 pounds, has white 
hair and hazel eyes. He also has burn scars on his arms, hands, lower face and 
ears, Millican said. Stanton had surgery for throat cancer a week before the 
disappearance and is supposed to be on medication, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has seen Stanton should call the Glendora police at (818) 914-8250.
