Opera North's staging of Boris Godunov, first seen in 1989, has returned
with its glories preserved. Ian Judge's production has been carefully
revived by Jonathan Alver; John Tomlinson is again resplendent in the title
role. It remains a brutally direct, intense account, given razor-sharp focus
by the use of Musorgsky's original 1869 version of the opera - just seven
scenes lasting barely two and a half hours, and each rendered as a vivid
snapshot in a thrilling chronicle of Russian history.
Inevitably one regrets the loss along the way of some of the material
Musorgsky added in his subsequent attempts to make his creation more
politically and operatically acceptable - no Polish act, no character
numbers in the nursery scene. But there is no doubting the dramatic urgency
of the original scheme, or that the narrative thrust of the work emerges
more clearly - the two protagonists of Boris Godunov, it reminds us, are the
tsar himself and the Russian people. It is those two components which the
Opera North account catches so excitingly.
The Coronation scene, the second panel in this particular pageant, finally
set Wednesday's performance ablaze and began to exert the dramatic grip
which never slackened afterwards. The opening at the monastery had been slow
to come to life; in the opening exchanges too co-ordination between stage
and pit was sometimes approximate. But then Paul Daniel's conducting gained
pungency and attack, Tomlinson's first phrases as Boris compelled attention,
and the chorus began to direct its intensity out into the auditorium.
Each of the subsequent scenes contains beautifully crafted, intelligently
thought-out performances - grave, articulate Pimen from Matthew Best, never
at all histrionic; nimble, clear-toned Grigory from Paul Charles Clarke; an
inn scene stacked with cartoon grotesques and headed by Andrew Shore's
larger-than-life Varlaam and Ann Howard's eye-rolling Innkeeper. Jeffrey
Lawton's Shuisky is beautifully fluent, insidiously crafty, Mark Curtis's
Simpleton is uncomplicatedly affecting. Ann Taylor-Morly's Feodor and
Melanie Armitstead's Xenia are attractive, not at all caricatured.
Most of all there is Tomlinson, in wonderful clarion voice, making sure
every word carries through the theatre and wringing every last drop of
theatricality from his haunted visions. It is a masterly portrayal, the true
focus of this compelling production.
English National Opera has revived its 1989 Return of Ulysses, which thus
completes the trilogy of Monteverdi stagings by David Freeman seen in London
over the past two months. In 1989 this struck me as one of the most
heartfelt, powerful and boldly immediate of British Monteverdi productions
in living memory.
Its return aroused excited expectation, which on Wednesday was let down by
plodding, lumpily inexpert musical direction, and by the second-rate quality
of much of the singing. In Monteverdi, staging counts for much - and
Freeman's richly dramatised ensemble vision, at once ancient and modern,
warmly Levantine in its textures, still achieves one of his most
imaginatively expansive and fine-grained pieces of operatic theatre - but
singing counts for no less.
Most of the cast come new to their roles; many of them must be reckoned
simply inadequate Monteverdi singers, at least for a house of Coliseum size.
Among the gods and suitors a number of coarse-toned basses and strident or
cloudy mezzos smirched the picaresque enchantment of every scene in which
they appeared. The feebleness of the Minerva was a particular hardship; the
original performer had been Sally Burgess, gleaming with wit and vocal
lustre, and she was badly missed.
Still, not all is gloom. The old shepherd Eumaeus, one of the most wonderful
smaller roles in this wonderfully well-supplied opera, is taken now by Neil
Jenkins; he is a commanding Monteverdian (I remember with undimmed
admiration his Kent Opera Ulysses in the late 1970s), and his focused energy
and disciplined passion light up the stage.
Paul Nilon's Telemachus is dry-toned but eloquent, Adrian Thompson's
'paunchy cavalier' Irus gruesomely fascinating, Michael Chance's
countertenor Amphinomous a ray of elegance amid the encircling vocal murk.
And for Anthony Rolfe Johnson in the title role and Jean Rigby as Penelope -
the 1989 leading couple, thankfully restored to the revival  - no praise can
be too high. Both sink their beautiful voices and strong theatrical
personalities even more deeply into their roles than first time round; more
than ever, the dark, achingly sad beauty of Miss Rigby's low-register
plaints and the physical and vocal thrill of Mr Rolfe Johnson's
extraordinary stage magnetism provide the show's most arresting and powerful
rewards.
