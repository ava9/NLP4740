FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Penelope rediscovered - Faure's neglected masterpiece

OPERA DE Nantes, one of the strongest of the French regional companies, has
revived Penelope (Monte Carlo, 1913), Gabriel Faure's only opera. It is a
work I have loved with a passion since getting to know it from the score
half a lifetime ago; later encounters via radio broadcasts and then via
recordings with Regine Crespin and Jessye Norman only increased the
enthusiasm.
Penelope is very seldom done (the 1970 production at the Royal Academy of
Music, which I unfortunately missed, is the only one mentioned in the annals
over last two decades). Seeing it a first time in the theatre fulfilled a
wish that lasted, unfulfilled, even longer than Ulysses's absence from
Ithaca. Often, first encounters of this kind contain an element of
disappointment: one comes to understand that there are sound (if not
necessarily admirable) reasons for the absence from the schedules of this or
that favourite rarity.
Not here: after last Friday's performance I insist more forcefully than ever
that this is a crazily neglected masterpiece. Exactly like The Trojans
before it was widely seen, Penelope is an opera enshrouded in critical myth.
Most of the textbooks tell us that it is worthy but undramatic, the late
fruit of a composer who was essentially a miniaturist, a chamber-music
thinker, and above all not a man of the theatre.
In the actual experience none of this is borne out - least of all the
untheatrical charge - but it is easy to work out how such misunderstandings
could come about. Throughout his life Faure's tastes in opera (he was a
committed Gluckian and Mozartian, a clear-eyed but not idolatrous Wagnerian,
and a foe of Italian verismo) and his distaste for obvious effects might be
taken for those of an artistic monk, incapable of even contemplating, let
alone producing, a properly effective (in all senses) theatre composition.
Yet, as Andrew Porter pointed out on this page after that 1970 RAM
production, on those very few occasions when rediscovery has been permitted,
it is exactly the work's reserves of theatrical power, its culmination in
climaxes of elevated grandeur, that can so enthral the newcomer. In truth,
it is a 'quiet' opera (analogously, Faure's is a 'quiet' Requiem). The pace
is moderate - but has Parsifal ever been deemed undramatic on that account?
To begin with, the musical motifs out of which each act is woven seem
undemonstrative, the scoring (which, according to false legend, the composer
left entirely to other hands) discreet, the mood elusive.
In fact, the dramatic pull soon proves inexorable. The late-Faure musical
language elicits an atmosphere of chaste, classical decorum - which in all
three acts is then broken into, fierily, by the incursion of the disguised
dramatic-tenor Ulysses. Penelope is not lacking in 'moments'; indeed, it is
studded with airs, melodic units in the style of late-Faure songs, expanded
in scale and emotional range until the whole opera becomes a tissue of
song-turned-into-opera of ineffable radiance.
The characters are sharply defined: not just the glorious dramatic soprano
(or high-mezzo) title role, or Ulysses, but all of the smaller parts -
nurse, shepherd, quintets of serving-maids and suitors. In spite of his
criticisms of Rene Fauchois's libretto (directed at its wordiness, and the
difficulty of keeping a disguised Ulysses credible for three acts), Faure
reached to its core. As Martin Cooper once wrote, 'In Penelope the
much-vaunted affinity of the French and the Hellenic genius does appear and
finds what may be its classic expression'. What proves so theatrically
unexpected about this affinity is the revelation of the Dionysiac as well as
the Apollonian aspects of Faure's classicism: the fire burning within the
noble edifice.
Penelope is unfashionable: perhaps, like Gluck's mature operas, it always
will be. In presentation it demands focus on the music, on the words (the
intimacy of the Nantes opera house was ideal), on the 'moral' ethos of the
whole dramatic treatment. Any staging that takes a modish 'critical' slant,
that substitutes production tricks for concentration on the performing
powers of the leading players, will surely collapse in ignominy.
The Nantes production had got its values right. It was not an entirely
gimmick-free piece of stagecraft - the producer, Christian Gangneron, put
Penelope and her maids in ancient Greek costume and the suitors in modern
European - but by current French standards its modesty of style was
otherwise startling, and its ensemble was admirably cast. Neither the
Orchestre des Pays de la Loire nor the house chorus is of the front rank;
under the patient, profoundly musical guidance of the veteran French
conductor Jean Perisson, the achievement surpassed all built-in limitations.
The most impressive feat was to find two convincing exponents of Penelope
and Ulysses. Isabelle Vernet, whose song recital at last year's Aix Festival
I praised so highly, is Regine Crespin's star pupil. All who love French
opera must pray that she continues to develop out of the limelight: for in
potential she is the French soprano the world is waiting for.
The voice is not yet 'finished'. Its use is not always free of breathy
impurity. But in warm, tender utterance of words, in unforced stage command,
in emotional shades and nuances, Miss Vernet surpassed all hopes. Mark
Baker, the young American whose Florestan was last year shown to
Glyndebourne Touring audiences, needs to work on his French words, which
were clear but sometimes bluntly accented. The youthful power and freshness
of the tone lent the chastely sculpted phrases a thrilling lift.
The final-curtain cheers, bravos and foot-stamping of the Nantes audience
suggest that the promise of the house brochure had been kept: this was
indeed 'the highlight of the season'. Now it's time for a British house to
take on Penelope.
