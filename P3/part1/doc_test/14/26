Sweeping down over a near-record crowd of 450,000 jubilant spectators, the 
space shuttle Discovery glided in to a triumphant landing here Saturday 
morning, ending a five-day, $375-million mission that National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration officials termed nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
After 79 orbits during which the astronauts launched a $100-million satellite, 
tested a heat radiator for the proposed space station and photographed large 
sections of the Earth's surface in an attempt to monitor environmental damage, 
Cmdr. Michael Coats and pilot John Blaha eased the 195,000-pound Discovery down 
precisely on the center of the long concrete runway here at 6:36 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the third successful shuttle mission since the January, 1986, 
explosion that destroyed the Challenger, Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a veteran 
astronaut and head of the shuttle program, exulted: "We're back." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the crowd seemed to share his view. "It was wonderful. It gave me goose 
bumps and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up," said Jackie Gillespie 
of Lake Forest. "The emotional quiet before it landed was really amazing, with 
everybody holding their breath," added Jim Simpson of Thousand Oaks. "It was 
uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
Coats, 43, Blaha, 46, and crew members James Bagian, 37, Robert Springer, 46, 
and James Buchli, 43, made a brief, emotional appearance before boarding a jet 
for Houston nearly five hours after touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for America," Blaha said. "We have a free country. We have a great 
educational system that produces engineering expertise that allows us to build 
something like this space shuttle. So we're blessed. God bless you and God 
bless America." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief inspection of the Discovery, Truly said that the orbiter and its 
heat-shielding tiles came through virtually unscathed, a sharp contrast to the 
Atlantis mission in January in which the tiles were heavily pitted, most likely 
as a result of insulation that broke free from the nose of one booster rocket 
during separation. 
</P>
<P>
Modifications made to Discovery to prevent insulation from breaking loose were 
apparently successful, Truly said. "The vehicle is as clean as any orbiter that 
I personally have ever seen," he said. "There is almost no visible tile 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seven Missions Planned 
</P>
<P>
The most important goal of this mission, the first of seven scheduled for 1989, 
was the launch of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete a 
globe-girdling communications network that allows the space agency to keep in 
touch with the shuttle during 85% of its orbit. 
</P>
<P>
One TDRS was launched before the Challenger disaster and the second on the 
first post-Challenger flight. Completion of the network will allow the agency 
to close five ground tracking stations for an annual savings of $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
The TDRS system also allowed ground controllers to maintain contact with 
Discovery during its re-entry blackout period when ionized gases prevent normal 
communications with the ground -- the first time such contact has been 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
With the tracking system complete, Truly said, "Now the fun begins," referring 
to a series of science-oriented missions NASA has planned. In April, the 
orbiter Atlantis will launch the $530-million Magellan probe to Venus, which 
will use radar to map 80% of the planet's surface. Other planned scientific 
missions include the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Ulysses mission to orbit 
the sun and the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gamma Ray 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
NASA will also launch Department of Defense payloads in two classified shuttle 
missions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experiment With Rats 
</P>
<P>
After the landing, four crippled rats who were aboard Discovery, as well as 
four others in a control group kept on the ground, were killed with injections 
of sodium pentobarbital. A non-weight-bearing bone in one hind leg of each rat 
was severed before launch in the experiment to learn how fast bones heal in the 
weightlessness of space compared to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 450,000 people who viewed the landing was second in size only to 
the 500,000 who viewed the July 4, 1982, landing of Columbia, the fourth 
shuttle mission, which was also attended by then-President Ronald Reagan. NASA 
officials had predicted only 200,000 would attend this weekend, about the same 
number who had viewed the first post-Challenger landing last October. Many of 
the visitors said they would not have been able to attend had the landing not 
been on a Saturday.
