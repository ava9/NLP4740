Columbia, the shuttle plagued with mechanical problems since April, was pulled 
from its hangar again Saturday night for a trip to the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
In late October, Columbia will undergo the first of what may be several fueling 
tests. If the shuttle passes, its mission to deploy the $150-million Astro 
observatory could get under way in December. 
</P>
<P>
The move was Columbia's sixth since April 22, when it was first rolled out for 
a scheduled May 30 mission. Hydrogen leaks scrubbed that launch, and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration did not get a shuttle in orbit 
until Discovery took off Oct. 6 with the Ulysses solar probe.
