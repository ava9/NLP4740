The oldest living person celebrated her 116th birthday on Sunday with hundreds 
of well-wishers, smiling and eating several slices of cake. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie White didn't seem to notice the greetings sent by Gov.-elect Lawton 
Chiles, or the recorded phone call from former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Once the six-tiered cake was cut, she perked up. 
</P>
<P>
"She's wide awake now," Paul Allen, owner and administrator of Putnam Memorial 
Nursing Home, said as hundreds of well-wishers gathered around to watch her 
enjoy the cake. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan called about an hour before the festivities began on the lawn of the 
nursing home. His remarks were recorded and played back later for the guest of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want you to know there will be a prayer for you in my heart while I'm 
in church," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
White was born in Gadsden County, Fla., on Nov. 18, 1874. Ulysses S. Grant was 
President. 
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Book of Records identifies her as the oldest living person whose 
date of birth can be reliably authenticated.
