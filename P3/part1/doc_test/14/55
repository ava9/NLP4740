The scene outside the Brooklyn Academy of Music suggested a political rally 
rather than an awards ceremony. Self-styled cigarette girls and Marlboro men 
handed out rolled-up "Helmsboros," flyers calling on Philip Morris to cease 
supporting Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and urging a boycott of Philip Morris 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the name invoked most often Wednesday evening at the seventh annual New 
York Dance and Performance Awards (or Bessies as the awards are known) was not 
that of a performing artist but of Helms, whose efforts to impose restrictions 
on National Endowment for the Arts grants have inspired an activist response 
within New York's performing arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Both scheduled hosts for the event -- performance artist Karen Finley (who won 
a Bessie) and actress Danitra Vance -- withdrew to protest the partial 
sponsorship of the evening by Philip Morris Co. Inc. Philip Morris, which also 
supports the Next Wave Festival and a number of other arts events, is a major 
donor to Helms' current re-election campaign and a planned center to store 
Helms' papers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Stephanie French, a Philip Morris vice president, confirmed the 
company's continuing support for the Bessies as well as Helms. "Not all 
viewpoints were represented last night. We support Helms because of our tobacco 
interests. This does not mean we agree with him on other public-policy issues." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the BAM Opera House, the 3 1/2-hour ceremony was evenly divided between 
political pep talks (anti-Helms, outspokenly gay, and in support of an 
unrestricted NEA) and the awarding of the Bessies. 
</P>
<P>
In the performer category, awards went to Arturo Armijo, a dancer with Susan 
Marshall and Dancers; Victoria Finlayson of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; 
Penny Hutchinson, long time dancer with Mark Morris; Jonathon Reisling (now 
with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) for his performances with the 
Jamison Project; Louise Smith, for her performance in Ping Chong's 
"Brightness"; and Gail Turner, for her collective work with Meredith Monk. 
Recipients in this category receive a $500 cash award. 
</P>
<P>
In the category of choreographer/creator, for which $1,500 is awarded, there 
were nine awardees: choreographer Margarita Guergue and musician Hahn Rowe for 
their collaboration "We Were Never There"; the collaborative duo Eiko and Koma, 
for their dance "Passage"; Ulysses Dove for "Episodes," choreographed for the 
Ailey troupe; Karen Finley, for her controversial work "We Keep Our Victims 
Ready"; performance artist Robbie McCauley, for "Sally's Rape"; and Belgium 
choreographer Wim Vandekeybus. Choreographer Garth Fagan and performance artist 
Pat Oleszko were given sustained achievement awards. 
</P>
<P>
Special citations went to Annabelle Gamson, for her reconstructions of Isadora 
Duncan and Mary Wigman dances; Beate Gordon, for her presentations of Asian 
performing arts; and to Martha Wilson, founder and director of the performance 
space Franklin Furnace.
