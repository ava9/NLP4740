SPACE: IT'S THE THIRD TIME SINCE MAY THAT SUCH A PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED.

For the snake-bitten officials of NASA, the third time was not the charm. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time since May, NASA engineers attempted to load liquid hydrogen 
fuel into a shuttle's fuel tanks. And, for the third time, technicians 
discovered a hydrogen leak, forcing them to scrub the oft-delayed launching of 
the shuttle Columbia and the star-crossed Astro observatory. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:38 p.m. PDT, less than an hour after fuel loading had begun and less than 
eight hours before Columbia's scheduled launching at 10:20 p.m., launch 
director Robert Sieck decided that levels of potentially explosive hydrogen gas 
in the aft compartment of Columbia were too high for safety and ordered the 
launching aborted for the second time within a week. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the mission was scrubbed, the level of hydrogen in the compartment 
was about 6,000 parts per million, about 10 times higher than the maximum level 
permissible for a launching. 
</P>
<P>
By late evening Wednesday, engineers still had not identified the source of the 
leak, but space shuttle director Robert L. Crippen said it would be at least 
three or four days before another attempt at launching could be made. "But I 
don't believe that's realistic," he added, indicating that such an attempt may 
be much further in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said also that because of the leak he would probably order a fueling 
test of the shuttle Discovery, which is now on pad 39B awaiting its Oct. 5 
launching with the Ulysses probe, which is to slingshot past Jupiter to go into 
a polar orbit around the sun. NASA has only an 18-day window in October during 
which to launch Ulysses. If it is not launched then, the agency must wait an 
additional 13 months before the planets are in the proper alignment once more. 
</P>
<P>
Such a test would add at least five days to Discovery's already tight 
prelaunching schedule, placing the flight in jeopardy. NASA officials had 
previously been worried by a loss of Freon coolant in Discovery, and the need 
for a test will further compound their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was originally scheduled for launching on May 29, but officials 
scrubbed the liftoff when potentially explosive hydrogen gas was detected 
outside the shuttle and in its aft compartment. Officials ordered a test 
fueling of the shuttle Atlantis in July and found that it also was leaking. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of that leak caused NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly to ground the 
shuttle fleet until the cause of the leaks could be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the 17-inch valve removed from Columbia after the first leak 
indicated it had been contaminated with submicroscopic glass beads that had 
prevented gaskets in the valve from making a tight seal. Although technicians 
have not yet disassembled the valve from Atlantis, it was from the same batch 
as the Columbia valve and Crippen had said earlier Wednesday that it most 
likely was also contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
The newly installed 17-inch valve on Columbia was from a different batch and 
had shown a much lower leak rate during preliminary testing. Crippen said NASA 
was "very confident" that the leak problem had been solved. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were so confidant, in fact, that they canceled a fueling test of 
Columbia because it would have added five days to their already tight schedule. 
That was a gamble that now appears not to have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen noted Wednesday evening that engineers had run leak tests in Columbia's 
aft compartment after the aborted May launching and had not found any leaks. 
Because of that, they assumed that the excess hydrogen in the aft compartment 
was a result of the leak on the 17-inch valve. That assumption, he conceded, 
was apparently wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Because engineers have already unsuccessfully searched for a leak in the aft 
compartment, the probability of finding it quickly now seems small, he 
admitted. "That's going to be tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's failure to find the leak in the previous tests, as well as 
Crippen's decision not to run a fueling test on Columbia, is certain to bring 
fresh criticism to an agency that is already shell-shocked. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the summer-long grounding of the shuttle fleet, NASA suffered 
acute embarrassment from the discovery that the mirror on its showpiece Hubble 
Space Telescope has an imperfection that will greatly reduce the orbiting 
observatory's scientific usefulness until it can be repaired by a shuttle 
mission in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have twice lost 
contact with the Magellan space probe, which is orbiting Venus.
