The Times calls for the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to assume control 
of the jails currently operated by the sheriff ("Time Is Ripe for Supervisors 
to Assume Control of Jails," Feb. 18). Nowhere, however, does The Times 
indicate how such a move would solve the horrendous problems associated with 
our local detention system. The Times, which also publishes editions in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, suggests this transfer of responsibility only in 
San Diego. Apparently jails operated by the sheriffs of the other Southern 
California counties seem to be very acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The principal area of concern appears to be accountability. We should not 
forget that the elected sheriff is accountable to the very people that the 
elected members of the Board of Supervisors are responsible to -- the people. 
Accountability of elected officials is the cornerstone of a democratic 
governmental system. 
</P>
<P>
As for the board's continuous concern for financial accountability of the 
sheriff, let us not forget that no one has ever asserted that the local jail 
system is funded as it should be. Isn't it somewhat incongruent to demand 
financial accountability on the part of the sheriff while at the same time 
claiming there is insufficient money available to provide even an adequate 
level of security staff? 
</P>
<P>
If county sheriffs can operate jails in the vast majority of other California 
counties, surely, with proper funding and support, the sheriff of San Diego 
County can do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than spend valuable time, effort and public money creating a new 
Department of Corrections, the board, county staff and the sheriff should be 
working in concert to solve our problems. The Board of Supervisors may well be 
able to utilize the political power of the sheriff as an ally in its fight for 
the redistribution of tax revenues to this county. It is far better to take on 
Sacramento with a single focus and a unified front than a fragmented, 
quarrelsome team that won't walk on the same field together. 
</P>
<P>
A county Department of Corrections holds no promise to solve existing problems. 
A well focused team effort on the part of all county elected officials is the 
promise of the future.
