Californians in November will elect a former big-city mayor as governor for the 
first time in more than half a century, to the delight of problem-plagued 
leaders of California's 58 counties and 456 cities who look forward to having 
an experienced ally of local government in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
They will have such a friend regardless whether California voters choose former 
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, a Republican U.S. senator, or former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. Both nominees have already pledged to 
develop a stronger, more sympathetic relationship between state and local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
If they can deliver, their proposals could lead to the most significant 
realignment of governmental powers in California in decades, and certainly 
since the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting 
initiative that precipitated a major shift of power and finance from city halls 
and county courthouses to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson left the state Assembly in 1971 to win election as mayor of San Diego, 
serving in that post through 1982. Feinstein was the chairman of the San 
Francisco city-county Board of Supervisors in November of 1978 when Mayor 
George Moscone was shot to death, and she automatically succeeded to the 
mayor's office. Feinstein subsequently won election to two full terms ending in 
early 1988. Wilson has been president of the League of California Cities, and 
Feinstein has been a league board member. Since San Francisco is both a city 
and a county, her administration also was active in the County Supervisors 
Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have made strong statements of support for local government 
programs. Each has vowed to stop the Legislature's practice of dumping 
additional responsibilities onto cities and counties without giving them the 
money or revenue sources to finance such duties. Each has promised to establish 
an intergovernmental structure to involve cities and counties in the formation 
of state policy and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has gone further than Wilson in supporting the goals of the county 
supervisors -- to suggest, for example, that the state take over all financing 
and administration of welfare from the counties. Wilson told The Times last 
week that he opposes such a move and is more inclined to decentralize welfare 
administration to give counties more discretion in running the system. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also differ over the creation of a split property assessment 
roll to require businesses to bear a bigger share of the property tax burden 
than residences. Feinstein has said a split roll "makes a lot of sense to me." 
Wilson opposed the split roll because, he said, heavier business taxes would be 
bad for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Their differences, however, do not dampen the enthusiasm of local officials for 
having two nominees for governor who have experienced their problems firsthand 
as local administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Donald C. Benninghoven, executive director of the League of California Cities, 
said, "They have been on the firing line. They have been major managers of an 
urban area. They understand what it's all about. We're just delighted to work 
with both candidates in coming to grips with issues that need to be dealt 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Larry E. Naake, Benninghoven's counterpart at the County Supervisors Assn., 
said that George Deukmejian also pledged to work closely with local government 
when he became governor in 1983. He established a local-government liaison in 
the Office of Planning and Research. The system "worked pretty well for a 
couple of years, but now has just sort of petered out," Naake said. While the 
local government emissary was a member of the governor's staff, the office was 
in a building away from the Capitol and did not have the access to power 
enjoyed by staff members within the governor's Capitol compound. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has endorsed the supervisors' proposal for a state-local government 
commission that would be involved in the governor's budget process. Naake noted 
that about $13 billion of the current $42-billion state general fund budget 
"finds its way to or through the counties, but we're out of the process." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has talked of creating a body similar to the federal Advisory Commission 
on Intergovernmental Relations with a less-direct role than the supervisors' 
proposal. But in a meeting with California county sheriffs last week, Wilson 
pledged, if elected, to meet with supervisors and other county representatives 
to review the existing structure of government. 
</P>
<P>
"What we intend to do is make sense of what now makes no sense," Wilson said. 
"It makes no sense for Butte County to be on the verge of bankruptcy, saved 
only by a one-time infusion of state funds. What makes sense is to reorder 
priorities and to say that county governments are to do those things that are 
most important. And the most important in my judgment is public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Benninghoven said the form of the bureaucratic structure is less important than 
the governor's personal commitment to the concept. "The best relationship we 
ever had was way back with Pat Brown when cities and counties sat with the 
Cabinet at regular monthly Cabinet meetings," he said, referring to the 
governorship of Edmund G. Brown, 1959-67. "That has never happened before -- or 
since." 
</P>
<P>
The major problem facing counties is the growth of programs such as welfare and 
the courts. A constitutional mandate that the state pay for new or expanded 
services it requires of local government does not apply to such big-ticket 
programs. Naake said that 65% to 70% of all county income was spent on state 
services 20 years ago. Today, the figure has grown to 95% while county income 
has declined. This has put the squeeze on traditional county services such as 
law enforcement, libraries, parks and health care. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just totally eroding our ability to deal with local demands and local 
services," Naake said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1972 state law incorporated into the state Constitution by the Gann 
spending-limit initiative of 1979 prohibits the Legislature from imposing new 
services from local government without also financing them. But the Legislature 
often skirts the requirement by declaring new laws exempt from the financing 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wilson and Feinstein have promised to end this practice, with Wilson 
vowing to veto any bill that puts a new duty on local government without 
providing the needed money. Feinstein has said there is a need for "reliable 
funding for the mandates so that counties won't have to divert money from 
sheriff patrols, fire protection and other vital day-to-day services to pay for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has not said just where the state would get the money. But in an 
appearance before county supervisors during the primary campaign, she said, 
"There can be much more discretion in deciding on what priorities should be 
addressed and what funds should be used." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said major savings can be achieved through cost controls in the 
provision of medical services to the poor and through preventive health care. 
And local government must be given more authority to set its own spending 
priorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Proposition 13 restrictions, the cities have more authority to 
raise needed revenue than do the counties. Thus, the municipalities' financial 
problems are not as severe. The major challenge facing cities in the 1990s is 
growth management, Benninghoven said. "That will require a very close and very 
sensitive new and more effective relationship between state and local 
government. That's going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the state will have to provide local government with 
long-range direction in the field of land-use planning, Benninghoven said, 
adding: "That's where the state is going to be spending a lot of its 
policy-direction time. . . . I think both candidates frankly realize that."
