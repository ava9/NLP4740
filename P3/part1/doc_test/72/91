A regional commission charged with spending $2.25 billion in sales tax revenue 
to upgrade the county's transportation system on Friday proposed a financing 
plan that would accelerate construction of the improvements and save more than 
$282 million. 
</P>
<P>
The plan could speed up construction of the regionwide transportation network 
improvements by three years, and could accelerate some major projects by as 
many as six years, said San Diego City Councilman Ed Struiksma, a member of the 
San Diego County Regional Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A financial analysis conducted for the commission recommends that it sell bonds 
to raise money for early construction of some large, expensive projects. 
Revenue from the half-cent sales tax increase authorized by voters in November, 
1987, would be used to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Would Increase Cost 
</P>
<P>
In research conducted for the sales tax hike referendum, "the overwhelming 
consensus of cities and towns was that, in those instances where we could 
provide capital improvements -- freeways, roads -- ahead of time, we should 
bond," Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on the borrowed money would increase the cost of the projects by $116 
million, from $1.612 billion to $1.728 billion, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
But freeway users would save $298.8 million from reduced congestion delays, 
$45.3 million by traveling on more direct routes and $54.3 million from the 
lower accident rate that would result by shifting motorists off local roads and 
onto freeways, according to the analysis. Total savings after the $116-million 
cost is subtracted would be $282.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also would save money under the plan by building projects 
earlier, before prices for construction and materials rose, Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 64% of the projects would be built on a pay-as-you-go basis, while 36% 
would be constructed with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Proposition A, the referendum authorized a half-cent sales tax 
increase for 20 years, raising the county sales tax to 6.5%. A subsequent 
half-cent tax hike approved in June to finance jail construction raised the 
sales tax to 7% on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition A revenue is to be split three ways to pay for local street, 
freeway and public transit improvements. Some major projects it will finance 
include the construction of 8.6 miles of California 52 from Tierrasanta to 
Santee, and a six-mile Mission Valley trolley line from San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium to La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is composed of each city's representative to the San 
Diego Assn. of Governments, will meet Friday to decide whether to distribute 
the financing plan for review by governmental agencies countywide.
