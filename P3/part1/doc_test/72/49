SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County began sending out a new pamphlet this week to mental health 
clients and service providers, marking the final settlement of a lawsuit over 
cuts in the mental health budget in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet lists what services the county will provide and includes detailed 
grievance procedures clients can use if they feel they have been unfairly 
denied services. 
</P>
<P>
The grievance procedure was developed to settle the Legal Aid Society of San 
Diego's contention that clients were denied due process when $3.2 million was 
cut from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit's other key contention, that the county was required to give a 
minimum level of service to the mentally ill, became moot in February, 1989. 
Superior Court Judge Robert E. May notified the parties then that an appellate 
court decision in a similar Los Angeles suit would require him to reject that 
argument. Since then, attorneys have been negotiating over the due-process 
issue.
