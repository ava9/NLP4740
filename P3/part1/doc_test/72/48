GOVERNOR NEEDS TO AID MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The images of men, women and children living in cardboard and tarp-covered 
hooches with no running water or toilet facilities have faded somewhat from the 
public eye. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year when county health officials were forcing landowners to 
dismantle the makeshift migrant camps in the canyons and hillsides of North 
County, pictures of the migrants' plight were plentiful in the media. San 
Diegans were frequently forced to face a long-ignored problem. 
</P>
<P>
The reminders are fewer, now that some of the camps have been closed. But the 
problem has not lessened. Perhaps as many as 15,000 migrants, most of whom are 
now legal residents, remain homeless, according to some estimates. That's three 
times the size of the county's non-migrant homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
We hope Gov. George Deukmejian will remember this and look back at the 
newspaper and television accounts of the camps as he is deciding whether to 
approve $500,000 in seed money for migrant worker housing for San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first state money for migrant housing San Diego County has 
received, despite the fact that the county ranks 12th in California in volume 
of agricultural products. Why the county is so far behind in building migrant 
worker housing is difficult to pin down and varies depending on whom you talk 
to: The state rules are too restrictive, the land is not available or there has 
been little local support. This last reason was cited by Deukmejian last year 
when he vetoed a similar $500,000 budget item. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not that was the real reason for the veto, there is some truth to 
the accusation. Local officials have never applied for state money. Migrant 
housing has not been a priority. 
</P>
<P>
But that has begun to change, in part because so many of the migrants are now 
legal residents -- more than two-thirds, according to the U. S. Border Patrol 
-- under the amnesty program. Farmers and growers are worrying that they may 
lose newly legal workers to less backbreaking jobs, and they see housing as a 
possible way to keep workers in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Also fueling the interest have been complaints about the health risks posed by 
makeshift migrant camps and the decision by county health officials to close 
many of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
This prompted Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to put together a 
broad-based working group of government and community leaders to look for ways 
to provide housing and to marshal the support necessary to persuade the 
governor to approve this year's budget request. Group members see some 
progress, but little can be accomplished without money. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000 that Frazee has shepherded through the Legislature won't shelter 
many people. But with the 25% required match from local government and money 
from federal and private sources, housing officials think the $500,000 can be 
leveraged into as much as $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even that will not go far. But it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed now is a show of local support, one too strong for the governor 
to ignore. Five members of the county's legislative delegation have co-authored 
Frazee's bill, and the county and the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas and 
Oceanside have formally endorsed the funding request. Resolutions are pending 
in a couple of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The show of support should be unanimous. It's time to remember the faces of the 
migrants living in the brush and to put an end to years of neglect.
