GROWER EXPECTED TO GET PERMITS FOR FARM-WORKER HOUSING

After months of regulatory delay, a major grower in North San Diego County is 
expected to be granted county building permits next week to begin construction 
of much-debated housing for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
The planned housing, which has generated considerable interest throughout 
California, is being built by Oceanside-based Singh Farms with the stated 
purpose of avoiding the defection of laborers newly legalized under the 
government immigration amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the West, growers long dependent on undocumented labor have voiced 
concern about the prospective loss of newly legalized farm workers who may 
decide to take jobs in less-taxing and better-paying industries. With spring 
and summer approaching, officials are watching the labor market closely. 
</P>
<P>
While praised by farm groups and some farm-labor advocates, the proposal by 
Singh Farms also ran into strong opposition from area residents concerned about 
clutter, crime, traffic and other problems. Some activists also expressed fears 
that such housing could be used for future "guest workers" to be brought in 
from Mexico especially for farm-labor tasks. Company officials denied any such 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The considerable opposition resulted in lengthy delays for a project that was 
first expected to be built last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a series of hearings and appeals, Singh Farms appears to have 
passed its final hurdle. The building permits are expected to be granted next 
week, said Gloria Kelly, regional planner with the San Diego County Department 
of Planning and Land Use. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the $1.5-million facility should be completed in about five 
months, said George Williamson, a planning consultant for the project. Grading 
has already begun on the 4-acre site in rural Bonsall, next to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the permits are pulled, they want to start getting that thing up," 
said Williamson, who works with the Lightfoot Planning Group in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to house more than 300 workers, is to include a pair of 
two-story residential buildings, each outfitted with bunks. Other rooms will be 
used for dining, laundry, storage, bathrooms and recreation, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The housing will be open only to workers for Singh Farms, which cultivates 
about 700 acres in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to various concerns, Williamson said, Singh has agreed to make a 
number of modifications to its initial plans. Among other things, he said, the 
company will now provide more street lights and expanded recreational areas, 
and will make added improvements in streets. 
</P>
<P>
The planned housing development for migrants has not spawned any copycat 
</P>
<P>
proposals in San Diego County, where thousands of farm workers live outdoors in 
crude shacks and hovels that, experts agree, constitute some of the worst 
migrant-labor living conditions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of employers who might have thought about providing housing 
looked at the incredible hassle that (Singh) went through and decided they 
wouldn't want to go through the same thing," said Wendy Dietrich-Benz, 
executive director of the San Diego County Farm Bureau, an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's $500-million farm industry ranks it among the nation's 
top-20 agricultural counties, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Although conditions in barracks-type farm-worker housing has often been found 
to be substandard, migrant advocates note that it is still a considerable 
improvement over living in the brush. Also, the facilities are subject to state 
and federal inspection.
