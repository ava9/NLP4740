</P>

<P>
Hoping to thwart protests planned in San Diego this weekend by anti-abortion 
activists, ACLU officials have obtained a federal court order to prevent 
protesters from blockading medical clinics where abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, including 
those from San Diego and Imperial counties, said they obtained a statewide 
preliminary injunction from U. S. District Court Judge A. Wallace Tashima in 
Los Angeles on Monday. The action was in anticipation of anti-abortion protests 
targeted for one or more clinics in the San Diego area Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU officials said they will ask Tashima to levy fines of up to $10,000 
against any protester violating the injunction, said Betty Wheeler, legal 
director of the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties is taking legal steps, in 
conjunction with the ACLU of Southern California, to make sure that all women 
in San Diego County will be able to exercise their constitutional right to 
reproductive choice . . .," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vigorously Pursue Proceedings' 
</P>
<P>
"The ACLU will vigorously pursue contempt proceedings against those persons who 
. . . deprive others of their constitutional rights," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary injunction, demonstrators will be barred from trespassing 
or forming blockades on the property of medical facilities that perform 
abortions and other family-planning services. They will also be banned from 
conducting so-called sidewalk counseling, which the clinics claim is a tactic 
to impede the movement of their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest will be sponsored by Project Rescue in San Diego, a local 
branch of the national group called Operation Rescue. The national group gained 
widespread attention for its practice of forming human blockades to prevent 
women from entering clinics, as well as for its participants' willingness to go 
to jail for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Abortion Clinics Closed 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Operation Rescue activists were responsible for closing two 
abortion clinics in Los Angeles in February, and another protest is scheduled 
there from March 22 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such closures of San Diego clinics, ACLU officials said they decided 
to seek the court order to make sure women will not be barred from medical 
services this weekend, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU chapters sought the order on behalf of medical providers such as 
Planned Parenthood and Womancare, Wheeler said. Other states have used such 
orders to ensure that women have full access to clinics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego clinics are also planning to have volunteer guards on hand to escort 
women through protesters and into the medical offices, said Patricia O'Neil, 
associate director of Womancare. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the federal court order, Project Rescue officials have said they will 
continue their efforts to discourage women from obtaining abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to stop the slaughter of unborn babies from conception to birth, 
those participating in Project Rescue will passively, repentantly and 
peacefully block the entrances of abortion clinics with their bodies," San 
Diego organization leaders stated in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescue Efforts 'Not Militant' 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Mick McCoy, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of East San 
Diego County and one of the clerics involved in Project Rescue, said Tuesday 
that the group's efforts are "not militant." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a peaceful, nonviolent attempt to stop the murder of unborn children," he 
said, distinguishing his group from more militant anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy could not say if the preliminary injunction would prevent some 
anti-abortion activists, most of whom are Christians, from joining the protest 
Saturday. But he said it is a "shame" for those who want to protect an "unborn 
child from death to receive a criminal charge for that." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil of Womancare disputed the assertion that the blockades and sidewalk 
counseling against medical clinics have been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the nation, it's not been anyone's experience that they are peaceful 
protesters," O'Neil said. "It's violence against women who are being publicly 
humiliated for a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Lowe, director of community affairs for Planned Parenthood of San Diego 
and Riverside counties, said it is a "miscalculation on the part of Operation 
Rescue organizers that the public will stand for such action. . . . Women 
resent someone else making this a public issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Hundred Expected 
</P>
<P>
Project Rescue organizers said they expect several hundred anti-abortion 
activists to attend a rally on Friday at the Youth for Christ Conference Center 
in Mission Valley, where the primary speaker will be Joe Schiedler, author of 
"99 Ways to Stop Abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Participants won't be informed of the targeted clinic or clinics until the next 
morning, said Rick Monroe, publisher of "Good News, Etc," a San Diego County 
Christian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
According to Operation Rescue statistics, more than 22,000 protesters have been 
arrested in more than 20 cities in the United States during protests, most of 
whom have been released after a day or so in jail. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU officials, however, hope their federal injunction will "up the ante" and 
discourage the protesters from blocking entrances to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
An Operation Rescue supporter said the large fines stemming from the court 
order won't make a difference to protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"It (protesting) was illegal before and it's still illegal now," said an 
assistant in the Operation Rescue office in Los Angeles who gave her first name 
as Angela. "Nobody pays the fine anyway. We'd rather do jail time than pay the 
fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers for Project Rescue in San Diego say the goal of their protest 
"is not to be arrested, but to save women from being exploited . . . and to 
protect the life of the unborn," McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that means putting ourselves physically between the child and the 
abortionists, then so be it."
