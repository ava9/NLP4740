SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS ARE LEFT OUT 
IN COLD BY COMBO

<P>
Last year, an artist with a dream could apply for money from the county 
fund-raising arm, the Combined Arts and Education Council, also known as COMBO. 
</P>
<P>
This year, there is no point in applying. Money once earmarked for the projects 
of individual artists is no longer there. And so far, no new money has surfaced 
to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect could leave the talented but unaffiliated producers so 
necessary to the growth of San Diego's artistic community without hope. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year National Endowment for the Arts grant earmarked for individual 
artists' projects ran out in December. The $150,000, distributed by COMBO, was 
supplemented by $300,000 from the city of San Diego. The city has since taken 
back its contribution and earmarked it for the newly formed Cultural Arts 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming a lack of sufficient funds to award individuals, Michael Lyon, director 
of community relations for COMBO, said his organization now funds projects for 
groups with at least two years' tax status as nonprofit companies. The 
semiannual allocations, to be announced Monday, include more than $100,000 to 
25 groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon said he lobbied the city to take over the job of funding individual 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cultural Arts Commission, which had considered setting up four support 
levels -- three of them for arts organizations with budgets of $2 million-plus, 
$300,000 to $1,999,999 and less than $300,000 -- indefinitely postponed plans 
for the level that would have addressed the needs of the independents. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Hamilton, head of the Cultural Arts Commission, said the commission 
will process the newly released applications for organizations, due back March 
17, before addressing the issue of individual artists. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission has recommended designing a special-projects category which 
might be a challenge grant or a one-time-only funding program for individual 
artists," Hamilton said. "We have not identified any sources of funding, and we 
don't know what the program is going to look like yet." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Schuette, artistic director of Sushi Gallery, who works largely with what 
she calls "generative" artists (because they generate original work), believes 
the commission will take care of individuals -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Schuette said she's optimistic because people are at least aware that there's a 
need to fund individuals -- a concept, she said, that wasn't around before the 
NEA, the city and COMBO began distributing these funds three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole institution of never funding the generative artist," she 
said. "The generative artist keeps an artistic community healthy. But they've 
always been left out in the cold." 
</P>
<P>
Bary Odom, the new costume director for United States International University, 
found designing costumes for the current USIU production of "My Fair Lady" a 
challenge -- if a sumptuous one. 
</P>
<P>
In his designs, Odom battles the temptation to imitate the lavish, lauded "My 
Fair Lady" costumes of Sir Cecil Beaton, the artist whose works are now on 
exhibit at the San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Odom, whose own designs are wonderfully lavish, said he's admired Beaton ever 
since Beaton photographed the costumes Odom supervised for the film "Nijinsky." 
</P>
<P>
"He was wonderful, inspirational and eccentric, just like the characters in 'My 
Fair Lady,' " Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
Even more challenging than this job, he said, was the time he designed for 
Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so big. By the time you have the barest costume on him, you have 25 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
And the sweetest job? 
</P>
<P>
Fitting Elizabeth Taylor for her first wedding to Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
"She wore a very pretty lemon chiffon affair with tendrils of flowers and 
leaves," Odom recalled. "She was a nice lady, and a beautiful bride." 
</P>
<P>
John Highkin, the director of "Conversations in Exile" at the Big Kitchen 
Dinner Theatre, has a hot date after his twice-extended show continues this 
weekend. The assistant director on the Old Globe Theatre productions of "Tea" 
and "There's One in Every Marriage," will fly to Seattle March 7 to become the 
assistant director to Daniel Sullivan, artistic director of the Seattle 
Repertory Theatre, on Sullivan's adaptation of Carlo Goldoni's "The Servant of 
Two Masters." Highkin, who made the acquaintance of Big Kitchen owner Judy 
Forman when he prepared food, briefly, in her not-so-big kitchen, was 
originally to start work in Seattle this Wednesday. But Sullivan, whose theater 
is represented by two smash-hit New York plays ("Eastern Standard" and "The 
Heidi Chronicles"), had to fly to New York to transfer "The Heidi Chronicles" 
from Off-Broadway to on.

PROGRAM NOTES: Glasnost may be an oft-heard expression at the upcoming Soviet 
Arts Festival, but the concept does not seem to have traveled to the Soviet 
satellite of Czechoslavakia. Renowned playwright Vaclav Havel was sentenced to 
nine months in prison for showing up at a rally to commemorate a student 
protester of the Soviet-led invasion of Prague in 1968. . . . "Sister Mary 
Ignatius Explains It All for You" comes to the Lyceum Space March 3-April 9 via 
Catfish productions, a local independent company. The Christopher Durang satire 
of Catholicism was banned in St. Louis because it upset the Archdiocese there. 
. . . One of the co-authors of "Tango/Orfeo," the newly named third production 
of the La Jolla Playhouse season, is Jim Lewis, who finished his graduate work 
at UC San Diego. His co-author, Graciela Daniele, was the co-director and 
choreographer of "Blood Wedding," which opened the Old Globe Theatre's season 
last year. . . . Sledgehammer Theatre plans to be back in the old Re-In 
Carnation Building on April 20 for "Endgame." The audience will not follow the 
production around in the chilly warehouse as it did in the last Sledgehammer 
production, "Blow Out the Sun," said Scott Feldsher, the company's artistic 
director. Samuel Beckett's play will be performed in a different, warmer part 
of the theater, and the audience will even get to sit.
