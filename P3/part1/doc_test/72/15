A CASE FOR REFORM OF PROP. 13 LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether San Diego County officials "purposely circumvented" Proposition 13 by 
getting the Legislature to allow a simple majority vote on a sales tax increase 
for jails and courts -- as a Superior Court judge recently ruled -- is a 
question of legal definitions best decided by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
But the circuitous route the Board of Supervisors took to get to this point 
illustrates the deteriorating condition of state and local government planning 
and financing, and should concern all San Diego County residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 citizens initiative that slashed property taxes may have saved 
Californians more than $115 billion in taxes in the past 11 years. But 
Proposition 13, along with the restrictions it spawned, has bled vital 
government functions, such as the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County jails hold more than twice their state-rated capacity, and 
thousands of people who should be incarcerated each year aren't. Even the 
approximately 1,600 jail beds that will be added over the next two years will 
be insufficient to meet current needs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans for jails to accommodate growth are stymied. Without 
additional revenue from local or state taxes, county officials have few 
realistic sources to replace the $1.6 billion the sales tax would have provided 
for jails and courts for the next 20 years. That sort of money can't be 
squeezed from current budgets, even if whole programs such as libraries and 
parks are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the Board of Supervisors has direct control over only a 
fraction of the $1.2-billion current budget. The remainder goes for such 
mandated programs as health care and legal defenses for the poor, many of which 
are also under-funded. 
</P>
<P>
The money also is unlikely to come from the state without additional taxes or 
bond measures, because Sacramento is in the same Proposition 13 mire. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sales tax is upheld, however, only the immediate crisis is 
addressed. Until there is meaningful statewide reform of the Proposition 13 and 
spending restrictions, there will be one crisis after another with piecemeal 
solutions rather than rational long-term planning. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way the lawsuit is decided, we hope that a byproduct of the challenge 
is to focus attention on the need for such reform and to build much-needed 
political support for it. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, then the delay caused by the suit might ultimately be worth 
it.
