An Orange County site-selection group has chosen three potential locations for 
a new regional airport, and one of them is in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested south Camp Pendleton site, about 3 miles north of Oceanside, 
would be an international airport serving 10.3 million passengers annually 
beginning in the year 2010, according to a proposal drawn up by Orange County 
Airport Site Coalition. The coalition is looking for a site to relieve crowding 
at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants envision a passenger terminal with 14 gates, as well as cargo 
and general-aviation facilities. The 3,190 acre facility would cost $5.496 
billion. Funding was not spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Pendleton site, the group chose Norton Air Force Base in San 
Bernardino and a location in the Cleveland National Forest northeast of San 
Juan Capistrano as finalists. The Cleveland forest location, a plateau called 
Potrero Los Pinos, is the only one of the three finalists within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials also are considering a second San Diego County site, 
McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, as one of five backup locations in case 
the Camp Pendleton site or the two other finalists they identified last weekend 
-- prove unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement among government officials in San Diego County that 
both Camp Pendleton and McClellan-Palomar are off limits as replacement sites 
for San Diego's Lindbergh Field, and Marine Corps officials say they are 
adamantly opposed to giving up part of Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"Local policy is very clear on both of these sites," said Jack Koerper, special 
projects director at the San Diego Assn. of Governments. "It would be very 
difficult to do politically in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sandag released a study saying that San Diego would have one of the 
nation's most congested airports and lose billions of dollars in forfeited 
economic growth if no new airport for San Diego is built by 2010. The study 
compared the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of Lindbergh 
Field, but did not endorse either. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed alternatives to Lindbergh include two sites in and next to the Miramar 
Naval Air Station and one along the U. S.-Mexican border on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is attempting to find solutions to its airport question inside the 
San Diego region," said Koerper, who headed the study made public Monday, a 
continuing Sandag report of San Diego's airport system. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County, or the Los Angeles area, has taken a different point of view, 
especially Orange County, by looking both inside and outside Orange County for 
solutions to air carrier problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Stan Pederson, a Marine Corps spokesman at Camp Pendleton, said 
Tuesday that senior officers there are sticking by a January statement saying 
they would "strenuously oppose all proposals to locate a regional airport" at 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We will take every measure necessary to prevent this from happening," Pederson 
read from the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just tossing these ideas around," said an aide to San Diego 
Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of a new San Diego airport. "It just 
goes to show you the measure of desperation when it comes to air transportation 
planning in Southern California. It's critical." 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Orange County Airport Site Coalition, meanwhile, said the 
group was "site-neutral" when it chose the three potential locations for a new 
airport at a meeting Saturday in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only concerned with alleviating the year 2010 demand of more than 22 
million air passengers a year in Orange County," Leland Oliver said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In case any of the three chosen sites proved unworkable, the coalition 
fashioned a backup list that included McClellan-Palomar and four other 
possibilities. The group is sanctioned by the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors and has been aided by professional planning consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are not required to adopt the coalition's final recommendations 
or choose any site. However, Oliver said Saturday that the group will work to 
build political pressure on behalf of its final recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sites dropped from consideration was El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
because the coalition's staff concluded that selection of the military base 
would face significant political opposition and that there would be major costs 
in relocating military operations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan-Palomar was projected to be a "short-haul," as opposed to an 
international airport with three gates for up to 2.3 million passengers a year 
beginning in 2005. Though it would continue to handle general aviation traffic, 
it would not have cargo service, according to the consultants. They estimated 
it would cost $619.85 million to expand that airport. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants' projections for all locations assume that the process of 
obtaining money and government approvals would get under way in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport now serves a maximum of 4.75 million passengers annually, 
with a new ceiling of 8.4 million when a new terminal and parking garages are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Although many studies of airport sites have been filed over the years, a new 
search was required under terms of a 1985 court settlement between Orange 
County supervisors and the city of Newport Beach over planned expansion at John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's final report is due in December, Oliver said.
