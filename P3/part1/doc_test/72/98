After initial meetings this week with a San Diego-area delegation, Mexican 
officials have agreed to further talks on the proposed binational airport on 
Otay Mesa, which would be run jointly by Tijuana and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Mexican Communications and Transportation Ministry 
said Friday that the government is willing to discuss the idea, but would 
prefer that U.S. federal officials be included in future talks. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to create an informal joint study group to explore the 
issue further, said delegate Jack Doyle, mayor of Santee and president of the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to have a willingness (from the Mexican government) to participate with 
us in gathering more information is encouraging," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings Thursday and Friday were the first direct attempt to gauge the 
Mexican government's interest in a binational airport, although San Diego 
officials have discussed the possibility intermittently for 20 years. Advocates 
see a binational airport as the best solution to crowding and lack of room for 
expansion at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government's willingness to consider the airport is seen as an 
encouraging sign after reports in August that Communications and Transportation 
Secretary Andres Caso Lombardo opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an ongoing plan and feel that their needs will be adequately met 
with their current plan," Doyle said after meeting with officials in the 
ministry. "However, they said they would be willing to look at other 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to build an airport between Brown Field Air Station on Otay 
Mesa and Tijuana's Rodriguez International Airport. Baja California state 
officials have called for expansion of Rodriguez airport, saying it is crowded 
and needs more air-control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Mexico Project at the University of Southern California has 
termed the airport one of "several worthwhile proposals that have thus far been 
stymied by funding constraints or by the political hurdles to cross-border 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents Reps. Jim Bates (R-San Diego) and Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) 
and San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner say the idea is impractical because of 
jurisdiction complications. 
</P>
<P>
Binational airport advocate Ron Roberts, whose City Council district includes 
Lindbergh Field, has said the critics dismiss the project "without even 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts led the delegation that also included Doyle, County Supervisor Leon 
Williams, Port Commissioner Dan Larsen and Kenneth E. Sulzer, executive 
director of the San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with Gustavo Patino, undersecretary of operations at the 
Communications and Transportation Ministry, which oversees airports, as well as 
Tourism Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell and representatives from the Commerce 
Department, the presidential staff and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
One observer said the Mexican officials appeared interested in the idea, 
although not enthusiastic.
