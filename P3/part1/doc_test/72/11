COUNTY SHORT-CHANGED ON FUNDS, JUDGE RULES

Bolstering San Diego County's claim that the state has shortchanged it by tens 
of millions of dollars in mental health funding, a local judge tentatively 
ruled Thursday that the county has been deprived of its fair share of some of 
those dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In what county officials hailed as a significant decision that strengthens 
their hand in their nearly 3-year-old lawsuit against the state, Superior Court 
Judge Barbara Gamer tentatively decided that the state's method of distributing 
mental health dollars violates a law governing such allocations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction, but it's only the first step," said 
Deputy County Counsel Michael Poynor. "This ruling does not solve San Diego's 
complete mental health needs. Only a complete restructuring of the financing 
formula, so that every county gets its fair share -- nothing more and nothing 
less -- will do that." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the state, emphasizing that Gamer's ruling is only 
tentative and does not directly address the overall equity of the state's 
mental health funding system, characterized Thursday's ruling as a relatively 
small battle in a war that could have statewide implications. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like the county is getting a little ahead of itself, because this is 
not a final decision, and it does not even deal with the fair share and overall 
fairness question," said state attorney Lesley Sive. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to two 1986 lawsuits that San Diego filed against the state concerning 
alleged inequities in the distribution of property taxes and other revenues, 
the mental health suit stems from the county's complaint that its allocation of 
state revenue for that purpose is also vastly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Though county officials concede that the San Diego delegation's lack of 
legislative clout in Sacramento contributed to the predicament, they argue that 
unfair funding formulas -- and the state's failure to adhere to its own 
guidelines -- have dramatically worsened the financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
During earlier hearings, Poynor emphasized that San Diego receives $19 per 
capita annually for mental health services, less than the statewide average of 
$28 and far below the $62 per person awarded to San Francisco County. Since the 
mid-1980s, the gap between San Diego's allocation and the statewide average has 
cost the county about $20 million annually, Poynor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the state's funding discrimination, we have been prevented from 
providing needed care to the mentally ill of this region," county Supervisor 
George Bailey said. "The impact of this unfair situation can be seen on our 
streets every day. This is legally and morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's tentative decision came in the first phase of a two-part trial. In 
the more critical second phase, scheduled to begin late next month, the county 
will ask the court to rule on the legality of the state's overall mental health 
funding formula, which county attorneys contend violates the equal protection 
clauses of the state and federal constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of Thursday's ruling is a 1986 state law specifying that any 
additional mental health dollars beyond those then being received by counties 
should go to under-funded counties such as San Diego. However, rather than 
strictly comply with that measure -- an attempt to at least partly remedy 
funding inequities -- the state actually has sent millions of additional 
dollars to counties such as San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Napa and Alameda 
that already receive allocations in excess of the statewide average, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In tentatively siding with the county on that question, Gamer ruled that the 
state has, in fact, violated the provisions of that law.
