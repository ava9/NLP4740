SDG&amp;E VOWS TO BATTLE BILL SMOOTHING PATH FOR A MUNICIPAL TAKEOVER

San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. officials vowed Friday to strenuously oppose 
the latest legislative effort to make it easier for the government to take over 
the investor-owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hutchens, director of governmental affairs for the company, said the firm 
will try to defeat a bill by Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) in a Senate 
committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was recently amended so that it would allow the county to call for an 
election, at which a majority of voters could approve creation of a 
seven-member County Utility District that could sell bonds and purchase the 
utility. The bonds would be repaid by revenue from utility users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Process 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, the formation of such a district would first require each 
of the county's city councils to vote to place the issue on the ballot. Then 
two-thirds of the voters in each participating city would have to approve the 
measure before the public utility could be formed. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill would also allow the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to 
appoint the original seven members of the public utility's board of directors. 
These members would then be phased out and replaced by elected members during a 
four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Existing law requires that members of a public utility be elected at the same 
time the utility is formed. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens said Stirling's bill was no more than an indirect attack by San Diego 
politicians on SDG&amp;E's proposed merger with Los Angeles County-based 
Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Is This Needed?' 
</P>
<P>
"Our question is, 'Why is this needed?' " Hutchens said. "What makes San Diego 
so different? We already have existing laws on the books which provide for the 
formation of municipal utility districts. Why do we have to go to another 
method?" 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens said recent opinion polls show that most county residents oppose a 
government takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of San Diego County thought that the municipal takeover issue was 
dead and buried," she said. "The merger is the real issue. Yet we have 
legislation like this still coming up in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Deleting the two-thirds vote requirement, Hutchens said, "really takes the 
voters out of the process." 
</P>
<P>
In its earlier form, Stirling's bill would have allowed the San Diego County 
Water Authority to go into the energy business and purchase SDG&amp;E. Stirling 
had all but abandoned that measure amid signs that legislators would not 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, in fact, said last month that the strategy of proposing a public 
takeover of the utility was a "mistake" that had been used by SDG&amp;E as a 
"red herring" to divert attention from the merger issue. 
</P>
<P>
In that interview, Stirling said: "What I've done is make a tactical mistake by 
raising the issue of municipalization so heavily. It's given the Edison people 
a perfect straw man to fight against." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, Stirling said that, despite the political strategy, he 
continues to believe that a municipal utility is the best alternative for San 
Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the municipal utility will provide the best service at the cheapest 
cost," Stirling said. "I think it's important that the voters get their best 
chance at evaluating that and acting on it if they so choose." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Clay, a lobbyist for the County Water Authority, said the bill was changed 
to overcome the objections of state legislators who opposed the measure in its 
original form. 
</P>
<P>
Clay said the bill's provision for a countywide majority vote, rather than a 
city-by-city and two-thirds majority, would prevent the establishment of a 
"patchwork quilt" utility system in which some cities were served by the public 
utility and others by an investor-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it makes more sense to have them all in or have them all out," Clay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill is scheduled to be heard Tuesday in the Senate Agriculture and 
Water Resources Committee. It may also be referred to the Energy and Public 
Utilities Committee, which last month killed another Stirling bill that would 
have provided for an advisory vote of San Diegans before the SDG&amp;E-Edison 
merger could go forward.
