San Diego City Council members Monday authorized leasing city-owned land on 
Otay Mesa to the county for construction of a 200-bed misdemeanor detention 
facility, but the city has yet to settle the nettlesome question of how to pay 
for the much-needed jail. 
</P>
<P>
The city had hoped to win a low-cost loan or a grant from Gov. George 
Deukmejian. But, so far, the only offer from Sacramento is an 8% loan that 
"would cost more than what we can get" elsewhere, said City Manager John Witt. 
"It just doesn't make sense to borrow at 8%," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the $12-million loan would pay for construction and operating 
costs of the jail that would house people who have been arrested for, but not 
yet arraigned on, misdemeanor charges. The lease authorization was needed 
because the jail, which would be built and operated by Florida-based Wackenhut 
Corp., eventually would be turned into a county-owned jail. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who in early April announced that a state loan would be 
available, argued Monday that the state should drop its demand for interest 
payments because "that money belongs to the taxpayers." Borrowing from the 
state at an 8% interest rate "makes no sense," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor's stance clashes with a decision by State Department of Finance 
Director Jesse Huff, according to David Takashima, an aide in Assemblyman Steve 
Peace's office. Peace (D-Chula Vista) had agreed to carry legislation in 
Sacramento that would authorize the loan. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation is on hold because Huff maintains that Deukemejian "can't loan 
money at zero interest," Takashima said. "Clearly the governor's position is 
that it's going to be a loan, not a grant, because a grant would be a gift of 
state money to the city of San Diego," Takashima said. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and other members of the San Diego delegation in Sacramento are waiting 
for the city to decide if it will seek a loan at 8% or lower, Takashima said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the possibility of grant or a state loan at an acceptable interest 
rate seems bleak, the council intends to move ahead with construction of the 
jail, Witt said. The council will incorporate funding of the jail while 
deliberating the city budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The impasse with the state also raises the question of what the city should 
fund with borrowed money, said Councilman Ron Roberts. While borrowing is 
appropriate to cover capital costs associated with the new building, Roberts 
said, he questioned the use of borrowed money for operating costs that should 
be included in the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday authorized the city manager to execute a ground lease with 
the county for 10 years at $1 a year.
