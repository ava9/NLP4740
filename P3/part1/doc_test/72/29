Organizers of the Soviet arts festival announced Tuesday the inclusion of a 
movie festival and symposium featuring four Georgian film directors, the 
addition of three more eggs to the exhibit of Faberge eggs, and the creation of 
extensive festival-related educational programs for children.

<P>
Arrangements were also solidified for the B St. Pier exhibition of 30 Georgian 
icon masterpieces from the Fine Arts Museum of Georgia and for performances by 
the Georgian State Folk Song and Dance Company and a children's folk dance 
group, the organizers said. An agreement was also reached to bring a Georgian 
mural artists to San Diego to paint a tribute to the festival.

"This visit was very productive in clarifying a number of details and in 
initiating the educational component," said Sal Giametta, cultural aid to Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor. "The educational component is one of the most important. The 
plan is to involve San Diego-area children in the festival to the fullest 
extent."

<P>
Giametta returned recently from a 10-day trip to the Soviet Union with a 
delegation representing the "San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet 
Union." Other delegates were festival artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph, Hal 
Fischer of the Timken Art Gallery, festival education committee chairwoman Jess 
Flemion and San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell.

Flemion took letters and mementoes to Georgian students from 24 San Diego 
schools that are participating in "Young at 'Art," an innovative visual arts 
training program. Flemion will be developing "curriculum packets" in social 
studies and current affairs on Soviet Georgia for local elementary and 
secondary-school classes, Giametta said. "It's the first leg of a 
children-to-children component of the festival that will become more and more 
important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Georgian film directors and a Georgian film critic will participate in a 
cinema festival and symposium. The directors will be recommended by Eldar 
Shegelaja, cinema director of the Georgian Cinematographic Union, Giametta 
said. Either the Museum of Photographic Arts or the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art or both will sponsor the festival locally.
