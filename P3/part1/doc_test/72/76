SHERIFF'S RACE MAY HINGE ON WHO HOLDS KEY TO JAILS

When the new chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors recently 
threw his support behind a privately run correctional system to take the key to 
county jails away from the Sheriff's Department, he guaranteed one thing: 
</P>
<P>
No other issue is likely to carry greater importance in this year's election 
for sheriff, the first wide-open race in two decades for the county's top law 
enforcement job. 
</P>
<P>
The four major candidates seeking to succeed John Duffy are solidifying their 
campaign positions on the question of who should run the jails -- the sheriff 
or a civilian director appointed by the five-member Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate is insistent that the elected sheriff retain power over the 
county's detention system. Another is willing to let the board have the jails. 
Two others are proposing compromises in which the sheriff would be the top 
jailer but supervise a staff of correctional officers with limited peace 
officer status and lower salaries. 
</P>
<P>
And the local Deputy Sheriff's Assn., whose endorsement is seen as critical in 
this year's election, is arming itself against Supervisor Leon Williams and the 
rest of the board if they place the issue on this year's ballot and ask the 
public for an advisory opinion on who best belongs in the jailhouse control 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost 100% unified that a department of corrections is the wrong way to 
go," said Lt. Skip Murphy, deputy's association president. "We're talking to 
outside consultants about what we might have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we will not sit still if the Board of Supervisors decides to go 
through with it. We won't roll over on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
His group has the backing of the California State Sheriff's Assn., which helped 
the Santa Clara County deputy's association try to defeat a similar proposal. 
The deputy's group there spent $750,000 to challenge its Board of Supervisors, 
only to lose when a separate Department of Correction took control of the jails 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that starts out with a flurry and somebody does it, 
like Santa Clara County, and then everybody looks at it and says, 'Me too,' " 
said Al Cooper, legislative lobbyist for the state association. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's difficult for us to understand why five people elected to the Board 
of Supervisors would want the jails in the first place. It's got to be the 
biggest headache in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara County board members insist that they created their own corrections 
department for economic reasons, after becoming incensed with a series of 
million-dollar cost overruns posted by the sheriff. The new private agency will 
save $62 million in the first 10 years, county officials contend, mostly by 
reducing salaries and training schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Money is the bottom line in San Diego too. Although still awaiting a financial 
analysis on switching jail leadership, Supervisors Williams and George Bailey 
outlined their position in an advisory letter, spelling out the rising costs of 
housing inmates in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Faced with similar circumstances, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors 
initiated action to allow the board to take charge of their correctional 
facilities," they said. "Discussions with Santa Clara County officials in 
November revealed that this action has enabled the county to reduce costs of 
operation and improve administrative procedures and operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is now for San Diego County to determine whether or not we need to 
take similar action. Costs are accelerating to operate today's facilities and 
will sky rocket to pay for tomorrow's facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's current budget is $110.8 million, with $52.5 million allocated for 
operation and support services for the detention facilities. Three years ago, 
the sheriff's jail budget was $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s saw an explosion in the growth of inmate population. As of the middle 
of last week, the seven county jails were housing 4,269 inmates, along with an 
additional 750 inmates assigned to honor camps and work-furlough programs. 
</P>
<P>
The jails now operate at 180% of rated capacity. And, even with completion of 
the new East Mesa Detention Facility and honor camp next year, with more than a 
1,000 new beds, it is predicted that the jails will remain crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Under those conditions, said Mel Nichols, commander of the sheriff's detention 
facilities, it is all the more important to have highly trained deputy sheriffs 
staffing the jails. He said he personally believes the jails should remain 
under the aegis of sworn officers in the Sheriff's Department, regardless of 
who is elected to replace Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some very, very competent administrators in our jail environment," 
he said. But Jim Butler, a former military chaplain in Vista who is pushing for 
a deputy review board for the Sheriff's Department, said a civilian jail system 
would bring a greater level of professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
He faulted the current system because newly hired deputies are initially 
assigned to jail work and have a difficult time adjusting to patrol duty when 
they leave the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the jails come out of that assignment and feel like all the people, 
all the public, are like those criminals," he said. "But police have to be 
people-oriented on the street, not criminal-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have their own views, and Ray Hoobler, a former San Diego police 
chief, agrees with Butler that the sheriff should relinquish the jails. "I 
never foresee sufficient funds within this county to provide adequate custodial 
facilities," he said. "So one positive aspect (for the sheriff) would be turn 
it over to a department of corrections." 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Jack Drown, one of Duffy's assistant sheriffs, supports his 
boss's unwavering position that the Sheriff's Department is the best agency to 
manage the jails. "You don't have to create a whole new bureaucracy and a whole 
new administration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Jimno, who is on leave from his post as Escondido police chief, said he 
would support a compromise measure in which correctional officers would be 
gradually hired to replace jail deputies. As the staff grew, the correctional 
officers would be promoted to front-line supervisors, but the Sheriff's 
Department always would have ultimate authority in the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's cost-effective," he said. "I think it's good business. There's no 
reason to have a cop be a jailer. That's not why you send a guy to a police 
training academy." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Roache, captain of the sheriff's Lemon Grove station, said he has a similar 
plan for staffing the jails, and he would build a career-ladder system to keep 
qualified correctional officers working the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it needs to be done no matter if a department of corrections is 
discussed or not," Roache said. "It makes good logical sense."
