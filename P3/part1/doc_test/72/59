REPORT PROMPTS CALL FOR CIVILIAN REVIEW OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES

A stinging report from the San Diego County Grand Jury documenting assaults of 
jail inmates by deputies has sparked calls for the creation of a civilian 
review board to monitor the County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butler, one of the inmates allegedly beaten in the County Jail in Vista, 
said he appeared before the Grand Jury on Wednesday and repeated the call for a 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Human Weaknesses' 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that, because of human weaknesses, it is necessary to have checks 
and balances with a police review board," he said. "And I told them that, if we 
don't have that, then power will continue to corrupt and we will have a police 
state." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Jury report, released Tuesday, lambasted the Sheriff's Department for 
its operation of the six county jails. 
</P>
<P>
The panel found that inmates were frequently assaulted by deputies, that 
internal cover-ups were conducted to conceal those activities and that Sheriff 
John Duffy and his top leaders did not assert adequate leadership to 
investigate the allegations and stop the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Using the El Cajon jail as an example, the Grand Jury said a "Rambo Squad" of 
deputies roamed the jail and routinely assaulted and harassed inmates in 
conduct that was "totally reprehensible and inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has been out of town this week and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Lt. Alan Fulmer, said the sheriff will hold a press conference 
soon to address the concerns in the 20-page report. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of a civilian review board for the department, Duffy has in the 
past said he is opposed to allowing his staff to be scrutinized by any 
outsiders. Instead, he has defended his in-house Internal Affairs Division as a 
capable unit for investigating misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Grand Jury did not call for an independent civilian review board, 
the panel's report did conclude that the Internal Affairs Division is woefully 
understaffed and unable to properly ferret out misbehavior by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the sheriff's Internal Affairs Division has one 
lieutenant and three sergeants for a department of 1,200 deputies, whereas the 
San Diego Police Department's counterpart has two lieutenants and 12 sergeants 
for a force of 1,700 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the sheriff's unit recently had a 50% increase in 
its caseload. And, the report added, "the backlog is building." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the issue of civilian review has dogged the San Diego 
Police Department. One panel was created but then sharply criticized for being 
weak and ineffective. Now, officials are attempting to determine whether one or 
both of the two new proposals for a city review board should be carried out, as 
approved by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
John Crew, director of the Police Practices Project for the ACLU in Northern 
California, said that, though review boards are increasingly being established 
to oversee local police procedures in the state, he knows of no panels to 
monitor deputies in jail settings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Reasons Why 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"In the jail, it's a closed society," he said. "And the complainants are often 
considered less credible because they are inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"And misconduct is difficult to prove when you're dealing with people 
incarcerated in jail. Witnesses will be less likely to speak up. And there is a 
built-in bias against people who are incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
For a review board monitoring jail activities to be successful, he said, the 
panel must be granted subpoena powers. It should also hold open public 
hearings, make final decisions on misconduct and decide whether discipline is 
warranted for errant officers. 
</P>
<P>
Crew discounted common complaints by peace officers who argue that review 
boards are no good because civilians cannot be properly trained to study police 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on," he said. "This is not brain surgery. Civilians already make 
decisions about water bonds and streets and sewers. So why should a police 
agency be an exclusion from democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crowley, a San Diego attorney, helped set up a special telephone hot 
line for victims of jail abuse after the allegations began surfacing. And he 
said many of the victims who called the hot line have expressed frustrations 
because they feel as though no independent watchdog has monitored the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every indication that the abuse is continuing and has been non-stop," 
he said. "And now, we are demanding that, based on the Grand Jury's report, a 
review board be established." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Charges Noted 
</P>
<P>
Tom Adler, another lawyer who has represented inmates allegedly beaten by 
deputies, said the frustrations have deepened because federal and state 
prosecutors have refused to file criminal charges against deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has been watching what's been happening in those jails," he said. "A 
handful of lawyers have filed lawsuits over brutality cases. Occasionally, the 
Grand Jury issues a report like this. But other than that, the U. S. attorney 
has turned his back on the problem, and the county district attorney doesn't 
want to get involved.
