With Orange County struggling to find affordable housing for its growing 
population of low-income working people and welfare recipients, county 
supervisors Tuesday ordered a study of an innovative housing program initiated 
in San Diego and emulated across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Orange County study will focus on construction of 
single-room-occupancy hotels, which are clustered residential living areas that 
resemble college dormitories, often featuring shared bathroom and cooking 
areas. The 60-day review will be conducted by the Environmental Management 
Agency, which is expected to return with specific recommendations for zoning 
and building code changes that would allow for development of the hotels in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
SROs, as the residential hotels are known, have been successfully tested in San 
Diego, and Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a leading advocate of SRO 
construction, said Tuesday that the facilities "would truly be something that 
would be effective in terms of helping the homeless people of this county." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who co-chaired an SRO task force with Stanton, 
agreed, calling the prospects of residential hotel construction in Orange 
County "excellent" and predicting that some of the facilities could be built as 
early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
Since San Diego launched an SRO program in 1987, the idea has spread to cities 
across the country, but it has been slow to catch on in Orange County, where 
the area's wealth often has obscured a dire shortage of low-income housing. If 
the supervisors approve the needed building and zoning changes, officials 
predict that SRO development will quickly take off because the area's acute 
housing shortage has created a demand for the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lennon, community affairs director for the Orange County Building Industry 
Assn., said local developers already have expressed interest in building SROs. 
The BIA is planning to hold a workshop at the end of October to brief 
prospective developers on building the residential hotels. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be a moment too soon, say county officials and housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing more and more working poor people in this county," said Larry 
Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency. "We have more and more 
people coming forward needing food stamps and needing welfare and needing 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The county's review will be aided by a new guide to SRO development prepared by 
area cities, building industry officials and county staff members. That 
document, entitled "Orange County SRO Housing Development Guide," was presented 
to the board Tuesday and was quickly hailed by housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"They're calling this the SRO cookbook," said Judy Lenthall, president of 
HomeAid, a nonprofit housing corporation backed by the Building Industry Assn. 
of Southern California. "But I've been calling it the SRO New Testament. It's 
fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall, who drafted the much-admired San Diego program, called the Orange 
County guide the "latest and greatest in SRO planning and development in the 
nation" and predicted that it would be widely used by city and county 
governments trying to pave the way for SRO construction in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities assisted in drafting the report, and their cooperation 
would be needed to make widespread development of the residential hotels 
possible. Most of the county's densely populated areas are incorporated, so 
merely amending the county zoning laws would not have any direct effect on the 
laws of cities. 
</P>
<P>
The cities' support seems solid, however, as 16 of them were represented on the 
task force that produced the guide, and the local League of California Cities 
chapter heartily endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, SRO construction has found support from a broad range of 
constituencies: Conservative Republicans such as Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp -- who commended Stanton on Orange County's guide -- see 
them as a way for the private sector to address a social need. And liberal 
Democrats hail them as a way to alleviate homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"This program has no politics," Lenthall said. "Orange County is ripe, and 
they've finally matured enough to recognize the importance of affordable 
housing. I'm very optimistic."
