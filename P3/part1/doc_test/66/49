It wasn't the best of concerts. It wasn't the worst of concerts. Just like La 
Revolution itself, Saturday's appropriately titled program in the Getty 
Museum's peristyle garden, "Music Before and After Bastille Day," was not 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
No one was sent to the guillotine, but there was one casualty earlier in the 
day: Soprano Mary Rawcliffe reportedly fell victim to an allergy. To the rescue 
came Susan Judy, who, on scarcely more than two hours notice, performed 
yeoman's duty in delivering Revolution-era songs by Dalayrac, Gaveaux, Philidor 
and Becourt. Though one had to admire her pure, sweet tone and sensitive 
phrasing, her voice lacked both projection and range and it appeared that she 
had far too little time with which to acquaint herself with the text. 
</P>
<P>
The purely instrumental installments were characterized by rhythmically 
precise, well-balanced ensemble-work and intelligent, stylish phrasing. 
Intonation, however, especially when the strings played double stops, proved a 
recurrent problem. Violinists Elizabeth Blumenstock and Anthony Martin, viola 
da gamba player Martha McGaughey and harpsichordist Arthur Haas brought 
elegance and vigor to Francois Couperin's "Sonade: L'espagnol," but found it 
necessary to retune the period instruments at every possible opportunity. 
McGaughey had some difficulty in negotiating the technical hurdles in Marin 
Marais' Suite, "D'un gout etranger" and some of her notes could barely be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
Haas gave clean, articulate and highly charged readings of harpsichord works by 
Claude-Benigne Balbastre, among them a spirited march based on the 
"Marseillaise." TERRY McQUILKIN
