  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France is hoping for "more 
active support" from the European Union for its intervention in 
Rwanda at the EU's two-day summit in Corfu starting on Friday 
[24 June], French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure 
said on Thursday. 
  "We need the support of the whole international community, 
we 
got it with the United Nations Security Council vote -- at the 
same time we expect much greater support from our European 
partners," Lamassoure said in an interview on France Inter radio. 
  Meanwhile Pierre Lellouche, foreign policy advisor to 
Gaullist presidential hopeful Jacques Chirac, criticised alleged 
lack of support from Germany for the Rwanda operation. 
  In a reference to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation 
to German troops to take part in the annual Bastille Day 
military parade next July 14, Lellouche said he would prefer 
"that the German units do a detour via Kigali to carry out this 
peace mission before parading in Paris." 
  For his part, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied 
that 
France was isolated over Rwanda. 
  Juppe told a press conference that Paris had won a pledge of 
"logistical support" from the United States and backing from its 
European partners and French-speaking African countries. 
  Juppe, speaking after briefing the Senate foreign affairs 
committee, said other countries might also offer logistical 
support and mentioned Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain. 
  The foreign minister, who played down Organisation of 
African 
Unity opposition to the Rwanda operation, also said there was no 
conflict with the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), 
which has vowed to fight the intervention. 
  "There is agreement to pursue dialogue. We shall maintain 
contact (with the RPF) during the operations," Juppe said, 
insisting that one of the objectives was to "save Tutsi lives in 
the western part of Rwanda." The Tutsi-dominated RPF mistrusts 
France for past backing of its Hutu rivals. 
  Juppe refused to answer questions on the progress of 
operations and to say whether French troops had entered Rwanda. 
  Lamassoure said that although there would be "technical 
support within the framework...of the EU," France wanted "other 
Europeans to take part in the military operation." 
  He said "There is a duty to come to the aid of a people in 
mortal danger" and "it is in this spirit that we are going 
there." 
  Lellouche, who was speaking on Radio Monte Carlo, said the 
"Europe as a whole will have to be reviewed" if Germany could 
not be counted on when "major political and strategic issues" 
came up. 
  He said that if Europe consisted of "the Germans looking 
after the Deutschmark, the British looking after trade while we 
are the mercenaries called upon to spend our money and have our 
young men killed for the stability of our periphery, then this 
Europe cannot work." 
  Lellouche added that the US had stabilised Latin America, 
the 
Japanese had contributed to political and economic stability in 
their region and "Europe's duty is to do this job in the south."
