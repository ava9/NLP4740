Holland Festival
Riccardo Chially is the conductor of a new production of Verdi's Falstaff,
which should set the Holland Festival off to a sparkling start on Wednesday.
The festival is based in Amsterdam and lasts for the month of June. Falstaff
apart, there are several themes this year, including new music written in
China since the end of the Cultural Revolution - a generally unknown
quantity, advertised as 'expressive, theatrical, exotic'. Dance and theatre
events, led by Merce Cunningham and Peter Brook, support the main music
programme.
Royal Academy Summer Show
Once it signalled the start of the London season and it remains a social
event of a very English sort. The Summer Show, in which members of the
public are invited to contribute up to three works of art for exhibition
alongside Royal Academicians, has been held annually since 1769. This year
there were 13,000 entries - paintings, sculpture and architectural designs.
A final 1,300, among them The Bathers by Bill Jacklin RA, were selected.
After a week of private views and parties, the exhibition opens on Sunday.
Royal Ballet
Marking its return to Covent Garden after its American tour, the Royal
Ballet revives Anthony Dowell's production of Don Quixote. Sylvie Guillem
is, according to our dance critic Clement Crisp, 'trapped aboard this
Titanic of the dance: she may have the wit to find the only life-belt.'
Performances, all with Mlle Guillem, tonight, Wednesday and Saturday.
Ballet-lovers in New York will be at the State Theater for New York City
Ballet. Tonight in Paris, the Opera Bastille hosts the wonderful La
Bayadere.
Jazz
The spirit of carnival and tropical Bahia comes to London on Wednesday when
the original Tropicalia musicians, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, are
reunited for the first time in 20 years at the Royal Albert Hall. Joined by
Gal Costa and Caetano's sister Maria Bethania, the Doces Barbados (the four
great Bahians) will perform alongside the 50 drummers and dancers of the
Mangueira school of Samba in an exciting climax to the Brazilian
Contemporary Arts 'Festival of Bahia'.
Bonn Opera
One of the most unusual operatic premieres of the season takes place on
Sunday when the Bonn Opera stages Il Guarany, a four-act opera-ballet by
Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Gomes. Based on a love story about the
Guarani Indians, it was first performed at La Scala in 1870. Long forgotten
outside Brazil, it owes its revival to Placido Domingo who sings the title
role. The producer is Werner Herzog, of Fitzcarraldo fame.
