<F P=106> [Responses by French President Francois Mitterrand and </F>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to written questions from Dieter 
Schroeder and Serge July; received on 2 and 3 June: "Kohl and 
Mitterrand -- a Shared European Belief To Guarantee Peace"] 
  [Text] To mark the 6 June ceremonies, LIBERATION and the 
leading Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG requested and were 
granted a "three-way" interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President Francois Mitterrand. It was initially planned that 
they would answer the questions asked by our editors Dieter 
Schroeder and Serge July during the Mulhouse summit on 30 May. 
However, because the two men could not fit it into their 
schedules, the Mulhouse interview could not go ahead. We 
therefore sent our questions to the offices of both leaders and 
received our replies on 2 and 3 June. 
  [LIBERATION] The world is currently commemorating the 
anniversary of one of the major military events of the century 
that came one year before the fall of Nazism. What are your 
feelings as you witness the ceremonies being held on the beaches 
of Normandy? 
  [Mitterrand] This year's Normandy landings ceremonies are 
particularly solemn since we are celebrating their jubilee. 
Exactly 50 years ago, an immense fleet bearing the colors of 
liberty and democracy returned hope and dignity to the people of 
France. The feelings anyone can have on such a day are 
appreciation of the nations which took part in this 
extraordinary uprising against Nazism, feelings of admiration 
for the leaders who organized and successfully conducted 
operations of this scale, and finally feelings of deep gratitude 
to the courageous men, many of whom sacrificed their lives, who 
set foot on Norman soil on that day. 
  It is natural that those who were the main participants or 
witnesses of these events, or those who remain after 50 years, 
should want to meet again and pause to reflect at the place 
where they lived this episode in history. These are feelings 
that everyone can understand. The only purpose of the 
ceremonies of 6 June is to respond to this quite legitimate 
desire. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you regret not being able to attend? 
  [Kohl] Of course not. While everyone has quite naturally 
claimed the opposite, I at no time requested an invitation, 
because I feel that it would not have been right for Germans to 
participate in this event. On this point, President Mitterrand 
and I have always been in total agreement. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you regret the fact that Chancellor Kohl 
could not attend? 
  [Mitterrand] Chancellor Kohl and I have never had a problem 
or misunderstanding on this issue. On 6 June, we will be 
commemorating an event, and history cannot be rewritten. 
Chancellor Kohl and I both considered that the anniversary of 
the Normandy landings was not the best occasion to celebrate and 
strengthen French-German friendship. 
  However, everyone in France knows that the defeat of Nazism 
enabled the building of a democratic Germany with which we have 
developed ties that are closer than with any other country. It 
is in this spirit that federal Germany will participate in the 
ceremonies of 8 May 1995. Before that date, we will soon have 
the opportunity to illustrate the exceptional relations that 
exist between our two countries when I visit Heidelberg on 8 
June, at the invitation of Chancellor Kohl, to attend the great 
French-German festival of youth. On 14 July [Bastille Day], as 
I requested, the European Defense Corps will parade along the 
Champs Elysees. 
  [LIBERATION] France and Germany have gone to war three times 
since the end of the 19th century. These tragedies are now a 
thing of the past. What assurances can you give your peoples to 
guarantee this can never occur again? 
  [Kohl] We Germans border on more European countries than 
anyone else. Therefore, our relentless pursuit of a policy for 
European unity is precisely a fundamental, if not the main, 
issue that shapes our future. 
  We cannot just take peace and freedom for granted. Each day 
we must take steps to ensure them. In my opinion, there can be 
no doubt that European unity is precisely the best insurance 
against an uprising of nationalism and chauvinism and against 
rivalry between powers, including here in the west of Europe. 
The success of our plans for the European Union [EU] is finally 
a question of war and peace for the 21st century. 
  [Mitterrand] There is no "fully comprehensive" insurance 
policy. First and foremost, everything is a question of will: 
the will of the political leaders and the will of the people. 
However, it is clear, more so today than yesterday, that 
European construction is the best possible guarantee against a 
return to this type of confrontation. That is why everyone who, 
here or there, through nationalism, nervousness, or selfishness 
argues in favor of inward-looking policies, is being very 
shortsighted and most unwise. There has never been strength or 
peace through disunion. 
  [LIBERATION] The Normandy landings took place 50 years ago. 
How much longer should we continue to commemorate the rifts in 
our shared history? Can these references to the past really 
serve to consolidate our relations? 
  [Kohl] I fully understand that the Allies want to 
commemorate 
these events that were of great significance for the whole of 
Europe and to remember their dead. We Germans, too, must 
remember this era in our history so that we are sure to learn 
the right lessons. On 8 June, President Mitterrand and I will 
meet young people from France and Germany in Heidelberg and 
stress the joint commitment of our peoples in favor of Europe. 
Using an idea of the historian Joseph Rovan, we will invite the 
youth of France and Germany to present their shared vision of 
Europe in the 21st century. I believe it is important to take 
their suggestions and proposals into account in our future work 
on continued European integration, especially when the Germans 
and French preside the EU. We must ensure that youth plays an 
active role in our discussions when we are talking about 
European construction, since it is precisely their future of 
peace and freedom that is at stake. 
  [Mitterrand] The history of two great nations, when they are 
neighbors, has rarely been a never-ending romance. There are 
good memories and bad memories and it would be rather simplistic 
to forget the bad things and remember only the good times. The 
waters of history run deep and voluntary amnesia, whether by 
peoples or individuals, is never a good solution. On the 
contrary, it is the accepted past that can feed the political 
will I spoke of before. We can only see an apparent paradox in 
the fact that the most spectacular coming together, which lies 
at the heart of European construction, has been that of France 
and Germany, the two countries that have fought the most over 
the last century. Here, as elsewhere, time has done its work 
and the time will come when we will no longer feel the need to 
commemorate events, even ones so memorable. 
  [LIBERATION] On 6 June 1944 we saw the large-scale 
commitment 
of the United States in the war against Nazism. This marked the 
start of a military presence in Europe, and especially in 
Germany, which continues to this day. What military role should 
the Americans play in Europe now? 
  [Kohl] The alliance with the democracies of North America 
and 
the presence of the Americans in Europe remains, and will remain 
in the future, for us Europeans, the most obvious expression of 
shared transatlantic values and an irreplaceable basis for 
keeping Europe on a stable footing of peace and security. On 
this point, I welcome the fact that President Clinton has 
renewed his commitment to keep 100,000 American military 
personnel stationed in Europe. With the EU, an effective 
alliance is an essential precondition to bring the new 
democracies of Central and Eastern Europe closer to the 
organizations of the West and to ensure general and lasting 
peace for the whole of Europe. 
  [Mitterrand] The vigor of the alliance with the United 
States 
and its European partners remains an essential part of our 
security, and the United States' military commitment in Europe 
is the very expression of the transatlantic link. This is why 
during the debates that have been held over the years on the 
development of NATO, I have always advocated that nothing be 
done that could divert the Atlantic Alliance from its basic 
mission, namely guaranteeing the security of its members. 
  Of course, this must not discourage Europeans from jointly 
building up a European defense system. It seems to me that we 
have made progress in this area. The creation of the Eurocorps 
is a significant step forward in this respect. The desire to 
develop the role of the Western European Union (WEU) is also a 
move in the same direction. At the last Atlantic Alliance 
summit in January I felt that our American and Canadian friends 
realized that, far from weakening the Alliance, this desire of 
the Europeans to assume their responsibilities in the areas of 
security and defense was, on the contrary, the best guarantee 
they could have of counting on genuinely determined allies in 
the long term, as set out in the preamble to the North Atlantic 
Treaty, "to safeguard the freedom of their peoples, their common 
heritage, and their civilization." 
  [LIBERATION] Under joint impetus from you both, France and 
Germany decided to create a European Army Corps. In your 
opinion, will the Eurocorps be the embryo of a European army? 
  [Kohl] With the creation of the European Corps, President 
Mitterrand and I intended -- as we have since the beginning -- 
to place close French-German cooperation in a Europe 
perspective. Since then, Belgium has responded positively to our 
invitation, which was sent to the member states of the WEU, to 
participate in the European Corps. Negotiations for Spain's 
entry are under way. Consequently, the European Corps, which 
should be fully established by 1995, is already a successful 
model for a European military structure, thanks to which both 
the European pillar of the Alliance and the WEU will be 
strengthened. It could therefore serve as an example for other 
large European units in a EU that is in the process of becoming 
integrated. I am especially pleased with President Mitterrand's 
gesture. He invited German, French, and Belgian soldiers from 
the Eurocorps to march in Paris during the traditional parade on 
14 July to mark the Bastille day celebrations. 
  [Mitterrand] My answer is obviously "yes." Will the embryo 
keep developing until it leads to the birth of a European army? 
That remains to be seen. However, I feel that there is no 
doubt at all about the fact that the gradual emergence of a 
genuine European defense identity, having the required resources 
and placed at the service of a joint policy, will be the 
touchstone of EU success in the long term. 
  [LIBERATION] On 7 May, you suggested that the aircraft 
carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a future 
European Navy." Are you suggesting the birth of an integrated 
European squadron based on the Eurocorps model? 
  [Mitterrand] Indeed, it seems to me that the issue will 
arise. In fact it has already started coming up with the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. On this occasion, it 
appeared to the Europeans that it was more simple and effective 
to coordinate, within the framework of the WEU, their 
participation in the naval embargo control operations. This is 
a first step. There will be others and I am very much in favor 
of them. What I told you about the European defense identity 
also holds true for the navy. Just like we put together the 
European Corps with elements from several countries' armies, we 
can undoubtedly envision the creation of standing multinational 
naval units which will also be the embryo of a future European 
navy. 
  [LIBERATION] President Mitterrand has just suggested that 
the 
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a 
future European Navy." Would you be prepared to have this ship 
participate in an integrated European squadron set up along the 
lines of the Eurocorps? 
  [Kohl] For the naval forces, the multinational aspect and 
commitment within an international framework are part of a tried 
and tested tradition. For many years now, we have been 
maintaining close cooperation in this area with France and with 
our partners in the Alliance. In this context I would simply 
reiterate that NATO's standing naval intervention units and the 
naval forces set up on an ad hoc basis within the WEU have, over 
the last few years, contributed primarily toward overcoming 
various crises. 
  We have therefore agreed to develop procedures to be able to 
establish a French-German naval unit at any time for joint 
missions. Outside the bilateral framework proper, this kind of 
temporarily established unit could be placed at the disposal of 
NATO or the WEU. This kind of availability on both sides would 
correspond to the model supplied by the European Corps and would 
be a fresh contribution toward reinforcing the WEU's operational 
capability and European commitments within NATO. In this 
respect, I understand President Mitterrand's statements as a 
sign to legally accentuate Europe's efforts in naval matters. 
  [LIBERATION] Today's ceremonies have reminded us that the 
United States of America plays a crucial role in Europe 
politically, economically, culturally, and socially. What is 
your assessment of this in the light of this event? Is it 
symbolic of current relations between America and Europe? 
  [Kohl] In the past, during the time of the East-West 
conflict, the transatlantic link binding us firmly to the United 
States of America and Canada was primarily geared toward matters 
of security policy. Today, we are duty-bound to broaden this 
link to take in other sectors and, in particular, to intensify 
cooperation in the areas of the economy, culture, and science. 
It is also important to reinforce exchanges of young people, 
thus consolidating ties of friendship between young people on 
both sides of the Atlantic. 
  [Mitterrand] The United States of America occupies an 
important place in Europe at all levels. This is the result of 
that country's qualities, its dynamism, and its creativity, but 
also its economic and financial power, the size of its domestic 
market, and the size of its businesses. It is here that we are 
faced with stiff competition which is highlighted by the effect 
of our own divisions. This is true despite the fact that here in 
Europe we have a considerable potential for creativity, whether 
in technology, science, culture, the arts, etc. I see in this 
yet another reason to work toward reinforcing the EU further. 
The dialogue between the United States and Europe will only be 
richer and more fruitful for it.
