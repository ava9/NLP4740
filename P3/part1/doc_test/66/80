The splendid royal palace of Compiegne, about one hour north of Paris, on
the edge of the forest of the same name, now has an Imperial Theatre to add
to its attractions. That 'now' points to a strange history. Napoleon III and
his Empress, Eugenie, who both loved Compiegne and entertained there
lavishly, found the existing theatre too small and commissioned a larger
one, still incomplete when the Second Empire collapsed in 1870.
Quite recently private sponsors banded together to restore the theatre and
entrusted it to Pierre Jourdan's Theatre Francais de la Musique, an opera
company formed to explore and revive forgotten corners of the rich French
repertory. And so the Imperial Theatre finally opened its doors last autumn,
about 120 years late. This year's operas are Christophe Colomb and Mignon.
They are followed through the winter by a series of weekend concerts of
French music. Compiegne being easy of access, the enterprise is an
acquisition for Paris as well as for the neighbourhood.
The theatre is large for even the grandest palace. The present capacity is
770 - about the same as the Glyndebourne we used to know but vastly
different in shape and appearance - a wide, semi-circular auditorium with
raked stalls, three balconies and side boxes. Those expecting a profusion of
Second Empire gilt may be disappointed. Apart from plasterwork there is
little decoration - plain greyish-white surfaces. But the architect
Ancelet's strong, simple lines are as harmonious as they are imposing. The
restoration was the work of Renaud Bardon, architect of the Musee d'Orsay.
Milhaud and Claudel's Christophe Colomb, a monument of modern music and
theatre in the 1920s, imposed itself this year, celebrating both the
composer's centenary and the quincentenary of Columbus.
Concert performances apart, this dauntingly demanding work has still not
been given in Paris or the surrounding region. Nevertheless, since the
Compiegne stage is by no means large as opera houses go, it was a brave
decision.
A crucial factor was the generous offer of the Gulbenkian Foundation in
Lisbon to lend not only chorus, orchestra and ballet for the performances
but to ensure adequate rehearsal time for preparation of the complicated
score. The solo singers were French and mostly young. The conductor, Michel
Swierczewski, is a Frenchman who has studied with Mackerras in Vienna and
who is a regular visitor to Lisbon. Claude Lule produced, in designs by
Jean-Yves Legavre and Juan Stoppani.
One thing the venture did prove. Colomb, though no walkover, is not after
all such an immense undertaking - it can be done, and worthily, on a fairly
modest scale. Not that total success was won in this turbulent work in which
episodes from the life of Columbus (rarely given in chronological order) are
separated by spoken narrations and by comments and reactions from the
chorus, all in Claudel's torrential language.
Lule decided not to use film as specified by Claudel as an auxiliary means
and substituted dancers. In the storm scene he even fell back on our old
friend, dry ice (surely due for retirement). On the other hand the balletic
treatment of the strange episode where Mexican gods unavailingly churn up
the waters to repel the advancing caravels, was a great success - here as
elsewhere the choreography of Olga Roriz was better than one usually finds
in opera.
The orchestra pit was covered, no doubt a wise precaution in view of the
exuberance of much of Milhaud music. The result, with obviously careful
preparation, was perfectly clear. Remembering its past excellence in Lisbon
I was a little disappointed with the chorus. Perhaps there were too few
voices in that gallant group. Milhaud wrote expertly for voices but he
expects endless stamina over long stretches. There was some flagging, some
sour intonation, and too few audible words - the simple, all-important
phrases greeting the moment of discovery were mumbled.
The Columbus, Laurent Naouri, is a most promising, musical baritone with a
strong, tireless voice - the role is long and demanding. He has a good
presence, but his white, centrally parted wig, aquiline features and long
cassock reminded me fatally of a later and different kind of explorer - the
Abbe Liszt. Naouri's jerky movements contrasted with the remarkable physical
control of the narrator, Michel Hermon, an accomplished actor-singer who
also (rather confusingly) sang the role of Columbus's alter ego.
Mary Saint-Palais, a useful high soprano, had her moments as Queen Isabella
but the right degree of limpidity for her rapt phrases was not always
forthcoming. Pascal Mesle dealt ably with a number of tenor character roles.
The fine passage describing 'the eye of the storm' lay low for him. It was
unwise to have big, floppy programmes that they could hardly be opened
without damaging the coiffure in front. Even then there was too little light
to read them comfortably. A worth-while event in spite of minor flaws - and
a shame there were only two public performances.
