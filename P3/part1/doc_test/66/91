FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Donizetti's 'Roberto Devereux' - Opera in Genoa

The building of a new opera-house is such an expensive business and so
fraught with potential problems that it is only the rash or the
exceptionally well-funded who would be advised to contemplate it at all. In
the last decade neither the Bastille in Paris nor the Muziektheater in
Amsterdam met with an unqualified chorus of rapture.
The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa has won more harmonious applause. Strictly
speaking, it is not a new building, as the shell of its predecessor remained
after war damage in 1943. It has also taken the best part of 15 years to
reach fruition even from the selection of the definitive project (the Royal
Opera will know about this problem). But for an opera-house totally
re-conceived and built afresh, amply spacious, lavishly appointed, it is
difficult to think of a city luckier than Genoa.
As befits its original frontage, the interior of the theatre has kept in
touch with classical features, albeit interpreted in a modern style. The
auditorium (about 2,000 seats) is unlike any other in Italy, or anywhere
else for that matter. The side walls are fashioned to resemble Venetian
houses with their balconies forming the traditional side boxes, looking down
on the stalls as though over a central piazza - a novel idea, which gives
the theatre a thoroughly Italian atmosphere of its own.
All this, however, is a mere counterpoint to its triumphant main theme: the
excellence of the acoustics. According to a recent opinion-poll the sound
qualities of the new theatre have won almost unanimous approval, and I am
not surprised. The voices project with remarkable clarity. At the
performance of Donizetti's Roberto Devereux which I saw on Sunday each
singer had only to step to the front of the stage to ensure an enormous
vocal impact.
What with La Favorite in Cardiff and L'assedio di Calais at London's
Guildhall School of Music in the last fortnight, it would seem that
Donizetti's serious operas may be inviting re-appraisal ahead of his
bicentenary in 1997. Roberto Devereux is one of the most red-blooded of all.
To succeed, a performance needs to work up a real head of steam in the royal
show-down that crowns Act 2 and that is what Jan Latham Koenig achieved
here, conducting the very respectable Genovese orchestra.
With the exception of the main character of Elizabeth I - the Polish soprano
Jolanta Omilian, not a great voice, but dramatic and strong, able to stamp
her authority on the opera - the roles were cast with some of the best of
the younger Italian singers. Vincenzo La Scola was the stylish tenor Earl of
Essex; the baritone Roberto Frontali sang a well-focused, firm Duke of
Nottingham. Best of all was Gloria Scalchi, who showed no sign of strain at
all in tackling the high mezzo part of Sara: clearly a notable talent.
Audiences in Genoa are liable to express their displeasure at modern
productions, so there was no suggestion of updating this piece of Tudor
historical fiction to the era of Thatcherite domination or Italian political
corruption scandals. The staging was grandly traditional, with luxurious
drapes and tapestries providing opulent spectacle for its Palace of
Westminster locale. On its own terms it all worked splendidly and was a
first-rate advertisement for a company happily settled in its new home.
With four years to go, the Royal Opera in London might also want to think
about extending its repertoire to more of Donizetti's historical operas. The
addition of Roberto Devereux, arguably the most exciting musically of the
three works, to its existing Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda, would make a
properly regal trilogy.
