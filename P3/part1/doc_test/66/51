the first half of the Paris cycle

Not the whole Ring, as yet: Wagner-lovers in Paris will have to wait until
the autumn to see the first complete cycles of this new production. The
timing does, however, mean that Paris has done its best to pip Bayreuth to
the post, as the Wagner festival is within a few weeks of unveiling its own
new Ring - an event which only comes round once or twice a decade.
For international opera-goers there is almost a surfeit of new productions
of the Ring this year (the Royal Opera in London is about to launch another
in the autumn) but if the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris has its eye on the
opposition, it is likely that it is looking closer to home. The Chatelet and
the Opera de Paris Bastille, Mitterrand's huge opera palace for the people,
are keen rivals and the Bastille has yet to accept the challenge of a Ring.
If anybody doubts that competition can be good for the arts, the operatic
situation in Paris at the moment offers the proof. Determined not to be
outdone by its rival's greater size, income and prestige, the Chatelet aims
to make up ground by putting together an adventurous programme. Like the
Bastille, it is able to offer international casts and its only ongoing
weakness is the lack of a house orchestra of the front rank. For some of its
major productions it has the Philharmonia Orchestra in residence from
London, but not unfortunately for this one.
Doubtless Jeffrey Tate had rehearsed the Orchestre National de France
diligently to get such a convincing Wagnerian sound, but the run of cracked
brass notes and general ungainliness of the playing do not speak well of the
orchestra's current form. Tate himself likes solid Wagner, built on
unshakable foundations, but found more elan than usual to build each act to
climaxes of unexpected passion. The Parisian audience rewarded him with an
enthusiastic ovation.
For his part the producer and designer, Pierre Strosser, decided not to come
on for a curtain-call, which was probably wise. So far, only Das Rheingold
and Die Walkure have been seen, but it seems unlikely that he has any
surprises in store for the other two operas. Certainly, his bare stage of a
set - everything dark and grey, barely a flicker of colour in sight - looks
here to stay, while all the Ring's invitations for scenic spectacle are
steadfastly ignored.
Just as he refuses to show on stage the waters of the Rhine, a Valhalla
castle or a rainbow for the gods, so Strosser is determined to avoid the
obvious in his handling of the singers. Whether it is Alberich slipping and
sliding on the rocks, Siegmund collapsing with exhaustion or the Valkyries
congregating with wild energy, he refuses to have anybody imitate the music;
for most of the time the singers just stand lifelessly and sing.
There are some virtues in this approach, but only negative ones. It is a
relief to see a Ring without caricatures, so that in Das Rheingold both
Franz-Josef Kapellmann's Alberich and Peter Keller's Mime came across as men
of feelings, not just grotesque misfits (it was distasteful, though, to use
real dwarves for the Nibelungs). It also makes life easier not to have to
wrestle with a producer's heavy-handed reading of Wagner's political
subtext, although Strosser does dress up his gods as a well-to-do Victorian
family, who do not want to pay for their new house when the proletariat
builders (the giants) turn up with the bill.
In general, Das Rheingold lacked impact, despite Peter Straka's
intelligently-played Loge getting a grip on the drama whenever he could.
Kirsten Dolberg as Erda was left to wander on from the back of the stage
virtually unnoticed, dressed like a Sunday-school teacher arriving to read
the lesson. Nadine Denize's experienced Fricka and Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe as
Freia made a limited impression among the gods. The Froh was inaudible and
the Fasolt feeble.
After so much inactivity, it was no surprise the next night at Die Walkure
to find nothing happening visually when the door of Hunding's hut flies open
to let in the spring. Instead, in blew a whirlwind called Karen Huffstodt,
whose Sieglinde sang and acted with such fevered intensity that she nearly
blasted everybody else off the stage. I was glad she was there, though her
pairing with Jyrki Niskanen's office clerk of a Siegmund did not look like a
marriage made in heaven.
For its Wotan, the Chatelet has Robert Hale, so far a strong and able
choice, with the right amount of power for this theatre. The Brunnhilde,
Sabine Hass, lacks heroic strength in the middle of her voice, but it is
splendid to hear both a Wotan and a Brunnhilde who sing without any wobble
or unpleasant forcing. Among the rest of the Walkure cast there was a
menacing, heavily Eastern-accented Hunding from Sergey Kopchak and an
international band of Valkyries, including the British duo of Penelope
Walker and Yvonne Howard. Siegfried and Gotterdammerung follow in October,
with two complete Ring cycles around the beginning of November.
