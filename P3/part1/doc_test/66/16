IT was back in the year 1102 that Paris first won its laurels as the
cultural capital of Europe thanks to Abelard, the learned logician, who left
the stuffy old cathedral school of Notre Dame to set up his own school on
the Montaigne Sainte-Genevieve.
Other freethinkers followed Abelard's lead. Medieval Paris became the 'New
Athens,' a hubbub of learning, with scholars and teachers flocking to the
city first from France, and then from all over Europe. Paris has been a
centre for the world's academics, artists, writers, architects, musicians
and film makers ever since.
From time to time other cities have tried to usurp its position. New York
ousted it in the 1940s as the centre of the modern art movement, just as
Milan did in the 1970s for architecture. But the sheer scale and range of
Paris' artistic activities means that it has always played a special role in
the cultural sphere.
In recent years the Paris arts scene has experienced an extraordinary burst
of energy, fuelled by the support of the socialist government which, under
Jack Lang, its long-serving arts minister and a close associate of President
Mitterrand, has invested heavily in the arts.
Jack Lang sees the investment in the arts not only as a lynchpin of the
government's attempts to safeguard France's cultural heritage, but also as
an economic catalyst, to boost tourism and create jobs within the arts
industry. Critically he has persuaded the president, and rest of the French
government, to agree.
During Jack Lang's nine years at the arts ministry, 'l'epoque Lang,' as
Liberation calls it, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the
arts has more than doubled to just under 1 per cent, or FFr13bn. A large
chunk of this money has been lavished on Paris. At a time when many of
London's main monuments are shrouded by protective plastic and the British
government dithers over whether or not it can afford to restore them, the
French capital has been engaged in an unprecedentedly ambitious programme of
architectural construction and renovation.
The Grands Projets, which President Mitterrand has presented as a testimony
to the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution - but his critics see as
megalomaniacal monuments to himself - have left Paris with a new opera house
at Bastille, a science museum at La Villette, an Arabic cultural centre
beside the Seine, a triumphal arch at La Defense and a glacial pyramid in
the middle of the Louvre museum.
Add to this the opening of the Musee D'Orsay, the Louvre restoration scheme,
the Jeu de Paume's metamorphosis into a contemporary arts museum, the
renovation of the Tuileries and Palais Royal gardens, the regilding of all
the prominent statues in the city and you get some idea of the scale of Jack
Lang's legacy to the French capital.
These programmes have been accompanied by a lower profile, but no less
influential, policy of arts subsidy. The French government's film funding
strategy has turned Paris into the centre of European cinema. A number of
large French companies, the Canal Plus television group and the Bouygues
construction empire, have set up film production subsidiaries. This has
created a sprawling satellite sector of film lawyers, set designers,
distributors, make-up artists and agents, all based in Paris, to service the
cinema industry.
Sometimes it seems as though nothing escapes the eagle-eyed arts minister.
One group of self-avowedly avant garde artists, who were working from the
derelict L'Hopital Ephemere in the groovy Pigalle district were startled to
see their alternative credentials shattered when they became the recipients
of an unsolicited subsidy from Mr Lang.
L'Epoque Lang has not been universally successful. The opera is a constant
bone of contention. The opulent old Paris Opera house had lost its stature
in the musical world long before President Mitterrand and his energetic arts
minister arrived on the scene. The FFr700m new Opera de Bastille was their
solution. It was to be a 'people's opera' with a state-of-the-art
auditorium, cheap seats and wonderful music. Instead, the Opera de Bastille
has been plagued by the same union problems - and the same customer
complaints about high prices and intermittent strikes - as the old opera
house. It has also been clouded by controversy over the firing four years
ago of Daniel Barenboim, its first artistic director, and more recently the
resignation of Philippe Belaval as director general following a tragic
accident in Seville when a set collapsed killing one member of the chorus
and injuring 30 others. Meanwhile the old opera house has been reduced to
staging ballet and occasional showings of vintage Hollywood musicals.
Jack Lang's critics have revelled in the melodramas of the opera world. They
see the flamboyant arts minister, with his penchant for graffiti art and
Thierry Mugler suits, as the epitome of the sybaritic socialists, la gauche
caviare, who have swept to power in the Mitterrand era. They also see him as
a presidential poodle and a fritterer of public funds.
Chief among the critics is Jacques Chirac, one-time prime minister, would-be
president and now mayor of Paris. The battles between the arts minister, in
his meticulously restored offices in the heart of the lovely Palais Royal,
and the mayor of Paris, in his Disneyesque headquarters at Hotel de Ville,
have added a definite frisson to the Paris arts scene of the 1980s and early
1990s.
The latest row is over the new Bibliotheque de France, the national library
otherwise known as the Tres Grande Bibliotheque, now being built with
government money on a patch of land owned by the Continued on next page

city council near Gare d'Austerlitz. Jacques Chirac has done everything he
can to stop the project. He has criticised the design, a series of glazed
glass towers conceived by the 39-year-old architect, Dominique Perrault. He
has even threatened to take back the land.
The Tres Grande Bibliotheque is going ahead, albeit with a modified design,
thanks to the constant complaints of the Paris mayor and the 200 academics
who petitioned President Mitterrand claiming that the original building
would have toasted France's academic treasures.
The battles between the mayor and the arts minister almost always make
entertaining spectator sport. They also work to the art lover's advantage in
that one of Jacques Chirac's main tactics - vocal though he has been in
attacking Jack Lang's alleged extravagance - is to invest in the city of
Paris' own ambitious arts schemes.
One of the best examples is in modern art, where the city council has spent
heavily to turn its Art Deco edifice, the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de
Paris (MAM), at Iena, into a serious competitor to the government-funded
Centre Georges Pompidou.
Four years ago MAM appointed a new director, Suzanne Page, who has turned
the museum into one of Europe's liveliest contemporary art centres by
concentrating on the recent work, notably conceptual art, that the more
conventional Pompidou curators ignored.
MAM has since become an unquestionable success with Jacques Chirac and the
city council basking in its reflected glory. Meanwhile Jack Lang, always
anxious to preserve his reputation as France's grooviest politician, has
decided that Paris did not have enough space for contemporary art. He has
turned the Jeu de Paume - originally the royal tennis court in the Tuileries
Gardens and later the shabby, but evocative Impressionist museum - into a
new contemporary art gallery.
The Jeu de Paume has since shown a series of sensational exhibitions. The
MAM programme is as innovative as ever and the Pompidou Centre has drafted
in a new director, Dominique Bozo, with a brief to liven it up. There is
more modern art to see, and more galleries to visit, in Paris than ever
before. Long may hostilities go on.
