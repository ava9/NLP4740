PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The background music was by Marilyn Monroe, the clothes by Yves Saint Laurent. 
It was a sly combination that, for the first time during these spring-summer 
couture collections, had runway photographers ooh-la-la-ing and wolf whistling 
as models moved down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Often in the past, Saint Laurent has used grand opera as background music for 
his couture shows. But since Pierre Berge -- chairman of Saint Laurent and also 
president of the Association des Theatres de l'Opera de Paris -- is currently 
involved in a war of wills with Daniel Barenboim, musical director of the new 
Bastille Opera, the Monroe music seemed a more neutral choice. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Mitterrand, first lady of France, whose husband, French President 
Francois Mitterrand, appointed both Berge and Barenboim to their musical posts, 
had the seat of honor at the far end of the runway with Catherine Deneuve on 
one side and the Baroness Marie-Helene de Rothschild on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The first suits came out to the tune of "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," two of 
them classic pantsuit styles that Saint Laurent has made his signature -- but 
with the pants cropped well above the ankle. It's a look he introduced in his 
Rive Gauche ready-to-wear collection for spring. 
</P>
<P>
The third number down the runway couldn't have been more classic YSL: a navy 
wool crepe jacket with an above-the-knee navy skirt. When the model started to 
move, however, the skirt flashed open almost to the waistline, while the blouse 
under the jacket clung precariously to the shoulders before plummeting in a 
wide-open V to the waist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexy Trademark 
</P>
<P>
Jackets were tailored to look as if there was no blouse underneath, but there 
was always one of those bosom-baring beauties, often in a flash of red or pink 
to contrast with the more classic white, navy or black of the suits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Skirt lengths rested firmly above-the-knee for day, with the slit ones more 
revealing than the shortest of minis. Accessories were kept to a minimum: big, 
flat earrings close to the head; perky small straw hats perched on the 
forehead; white kid gloves and linen shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Oversized buttons in mother-of-pearl, silver, rhinestone or gold were used 
almost as jewels to decorate jackets and skirts and to outline the seaming on 
another important day look, the easy chemise dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The chemises had the same new shoulder as Saint Laurent's jackets: less sharply 
defined than in the past but still wide, with fabric folded over in a flange 
for a looser, easier fit. 
</P>
<P>
Another Saint Laurent signature is the tuxedo, and as always, he included a 
group of them in this collection. This time around, tuxedo jackets were usually 
shown with short or long dresses in black or navy silk chiffon. 
</P>
<P>
Paris is chiffon-mad for spring, but Saint Laurent's way with it was the 
freshest and most directional: almost sporty-looking tank tops and skirts in 
sheerest chiffon, under gabardine smoking jackets. The chiffon skirts, like 
their daytime equivalents, were slashed up to sash-wrapped waistlines. For 
evening, jewelry was more in evidence: mother-of-pearl snails curled against 
the ear lobe; armloads of pearl and coral bracelets or oversized jeweled 
crosses balanced on those almost bare bosoms. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the collection, Saint Laurent spliced black, navy and white groups 
with bursts of color: A scoop-neck cardigan jacket was in tomato crepe above 
ruby satin pants, the blouse in aquamarine chiffon and the straw pancake hat in 
tangerine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich Decoration 
</P>
<P>
Another Saint Laurent specialty is extravagant embroidery -- some of the pieces 
in these groups sell for over $60,000. And extravagant is the only word for the 
gazar capes in red, violet, tangerine and turquoise, which were re-embroidered 
with bougainvillea vines. The capes were over the simplest chiffon beauties of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Then, almost as the sherbet course in a too-rich banquet -- between these capes 
and a group of beaded matador jackets -- he slipped in two floor-length 
dresses, long-sleeved and completely covered up: one in tea rose pink, the 
other in black crepe. These brought down the house. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Hotel Maurice just across the street from the 
Intercontinental Hotel where Saint Laurent showed, Milan's Gianni Versace was 
putting the finishing touches on the small "Atelier" collection he will present 
at the Musee d'Orsay tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Atelier as in 'workrooms,' " Versace said of the clothes that are hand-made in 
workrooms above his palatial Milan apartment. Each outfit is repeated only 
once, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Versace fans include Jane Fonda, who has just ordered 12, and Cher, who has 
picked out three from a trunk show Versace's sister, Donatella, held recently 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Prices average about $4,000 to $5,000 for a day dress, $20,000 to $30,000 for 
an embroidered evening dress. 
</P>
<P>
The collections conclude today with Givenchy and Rome's Valentino showing 
couture in Paris for the first time.
