  [Text] Paris, March 4 (TANJUG) -- French authorities on 
Thursday [3 March] ran true to form in their anti-Serb 
discrimination policy and clamped their third ban on Serbs' 
peaceful demonstrations in under a month. 
  France banned the Serbs' Europe-wide peaceful protest from 
being staged in Strasbourg on February 6 and their more recent 
rally, organized by the Paris Union of Yugoslav Clubs. This 
discriminatory practice culminated on Thursday in the 
information to the president of the Serbian community in France, 
Ivan Jankovic, of the Paris police decision to ban the latest 
demonstration in Paris, planned for March 6. 
  The demonstration was to take the form of a march from the 
Place de la Republique to the Bastille, to end in a rally for an 
equitable peaceful settlement for war-shattered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the lifting of anti-Serb sanctions and the 
condemnation of the media demonisation of the Serbs. 
  As the reason for the ban, French authorities again offered 
the well-worn cliche that a Serb rally would "jeopardise public 
law and order." 
  In his protest against the decision, Serbian community 
President Jankovic dismissed the offered pretext as thin and 
groundless, and pointed out that Serb protests in France to date 
had never produced a single incident. 
  Considering the fact that Moslems are allowed to organise 
militantly-intoned demonstrations in France in which they 
clamour for retaliation and military intervention against the 
Serbs, it is obvious that the explanation that a Serb protest 
would be "jeopardising public law and order" is nothing but an 
effort to prevent the Serbs from raising their voice against the 
West's shameful policy towards Serbia, of which Paris is a 
foremost champion. 
  After being denied all access to the French media, which 
continue to foment hatred of Serbia and the Serbs, the Serbs in 
France are now being denied one of the basic democratic rights, 
viz. the right to public and peaceful demonstration. 
  France, which takes every opportunity to boast of its being 
in the forefront of the struggle for human rights, is violating 
in the case of the Serbs some of the basic provisions of the 
human rights declaration, initiated in its soil. 
  The question remains why French authorities have done 
nothing 
to prevent frequent attacks on Yugoslav diplomatic and other 
representations in France. Last month, the Yugoslav Embassy and 
cultural center in Paris were attacked in full view of an 
indifferent police. Shortly before, the Yugoslav consulate in 
Lyon was attacked. 
  No blame has officially been apportioned for the assaults, 
although French authorities have made promises of quick and 
efficient investigation.
