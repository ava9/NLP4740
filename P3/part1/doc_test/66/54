FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: French leave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dismissal of Chung Myung-whun as music director of Paris's Opera
Bastille is causing a furore back in his home country of South Korea. His
compatriots regard the sacking as an insult to their national honour, even
though Chung is now a US citizen.
One Seoul newspaper has suggested Korea retaliates by cancelling its
contract to buy French high-speed trains, while the ministry of culture has
lodged a protest with the French embassy.
More cannily, the Korean government hopes to exploit the fracas by using it
to get France to return ancient royal Korean documents, removed to Paris a
century ago by a French military expedition. Chung's case will be sacrificed
if the papers are returned; in which case his next performance will no doubt
be The Miraculous Mandarin.
