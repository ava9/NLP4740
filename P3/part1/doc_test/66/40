changing face of Europe's musical establishment during 1993

Three developments dominated the musical landscape of continental Europe
over the past year, each with broad implications for the future. The
appointment of Hugues Gall as head of the Paris Opera raised hopes that this
once-great institution may enjoy a rebirth. After nearly half a century of
boom, Germany's orchestras and opera companies found themselves hard hit by
recession. And in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continued to upset everyone and
anyone, provoking a public spat with Claudio Abbado over links between the
Easter and Summer festivals, and then telling the Vienna Philharmonic that
it may be dispensable.
Gall will not assume hands-on control of the Opera Bastille until 1995, but
his appointment - in the wake of the French centre-right parties' return to
power last March - has already injected a long-overdue note of realism. The
Bastille was a Socialist utopia, designed to give the highest number of
performances to the largest number of people in the best possible quality.
It has been a lame duck since its inauguration in 1989, plagued by technical
faults, rocketing budgets, poor artistic planning, bad management and
strikes - the latest of which, in November, forced the cancellation of the
opening night of Bob Wilson's Madama Butterfly.
Gall proposes strong medicine. The number of performances at the Bastille
will be reduced, but will include the grand classical ballets which can sell
out its 2700-seat auditorium. A select slab of the opera repertory will
return to the Palais Garnier (probably at higher prices than the Bastille),
alongside a reduced ballet schedule. Both houses will at some point be shut,
the Bastille for acoustical improvements, the Garnier for refurbishment.
The biggest challenge will be political. To bring down costs, staff must be
reduced, monopolies broken, contracts renegotiated. Gall will be treading a
tightrope with the unions and the Opera orchestra, who have sabotaged all
previous attempts at reform. He will try to 'cohabit' with the current music
director, Myung-Whun Chung, who stands to lose most of his power. With
Pierre Berge's motley management team now clearing their desks, the Bastille
can be expected to drift for the next 18 months. Gall, who was Rolf
Liebermann's deputy at the Opera in the 1970s, knows the problems inside
out. His record over the past 12 years in Geneva suggests he has the
political and artistic savoir-faire for the job. But he will be climbing an
operatic Everest.
Musical Germany fell into a state of shock as recession took its toll. From
Bielefeld to Bamberg, budgets were chopped by up to 20 per cent. Even the
Bayreuth Festival has been forced to trim expenditure. While the long-term
effect on morale and artistic vitality is far from clear, some conclusions
can be drawn. Germany has not made the mistake of subjecting its myriad
orchestras and theatres to a beauty contest; none will disappear. With few
exceptions (notably the Berlin Philharmonic), cuts have been applied equally
and received stoically.
But there has been a change in perception. High cultural spending has long
been taken for granted in Germany. There was unnecessary fat and a lot of
waste. One of the most perceptive remarks came from Christoph von Dohnanyi,
a former intendant in Frankfurt and Hamburg and now chief conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra: 'Hard times can also be healthy times. Theatres must
make themselves necessary to the society which pays for them. Art without
some financial pressure is not good - as long as the pressure is not so
great that it actually hinders art.'
Three years after his arrival in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continues to
ruffle feathers. His joust with Abbado over co-production plans for the 1995
Easter and Summer festivals may have ended inconclusively, but it showed
that Abbado was not to be out-manoeuvred. By forcing the Italian conductor
to fight on behalf of the Easter Festival, Mortier has unwittingly helped to
make it more independent of the summer event. Competition will be healthy.
Abbado has yet to indicate how far he plans to remould and liven up the
Easter Festival, but his record in Berlin suggests that no-one is better
able to change perceptions.
Mortier's conflict with the Vienna Philharmonic, which boiled over again in
early December, is more far-reaching. The orchestra has been resident at the
Summer Festival for 70 years; it even has a street in Salzburg named after
it. The musicians' threat to boycott the festival after 1995 has to be taken
seriously. Mortier considers the Philharmonic conservative and expensive,
and is not afraid to say so in public. He awarded last summer's opening
concert to a youth orchestra; the highlight of the 1994 concert programme
promises to be a Beethoven cycle featuring the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.
Mortier reckons the Salzburg Festival can survive without the Vienna
Philharmonic - but can Mortier survive his own non-stop offensive on the
festival's sacred cows? His programme has been a breath of fresh air.
Salzburg needed that - but it may not tolerate Mortier's big mouth
indefinitely.
Outside the festival season, Berlin clearly eclipsed Vienna as Europe's
musical capital, notwithstanding another excellent Wien Modern contemporary
music festival in November. Abbado has rejuvenated the Berlin Philharmonic;
Daniel Barenboim has transformed the Staatsoper unter den Linden. The fusion
of artistic life between east and west Berlin has been slow but not as
painful as anticipated. After watching the Schiller Theater go down as a
sacrificial lamb, most companies survived. Fears that the Deutsche Oper
might not last the decade now look unfounded.
In Munich, the Jonas touch has yet to be properly felt at the Bavarian State
Opera, despite a clever public relations campaign since the former ENO
general director arrived in September. His real test will be the July opera
festival: can he make it a truly festive event, or will it remain an
expensive run-through of repertory? Whatever tricks he pulls out of the bag,
Jonas surely realises he needs a more dynamic music director than Peter
Schneider.
Looking back over my own tally of performances, I find the following
reputations either enhanced or consolidated: Samuel Ramey, whose first Boris
Godunov (in Geneva) was imposing without excess histrionics; Nikolaus
Lehnhoff, whose poetic production of Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg - revived
at Zurich in the autumn - has almost single-handedly rehabilitated this
beautiful work; Sylvain Cambreling, whose conducting of Simon Boccanegra was
a much-needed fillip for Frankfurt's musical life; the Oslo Philharmonic,
which made a triumphant tour of Europe's four major summer festivals with
Mariss Jansons; the Bolshoi Opera, whose concert performances at the Lucerne
Festival showed a tradition intact; Waltraud Meier, whose courageous Isolde
at Bayreuth and radiant Sieglinde in Berlin vindicated her move into
dramatic soprano territory; and Olaf Henzold, the most promising young
German conductor.
Declining reputations included Placido Domingo, whose Bayreuth Parsifal
suggested an artist on automatic pilot; Bob Wilson and Ruth Berghaus, who do
little more than repeat their own theatrical cliches from one production to
the next; and Yuri Temirkanov, who is starting to become a liability for the
St Petersburg Philharmonic.
My performance of the year was Gounod's Mireille in Lausanne at the end of
November, a blissfully natural production of an underrated opera. No stars,
no ugliness, no vulgarity, no need to be strikingly original or modern -
just pure lyric charm, provencal atmosphere and a powerful performance from
Danielle Borst in the title role.
