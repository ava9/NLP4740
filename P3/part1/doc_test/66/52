NIGHT and day a small troop of armed guards are stationed beside the
barricades at either end of the rue de Bievre running down to the river from
the boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris fifth arrondissement.
The guards are there because rue de Bievre is the private address of
President Francois Mitterrand. He is rarely there. For the 11 years of his
presidency he has spent most of his time at the Elysee Palace, but he is
still fond of reminiscing about his time back at rue de Bievre when he would
pop along the street to the local bistrot.
Francois Mitterrand was born at Jarnac in Charente but has spent most of his
adult life in Paris, first as a journalist, then a lawyer and finally a
politician. From the moment he became president he made it absolutely clear
that he planned to make his mark on the city - and to make it last.
The Paris of 1981, when the socialists swept on to the streets to celebrate
the election of the first socialist president of the Fifth Republic, was a
very different city from the Paris of today.
The most visible legacies of the Mitterrand era are the glossy Grands
Projets - the luminous Louvre Pyramid, the giant Arc de la Defense and the
glittering Bastille opera house - that are now part and parcel of the
cityscape.
The culture of Paris has changed too. The old-fashioned ouvrier socialism of
the early Mitterrand era was quickly supplanted by the groovy gauche caviar
ethos of the rest of his regime.
Le gauche caviare is out of tune with the more ascetic mood of the early
1990s as the opinion polls attest. Francois Mitterrand now faces the
challenge of redefining socialism for the 1990s if he is to avoid an
enforced return to his old home on rue de Bievre after the next presidential
elections.
