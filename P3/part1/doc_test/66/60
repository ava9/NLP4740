A FRENCH vote against the Maastricht Treaty in the September 20 referendum
would break up the European Community, President Francois Mitterrand warned
yesterday.
A French 'no' vote to European union 'would break Europe, because there
would be no more impulse', Mr Mitterrand told a television interviewer
during the annual Bastille day celebration. 'It would put an end to 45 years
of French foreign policy . . . A French refusal would seem like a negation
of everything.' France's position was decisive, because 'it had a driving
role' in European construction.
The passion with which a normally cool Mr Mitterrand pleaded for Europe
yesterday reflects the rising political temperature in France as the
pre-referendum campaign gets under way.
On the surface, the government need not worry, because opinion polls suggest
60 per cent are in favour of Maastricht, compared with 40 per cent against.
Yet French opinion can be very volatile and the government is anxious the
electorate should not misuse the referendum to vote against Mr Mitterrand,
whose popularity is at a low ebb.
'I have never said that if you vote for Europe, you vote for me . . . I am
not concerned in this affair, neither with the yes nor with the no,' he said
yesterday.
Mr Mitterrand also attempted yesterday to mollify truckers and farmers,
whose recent protests against government decisions have been mingled with
anti-European feeling. He understood truckers' tough conditions and farmers'
fear of falling prices and accepted the right to demonstrate. Yet 'the state
had to make itself obeyed,' he explained, in reply to a question over the
use of force to shift roadblocks.
Because of the Maastricht vote, Mr Mitterrand suggested it was unlikely he
would hold a referendum this year on plans for constitutional reform. In
November, he said these could give the French parliament extra powers,
reduce the seven-year presidential mandate and introduce an element of
proportional representation into general elections.
