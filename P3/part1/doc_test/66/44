WHILE the art world prepares for the huge Paris contemporary art fair FIAC
this month reports are going round New York that no fewer than 100 Parisian
galleries have been forced to close by the recession. The figure is
inflated, but it is true that an unprecedented purge is on after years of
careless prosperity.
Galleries in France doubled in the 1980's from just over 500 to more than a
1,000, while sales of modern and contemporary paintings at auction tripled
between 1985-1990. Galleries working not directly with artists but
specialising in quick resales sprang up not only around the trendy east end
Bastille area but also on the Right Bank.
This year the effects of the 1990 contemporary art market crash which
started in New York began swathing through Paris. Prices for paintings have
dropped by a rough average of 50 per cent and turnover has fallen
proportionately.
Not only speculative dealers but quality dealers have been hit. Isy Brachot,
who also has a gallery in Bruxelles, closed his Left Bank Paris headquarters
this year. Baudoin Lebon, a specialist in leading French artist Jean
Dubuffet, had to file a petition in bankruptcy. Galerie Daniel Lelong, which
represents stars such as Francis Bacon and Spanish artist Antoni Tapies, has
been forced to shed half its staff and close one of its two Paris premises.
Antoine Candau, one of the first dealers championing young contemporary
artists to set up in the Bastille area, has gone out of business.
Most well established galleries with good stocks and good stables of
artists, however, are weathering the crisis. Brand new galleries with low
overheads representing up and coming, low priced artists are even beginning
to open in the streets around the Bastille.
The real test of the health of Paris's and Europe's contemporary art market
comes when the week long Paris FIAC (Foire Internationale de l'Art
Contemporain), one of the world's top fairs, opens in the Grand Palais on
October 24. Some 100,000 people are expected to visit 161 galleries, 87 of
them from abroad, representing works by some 700 artists. Some 400 more
dealers applied to take part and were refused.
Last year economic gloom frightened a lot of people at the FIAC into showing
very staid, classical material. This year looks like being livelier now that
the gloom has become chronic. A large number of stands are staging
particularly fine one man shows.
Paris dealer Marwan Hoss is showing 20 recent large format works by
reclusive Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, his first Paris exhibition in
10 years. Jacqueline Moussion is showing the work of the French based Haiti
born artist Herve Telemaque and the Korean Moon-Seup Shim. The works by the
former are stark combinations of minimalist sculpture and videos evoking
Haiti and its ills. Those by Shim form an altogether more tranquil
collection of sculptures in iron.
Jacqueline Moussion thinks it quite normal that some Paris galleries should
have disappeared while others, like hers, ride out the recession. 'Most of
those who have gone to the wall were merely commercial and didn't know what
art is. The best dealers always refused to supply their artists' works to
the galleries and auction houses out for short term profits. Dealers who
work with a stable of artists, foreign galleries, museum curators and
collectors will survive.'
MEANWHILE, the presence of the world's biggest spender, the Sultan of
Brunei, was reported stalking the jewellery section of the Biennale des
Antiquaires which was greeted with understandable joy. For this year the 120
participants at the world's grandest antiques and fine art show spent as
never before - FFr 50m all in all - to make the event as spectacular an
attraction as possible. It has been a huge success. Only a few days after
the opening of Biennale, which ends tomorrow, big sales were being reported.
Paris dealer Yves Mikaeloff's stand was soon deprived of its star exhibit, a
massive, FFr 12m, mahogany and gilded bronze commode made in 1770 by French
cabinet-makers Severin and Foullet - the client insisted on taking it with
him. Mikaeloff also sold two paintings, five drawings and a William Morris
carpet while his neighbours, tapestry specialists Galerie Chevalier, parted
with eight pieces ranging from FFr 80,000 - FFr 2m, all to new clients, on
the first day.
The overall quality of the art has never been so high. Thanks to 18th
century French specialists such as the Antiquaires a Paris group, the
quality of furniture is top notch. Jean Lupu boasts a very rare Riesener
table of 1780 from the Roseberry collection and a rosewood and porcelain
plaque desk made by Martin Carlin for the marriage of the Comte d'Artois,
brother of Louis XVI.
Carlton Hobbs from London, a newcomer, is showing extremely fine 18th-19th
century Russian and English furniture. The standard of Old Master paintings
is better than ever with specialists such as Agnew's and Richard Green from
London and Haboldt and Tassel from Paris joined this year for the first time
by Colnaghi, who set up a gallery in Paris earlier in the year.
A major attraction on the Colnaghi stand and perfect for the French market
was La Baigneuse, a masterpiece by 18th century aritst Francois Le Moyne
which recently surfaced in Brazil. Newhouse Galleries of New York, teamed up
with Verner Amell of London, are showing an historical and exceedingly fine
imaginary landscape by three leading Italian artists of the day - Canaletto,
Pittoni and Cimaroli, commissioned in 1722 by the Irish actor and playwright
Owen McSwiny on behalf of Lord March. It was on offer for Pounds 950,000.
Nearby, hangs one of the very last paintings by Chardin we will ever see on
the market - an exquisite still life of peaches, pears and a beaker of wine
of 1760.
Dealers in highly specialised fields had clearly made an effort to display
exceptional stock. Sarti of London had a Virgin by 15th century Florentin
painter Gherardo Starnina and a late 16th century Italian marble marquetry
table top which both deserve to go straight to a museum. Brussels based
Chinese art specialist Gisele Croes, one of several oriental art specialists
present, attracted a lot of attention from museum curators with an
exhibition of Han and Tang period earthenware figures, Shang period bronzes
in perfect condition and nine exceedingly rare sculpted bronze plates from
the Dian kingdom, representing hunting scenes and with price tags of between
Dollars 80-100,000.
Decoration on the grandest of scales is catered for, too with several
furniture dealers chosing to wall their stands with antique wood panelling.
Achkar Charriere boasts painted panels with inset canvases by late 18th
century painter Fassin from Liege. Gismondi of Paris has late 18th Century,
light blue and green panels complete with a bas relief panel by sculptor
Clodion. Axel Vervoordt from Antwerp offered one room of 18th century French
white colonnaded bookcase panelling and a complete Louis XIV room stripped
to its original light green paint in order to set off, he said, his antique
Chinese bronzes.
