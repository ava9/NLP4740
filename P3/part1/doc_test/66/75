FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Some dreams come true - International opera

The international musical year makes its most dynamic start on the other
side of the Atlantic, with three world premieres over the next six weeks.
America's most experienced opera composer, Dominick Argento, evokes the
spirit of the legendary 1920s Hollywood actor Rudolph Valentino in his new
opera The Dream of Valentino, which will be unveiled by the Washington Opera
(Jan 15). The other two premieres are orchestral: Kurt Masur conducts the
New York Philharmonic in Schnittke's Eighth Symphony (Feb 10), and Daniel
Barenboim conducts a new Elliott Carter work in Chicago (Feb 17).
In Europe, the spotlight falls initially on the Bavarian State Opera in
Munich, where Peter Jonas has launched a British invasion in his first
season as intendant. Tom Cairns designs and directs Un ballo in maschera
with a cast including Dennis O'Neill and Julia Varady (Jan 31), while
Richard Jones and Charles Mackerras tackle Giulio Cesare, with Ann Murray in
the title role (March 21).
Zurich also makes a rare foray into Handel with Alcina (Feb 5), one of two
new productions conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt - the other being a very
Viennese-looking La Belle Helene (May 28). The highlight of the Geneva
season promises to be Francesca Zambello's new staging of Billy Budd, with a
cast headed by Robert Tear, Rodney Gilfry and Samuel Ramey (March 15).
Claudio Abbado's Faust series with the Berlin Philharmonic reaches its
climax with Mahler's Eighth Symphony (Feb 12/13), but the event likely to
generate most excitement in Berlin is saved for the end of the season - when
Carlos Kleiber emerges from seclusion to conduct the federal president's
charity concert (June 28).
Nothing in the Milan programme arouses undue interest - except perhaps
Riccardo Muti's Rigoletto (May 14). French tenor star-in-waiting Roberto
Alagna sings the Duke, before moving to Paris to join Nuccia Focile in Romeo
et Juliette at the Opera-Comique (June 24). Apart from a showing of Harry
Kupfer's 1987 Stuttgart production of Die Soldaten at the Bastille (Jan 22),
the only big-scale opera project in Paris is a new Ring at the Chatelet,
conducted by Jeffrey Tate and staged by Pierre Strosser (June-Nov).
That may be overshadowed by the new Ring at Bayreuth - a curious marriage of
arch-radical producer, Alfred Kirchner, and arch-conservative conductor,
James Levine. But Bayreuth faces strong competition from this summer's
Salzburg programme, which promises to be Gerard Mortier's strongest yet: a
Barenboim-Chereau Don Giovanni, two cycles of Beethoven symphonies conducted
by Harnoncourt, a Stravinsky series featuring a Nagano-Sellars Oedipus Rex,
and plenty of Stockhausen and Boulez.
Lovers of operatic rarities will seek out Lalo's Le Roi d'Ys at Marseille
(March 16) and Reyer's Sigurd at Montpellier (May 6). But the most
intriguing of all is the revival of Hans Krasa's Dostoyevsky opera Uncle's
Dream at the Prague State Opera - formerly Prague's German theatre, where it
was premiered by George Szell in 1933. Krasa was gassed at Auschwitz, and
the opera has not been heard since - unlike his children's opera Brundibar,
which was performed last year at London's South Bank. When a young Israeli
conductor, Israel Yinon, recently asked Universal Edition for the score, he
was told it had been lost. He persisted, and eventually found Krasa's
manuscript, complete with Szell's pencil markings, in the basement of the
publisher's Vienna premises. Yinon conducts Uncle's Dream in Prague on March
27. (The production transfers to Mannheim in June.)
