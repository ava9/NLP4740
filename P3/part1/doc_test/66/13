A NEW crisis has erupted in the Paris opera world following the dramatic
resignation of Mr Philippe Belaval as director general of L'Opera de Paris,
after weeks of conflict with Mr Pierre Berge, the controversial president.
The immediate cause of Mr Belaval's resignation was last month's accident in
Seville, when a set collapsed during an Opera de Paris production of Verdi's
Otello, killing one member of the chorus and injuring 30 others.
Mr Belaval has since clashed with Mr Myung Whun Chung, artistic director and
a protege of Mr Berge, over who should bear responsibility for the tragedy.
The Seville disaster followed a tense period of industrial disputes at
L'Opera de Paris, which operates the opulent new Opera Bastille, as well as
the Opera Comique and Palais Garnier. This tension came to a head late last
month in a row between Mr Belaval and Mr Berge over the conduct of their
long-running negotiations with the trade unions.
Mr Berge, known as Pierre la Panthere because of his fiery temperament, made
a fortune by founding Yves Saint Laurent, the famous French fashion house
and is a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand.
Mr Belaval's resignation is the latest in a series of dramas to have hit
L'Opera de Paris in the four temptestuous years of his presidency.
Mr Berge first hit the headlines at L'Opera de Paris by firing Mr Daniel
Barenboim, the world-renowned German conductor, as artistic director. There
has since been the controversy over the two-year-old Opera Bastille, the
Pounds 70m showcase of the French government's ambitious arts investment
programme.
President Mitterrand saw Opera Bastille as a 'people's opera' with a
state-of-the-art auditorium and cheap seats.
But while the new opera has won praise for its productions, it has been
burdened by the old L'Opera de Paris union agreements resulting in
intermittent strikes and high ticket prices.
Mr Belaval has for the past 20 months been locked in negotiations with the
unions to amend those agreements.
The original deadline for the negotiations was set for next Saturday, but
last month Mr Berge, to Mr Belaval's fury, agreed to extend it until
November.
Mr Belaval resigned in a letter which was fiercely critical of L'Opera de
Paris' management.
Three other senior executives left last week amid rumours of more
departures.
So far the crisis has not affected the programme, since the opera house has
closed for the summer, but the Opera Bastille may have to delay the premiere
of Arthur Honegger's Marriage of Figaro which was intended to be its first
production in the autumn.
