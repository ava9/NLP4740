Normandy is bracing itself for this weekend's commemorative assault, writes
David Buchan in Caen.
The combined force includes some 14 heads of state and governments, 40,000
D-Day veterans, 100,000 tourists and battalions of broadcasters and press.
To ensure it does not finish off in the next few days what Operation
Overlord began 50 years ago, France has just declared the remains of
Hitler's Atlantic Wall defences an historic monument.
But the region will take a pounding before the main commemoration ends on
Monday night in a peace extravaganza in Caen. US, British, Canadian and
French paratroops are to re-enact tomorrow their 'drops' on the western and
eastern edges of the invasion zone. Most will be serving troops. But the
landing may feel on the hard side for the 38 veterans of US 82nd Airborne
Division, aged between 68 and 83, who have persuaded reluctant French
authorities that they are fit enough to fall out of the sky over
Sainte-Mere-Eglise, just as they did 50 years ago.
On Monday, the five kings and queens, five presidents, four prime ministers
and one governor general will criss-cross the area in a complicated
quadrille of bilateral ceremonies. One, France's 76-year-old President
Francois Mitterrand, will have to be virtually everywhere as host, while all
will be at the 'international' ceremony on Monday afternoon at Omaha Beach,
the scene of the worst allied casualties on June 6, 1944 with the deaths of
3,000 Americans.
Absent, perforce, will be any official representatives of Germany, which
lost 58,000 men in the Battle of Normandy to the 37,000 allied dead, even
though there will be at least one small unofficial American-German ceremony
at the private initiative of veterans of both sides. But Mr Mitterrand has
invited German troops belonging to the Eurocorps, and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, to attend France's Bastille day parade in Paris next month. Germany
will be present, too, at next May's ceremonies marking the end of the second
world war.
Meanwhile, however, this weekend's events will require considerably more
troops than the free French were able to muster for D-Day - 15,000 soldiers
to ensure the logistics, 7,000 gendarmes to guard the roads, and 4,000
police controlling crowds. 'It's a bit like organising a summit meeting in
the middle of the Olympic Games,' says Mr Roger Gros, the harassed prefet of
Lower Normandy, referring to the problem of trying to ensure the safety of
so many bigwigs among so many other people in such a large area.
But he will have, as the allies did half a century ago, the advantage of air
superiority. An air exclusion zone will prevent anything but VIP helicopters
from circulating over the Normandy coast.
Controlling the sea may be harder. In the royal yacht Britannia, Queen
Elizabeth is expected tomorrow to lead a small armada from Portsmouth, where
tonight she is to host a state dinner. Her Majesty should have no problem.
Pressure on her civil list is not such that Britannia has had to take on
cheap Chinese crew, which is the reason that French sailors gave for
preventing two P&amp;O ferries from docking at Cherbourg on Thursday.
The presence of 45 warships, as well as several thousand private boats, will
ease the hotel squeeze in Normandy. The Queen will stay on the Britannia
moored in the port of Caen, while President Bill Clinton will repair, aptly,
to the Dwight Eisenhower aircraft carrier.
Other dignitaries have had to settle for staying in Paris, so as not to
disrupt long-made hotel reservations by D-Day veterans. On Wednesday a Caen
tribunal ordered a local hotel to pay 50 British veterans from the Lancaster
Regiment FFr1,500 each in compensation for cancelling their bookings.
In general, the welcome has been warm - and commercial. All sorts of
souvenirs for D-Day, or Jour-J as it is known in French, are on sale,
including Bordeaux and Beaujolais under the 'Debarquement 44' label.
Luckily, it is not actually that vintage, which would not have aged as well
as the veterans.
