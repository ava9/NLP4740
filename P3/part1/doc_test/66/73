<P>
Two epochal events in the course of human rights happened almost simultaneously 
200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly approved the Declaration of the Rights of Man on 
Aug. 26, 1789, shortly after the Bastille had been stormed by mobs looking for 
weapons. On Sept. 25 that same year, the new Congress of the United States 
approved the Bill of Rights, in the form of 10 amendments to the Constitution. 
One document marked the beginning of a revolution, the other ratified the 
resolution of a revolutionary war. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1989 various bicentennial celebrations are planned, to commemorate 
the common concern for civil rights in both the United States and France, but 
differences are worth noting, too. Governing philosophies affect nations, just 
as revolutions do. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly did not include common people, but clerics, 
aristocrats and bourgeoisie. And the declaration they framed was written with 
some apprehension about the coming terror in the streets. Consequently, many of 
the rights proclaimed were qualified by duties expected of citizens. First and 
foremost, men were declared both free and equal, but social distinctions were 
said to be acceptable when useful. And to this day privileged Parisians proudly 
accept their social standing as the patrimony of the nation. Otherwise, who 
would set the poor a good example? Freedom of religion was guaranteed, but not 
to the extent it might disturb the public order, as defined by government. 
Freedom of speech was similarly subject to constraints imposed by law, to guard 
against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty was taken from the sovereign and given to the nation as a whole. 
But there were provisos written into the rights of man, to keep individuality 
constrained. Equality before the law replaced arbitrariness of government but 
government would evaluate the interests of the people and impose limits on 
freedoms and on fairness whenever necessary. The nation's interest, under law, 
superseded that of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
The common welfare of the nation has generally prevailed as the governing 
philosophy in France. Elected officials and well-educated functionaries are 
guided by what they take to be the best interests of the state. So, nuclear 
weapons are exploded on Pacific atolls, without the consent of native 
islanders, and Greenpeace warriors are murdered in the name of France. Actions 
that foreigners abhor are seen to be a duty, serving the interests of the 
nation. It is a philosophy that has proved popular to Francophiles. It has also 
inspired chauvinism. Every philosophy of government is double-edged; this is 
France's sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bill of Rights was founded on a different, "don't tread on me" 
philosophy, where the rights of man superseded duties to the nation. Unlike the 
French declaration, Congress imposed rights without restrictions. No laws would 
be countenanced constraining religion, freedom of the press or speech. The 
right of persons to assemble peaceably -- even to complain about the government 
-- was absolute. The right of citizens to keep and bear arms was not to be 
infringed. And the Ninth Amendment endorsed all other rights belonging to the 
people, in addition to those not spelled out in the Constitution. The 
Constitution could be changed, of course, but short of amending these 
amendments the welfare of the nation could not take precedence over the 
privileges of persons. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining items in the Bill of Rights were largely procedural protections, 
guaranteeing individuals their day in court, similar to legal rights being 
guaranteed in France. Finally, the 10th Amendment insisted that except for 
powers explicitly written into the Constitution, the powers of the people and 
of the separate states were sacrosanct. This same philosophy was soon embraced 
by the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson as self-reliant conservatism -- 
a philosophy suspicious of officials. 
</P>
<P>
Our unrestricted freedoms have come to include far more than the Founding 
Fathers bargained for: pornographic movies, Nazis marching in the streets and 
ghetto gangs packing submachine guns. The result of such excesses has produced 
a philosophic friction. 
</P>
<P>
Today's conservatives enthusiastically embrace self-reliance but seek to 
override the Constitution when it comes to pornography and unwelcome 
demonstrations, while at the same time invoking constitutional protection to 
sell weapons. And the American Civil Liberties Union, which favors an 
interventionist philosophy, finds itself engaged in defending self-reliance, 
with lawsuits over creches, crosses and menorahs displayed in public places, 
not to mention defending the right of the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate. Both 
conservatives and liberals invoke "don't tread on me" selectively. It's getting 
hard to tell who is on the side of what. 
</P>
<P>
About the time Emerson was writing "Self-Reliance," Alexis de Tocqueville 
observed how our form of government enhances the political power of those 
lawyers who "do not, indeed, wish to overthrow the institutions of democracy, 
but they constantly endeavor to turn it away from its real direction by means 
which are foreign to its nature." Certainly, our procedural freedoms have been 
abused by those who can afford sufficiently enterprising lawyers to exploit 
their clients' Fourth through Eighth Amendment rights, just as our freedoms of 
religion, speech and assembly sometimes turn democracy into a circus of con men 
all petitioning the courts. It can even make you want to emigrate to France. 
</P>
<P>
Homespun philosophies never exactly fit the individuals they're designed to 
suit; the same is true of ideologies. What is required is not to abandon all 
political philosophy, but to recognize the limited vision of our principles and 
to compensate for them with some common sense. 
</P>
<P>
France faces the problem of sufficiently ignoring the nation's interest to 
respect the rights of individuals, to counter state chauvinism, to be tolerant 
of human differences. The United States faces an opposite dilemma, to protect 
whole segments of society against the power of self-interested individuals, be 
they common criminals or financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Just as France must restrain its intervention, we often need to intervene 
through legislation to accommodate the limitations of the Bill of Rights. 
"Don't tread on me" does not do much for those who are already trodden on: the 
ignorant, the homeless, the disabled and the poor -- those who cannot rely upon 
themselves. The Bill of Rights does not include economic guarantees to live the 
kinds of lives that would make those rights worthwhile. For this reason, the 
14th Amendment intervened to provide equal protection under law to supplement 
equality before the law. Compassion is the common cure for ideology. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain naivete to any grand design of government. When the 
Declaration of Independence proclaimed "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of 
Happiness," it also chastised the king of England for not suppressing 
insurrections among the "merciless Indian savages." Unfortunately, perfect 
social progress cannot be mandated by courts or guaranteed by legislation or 
brought about by manifesto and revolution. It is, after all, a government of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson's self-reliance sided with the skeptics. France's National Assembly 
took the opposite approach and thought of the state as a god. Neither 
philosophy faced up to the limits of its vision. Neither the Declaration of the 
Rights of Man nor the Bill of Rights addressed the difference between civil 
liberties and those rights that know no borders and no country.
