made the arts a success story

DAY after day hundreds of people queue patiently, and not so patiently, on
the square outside the Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris waiting to buy
tickets for the Matisse exhibition.
The Matisse show has been billed as a highlight of the European arts year.
It is also an appropriately grandiose final fling for France's Socialist
government, which, after a decade of lavish support for the arts, faces
crushing defeat in the parliamentary elections, for which the first round is
held this weekend.
Despite the general disenchantment with the Socialists, the arts is one area
where they are still deemed to be successful, thanks partly to the personal
standing of Mr Jack Lang, the charismatic minister of arts and culture who
consistently tops the polls as France's most popular elected politician.
Few political acts are genuinely impossible to follow but that of Mr Lang,
53, is probably one of them. He is a flamboyant figure with apparently
indefatigable energy and a taste for snappy designer suits, who has
dominated the French arts scene since the Socialists first took power in
1981. Liberation, the bible of French culture buffs, even calls the 1980s
l'epoch Lang, the Lang era.
The conservatives now face the unenviable task of finding a way of following
Mr Lang after the elections.
French culture has had a new lease of life in l'epoch Lang, when the
proportion of the state budget allocated to the arts has doubled from 0.5
per cent in 1981 to 1 per cent, or FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn), in 1993. Mr Lang
has also pulled off the rare feat of developing popular and innovative
policies. He has done so by blending elements of conventional Socialist
cultural dirigisme, such as state subsidies and industrial restructuring,
with new themes, notably corporate sponsorship.
Mr Lang has even plundered some ideas from the conservatives. The Grands
Projets, the monumental modern architecture schemes including I M Pei's
glass pyramid in the Louvre museum and Jean Nouvel's Arab cultural centre,
are his most visible legacy. But they trace their roots to the 1970s review
of public sector building commissioned by the conservative President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing.
Mr Lang's record is far from flawless. French television is in a fragile
financial state, which culminated in last year's collapse of La Cinq, the
entertainment station. The Paris opera struggles from crisis to crisis
despite an annual budget of FFr800m (two-thirds of which comes from the
state) and the opening three years ago of the glittering FFr3bn Bastille
opera house.
The Lang regime, long criticised by the right, is now under fire from his
old supporters on the left. The latest film from Eric Rohmer, The Tree, The
Mayor and The Mediatheque, is a scathing satire of a Socialist mayor who
secures a generous grant from the Arts Ministry to build a media complex in
his tiny village. Le Canard Enchane, the satirical magazine, recently
published a leaked story about Mr Lang's plans to produce a film about his
own achievements.
But the electorate seems willing to overlook Mr Lang's shortcomings, as
illustrated by his success in the opinion polls. This has left the
conservative coalition of the RPR and UDF in a difficult position. Mr Lang,
the epitome of the sybaritic gauche caviar who have thrived under President
Mitterrand, is exactly the sort of Socialist the conservatives most loathe.
Moreover an extravagant Socialist arts minister is an easy campaign target.
But the right has been forced on to the defensive in the election campaign.
This is partly because of Mr Lang's popularity and partly because of an
internal split. The UDF favours an ascetic approach to cultural spending;
the RPR, whose leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, comes close to rivalling Mr Lang
with his munificent cultural budgets as mayor of Paris, is more indulgent.
All that the conservatives have produced in terms of policy is a pledge to
erase what they call the 'cultural inequalities' of Mr Lang's policies by
fostering cultural activity in the provinces and giving more power to local
authorities to launch their own arts initiatives.
This sounds suspiciously similar to both the Socialists' own arts manifesto
and to the policies pursued by the last conservative government between 1986
and 1988, when, despite constant debates over whether to scrap various Lang
programmes, the right did little to reverse his policies.
The conservatives are also searching for a suitable successor. Mr Alain
Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, and Mr Jacques Tubon, secretary general of the
RPR, have been mooted as candidates as has Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, the
populist philosopher whose girlfriend, Ms Arielle Dombasle, stars in the new
Rohmer film.
Mr Lang himself has always maintained that the true test of his influence
will be whether his reforms survive his departure from his opulent offices
at the Palais Royal in Paris. He will soon find out.
