minister Jacques Toubon

THE SUMPTUOUS 18th-century corridors of the French culture ministry at the
Palais Royal in Paris have been bustling with activity as Jack Lang, the
former arts minister, moved out and Jacques Toubon, his successor, moved in.
It is the end of an era for the arts in France. Lang, 53, with his curly
locks and Thierry Mugler suits, has dominated the cultural scene for nearly
a decade with his innovative policies, big budgets, lavish promotions and
the grands projets, his monuments to modern architecture. Liberation, bible
of the French intelligentsia, even dubbed the 1980s - l'epoch Lang, the Lang
era.
What happens now? Will the new conservative government provide the same
level of financial support as the socialists? How will the arts be affected
by the austerity measures announced by Edouard Balladur, the new prime
minister? And how will Toubon match up to Lang?
Toubon does, at least, want the job. Francois Leotard, culture minister in
the last conservative government from 1986 to 1988, reluctantly accepted the
portfolio only after President Francois Mitterrand had blocked his
appointment as defence minister, the post he holds in the new cabinet.
But the gregarious Toubon, 51, a casino croupier's son from Nice who entered
politics from the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, is an arts
enthusiast. He is also a confidant of Jacques Chirac, prime minister in the
last conservative administration and now mayor of Paris, where he rivals
even Lang in the extravagance of his arts budget.
Toubon made an early play for the culture ministry by writing the
conservatives' arts manifesto, beating off competition for the job from
Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, and Bernard-Henri Levy, the 'pop'
philosopher.
The new minister's enthusiasm may not be enough. The chief concern of the
arts community is the fate of the cultural budget, which rose rapidly in
l'epoch Lang from 0.47 per cent of government expenditure in 1981, when Lang
took office, to 0.98 per cent last year. Traditionally the conservatives
have cut the budget. It fell from 0.93 per cent when Leotard arrived in 1986
to 0.81 per cent when he left in 1988.
Lang was lucky. He presided over the culture ministry when the French
economy was booming. Toubon is less fortunate. The economy is now sluggish
and the conservatives have inherited a FFr226bn (Pounds 28.35bn) budget
deficit. Balladur has asked his new cabinet to save FFr20bn from annual
expenditure, some of which must come from the arts.
Which areas will be most vulnerable? The grands projets are now completed.
The only exception is the FFr7.2bn Tres Grande Bibliotheque, the
controversial new national library designed by Dominique Perrault, which is
still a hole in the ground. But Lang has already spent FFr4bn digging the
hole, and Toubon has conceded that it will go ahead.
However, there are likely to be far fewer new schemes. The Opera Bastille
may find it difficult to persuade the conservatives to fund its plans for a
1,100 seat auditorium to stage smaller productions. The final phase of the
FFr5.6bn Grand Louvre scheme, which involves renovating and extending the
galleries of the Louvre museum and the neighbouring Musee des Arts
Decoratifs, could also be curtailed.
Toubon has hinted that the conservatives may cut contributions to the
running costs of arts institutions, particularly in Paris. The Opera
Bastille's FFr520m state subsidy may be vulnerable as the new opera has been
clouded by controversy and lack-lustre reviews.
The cuts could pose problems for some institutions. The conservatives will
encourage them to raise extra money from corporate sponsorship. But French
industry is now under financial pressure. Moreover, many big arts sponsors
are state-controlled companies which may be less generous once they are sold
off in the conservatives' privatisation programme.
Toubon will do his best to mitigate the damage, and one of his strongest
cards will be Lang who, although he has lost some of his lustre, is still
France's most popular elected politician. He also had the advantage of being
in power for so long that he had enough time to implement his policies.
A great deal will depend on Toubon's own status within the cabinet. He has
far less clout than his predecessor. Lang used the arts portfolio as a base
from which to build a cultural 'super-ministry' including media, education
and, eventually, the deputy prime ministership. Toubon only has the arts
brief.
Toubon's personal position is also more precarious. Lang had the inestimable
advantage of being a favourite of President Mitterrand. The new arts
minister's chief ally, Chirac, is not even in the cabinet, having gambled
that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential elections will be better
if he stays outside the government.
