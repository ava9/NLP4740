EU leaders look set today to name Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's prime
minister, as the new president of the European Commission in succession to
Mr Jacques Delors.
In spite of widespread concern in Brussels and among senior EU diplomats and
national officials that the Commission would be badly weakened after Mr
Delors' influential 10-year stewardship, Mr Santer appeared the only
candidate behind whom the 12 member states could unite.
However, in a development that raises the possibility of a setback at
today's special summit in Brussels, Denmark announced yesterday the rival
candidacy of Mr Poul Schluter, a former conservative prime minister. Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, declared Mr Schluter's candidacy
after meeting parliamentary leaders.
'The Danish government finds that Mr Schluter is the Danish candidate with
the best chances of getting the post,' he told Danish radio. 'It is too
early to say what the outcome of Friday's summit will be . . . but Mr
Schluter is Denmark's candidate.'
In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand predicted that today's summit would
agree on the Brussels succession, and stressed that the person must be
'someone who speaks French'. Mr Santer, 57, has led a Christian
Democrat-Socialist coalition in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg since 1984. He
speaks fluent French and German, as well as English.
The British government yesterday signalled strongly that it expected Mr
Santer to emerge as the consensus choice, although UK officials warned that
other candidates remained.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, refrained from naming Mr Santer during
Commons exchanges but said there was 'a substantial difference' between the
current candidates and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who
was vetoed by the UK at the Corfu summit.
Strong backing for Mr Santer emerged yesterday from Portugal. 'If the
candidature of the prime minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, is
confirmed, Portugal will approve it enthusiastically,' Mr Jose Manuel Durao
Barroso, the foreign minister, told reporters.
Last-minute consultations took place in Paris. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, Mr Mitterrand, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister,
Mr Dehaene and Mr Santer all attended Bastille Day celebrations.
