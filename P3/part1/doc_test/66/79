Striking technicians at the Paris Opera house forced the cancellation of a 
production of "Faust" this week, but on Wednesday they agreed to let a planned 
cancer benefit gala starring Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr. go 
ahead on Tuesday. The technicians are protesting plans to transfer staff to a 
new People's Opera at Place de la Bastille, which is still under construction. 
Performances of Tchaikovsky's ballet, "Sleeping Beauty," which is playing on 
alternate nights with "Faust," are being disrupted by a separate pay strike by 
the opera's dancers. ALEENE MacMINN
