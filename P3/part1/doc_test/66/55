Financial scandals, robbery, law and order - the subject of Les Brigands has
an enduring relevance while Offenbach's music remains unquenchably alive.
This production by Jerome Deschamps and Macha Makeieff, made for Amsterdam
and adapted for the Opera Bastille, uses an assemblage of scraps of old-type
scenery-painted cloths, paste-board, old methods, old gags and even old
costumes from provincial theatre wardrobes. That may sound tatty, but choice
and blending have been done with such flair and affection that the result is
ravishing, colourful and witty.
The performance crackles with a cheerful vigour calculated to please all
except the stuffies who do not want theatre to be theatrical.
There are problems: most of the cast have difficulty in projecting words in
the cold spaces of the Bastille auditorium. There are two casts of
principals. I heard Georges Gautier as Falsacappa (chief bandit), Michele
Lagrange as his daughter Fiorella, Brigitte Balleys in the travesty part of
her adored Fragoletto. Pleasing, warm-voiced performances all of them, but
only about half their words came over.
Of the permanent cast the ever-reliable Jules Bastin as the chief of the
carabiniers, Ryland Davies and Daniel Galvez-Vallejo as the Spanish envoys
and Steven Cole as the impenitently unreliable cashier had more luck. The
welter of noises off and on, the abundance of picturesque livestock real and
sham, though it gave the audience enormous pleasure, did not help the
clarity, but the size of the place was chiefly to blame.
Invaluable support came from the conductor (on the night I attended it was
Louis Langree) the soul of crisp discretion in accompaniments, in able
control of the ensembles. One does not often find Offenbach revivals where
riotous theatricality is so well joined to musical quality.
What better symbol for Cilea's opera Adriana Lecouvreur could there be than
a bunch of faded violets? Much is seen and heard of this nosegay in the
libretto, based on an old piece of theatrical hokum by Scribe and Legouve,
once a vehicle for Sarah Bernhardt. The opera, first given in 1902, has
survived chiefly by virtue of two popular arias; and, as Julian Budden
neatly puts it in the New Grove Opera Guide, mainly because of the
'opportunities it affords to an experienced prima donna who has already
passed her prime'.
There is not much else. Cilea knew all the tricks but his invention is weak.
In the well-known arias he explores a genuine gift for rather flaccid
melancholy reflection. But he works his themes too hard. The ascending
phrase associated with the 'humble handmaiden' aria is heard almost as often
as its cousin in 'Depuis le Jour' in Charpentier's Louise. Most of the
comedy scenes are made out of leavings from Falstaff
Mirella Freni takes the title-role in this new production at the Bastille.
Experienced she certainly is but not, on this evidence, in decline. There
was some hard tone, but she cossets and floats the lyrical phrases with
undiminished charm and skill. Still, she hardly suggests the burning fires
of the tragedienne, rather the quiet confidence and poise of a polished,
versatile comedienne - more Marie Tempest than monstre sacre.
Peter Drovsky, singing Adriana's lover Maurizio in place of the announced
Giacomo Aragall, was effective in his forceful way except when he belted out
phrases as if he were already on the battlefield. As Michonnet, loyal and
devoted stage director, Jean-Luc Chaignaud, a baritone of whom we shall
surely hear more, did full justice to the best of the male roles.
The young conductor Maurizio Benini accompanied skilfully without spurring
the orchestra to much eloquence. Production by Jean-Luc Boutte, decor and
costumes by Louis Bercut, were economical to the point of stinginess;
Bercut's costumes on the other hand were very fine.
