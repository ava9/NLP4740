If a French conservative were asked to compile a hit-list of the gauche
caviar, the sybaritic socialists with a penchant for designer suits and
conceptual art, the name of Mr Jack Lang, France's minister of education,
culture and communications, would almost certainly be at the top.
'They hate me. They detest me,' he says, with more than a hint of smugness.
'To them I am the devil, the incarnation of immorality, a force for evil.'
Mr Lang, who is 52, can afford to be smug. As arts minister, he has become
so popular - two out of three French people admire him, according to the
opinion polls - that his name was cited in the past fortnight as a candidate
to succeed Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister.
After days of uncertainty, President Francois Mitterrand last Thursday chose
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, his stolid finance minister. 'Bere' was a safer choice,
but the minister of culture would have been more charismatic. As a
consolation prize, Mr Lang was given education to add to his old arts
portfolio.
It is astonishing that Mr Lang's name should have been mentioned at all as
potential prime minister. The arts ministry is not generally seen as a
springboard to higher things in politics in France or elsewhere.
However, he has a close relationship with President Mitterrand, and has
emerged at the forefront of French politics through the force of his
personality. He worked his way up from the grassroots of the Socialist party
after starting his career as a law professor, who made his name in the arts
by founding the International Theatre Festival at Nancy in the 1960s.
He has never been far from the headlines or from controversy during his time
at the culture ministry. There was uproar when Mr Lang and his colleagues
fired the conductor, Mr Daniel Barenboim, from the Paris Opera. There was
another row last year when, after the sculpture at the Louvre subway station
had been defaced by graffiti, Mr Lang announced that he was inaugurating an
exhibition of graffiti art. Most recently he has been pilloried in the
French press for pinning the Order of Arts and Letters on the chunky chest
of Mr Sylvester Stallone, the Hollywood movie star better known for brawn
than brain. One columnist said the Croix de Guerre, a military medal, might
have been more appropriate.
The French press relishes the rumpus over his adventures and misadventures,
but so does Mr Lang. 'Where there is hostility there is debate,' he says,
with a shrug of the shoulders and an elaborate lift of the eyebrows. 'At
least it means people are talking about the arts.'
Although he made no secret of his hopes of becoming prime minister, at one
point pleading for the job on French television, it is impossible to imagine
him enjoying anything as much as his present post. His energy is
unquestionable. Night after night he sweeps into exhibition openings
accompanied by camera crews. His present projects include the renovation of
the 18th-century Palais Royal Gardens, the celebration of the centenary of
the death of Rimbaud, the French poet, and the construction of the new
national library, the tres grande bibliotheque.
Since last May, when he became government spokesman, he has been even more
visible than before - preening for the paparazzi in his Thierry Mugler suits
outside the National Assembly as he rattles off the official line on the
never-ending Gatt negotiations or the socialists' latest diplomatic debacle.
The best illustration of his influence is the rise in the proportion of the
national budget allocated to the arts. It has increased from 0.46 per cent
10 years ago to 0.98 per cent, or FFr12.98bn (Pounds 1.3bn), this year. This
makes France the highest spender on the arts among leading EC countries. The
UK, for example, spends just 0.7 per cent. Mr Lang's critics, however, claim
that the increased proportion of the government budget going to the arts
would be better spent on schools and hospitals.
Mr Lang has achieved his funding increase with a policy that combines
elements of 1950s cultural dirigisme, such as government subsidy, with
modern market forces. He believes that governments should support artists,
film makers, musicians and writers so they do not have to depend entirely on
the private sector - that is, the giant Hollywood entertainment groups. 'I'm
not against all the Hollywood multinationals,' he says. 'But I am against
certain groups that impose uniformity. So much of their work is bad. It's
bland, it's vulgar, it's boring.'
The state's role, he argues, is not to intervene directly in the arts as
governments tried to do in the 1950s. Instead, he says, it should create a
climate in which artists can work. 'Our role is to provide the best possible
environment for artists to work in. We should help to alleviate the
pressures on them and then leave them to choose their own direction.'
Although he favours government grants, Mr Lang differs from his predecessors
in that the multinationals - he recognises the role of the private sector.
He cites the US tradition of corporate sponsorship as an important
influence, as well as the Arts Council of 1950s Britain and the great
Mexican museums. 'The idea that the arts should have nothing to do with the
market is an anachronism. In fact it's worse.' His lips curl ready for a
really big insult: 'It's petit bourgeois.'
His strategy has succeeded in some sectors. The French film industry has
flourished. 'If we hadn't developed a national policy for the cinema, our
film industry would have died, crushed by Hollywood as it has been in other
countries.'
Architecture is another success. The monumental modern buildings conceived
by President Mitterrand and Mr Lang to commemorate the bicentenary of the
French Revolution in 1989, such as the glass pyramid in the Louvre museum
and the great arch at La Defense, are regarded as an international model for
public sector building policy. The UK's Labour party has included many of
the ideas in its arts manifesto.
However, some of Mr Lang's new schemes still stir up a fuss. The latest
furore is over the tres grande bibliotheque, with its glass storage towers.
The original design, say some critics, was ill-conceived: sunlight would
have streamed through the glass scorching France's academic treasures.
'Nonsense,' groans the minister. 'Why won't people listen to the experts?'
Nevertheless, he has been forced to modify the design, making the towers
slightly smaller and storing some books underground.
His critics also point to the opening of the Opera Bastille in Paris, which
was intended to herald a new era of populist opera with cheap seats. The new
opera house operates under the same trade union constraints as the old Opera
de Paris and has been dogged by high ticket prices and intermittent strikes.
The plight of French television, which comes under his communications
portfolio, is even worse. In the early 1980s the Socialists implemented a TV
deregulation drive intended to bring private capital into the old state
system to launch new channels. Instead French viewers are subjected to
apparently endless light entertainment 'spectacles' featuring ageing 'stars'
such as singer Johnny Hallyday. The system is dominated by one channel, TF1,
which has almost half the audience and more than half of all advertising
revenue. Other stations are struggling. The worst case of all is La Cinq,
which went off air on Friday after failing to attract enough viewers or
advertising.
Even Mr Lang appears daunted by the difficulties of French television. 'It
isn't perfect,' he admits. 'But what can we do?' It is a testimony to his
popularity that he has emerged unscathed from La Cinq's collapse.
The length of his tenure at the culture ministry, however, will be
determined not by his own policies, but by Mr Beregovoy's attempts to
salvage the Socialists' electoral chances before next year's general
elections.
Perhaps the biggest test of his achievement will be whether France's present
enthusiasm for the arts - the crowded art galleries, the lively debates on
architecture and the bulging corporate sponsorship budgets - can survive his
departure. 'Will it last?' he asks. 'I don't know. We'll have to wait and
see.'
