<TEXT>
<P>
It's almost all-star time again, so, based on sketchy information, speculation 
and, in some cases, outright opinion, the following constitute a few humble 
choices as to who should take the floor in Miami Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference: Forwards: Charles Barkley, Philadelphia; Larry Bird, 
Boston; Chuck Person, Indiana; Scottie Pippen, Chicago; Dennis Rodman, Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Rodman. Of course Dominique Wilkins averages more points than 
Rodman. So do Bill Cartwright, Fred Roberts and Jerry Reynolds. So what? Rodman 
changes the momentum of a game without taking a shot. We're already going to 
see the game's best offensive talent. Why not showcase its best defensive 
player? 
</P>
<P>
Told to lose weight and be a model citizen, Person has lost weight and been a 
model citizen for Indiana -- and still scored 20 a night. Pippen has been 
all-around outstanding for the Bulls, finally providing Chicago with someone to 
take the pressure off Michael Jordan. Well, a little. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Catledge (Orlando) has had a fine first half at 20.6 points and 8.7 
rebounds per game, but first-year expansion numbers always tend to be a little 
skewed. We don't want to be cynical, but Catledge was in a contract year before 
signing a six-year pact with the Magic last week. Centers: Pat Ewing, New York; 
Robert Parish, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Parish gets in for no other reason than he got robbed of an appearance last 
season, but his numbers (16.8 points per game, 10.5 rebounds per game, .589 
field-goal percentage) more than back up an invitation this year too. Ewing? 
MVP. Enough said. Moses Malone's numbers are solid as always, but the Hawks are 
treading water and his play is doing nothing to improve the team. 
</P>
<P>
Apologies to Rik Smits (Indiana), Rony Seikaly (Miami) and Sam Bowie (New 
Jersey), playing well, but just a cut below. Guards: Jordan, Chicago; Joe 
Dumars, Isiah Thomas, Detroit; Reggie Miller, Indiana; Jeff Malone, Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars has been the better guard in Detroit and Thomas makes it only because 
Mark Price (Cleveland) missed too many games with injuries early on. Miller has 
been the centerpiece of Indiana's emergence and may be the best three-point 
shooter in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Malone? The conference's third-best scoring guard (23.2 points a game) is 
having a career-best shooting year from the floor. He deserves it, finishing a 
few strides ahead of Ricky Pierce (Milwaukee). 
</P>
<P>
Western Conference: Forwards: Karl Malone, Utah; Terry Cummings, San Antonio; 
Buck Williams, Portland; James Worthy, Los Angeles; Chris Mullin, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Trail Blazers were the league's worst underachievers. With the 
same group of players, Williams's professionalism has rubbed off (as well as a 
few crunching picks and 9.7 rebounds) and the Trail Blazers are chasing the 
Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who would make David Robinson the sole reason for San Antonio's 
turnaround, please note Cummings's 21.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Warriors and Suns have come on of late, but Phoenix's rise seems more 
directly related to Kevin Johnson's return. By this slim margin (and logic), 
Mullin gets the nod over Tom Chambers (25.2 points per game). Centers: Akeem 
Olajuwon, Houston; Robinson, San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Head and shoulders above the competition, Olajuwon has kept a struggling 
Rockets team near the .500 mark. Robinson has launched himself onto the list of 
the top five centers in the game with half a year's work. Guards: Magic 
Johnson, Lakers; John Stockton, Utah; Clyde Drexler, Portland; Gary Grant, 
Clippers; Mitch Richmond, Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler has been brilliant for Portland, keeping quiet and letting his play 
speak for him. Grant is one of three players in the league in the top 10 in 
assists and steals; Richmond (22.2 points a game) came on after a slow start. 
The most competitive of spots. Ron Harper (Clippers) would have made it but for 
his knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lo and behold, the former Mr. Fragile, Sam Bowie, is on the verge of becoming a 
down-and-dirty tough guy inside for Bill Fitch and the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
"His low-post game a year from now will be tremendous," Fitch said. "Instead of 
spending an hour and a half each day during the summer working on his strength 
and trying to rehabilitate one of his legs, he can ... work on his low-post 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
Bowie said others always have been in the way to his being the go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at (Kentucky), Melvin (Turpin) played the low post, and I played 
the perimeter," he said. "I go out to Portland and (Kevin) Duckworth's progress 
comes around the way he did. ... Here I'm the (center) and I need to develop 
some low-post moves that come crunch time, regardless of how the defense plays, 
I'll be able to get the shot off." 
</P>
<P>
That's assuming Bowie doesn't break in two by year's end; he's missed the last 
two Nets games with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley, who was suspended Nov. 16 for violating his 
substance-abuse aftercare program, was reinstated by the ASAP Family Treatment 
Program Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to play Friday night against the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley missed 34 games and lost more than $240,000 for failure to adhere to 
his NBA-mandated program. ... 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird tells the Orlando Sentinel that he was asked to be one of the 
participants in the now-unlikely Magic Johnson-Michael Jordan one-on-one game, 
but said no because he thought there would be betting on the event.
