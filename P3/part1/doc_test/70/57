MIKE DOWNEY: THE SACRIFICE MIGHT BE A LOST ART IN BASEBALL, BUT IT'S A BIG HIT 
IN NBA

<TEXT>
<P>
I am thinking about taking a cut in pay, so my company can afford to go out and 
hire somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
I want to make this organization as good as it can possibly be, even if it 
means giving back part of my paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
I want to be like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
When their basketball teams did not have enough money, under the terms of the 
NBA's salary cap, to go out and purchase a couple of necessary new players, 
Magic and Michael donated portions of their salaries to make the acquisitions 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
That's right -- basketball players, giving rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, I'd hate to think my employers couldn't afford to buy another baseball 
reporter, or a crossword puzzle, or Erma Bombeck or Beetle Bailey just because 
some greedy pig in the sports department was getting too much money. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, a man with a heart of gold as well as a vault full of it, gave 
back something approximating $75,000 for the Lakers to meet the salary needs of 
Terry Teagle of the Golden State Warriors, who will be coming south this season 
to weave baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know what you are thinking. What's 75 grand to Magic? He'll get that 
back with one Diet Slice commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's the principle of the thing, not to mention the interest. Earvin 
Johnson dug into his own purse and fished out 75K for the sake of the Lakers. 
Teagle is now on the team, and Magic, as usual, gets the assist. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing happened with Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Back on draft day, the 
Bulls were interested in acquiring Dennis Hopson. The salary cap, however, 
stood in their way, partly because Jordan costs more than a tanker of crude 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Since the only way Chicago is ever going to win an NBA championship is for 
Jordan to get some more help, Michael saved the day. He deferred some of his 
income so that Hopson could be paid what he supposedly is worth. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much Jordan already has in the bank, this was a significant 
gesture on his part. By NBA standards, Michael happens to be underpaid. When 
you take a minute to consider what Hot Rod Williams and Jon Koncak make, it's 
amazing that the Bulls don't have to pay off Michael Jordan in uranium. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, he gave money back. 
</P>
<P>
I respect this. That's why I am willing to do my share, to give till it hurts. 
That's why I am planning to give back $10 from my salary every two weeks for 
the next six months so that, by God, this newspaper can go out and pay what it 
takes to hire somebody else who is worth every bit as much as me. 
</P>
<P>
After all, we are all in this together, and because of people like me, 
wonderful people like me, caring people like me, the world can be a better 
place for all of us, the united way. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sorry. Somehow I slipped into a Georgia Frontiere commercial there. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I wonder what would happen if baseball tried a salary cap. Every time 
somebody in that sport signs a contract for $3.5 million a year, making him the 
highest-paid player in the game, somebody the next day signs for $3.6 million, 
whereupon the first guy says he was cheated and wants his contract renegotiated 
to $3.61 million. 
</P>
<P>
I had a dream the other day where Rickey Henderson, rounding third and headed 
for home, refused to run the final 45 feet unless the Athletics did something 
about his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"OK! OK! You get the damned Ferrari! Now slide! Slide!" 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could use a couple of hitters, but you can't expect Mark Langston to 
spring for them. The White Sox could have used Willie McGee and Harold Baines, 
but it wasn't Carlton Fisk's job to free up the necessary dough. 
</P>
<P>
If Magic Johnson had been playing for the Dodgers, they would have won the 
division. By September, he would have given back enough of his salary that they 
would have gone out and gotten the players they needed most -- like, oh, you 
know, Franklin Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers needed a shooter. Magic, being Magic, made one appear. He made sure 
the Lakers were able to get Eagle-Eye Teagle. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls need a center. Michael, being Michael, probably will offer Akeem 
Olajuwon every penny of his salary and play for free, just to win a 
championship. Michael would scrub Chicago Stadium with his tongue to win a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
This NBA salary cap is unconstitutional, if you ask me, but darn it anyway, I 
like it. I wish this newspaper had a salary cap. There's one guy around here 
who makes way too much. 
</P>
<P>
All summer, I've been thinking that this is finally the season the Lakers slip 
to third or fourth place. But I did something I almost never do. I 
underestimated Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Now I estimate that by November, Magic will be playing for about $7.98 a game, 
but the Lakers will have All-Stars at the other four positions. Poor Earvin. 
He'll have holes in his socks, but at least he'll have another ring on his 
finger.
