The Atlanta Hawks have had their troubles trying to blend some new talent into 
a championship team. It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kevin Willis was injured in training camp and hasn't played a minute. 
</P>
<P>
While newcomers Moses Malone and Reggie Theus have had some problems adjusting 
to Dominique Wilkins, it was easy to replace Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Levingston, who spent his first 6 National Basketball Assn. seasons 
coming off the bench, has blended in as the substitute for the 7-foot power 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Right from the start, Levingston has had the Hawks' best shooting percentage 
and has been a strong rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston was 10 for 12 from the field Tuesday night at Atlanta as the Hawks 
put an end to Milwaukee's 6-game winning streak with a 111-98 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston helped the Hawks build a 19-point lead in the third quarter. He was 
on the bench when Ricky Pierce came off the bench to lead a rally by the Bucks 
that cut the lead to 4 points with more than 2 1/2 minutes left. Pierce had 14 
of his 22 points in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was Glenn Rivers, starting in place of injured Jeff Malone, who killed the 
Bucks' rally. With 2:13 left and the shot clock running down, Rivers sank a 
3-point basket to increase the lead to 99-92. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big shot," Rivers said after taking the pass from Wilkins. I saw it 
coming. When I got the pass, I knew I had to shoot it. I also knew that if it 
went in, it was all over. I like pressure situations." 
</P>
<P>
The win was only the Hawks' third in their last 8 games. It was the Bucks' 
second loss in 12 games, both to the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston scored 8 of his 23 points in the second quarter when the Hawks 
outscored the Bucks, 32-16, to build what appeared to be a comfortable lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really helped me to know that I will play at least 30 minutes," 
Levingston said. "It's a good feeling to know you can make a mistake or two and 
not come out. We need Kevin, but it has been a big break for me." 
</P>
<P>
For one of the few times in his career, Moses Malone was not in the starting 
lineup. No, Malone was not ill or ailing. No, the 6-11 center wasn't being 
disciplined. Just before the opening tipoff, there was a call from nature and 
Moses answered it. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Koncak drew a rare last-minute start at center. Malone played 35 minutes, 
had 17 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 103, Indiana 96 -- The Bulls have had to depend on Michael Jordan, 
nearly exclusively, almost every time they have been in tough games. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was refreshing for Jordan, as well as his teammates, when the star guard 
turned playmaker and ball stealer in this victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored only 22 points but had 13 assists. John Paxson led the Bulls in 
scoring with 24 points. Jordan scored half his points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun just contributing," Jordan said after getting 6 rebounds 
and 4 steals. "I don't think I just stood around, but it was my job to get a 
couple of the other guys active. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to give the Pacers credit for the way they held me off for 3 quarters. 
I kind of paced myself tonight, because I did not get a rest until the last 3 
minutes of the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers' comeback effort had a blow when Chuck Person was hit with his 
second technical foul with 6:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Person, who scored 29 points, was given a technical in the opening minutes, so 
when he became involved in a shoving match with Chicago's Scottie Pippen, the 
second technical resulted in an automatic ejection. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Coach Dick Versace was upset with referee Ed Rush for making the second 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little double push," he said. "It happens all the time. If it had 
been Michael Jordan and he had a technical already, it wouldn't have been 
called." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 123, Houston 109 -- Harold Pressley scored 7 of his game-high 24 
points in the last 5 minutes at Sacramento to keep the Kings in command. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, in a surprisingly easy victory, led several times by 23 points in 
the victory over the Midwest Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 111, Portland 110 -- John Stockton sank 4 free throws in the last 14 
seconds at Portland to wrap up a brilliant performance. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton had 20 points, 11 in the last quarter, and 18 assists as the Jazz 
handed the Trail Blazers just their second home loss in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton's free throws came after Jerome Kersey of the Blazers missed a layup 
with 22 seconds left and Utah leading, 107-106. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler, averaging 27.9 points per game for Portland, was held to 19. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 117, San Antonio 112 -- Mike McGee came off the bench to score 24 
points at East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nets handed the Spurs their sixth 
defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets built a 19-point lead in the first half, but the Spurs wiped it out 
and took a 2-point lead with 4:11 to go. Lester Conner scored twice and Joe 
Barry Carroll once to restore the Nets' control. DAN HAFNER
