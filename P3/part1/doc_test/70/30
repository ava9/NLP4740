Even a threatened shakeup could not snap the New York Knicks out of their worst 
slump of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, not so long ago considered a threat to the Detroit Pistons' crown, 
were beaten by Orlando, 121-118, Tuesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Before losing their fourth in a row, the Knicks built a 12-point lead in the 
third quarter. The Magic ended a nine-game losing streak and an 11-game road 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
This loss and the previous two by a team that was playing so well early in the 
season that they won 22 of their first 24 at home, are hard to explain. Last 
Thursday, they were humiliated by the other expansion team, Minnesota, 102-82. 
Saturday night, Milwaukee, missing three of its best players, won handily at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic had several stars, not the least of whom was Scott Skiles. Skiles had 
his first triple-double: 23 points, 12 rebounds and 17 assists. Michael Ansley 
had all 16 of his points in the fourth quarter when the Magic came from seven 
points behind. Nick Anderson scored 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Patrick Ewing led the Knicks. Coming back from a first-quarter ankle 
injury, the center had 17 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks trail Philadelphia by a game in the Atlantic Division they have led 
almost all season. They are only a game ahead of third-place Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"These are games we're supposed to win and build some momentum for the 
playoffs," said Ewing, who had only four points in the first half. "But I'm 
very disappointed in the way things are going." 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, General Manager Al Bianchi gave first-year Coach Stu Jackson a 
vote of confidence. Unless the Knicks straighten out soon, it may be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Skiles was given his chance because guards Reggie Theus and Sam Vincent are 
hurt. Skiles played the entire 48 minutes and didn't have a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 120, Houston 110 -- Clyde Drexler is doing his part in the Trail 
Blazers' drive to overtake the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
He scored eight of his 41 points in the last three minutes at Houston and had 
16 rebounds to lead the Blazers to their 10th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, in danger of missing the playoffs despite the presence of one of 
the NBA's great players, Akeem Olajuwon, built a 14-point lead in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 128, Seattle 106 -- There are seven teams in the NBA with winning 
records on the road, five of them in the West. 
</P>
<P>
With successive wins at Phoenix and Seattle, the Spurs, bouncing back after a 
mild slump, are one of them at 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson scored 20 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs 
romped and pulled to within 2 1/2 games of Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 117, Milwaukee 96 -- It just keeps getting easier for the NBA champion 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
With James Edwards getting 21 points in 29 minutes, the Pistons took command 
early in the second quarter against the crippled Bucks and were never in danger 
at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have won 12 in a row and 25 of their last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks, playing without their two big men, Jack Sikma and Greg Anderson, 
jumped in front, 29-21, in the first half, but were out of it by halftime, 
trailing, 57-41. They were only five for 23 in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 122, Washington 97 -- Michael Jordan, playing one of his infrequent 
poor games, sent out a call for help in the third quarter at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen and rookie Stacy King answered the call and the Bulls broke open 
a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen made two free throws to break a 75-75 tie late in the third period and 
King ignited a 12-4 run with a resounding dunk to start the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 21 points on eight-of-19 shooting. Pippen and King each had 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 112, Miami 98 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 20 of his career-high 29 points 
in the first half at Miami as the Pacers snapped a five-game losing streak with 
an easy win. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 105, Minnesota 101 -- Mitch Richmond had 18 of his 24 points in 
the second half at Oakland and the Warriors ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were without Chris Mullin, who has a virus. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell scored 34 for Minnesota. DAN HAFNER
