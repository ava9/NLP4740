SECOND WIND IN CHICAGO?;

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls are as exhausted as Sparky Anderson. They are plumb tuckered 
out. They have labored through 16 playoff games to the Detroit Pistons' 13, and 
poor Michael Jordan's tongue is just about touching the stadium floor, because 
he does not have the same reinforcements the Piston starters do. (Who does?) 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is working 43.4 minutes a game in the Eastern Conference finals, Scottie 
Pippen 39.8 on a bad foot. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody from the Pistons is averaging 40 minutes, and only one guy, Isiah 
Thomas, is playing more than 35. Even Thomas got to sit back like Tom Sawyer 
and let somebody else -- Vinnie Johnson -- handle his chores during the last 11 
minutes of Detroit's 94-85 success in Game 5 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's players are pampered. They even get to make trips on their own team 
airplane, Roundball One. They take their time, ride in style, leave when they 
want. There are no such friendly skies for Air Jordan. He's lucky Detroit and 
Chicago are only an hour apart. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, the Bulls are weary, punchy, too pooped to pop. They got off only 59 shots 
in Game 5, an all-time National Basketball Assn. playoff low. The Pistons are 
eager, energetic matadors, poised with their swords. They can do away with the 
Bulls tonight, clinching a rematch with the Lakers, when Game 6 tips off at 
Chicago Stadium at 6 p.m., Pacific time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fresh as daisies," Detroit forward John Salley said. "Fresher." 
</P>
<P>
Not a soul on the Pistons' starting front line is averaging even 30 minutes a 
night. Rick Mahorn, in fact, is averaging 17. At this rate, Chuck Daly's 
regulars are going to be as well-rested for the NBA Finals as Pat Riley's. The 
Pistons don't need a bench. They need a hammock. Some of them sit around on the 
sidelines shooting the breeze like those guys in the TV commercials for Dockers 
pants. Mahorn, a starter, talks more than plays. 
</P>
<P>
In the Windy City, meanwhile, what the Bulls are counting on, for tonight at 
least, is a familiar environment and a rush of old-fashioned second wind. That 
might get them through the night. 
</P>
<P>
Another loud, rowdy, capacity crowd will occupy Chicago Stadium -- some creep 
threw a rum bottle onto the court during Game 4, and Detroit's traveling fans 
have been describing other horrifying treatment by Chicago's customers -- and 
although Coach Doug Collins does not advocate disorder, he is looking for a 
certain kind of lift. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is for our home crowd to electrocute us," Collins malapropped. 
</P>
<P>
Electrify, Doug. Electrify. 
</P>
<P>
His cattle are tired, and need prodding. Those down-to-the-last-minute 
struggles against Cleveland and New York were exhilarating, but what the Bulls 
could really use is a blowout, because they sure aren't going to get a rainout. 
With an easy win, they could rest Jordan a little; maybe Pippen, too. Only, who 
blows out Detroit? The Pistons have kept opponents under100 points in 14 
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
None of the five series games played so far has been settled until the final 
minutes. Chicago's 24-point edge in Game 1 quickly disintegrated. It might even 
have helped the Bulls had the Pistons beaten their brains out Wednesday, but 
even on Jordan's 18-point night, the Bulls led at halftime and remained within 
five points with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave Michael a two-minute breather early in the game, and was going to give 
him another rest toward the end of the third quarter," Collins said. "But 
that's when he made his only little spurt of the night. You can't take out 
Michael Jordan just when he starts to heat up." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 10 of Chicago's last 12 points in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth period, he scored one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not tired. I am not tired. Read my lips," Jordan swore, smiling wanly. "I 
may look tired, but I promise you, I am not. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't stop shooting because I couldn't raise my arms. I stopped shooting 
because I couldn't get a clean shot off with three Detroit guys in my face." 
</P>
<P>
In a league that prohibits anything but man-to-man combat and punishes teams 
with technical fouls for using "illegal" defenses, Jordan finds himself drawing 
Pistons the way a porch light draws moths. About the only break he has had is 
that Joe Dumars, not Dennis Rodman, guards him most of the time. Rodman is two 
inches taller than Jordan and just as fast, if not faster. He is giving Jordan 
fits, as well as killing Chicago on the boards, in his nightly 25-minute 
stints. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call me Dennis the Rebounding Menace," said Rodman, whose confidence 
and ego are growing daily. 
</P>
<P>
Electing not to break up an act that has won 73 of 94 games, Daly continues to 
start a front line of Bill Laimbeer, Mark Aguirre and Rick Mahorn, and finish 
with a front line of James Edwards, Salley and Rodman. Even if Rodman started, 
he wouldn't guard Jordan, because Dumars doesn't match up with the taller 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnie Johnson, no taller but more muscular than Dumars, can handle that 
assignment when he enters the game at guard. That frees Rodman to tag after 
Jordan like a dog on a mailman. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodman, he's something," said Aguirre, who was so impressed with his teammate 
during Game 4 at Chicago that he told Daly to go with Rodman at the start of 
the second half rather than with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I've ever seen a guy who goes after his man so -- what? -- so 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Relentlessly? 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good word for it," Aguirre said. "Rodman never lets up, never lets 
you out of his sight. He stays with you like he's handcuffed to you." 
</P>
<P>
Also, with his reputation as a defensive expert expanding, Rodman no longer is 
a mere substitute who cannot convince referees of his abilities. Like a 
league-leading hitter who gets the outside corner, Rodman often gets the 
benefit of charging calls when he goes recoiling after being struck by an 
opponent's elbow. Funny how those elbows can knock a healthy, 6-foot 8-inch man 
five feet backward or even off his feet, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls are too tired to argue. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're dragging," Collins said. "No matter what great shape these guys 
are in, they've been going at it through preseason camp, exhibition games, 82 
regular-schedule games and 16 grueling playoff games, with practices in 
between. Not one of them is complaining about it. It's just a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you this, though: If we get a chance to go play the Lakers, we're 
not going to call them up and say, 'Hey, guys, we're too tired to come play. 
Let's do it in July.' We'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
First things first. 
</P>

Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Piston assistant coach Brendan Malone, a native New Yorker, is a candidate for 
the Knicks' job vacated by Rick Pitino. "It would be the stuff that dreams are 
made of," Malone said. "It'd be the perfect script for a B movie." . . . Three 
of Chuck Daly's former assistants hold head coaching jobs: Dick Harter at 
Charlotte, Ron Rothstein at Miami and Dick Versace at Indiana. . . . When a 
reporter pressed Doug Collins to be critical of Michael Jordan for taking only 
eight shots in Game 5, the Chicago coach broke up laughing and said: "You 
expect me to do that? This guy must think I just fell off the back of a turnip 
truck."
