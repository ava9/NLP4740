The Denver Nuggets unveiled their new rapid-fire offense and the result was an 
NBA record for points by two teams in a regulation game Friday night at Denver, 
although the Golden State Warriors won, 162-158, behind Tim Hardaway's 32 
points and 18 assists.

The 320 points broke the mark of 318 set when Denver beat San Antonio, 163-155, 
on Jan. 11, 1984.

points and Walter Davis 33 for the Nuggets. Golden State's Chris Mullin led all

With Golden State leading, 87-83, the teams' total of 170 points also was an

and San Francisco on March 10, 1963.
