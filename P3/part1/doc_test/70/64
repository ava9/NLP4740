Michael Jordan made sure it didn't come down to one shot this time. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 42 points, 15 in the first 10 minutes, and the Chicago Bulls led 
from start to finish in a 117-109 victory over the New York Knicks Sunday at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to control the tempo of the game," Jordan said. "We came out 
enthused and we put them on their heels. We didn't want it to come down to one 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was referring to last Monday's 109-106 loss in New York, when Trent 
Tucker hit a game-winning three-pointer after taking an inbounds pass with 
one-tenth of a second left. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have protested the game, claiming it is impossible to get off a shot 
in such a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well in New York, but we still felt that the game was a draw 
because of human error," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago scored the first nine points of the game this time and Jordan sank all 
18 of his free throws in the second half to hold off the Knicks as Chicago won 
its 15th straight game at home. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Patrick Ewing was held to 16 points, 12 below his average, and sat 
out much of the third quarter with four fouls. It was only the sixth time in 39 
games this season that Ewing was held under 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 120, Boston 115 -- Chris Mullin scored 20 of his 30 points in the 
second half and the Warriors beat the Celtics to snap a 12-year losing streak 
at Boston Garden and give Coach Don Nelson his 600th NBA victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who helped the Celtics to five NBA championships as a player, became 
the 10th coach in NBA history to win 600 games. He has a 600-404 record in 13 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
scored 25.

<P>
Milwaukee 127, Miami 101 -- Ricky Pierce scored 11 his 22 points in the second 
quarter and the Bucks won their fourth straight game by downing the Heat at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Robertson added 19 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists for the Bucks, and 
Jay Humphries also scored 19. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 115, Charlotte 100 -- Jerome Kersey scored 26 points and Kevin 
Duckworth added 23 as the Trail Blazers turned back the Hornets at Portland.
