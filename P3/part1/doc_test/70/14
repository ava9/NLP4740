Michael Jordan saved the Chicago Bulls even after a mistake nearly cost them 
the game and a chance to win their playoff series against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jordan is the best player to ever put on a uniform," New York Coach 
Rick Pitino said Friday night after Jordan scored 40 points, including eight 
straight free throws in the final 1:18 -- two with four seconds left -- to give 
the Bulls a 113-111 victory and send them into the NBA's Eastern Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
The game-winning free throws came after Knick Trent Tucker's four-point play 
with six seconds left had tied the score, 111-111. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls also got 16 points and eight rebounds from Bill Cartwright and 19 
points from Scottie Pippen before he was ejected for a third-quarter fight with 
New York's Kenny Walker. Chicago won the series, 4-2, and will open play Sunday 
against the Detroit Pistons, who are 7-0 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the help, it was still the man nicknamed "Air" who stood head and 
shoulders above everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
"He did the same thing against Cleveland at the end when they got him the 
ball," Pitino said. "We played him as well as we could. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to pressure the ball and force them to go to someone else. It 
just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
In the closing seconds, Tucker hit an off-balance three-point basket with 
Chicago's Craig Hodges draped all over him and converted a four-point play by 
sinking the ensuing free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago called time out, and Jordan, who gave the Knicks fits throughout the 
series by eluding their vaunted defensive traps, cut to the sideline for the 
inbounds pass, then slanted to the middle and was fouled while shooting a 
15-footer. The foul was Gerald Wilkins' sixth, and Jordan calmly sank both free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Newman's wide-open, three-point attempt for New York clanged off the 
iron as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I had great concentration throughout the game and good rhythm on my free 
throws," said Jordan, who had remained in the locker room until game time, 
receiving treatment for a pulled groin muscle that has bothered him the past 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the confidence that I was lacking (during the first playoff round) in 
Cleveland and I was trying to get fouled rather than hit the shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
New York got 22 points each from Mark Jackson, Wilkins and Patrick Ewing, who 
added a game-high 13 rebounds but was outplayed through most of the series by 
Cartwright, the man he replaced in the Knicks' pivot. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has been maligned all year because he is not a pretty player, but he's 
shown what he is made of," Bull Coach Doug Collins said. "Now he has the 
satisfaction of knocking out his former team." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls opened the final period with an 86-79 lead and matched that 
seven-point spread only once more -- with 3:33 left, after Horace Grant slammed 
a pass from Cartwright and added a free throw for a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
New York gained its first tie of the second half at 103-103 two minutes later 
on a layup by Ewing. But Jordan responded with four free throws sandwiched 
around John Paxson's jumper, then added two more free throws with nine seconds 
left for a 111-107 lead that Tucker soon erased. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls had begun the third period trailing, 61-59, but Craig Hodges sank a 
three-point jumper to give Chicago its first lead since the end of the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He followed that with another long jumper, and then Jordan strung together two 
baskets and finished off an 11-3 Chicago run with a beautiful feed to Pippen 
for a layup that gave the Bulls a 70-64 advantage with 8:48 left in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes later, Pippen stole a New York pass and fed Hodges for a 
breakaway layup to give the Bulls an 86-76 lead, their largest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 seconds left in the period and the Bulls' lead at 86-79, Walker used 
his forearm to move Pippen off the baseline, and Pippen threw a left-handed 
punch in response. He missed, and both men squared off, only to be restrained 
before any damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks got the opening basket of the game but didn't lead again until 
Jackson's three-point play in the closing seconds of the first period ignited a 
10-0 run that carried New York from a 32-28 deficit to a 38-32 lead two minutes 
into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan hit his first four shots of the contest and finished the opening period 
with 10 points. But he didn't break into the scoring column in the second 
period until 8:44 remained, and Jackson's three-pointer with 7:05 left before 
halftime gave New York the biggest lead of the game to that point at 48-41. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later, Paxson broke up a Knick fast break by grabbing Sidney 
Green, touching off a shoving match between Green and Chicago's Brad Sellers, 
who got a technical for his role in the skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
But Kiki Vandeweghe missed the technical, and Green made just one of his two 
free throws for a 49-41 lead with 6:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright scored the Bulls' next five points with two short jumpers and a free 
throw, and Jordan hit a three-pointer and a 20-footer from the wing to help 
Chicago close within two points at halftime.
