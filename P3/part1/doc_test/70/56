MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY AT GARDEN

<P>
With one-tenth of a second to play at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 15, the New 
York Knicks' Trent Tucker took an inbounds pass and made a three-point shot 
that beat the Chicago Bulls, 109-106. The Bulls protested the game, claiming 
the clock was started late. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Bulls' protest be upheld? Said Rod Thorn, NBA vice president of 
operations: "I recognize it's impossible to catch a ball with two hands and 
shoot it in one-tenth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody had thrown a lob pass toward the basket and a player had tipped it 
in, that's a horse of a different color. But in this case, the referee should 
have taken the bull by the horns and waved off the basket." It is assumed no 
pun was intended. 
</P>
<P>
Add Bulls: Michael Turner, a University of Chicago astrophysicist, said of the 
controversy: "A lot of things can happen in one-tenth of a second. A star 
explodes every tenth of a second in the universe, and light travels at 186,000 
miles per second and can circumnavigate the globe. The only thing I can't think 
of is a three-point shot with that much time on the clock, unless, of course, 
you're playing in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Bulls: The Bulls' Michael Jordan blames the Detroit Pistons' Isiah 
Thomas, president of the NBA players' union, for vetoing the proposed 
$1-million one-on-one showdown between Jordan and the Lakers' Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jordan: "I wonder what Isiah's position would be if he were playing Magic. 
But, of course, if he were playing Magic, no one would want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 30, 1971, who scored 28 points to lead UCLA to a 74-61 
victory over UC Santa Barbara, starting the Bruins' record 88-game winning 
streak? 
</P>
<P>
Designing woman: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner attended a news conference 
in Indianapolis last week to introduce the uniforms she designed for the 
Indiana Pacers. The uniforms are navy blue, yellow and white. Griffith Joyner 
favored a Laker look -- a purple dress and gold shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins update: Texas El Paso basketball Coach Don (the Bear) Haskins says he 
probably will not return to the bench this season because of a severe case of 
laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins said his voice has improved recently, but he is fearful of returning 
courtside because he tends to yell during games. Assistant Coach Norm 
Ellenberger has guided the Miners in Haskins' absence. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins said he watched the Miners lose a road game on television recently. Did 
he get excited? 
</P>
<P>
"I even screamed at the TV set," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oski update: Oski, the University of California mascot who was suspended by the 
school after he tossed a two-layer cream cake onto the laps of visiting Oregon 
State fans on Jan. 7, has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Rittler Andrews, spirit coordinator at Cal, said Oski "apologized and 
knew he was wrong. He was very upset with the whole situation. (He) wasn't 
using common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Grass is greener: How popular is soccer outside the United States? A West 
German merchandising company recently reached an agreement with Italia '90 
organizers to sell the turf from Rome's Olympic Stadium after the World Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Curtis Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: The Kings' Luc Robitaille, on the possibility of playing with the 
Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux: "A fire hydrant could score 40 goals 
playing on Lemieux's line. He is amazing the way he moves the puck. I'd be 
all-world on his line." GARR KLUENDER
