</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jordan scored 44 points, including four free throws in the final 
seconds, as the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 101-94, 
Wednesday night at Chicago to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-5 Eastern 
Conference playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls could advance to the next round, against New York, with a victory at 
Chicago Stadium Friday night. If the Cavaliers win, the final game wil be 
played at Richfield, Ohio, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we can't take them for granted Friday night," Jordan said. "But 
we're in our atmosphere, so we can control our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
John Williams, scoring 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, kept the 
Cavaliers in contention. Cleveland pulled within 91-88 with 2:43 to play, but 
Jordan converted a three-point play. With 1:04 left, he stole the ball and went 
in for a slam dunk, making the score 96-88. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said that although he had been driving to the basket repeatedly without 
drawing fouls, he planned his final three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to initiate the contact and then I jumped and made the shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland narrowed the score to 97-94, but Jordan's four free throws in the 
last 21 seconds sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries hurt Cleveland. Mark Price has injured hamstrings and was held to two 
points and four assists. Craig Ehlo suffered a sprained ankle in practice and 
did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 126, Seattle 107 -- Sleepy Floyd scored 28 points, including 22 in the 
first half, as the Rockets avoided being swept by beating the SuperSonics at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle has a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five first-round series, with the fourth 
game scheduled Friday night at Houston. A fifth game, if necessary, would be 
played in Seattle Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who had six assists and set a club playoff record with three straight 
three-point baskets, got the Rockets off to a fast start with 10 first-quarter 
points. He scored 12 points in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who shot poorly in the first two games of the series, made eight of 11 
shots, including all three of his three-point attempts. Akeem Olajuwon had 19 
points and 18 rebounds for Houston, and Otis Thorpe added 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleepy was the key," Rocket Coach Don Chaney said. "Akeem always has his game, 
but Sleepy got us running on all cylinders." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis, playing despite a broken nose that resulted in him wearing a 
protective brace, led Seattle with 26 points, and Sedale Threatt added 17. 
</P>
<P>
There were five technical fouls, four against the Sonics. Olajuwon was called 
for a technical with 4:03 to go in the second quarter after throwing a ball at 
Seattle forward Michael Cage. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon and Cage were fined for fighting in a regular-season game in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Alton Lister, Ellis, Xavier McDaniel and Cage were assessed technical fouls for 
the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said the Sonics were intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"They spent the night kicking our tails and we spent the night bitching at 
officials," Bickerstaff said.
