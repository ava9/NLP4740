</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was a day when basketball fans from both the winning and losing sides must 
have felt like chanting: "Can't Beat L.A.! Can't Beat L.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons were held to 86 points, made a miserable 36% of their 
shots, messed up 15 free throws, got just three field goals from their starting 
front line -- and still defeated the Chicago Bulls, 86-80, Monday afternoon at 
Chicago Stadium, to tie the National Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference 
finals at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Best thing Detroit had going for it was its bench, which outscored Chicago's, 
36-2. Dennis Rodman was particularly mean and hungry, ripping down 18 rebounds 
and taking turns hounding Michael Jordan, who, during the last three periods, 
managed only two baskets. Jordan scored 23 points, half of what he got in 
Saturday's Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
With the Lakers obliged to wait until June 6 to begin rumbling with one of 
these teams for the NBA championship, it might be wise for them not to study 
these latest game films. 
</P>
<P>
It was an ugly but not totally uninteresting little game, made uglier by a 
pint-sized rum bottle, flung from the stands, that smashed onto the court early 
in the fourth quarter, scaring the wits out of several players. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's 90th consecutive sellout crowd of 18,676 came hoping for more of 
Michael Python's Flying Circus, but instead saw Jordan and the Bulls yield 
their home-court advantage. Game 5 will be played Wednesday night at Auburn 
Hills, Mich., where the Pistons have won 26 of their last 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly out of desperation, due in great part to Detroit's slam-dance defense, 
the Bulls fired up a club-record 20 three-point shots, missing 14 of them. They 
made only 27 baskets from any distance, a new low for the franchise in 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Pistons, they didn't make any more baskets than the Bulls did. 
That's how feeble both of these offenses were. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's domination was on the boards, 56-40, and at the free-throw line, 
where it had 19 more chances than Chicago did. For most of the second half, 
Coach Chuck Daly completely abandoned his starting center and forwards, playing 
James Edwards, John Salley and Rodman -- "Buddha," "the Spider" and "the Worm," 
as known to their friends -- instead. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer scored two points, giving him six in the last two games. Mark 
Aguirre spent only 15 minutes on the court, donating six points. Rick Mahorn 
played a minute less, pointlessly. Detroit's Front Line II was far more 
productive, and Daly intends to use this unit more and more. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer injured his left hand slightly, another reason he played only nine 
minutes of the second half. The Pistons hardly missed him, though, what with 
Edwards scoring 13 points, and Laimbeer returned for the game's final 82 
seconds, in time to block a Horace Grant shot and snuff Chicago's last hope. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas also was a factor for Detroit, as he has been -- one way or 
another -- throughout this series. Thomas had 27 points Monday to top all 
scorers. In Detroit's two victories, he has scored 60 points. In the two 
losses, he scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the easy way out, to make that the reason we win or lose," Thomas said. 
"The key to our winning is our defense, not my scoring. Our team goes beyond my 
leading them every night." 
</P>
<P>
Any team that can afford not to start Rodman is no one-man team. Eight of 
Rodman's 18 rebounds were on offense, and Chicago only had nine offensive 
boards as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodman was everywhere," Chicago guard John Paxson said. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit needed him to be. At halftime, Thomas and guard partner Joe Dumars had 
all but two of Detroit's baskets. Nobody on the starting front line had a hoop. 
The Pistons made only a dozen field goals in 24 minutes, and the only reason 
they broke the 40-point barrier was that Thomas hit a three-pointer at the 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
It was a truly gruesome half of basketball. The Bulls made one-of-17 shots over 
one span, succeeding only on a Scottie Pippen breakaway dunk. The Pistons 
answered with an equally pitiful two-of-19 stretch, from the middle of the 
first period to midway through the second. After 18 minutes, Detroit had 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago led early by as many as seven points, but the last edge it held in the 
game was at 56-55, late in the third period. It was then that Edwards got hot, 
twice sinking turnaround jumpers in the lane, with Salley adding a dunk and 
Thomas two long jumpers. After three periods, the Pistons led, 64-60. 
</P>
<P>
With 9 1/2 minutes to play, Pippen faked two Pistons out of their shoes, but 
not Rodman, who planted himself and took a charge, nullifying Pippen's dunk. A 
presumably angry spectator hurled an empty pint of rum that landed near 
Detroit's free-throw line, no less than 15 or 20 feet from the nearest player. 
No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I saw some white thing flying toward us," Rodman said. "Then 
it smashed. I said, 'Omigod, I hope that's not a bottle.' And sure enough, it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"People are scary, man." 
</P>
<P>
Four more points by Edwards quickly put Detroit up by eight, and after a 
three-pointer by Chicago's Craig Hodges, the Pistons got a corner shot by 
Vinnie Johnson and a layup by Rodman for their largest lead to that time, 
76-67. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls never threatened thereafter. Jordan did get a dunk -- only his second 
in three games -- but Laimbeer's rejection of Grant with 32 seconds remaining 
cost Chicago a chance to cut Detroit's advantage to four, and the Pistons had 
the game they needed so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we're alive," Daly said. "That's all we are is alive. We 
know the Bulls believe they can win another one in our building. But at least 
we've got our heads above water again." 
</P>
<P>
Rodman, too, was properly respectful. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize that Chicago is a great team," Rodman said. "If you 
forget that, they'll be all over you. Especially with Jordan. You've got to use 
two or three guys on him, just to keep him under control. Any time you hold 
Michael Jordan somewhere around 20 points, you're doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the NBA's top defensive player, Rodman does not draw Jordan on defense 
more of the time partly because he is not in Detroit's starting lineup and 
partly because guard Joe Dumars, who does guard Jordan, does not match up with 
Bull forward Scottie Pippen. The Pistons threw Rodman, Dumars and even Vinnie 
Johnson at Jordan in Monday's game, keeping fresh legs on him whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"My own shots weren't falling, so I tried to spread it around to the other 
guys," Jordan said. "But, as a team, we couldn't hit baskets when we needed 
them. And we didn't get second shots. They were faster and more aggressive over 
every loose ball than we were." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bull Coach Doug Collins: "They make Michael work every time down the 
floor. But it's their second team that really beat us. Rodman, Salley and 
Edwards and those guys. We just ran out of juice." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
Even if this series ends by Friday in six games, the NBA championship series 
will not begin until June 6 at 6 p.m. (PDT). The Lakers either will visit 
Detroit or play host to Chicago in Games 1 and 2. . . . Bill Laimbeer's hand 
injury is not serious, and he should be able to start Wednesday.
