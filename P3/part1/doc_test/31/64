  [Text] San Jose, 2 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the local media 
reported that Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo 
categorically rejected an eventual resumption of diplomatic 
relations between Costa Rica and Cuba, although he stressed his 
country "will voice the concerns" of the island within the OAS. 
  "Neither the president of the Republic, the foreign 
minister, 
nor the country has considered resuming diplomatic relations 
with the government of Fidel Castro," Naranjo told the Costa 
Rican newspaper LA NACION, while clarifying his government's 
position on Cuba. 
  The Costa Rican Government has referred to the need to 
reconsider the "Cuban case" within the OAS, from which Cuba was 
suspended more than 30 years ago after the installation of a 
military regime in Cuba. 
  According to the foreign minister, the government will push 
for an in-depth analysis of the Cuban crisis by the nations of 
the hemisphere, because "Cuba is currently facing an oppressive 
political and economic situation." 
  "We are not going to become spokesmen for the regime of 
Fidel 
Castro, because we cannot agree with a government that does not 
respect human rights," Naranjo reiterated to the domestic media. 
He also stressed that the OAS "will have to heed the voice of 
the Cuban people." 
  Naranjo is trying to thwart criticism from the opposition, 
which has claimed that the government's position is the result 
of "improvisation" because no changes have taken place in Cuba 
to justify a shift in Costa Rica's policy toward the island. 
  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who assumed power 
on 8 May, has stated that changes in the international situation 
demand a revision of Costa Rica's policy toward Cuba to "advance 
the principles of human rights and democracy."
