  [Text] San Jose, 16 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Two boats detained by 
the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], in Costa Rican territorial 
waters on Saturday, arrived today, Monday, at Barra del Colorado 
on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast. Meanwhile, the tourists 
returned last night on a commercial flight from Managua. 
  The capture of the yachts was downplayed by Costa Rican 
President Jose Figueres, who said it was "an unfortunate 
incident" that is a "residue of the more tense relations" Costa 
Rica and Nicaragua have experienced in the recent past. 
  The Nicaraguan military released yesterday eight persons -- 
five U.S. tourists and three Costa Rican crew members -- who 
were arrested by the EPS in the Barra del Colorado (Costa Rica) 
coasts, 240 km northeast of San Jose, while they were sports 
fishing. 
  Meanwhile, two "Navajo" aircraft sent by the Costa Rica 
Expeditions tour company, owner of one of the yachts, remained 
in Nicaragua because "fuel had to be transported from here 
(Costa Rica), as the military did not supply us," company 
executive Javier Salazar told ACAN. 
  The aircraft transported from Bluefields [Nicaragua] company 
personnel and reporters "who had to return on a commercial 
flight last night from Managua," with the released tourists, 
Salazar assured. 
  The company executive said the Nicaraguan immigration 
authorities released the tourists and the crew "without any type 
of explanation." 
  All those involved in the incident from the Costa Rican side 
said that the capture took place in Costa Rican waters off the 
Barra del Colorado coast, in the Caribbean. 
  The Nicaraguan military version indicates that the tourists 
were in Nicaraguan jurisdiction, 10 miles north of the border 
with Costa Rica. Therefore, they proceeded to arrest them. 
  The detained, all U.S. citizens, were identified by Costa 
Rican police as Ted Mucium, Frank Vanderburght, Brian 
Brouckaert, and Erick and Parl Becker. They were travelling on 
the yachts "Bull Shark" and "Guapote," commandeered by Costa 
Ricans Luis Torres, Wally Wallace, and Roberto Graund.
