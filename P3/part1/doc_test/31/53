  [Text] Pretoria, May 11 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui continued a series of meetings with South 
African and other foreign officials here Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Early in the morning, Li met with several officials of the 
African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's new ruling 
party, for wide-ranging talks. 
  Raymond Tai, spokesman for the ROC Presidential Office who 
is 
accompanying Li on his current global tour, told the reporters 
that Li reaffirmed the ROC's determination to assist South 
Africa in its economic development. 
  "The ROC also looks forward to strengthening cooperation 
with 
the new South African Government," Tai quoted Li as telling the 
ANC officials. 
  Li also met with Burkina Faso's foreign minister and special 
envoys from several other African countries who were here to 
attend the swearing-in ceremony of Nelson Mandela as South 
Africa's first black president. 
  Later in the day Wednesday, Li will host a luncheon in honor 
of former South African President F.W. de Klerk, who is now the 
country's vice president, Tai said. 
  Li is also schduled to meet with President Mandela Wednesday 
evening. Mandela visited Taipei last year. 
  On Tuesday, Li met briefly with leaders and spcial envoys 
from many countries, including U.S. Vice President Al Gore and 
First Lady Hillary Clinton, Philippine Vice President Joseph E. 
Estrada and Yasir 'Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, after Mandela's swearing-in ceremony. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, said here Tuesday that the 
ROC Government will encourage Taiwan businessmen to increase 
investment in South Africa. 
  "Such investment will help improve economic conditions in 
South Africa and consolidate relations between Taipei and 
Pretoria," noted Hsiao, who is also accompanying President Li on 
his current global visit. 
  There are now 300 Taiwan-owned companies in South Africa, 
creating 40,000 jobs for black people here, Hsiao added. 
  Li and his entourage arrived in Pretoria Monday evening 
following a five-day visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica in 
Central America. He is scheduled to leave for Swaziland 
Thursday on the final leg of his four-nation state visit.
