  [Text] We are broadcasting directly from the Jose Figueres 
Ferrer Liberationist House where new President Jose Maria 
Figueres Olsen has given his first impromptu speech indicating 
that as president-elect of Costa Rica he will continue with the 
promises made during the election campaign. 
  He promised that he will help those most needy sectors of 
Costa Rica and also reiterated that as of tomorrow we must all 
stand under the same white, blue, and red flag to fight for 
Costa Rica's cause. Let us now listen to statements by 
President-elect Jose Maria Figueres Olsen's here in front of the 
Green Balcony. 
  [Begin Figueres recording] ... the future is ahead. The 
future, hope, and expectation lie ahead with National Liberation 
once again in the government. [applause and music] I would 
also like to express my appreciation to many men and women. I 
would like to thank [word indistinct], my lifelong companion, 
who has supported me and helped me transcend tough and difficult 
moments. I would also like to thank [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  We just listened to part of the statements made by Jose 
Maria
