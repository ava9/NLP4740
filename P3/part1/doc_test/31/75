  [Text] Pretoria, May 9 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui met briefly with Yasir 'Arafat, leader of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Monday [9 May] 
during a dinner given by Pretoria Mayor Nico Stofberg in honor 
of the foreign delegates here to attend the inauguration of 
South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela. 
  This was the first encounter between the ROC head of state 
and the PLO leader. 
  Li and 'Arafat shook hands and embraced each other before 
beginning their conversation. 
  Li also greeted many other foreign dignitaries present at 
the 
banquet, including the Spanish and Belgian crown princes and 
Tunisian Foreign Minister Beji Essegsi [name as received]. 
  Li and his entourage arrived in South Africa Monday evening 
following a [words indistinct] visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica 
in Central America. 
  South Africa is the third leg of Li's current global tour. 
His participation in Mandela's inaugural ceremony highlights 
the ROC Government's efforts to increase its presence in the 
world arena. 
  Official delegations from more than 100 countries will 
attend 
the historic presidential inauguration in Pretoria Tuesday. 
Scores of world leaders, including Cuban President Fidel 
Castro, Israeli President Ezer Weizman and US Vice President Al 
Gore, have already arrived here for the ceremony. 
  The ROC Embassy in South Africa has arranged for President 
Li 
to meet with Mandela and his predecessor F.W. de Klerk as well 
as with new governors of the country's nine provinces during his 
three-day stay here. 
  Li will also visit Swaziland before he returns to Taipei May 
16.
