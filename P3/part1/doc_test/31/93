  [Text] San Jose, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Jose Maria Figueres, 
the Costa Rican president-elect, rejected the possibility the 
country may enter the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) as 
long as differences on the issue still exist in his country. He 
also questioned Parlacen's "concrete results" in the almost 
three years it has been operating. 
  In an interview published today in the newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA, Figueres, who is 37 years old and will assume control 
of the government on 8 May, said Parlacen is "an issue that has 
divided the country," and as long as this situation continues "I 
do not think it is prudent to continue the controversy." 
  "We can do many things to become closer to the rest of the 
Central American countries without thinking about this 
parliament," said the next Costa Rican chief of state. He also 
said regional unity can be achieved "by fighting for just 
causes." 
  According to Figueres, Central American unity does not 
depend 
on Parlacen but, rather, on a "frank, open, friendly, and 
unitarian" position of the countries in the isthmus, because "it 
is easier to be heard as a region than as a sole country." 
  Figueres added, however, "the negative opinion many Costa 
Ricans have about Parlacen could change when we see concrete 
results," and he asked "what are the concrete results" of this 
parliament since it started operations? 
  Parlacen, headquartered in Guatemala, was installed in 
October 1991 with deputies from Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador. Nicaragua, which has already approved its entry into 
the forum, has still not elected its deputies. Costa Rica and 
Panama have not even ratified the proposal to enter this 
organization.
