  [Text] Managua, 22 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government has approved a "presence and control" program along 
the southern border with Costa Rica, which includes the creation 
of new police, immigration, and customs offices following a 
series of minor incidents, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto 
Leal said today. 
  The "vital" measures are aimed at "reaffirming our 
sovereignty and presence" on the San Juan River, a Nicaraguan 
waterway that marks the boundary with Costa Rica, the Nicaraguan 
foreign minister added. "We have had our backs to the river for 
decades," the Nicaraguan foreign minister said. 
  In mid-March Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
questioned the Nicaraguan authorities about the charging of a 
toll in the village of La Trinidad, where the Sarapiqui River 
meets the San Juan River. 
  Leal said the Nicaraguan authorities will continue to charge 
citizens of third countries, who sail on the San Juan River, 
five dollars per tourist card as in the case of tourists who are 
transported on motorboats operated by Costa Rican agencies. 
Ernesto Leal added that Costa Ricans who identify themselves as 
such will not be charged for sailing on the river in compliance 
with the border treaty signed between both countries on 15 April 
1858. The treaty gave Nicaragua the exclusive right to exercise 
full control over the waters of the San Juan River from its head 
waters at Lake Nicaragua to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean, 
Leal said. "This means Nicaragua exercises full sovereignty and 
jurisdiction over the river from source to mouth, Leal said. 
  In addition, the border treaty grants Costa Rica the right 
in 
perpetuity to free navigation on the river for trade purposes 
from its mouth on the Atlantic up to a point 3 miles below 
Castillo Viejo. "Nicaragua respects Costa Rica's rights and 
will continue to respect them," according to Leal, but he noted 
that the treaty explicitly excludes tourism and "that is why 
these types of services (rendered by Costa Rica) are not covered 
by the treaty." 
  The minister said that the new police stations will be 
installed in El Papaturro, El Castillo, El Delta, and Sarapiqui, 
and that there will also be new immigration offices in the 
aforementioned locations as well as in San Juan del Norte. The 
office at the mouth of the Sarapiqui River will be reinforced. 
The project's initial phase includes a tourist information 
program throughout the entire San Juan River area in addition to 
fishing and hunting controls to preserve the region's natural 
resources along that waterway. 
  Leal added that a bill is being drafted prohibiting 
foreigners from purchasing lands in the border regions, which 
will soon be submitted to the Nicaraguan National Assembly. "We 
are also going to have a substantial presence in the area with 
health and education programs at the border," according to Leal, 
who also said a border landmark plan will be implemented between 
boundary markers 13 and 14 along the border with Costa Rica.
