  [Text] Managua, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro today played down Costa Rican President Rafael 
Calderon's warning about taking the dispute regarding free 
navigation of the San Juan River, which borders both countries, 
to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
  "I do not believe we have to anticipate so much," Chamorro 
said when asked about her Costa Rican colleague's statements 
over the past weekend. Calderon said he disagreed with 
Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais' arguments for 
charging a $5.00 fee for every tourist coming from Costa Rica on 
the San Juan River. 
  "We will wait and see what happens" with Costa Rican 
President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen, who will be sworn in on 8 
May, Chamorro said in brief statements to the media after 
inaugurating a seminar on juveniles in prison. 
  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais said Calderon 
Fournier's statements were "exaggerated" and considered it 
unnecessary to go to The Hague to solve their differences 
regarding the San Juan River. Nicaragua "is free to take the 
measures it considers appropriate in its territory, and Costa 
Rica must respect our decisions," Pallais told reporters when he 
referred to the immigration controls implemented by the 
Nicaraguan Government at the river, which is the border between 
both countries. 
  Last week Pallais asserted that the "Canas-Jerez" treaty 
signed in the last century "only" gives Costa Rica the right to 
navigate freely on the river for commercial purposes, not for 
tourism.
