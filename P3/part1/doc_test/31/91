  [Text] Actions by the large American countries, headed by 
the United States, were stepped up on 10 January to expedite the 
official announcement of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's 
candidacy to the post of OAS secretary general, diplomatic 
sources have reported. Those sources have even said that in 
Washington the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and 
Brazil--the main promoters of Gaviria's candidacy--are the ones 
lobbying the most with other diplomatic representations to 
obtain the votes the Colombian president needs. 
  The sources have underscored that the United States does not 
want Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus to head the OAS, 
because, according to them, he does not meet the necessary 
conditions. 
  The North Americans want a statesman to head the 
organization, because they expect this will be the means to get 
their inter-American policy implemented with more multinational 
criteria, just as has been cited by Bill Clinton's 
administration. 
  According to news agencies, the State Department has already 
obtained the support of Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia 
for Gaviria's candidacy. Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva 
Cimma has said his government views this candidacy with much 
interest, although President-elect Eduardo Frei will have to 
make the decision. 
  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon has said there 
will be "a hard confrontation with Colombia" if Gaviria 
formalizes his candidacy. He also reiterated that efforts will 
continue to unite all the small countries on the continent and 
elect the Central American and Caribbean representative. 
  Luis Guardia, the Costa Rican ambassador at the OAS, has 
told 
LA REPUBLICA that only Peru had advanced its backing to the 
Colombian in Washington and that this was not surprising, 
"because Costa Rica was the first country to protest after 
President Alberto Fujimori broke the constitutional order." 
  The Peruvian president has said his country supported 
strongly the Colombian nominee, and he said Gaviria is a 
statesman who also has a good integrationist spirit. 
  Guardia has explained that the 13 Caribbean countries have 
confirmed their support for Niehaus' candidacy and will maintain 
it if Central America "does not separate." 
  In talks with U.S. officials, Guardia has requested "they 
not 
take sides yet" and that, as has been their tradition, they not 
announce their choice until the end. Likewise, he has stressed 
the importance of respecting the management rotation principle, 
which prevails in Washington-based institutions, such as in the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Pan-American 
Health Organization. 
  Until now the Costa Rican minister has maintained the 
support 
of the 13 Caribbean and six isthmian states, as well as the 
Dominican Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. The latter 
two seem to have modified their positions, however, according to 
reports coming from Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Niehaus has said much speculation has been reported to stop 
the regional option, but he said: "We have a comfortable 
majority, and I am sure President Gaviria will think twice 
before making his candidacy official." He has charged that 
certain big countries consider they are "first category" 
countries and that small countries are "second category" ones 
and thus unable to manage inter-American forums. 
  Niehaus believes this attitude violates international law. 
He has added that the 28 March election will reflect if 
regulations will be respected or slighted.
