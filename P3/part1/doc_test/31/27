  [Text] San Jose, 25 Apr (AFP) -- Fernando Naranjo, the 
Costa Rican foreign minister-designate, said this Monday he 
looks forward to the appointment of a U.S. ambassador to Costa 
Rica as a sign of improvement in both countries' relations, 
which have been marred by frequent diplomatic incidents during 
the past years. 
  "The absence of an ambassador (from Washington in San Jose) 
troubles us," but "we are going to work very closely (with the 
Clinton administration)" to solve the problems that have 
developed in the relations between both countries, Naranjo said 
during a news conference, which President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres also attended. 
  Naranjo, who will take charge of the Foreign Ministry on 8 
May when the new government assumes control, admitted a number 
of conflicts "unnecessarily" cooled relations between both 
countries during the administration of Social Christian 
President Rafael Angel Calderon, which is about to conclude. 
  Washington recently threatened to block several loans to 
Costa Rica, because the Costa Rican Government has not 
compensated a group of U.S. citizens whose lands were 
expropriated, and this triggered a harsh confrontation between 
U.S. and Costa Rican authorities. 
  The United States had also previously threatened to suspend 
Costa Rica's preferential custom tariffs, because the 
influential U.S. union AFL-CIO presented charges of union 
persecution against the Costa Rican Government. 
  Naranjo said the next administration will frankly broach the 
issues that have tarnished relations with the United States and 
expect the vacant position at Washington's embassy in San Jose, 
vacant for more than a year, to be filled in the coming months. 
  The designated foreign minister accompanied Figueres on a 
tour to Mexico, the United States, and Canada last week. During 
their trip, the Costa Rican officials met with top officials of 
those governments and with the hierarchy of international 
financial organizations.
