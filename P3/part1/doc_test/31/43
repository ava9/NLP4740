  [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Although the 
Dominican Republic has officially voiced support for Costa 
Rica's candidate for the post of OAS secretary general, today, 
just one day before the elections, it is still unknown how the 
Dominican Government will vote. 
  Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer has expressed 
a 
need for the regional organization to be reorganized to enable 
it to fulfill its duty of being the guardian of Latin American 
democracy. This position corresponds with the one proposed by 
the group of nations supporting the candidacy of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. Balaguer also stated that, together 
with Argentina President Carlos Menen, he is participating in 
Latin American efforts to restore the prestige of the OAS. 
  Previously, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral and 
Foreign Ministry officials had told EFE that the Dominican 
Republic would support Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus. The support was based on the fact that Costa Rica is a 
small country, as well as on an agreed rotation for 
representatives from all OAS countries to occupy the post of 
secretary general. 
  Ambassador Kemil Dipp Gomez, who heads the United Nations 
and 
OAS Department at the Dominican Republic's Foreign Ministry, 
said the Dominican Republic would maintain its support for Costa 
Rica even if there was a possibility that Niehaus could be 
replaced by Oscar Arias, former Costa Rican president and Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate. Niehaus is running against Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, who has the support of the United 
States, Mexico, and Brazil. 
  In January and March 1994, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin visited the Dominican Republic in an effort to obtain the 
government's support for Gaviria's candidacy. On both 
occasions, however, Dominican Republic diplomatic officials 
reiterated their country's preference for a representative from 
a small country, such as Costa Rica, to occupy the post of OAS 
secretary general. Therefore, Balaguer's statements have 
confused international diplomats as to which of the two 
candidates, Gaviria or Niehaus, will receive the Dominican 
Republic's support. 
  According to a source within the Dominican Republic Foreign 
Ministry, there are two international policy issues that could 
force the government to withdraw its support for Costa Rica in 
favor of Colombia. The first is that the United States, the 
country that has the most political influence and economic 
relations with the Dominican Republic, supports Gaviria. At 
this time, the Dominicans are promoting bilateral agreements 
with the United States, which, according to the source, could 
sway the Dominican Republic's vote in favor of Gaviria. 
  The other factor is that the Dominican Republic and Colombia 
are negotiating the possible release of four Dominicans jailed 
in Santa Fe de Bogota in connection with an alleged plot against 
the Colombian Government. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin de Rubio proposed to President Balaguer in her two visits 
that Colombia might agree to allow the Dominicans to serve their 
sentences in their own country if they are convicted, but only 
if the Dominican Republic Government agreed to a 
prisoner-exchange program. Balaguer is being pressured by 
relatives and educational, cultural, and political organizations 
to expedite the release of the Dominicans. 
  After voicing its support for the Costa Rican candidacy for 
more than four months, a change in the Dominican Republic's 
position would be interpreted as meaning that U.S. pressure or 
President Balaguer's interest in obtaining the release of his 
imprisoned citizens prompted the turnaround.
