  [Text] San Jose, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said the free trade agreement to be signed 
with Mexico next month "is an entry gate" to NAFTA. At the 
inauguration ceremony of a business, shortly after returning 
from Panama, Calderon stated that in the next five years some 
Latin American countries will have the possibility of joining 
NAFTA, signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and 
Costa Rica "will be one of the candidates." 
  He added that he will contribute, with his experience, from 
the ranks of the opposition, which he will rejoin on 8 May when 
he hands power over to social democrat Jose Maria Figueres, so 
Costa Rica can join commercial treaties like NAFTA. 
  Yesterday, Costa Rican and Mexican delegations concluded 
three years of negotiations leading to the commercial treaty 
that Calderon and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
will sign in April and which will enter into force on 1 January 
1995. 
  Calderon, who looked "very happy" about the successful 
culmination of the talks, urged the Legislative Assembly to 
immediately proceed with the free trade agreement that, he 
pointed out, offers Costa Rican producers a market of 90 million 
people. 
  The president hailed his country's negotiating team and 
spotlighted Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas, who led the 
negotiations, a person Calderon regarded as "one of the best 
ministers" his country has had. "It is an extraordinary 
agreement. The culmination of three years of effort," the 
president affirmed, and he added that Mexican investments, based 
on the treaty, can increase $300 million a year. 
  Calderon flew to Panama on Wednesday to attend the 
inauguration of a commercial fair, and later he met with his 
Panamanian counterpart Guillermo Endara to analyze the European 
Union's restrictions on banana imports.
