  [Text] San Jose, 1 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres said that because of world changes, the 
collapse of ideological barriers, and the end of the Cold War, 
Costa Rica believes that it should review its policy toward Cuba. 
  Figueres, in statements to NOTIMEX, said he considers "this 
review of the Cuban case should be done by all the hemisphere's 
countries, to find a peaceful solution to the island's 
situation." 
  It is not a question of establishing relations in the near 
future. It is a question that relations with that country 
should take on a new, broader outlook, more in accordance with 
the international situation, Figueres said. 
  The president has repeatedly said that the solution to the 
Cuban problem should be dealt with through negotiations at the 
hemispheric level, to avoid bloodshed in Cuba. 
  The government of former President Rafael Angel Calderon 
Fournier (1990 to May 1994) on several occasions spoke of the 
need to resolve Cuba's integration into the inter-American 
system through dialogue, in order to avoid bloodshed. 
  During the last UN General Assembly, Costa Rica voted with 
the majority of countries against the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  Costa Rica considers the U.S.-imposed blockade of Cuba a 
violation of international law contrary to the spirit of free 
trade, which the United States promised to respect through the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  On this same topic, Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando 
Naranjo, underscored that "today Cuba lives under an oppressive 
political and economic situation, in which the people are the 
ones who suffer." 
  "The Cuban people deserve a better future, and it is Latin 
America's obligation to raise its voice in defense of democracy, 
sovereignty, and liberties for the entire hemisphere," Naranjo 
explained. 
  The foreign minister clarified that "Costa Rica is not 
willing to support actions that condemn a people to hunger, 
poverty, and oppression, because respect of all human rights is 
part and parcel of being Costa Rican." 
  Naranjo pointed out to N0TIMEX that "Cuba's delicate 
situation should be analyzed in depth by all countries in the 
hemisphere because of international changes that have taken 
place," such as the end of the East-West conflict and the end of 
the Cold War. 
  "If Costa Rica is able to contribute anything, if Costa Rica 
can add its grain of sand to find a solution to Cuba's crisis, 
we are willing to play that role, because passivity is the worst 
mistake at this moment," Naranjo stressed. 
  The foreign minister said that "hopefully all Costa Ricans 
will join together to encourage a hemispheric position in the 
case of Cuba, and this is in full agreement with the democratic 
principles the American continent today brandishes with pride."
