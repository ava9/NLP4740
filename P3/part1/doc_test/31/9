  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
will address the Nicaraguan Parliament on his official visit to 
the Central American country next month, a Foreign Affairs 
Ministry official said Friday [15 April]. 
  "President Li would become the third foreign head of state 
to 
give a speech to the Nicaraguan Parliament," said Hou 
Ching-shan, an official with the Ministry's Central &amp; South 
American Affairs Department, who is fresh from visiting 
Nicaragua to arrange Li's trip. 
  "It would be the highest honor accorded to the head of a 
foreign state," Hou said. 
  President Li will arrive in Nicaragua on May 4 and then meet 
with Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Hou said, 
adding that a joint statement will be issued following the 
meeting. 
  Li will also visit a Taiwan-owned textile factory that 
employ 
1,500 workers, making it the largest single employer of textile 
workers in Central America. 
  From Nicaragua, Li will proceed to Costa Rica on May 6 to 
attend the inaugural ceremony for President-Elect Jose Maria 
Figueres. Li will be awarded a medal by Costa Rica in 
recognition of his contribution in promoting ties between the 
two countries. 
  A joint communique will also be issued after a meeting 
between Li and the outgoing Costa Rican President Rafael Angel 
Calderon. 
  Accompanying Li on the two-leg visit will be Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chien Fu, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, and Governor Samuel C. Shieh 
of the Central Bank of China. 
  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, along with five other Latin 
American countries, submitted a letter to United Nations 
Scretary-General Butros Butros Ghali last August requesting that 
the United Nations put the Republic of China's UN bid on the 
agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993. The 
request was later voted down.
