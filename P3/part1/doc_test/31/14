  [Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, May 7 (CNA) -- President Li 
Teng-hui of the Republic of China [ROC] said here over the 
weekend that the ROC would actively participate in international 
affairs as a sovereign nation. 
  Li, who is now on a official visit to Costa Rica where he 
participated in the inauguration of President Jose Maria 
Figueres Sunday [8 May], made the remarks during a news 
conference held following a breakfast meeting with Figueres. 
  The ROC is a sovereign nation and the world should recognize 
that China is divided and ruled by separate governments, Li said. 
  Under the existing situation, the ROC has two courses of 
action, Li said, including the promotion of substantial 
relations with other nations and improving cross-Taiwan Strait 
relations. 
  "Developing mutual understanding between the two sides of 
the 
Taiwan Strait is important," he emphasized. But it is necessary 
for the ROC to enter the international community as a sovereign 
nation, he added.
