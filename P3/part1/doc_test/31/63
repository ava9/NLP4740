  [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms 
what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac 
Oso Chavarria's assistant, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, has been 
clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA 
agents. The news agency report states: 
  The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the 
Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit 
through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that 
former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked to a drug 
trafficker. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the 
DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having 
informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on 3 April, 
again reported in Costa Rica that last week -- during a long 
testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos Herrada -- 
he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso Chavarria. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from 
Bolivia 
by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation 
Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement 
operation. Following consultations, the Bolivian prosecutor and 
Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal asked for 
permission to question him in conjunction with Costa Rican 
officials.
