  [Text] Managua, 22 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Friday, the 
Nicaraguan Government Ministry confirmed it has ordered the 
arrest of U.S. citizen John Hull, a naturalized Costa Rican 
citizen. Hull has several criminal charges pending in Costa 
Rica and is believed to be in Nicaragua, although his 
whereabouts are unknown. 
  Today, an official spokesman said the police began an 
investigation to locate the 74-year old Hull, who is charged 
with attacking anti-Sandinist guerrilla leader Eden Pastora in a 
place called La Penca on the Nicaraguan border 10 years ago. 
Hull, who is also accused of drug trafficking and supplying arms 
to the former Nicaraguan contras, fled Costa Rica to the United 
States several years ago, according to Costa Rican newspaper 
sources. 
  Today, BARRICADA published a report that Hull arrived in 
Nicaragua on 17 February through El Espino customs checkpoint on 
the Honduran border and that he is currently living on a cattle 
ranch near Juigalpa in the central Department of Chontales. 
  Even though police authorities have confirmed Hull's arrest 
warrant, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman told ACAN-EFE 
that the Costa Rican Government still has not requested 
extradition of the American, who is now a naturalized Costa 
Rican citizen. On Monday, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel 
Calderon Fournier reported that his government sent a note to 
the U.S. authorities requesting Hull's extradition.
