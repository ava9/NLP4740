  [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Jose Maria Figueres, 
National Liberation Party (PLN) presidential candidate, said it 
is necessary for Costa Rica to review its relations with Cuba 
within the framework of new international relations. 
  During an impromptu news conference a few hours before the 
start of this country's general elections, Figueres cited the 
need to evaluate the current state of relations between Costa 
Rica and Cuba "without deviating from the issue of human rights, 
which concerns all Costa Ricans." 
  "By respecting each country's decisions and internal 
situation, we are obligated to analyze, review this case to 
ascertain whether our position responds to current world 
realities," the presidential candidate said. 
  He dodged voicing an opinion about the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba, saying "what should concern us is our relations and 
policies toward Cuba, and that is what we are going to 
reevaluate." 
  "At any rate, I believe every country on the continent that 
still does not have relations with that nation (Cuba) should 
also review their policies," he added. 
  Figueres said "the world evolves. Nothing should remain 
static. I believe we all must evaluate the possibility of 
improving things, seeking, of course, that all our countries and 
people, including the Cuban people, may have a better future." 
  With respect to the possible reestablishment of diplomatic 
or 
consular relations during his eventual administration, the 
presidential candidate responded "first we must review our 
policies in light of world conditions; afterward, we will 
decide."
