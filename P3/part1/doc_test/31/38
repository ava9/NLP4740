  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
returned to Taipei Monday [16 May] after a 3-day four-nation 
state visit. 
  President Li was greeted by many high-ranking officials, 
including Vice President Li Yuan-zu, at Sungshan Airport in 
downtown Taipei. 
  Li did not make any formal statements on his trip at the 
airport. He may meet the press on May 26 to explain the 
significance of his four-nation state visit, government sources 
said. 
  Accompanied by a large entourage, Li began his global tour 
aboard a chartered China Airlines plane, which took him to 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland. 
  Li made a stopover at Singapore's Changi International 
Airport on his return flight from South Africa. Many senior 
Singaporean officials, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 
greeted Li at the airport, television news reports said. 
  Li's four-nation visit aimed to strengthen the Republic of 
China [ROC]'s diplomatic ties with its allies. Li signed joint 
communiques with heads of state of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and 
Swaziland pledging to further strengthen cooperation in various 
fields. Li also met with the new South African president, 
Nelson Mandela, during his stay in Pretoria. Li and Mandela 
reaffirmed their determination to further boost bilateral ties. 
  This was Li's first official overseas trip since he assumed 
the presidency in 1988. Li made an unofficial visit to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand 
early this year as part of his effort to promote Taiwan's 
substantive relations with other countries and to increase 
Taiwan's presence in the world arena. Taiwan does not maintain 
diplomatic ties with the four Southeast Asian nations.
