  [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Jose Pallais asserted that 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon's announcement on 
the possibility of taking Nicaragua to the International Court 
of Justice at The Hague for its immigration controls in its 
sovereign San Juan River area are "exaggerated." 
  Pallais, in statements made on the phone from his house in 
Leon, said: "I do not see the need to resort to The Hague to 
resolve matters which we, as friendly countries, can discuss 
ourselves." The Nicaraguan Government informed Costa Rican 
authorities that it "would implement immigration controls on 
tourism activities carried out on that river" and would charge a 
$5 fee for each person who used the river for tourism. 
"Nicaragua is free to implement the measures it feels necessary 
on its territory, and Costa Rica has to respect our decisions," 
Pallais underscored. 
  The Costa Rican president told the Costa Rican newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA over the weekend that he did not agree with the 
measures implemented by Nicaragua because the Canas-Jerez Treaty 
established free transit on the San Juan without any type of 
preference. Calderon requested his foreign minister, Bernd 
Niehaus, to establish immediate negotiations with Nicaraguan 
authorities. "If an agreement is not reached, the future Costa 
Rican administration -- headed by Jose Figueres -- will have to 
present the case at the International Court of Justice, although 
we expect that will not be necessary," he said. 
  Pallais reaffirmed Nicaragua's right to safeguard its 
sovereignty over the San Juan River as established in the 
Canas-Jerez Treaty signed last century. He said the treaty 
stipulates that Costa Ricans cannot navigate more than three 
miles of the river, much less navigate up to Nicaragua Lake, 
which is where Costa Ricans go in a clear violation of our 
sovereignty.
