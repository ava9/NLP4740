    [Editorial Report] Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in 
Spanish at 2113 GMT on 29 May broadcasts a live relay of a 
36-minute news conference by President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro and Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen with 
unidentified reporters following a working meeting at San Juan 
del Sur, Nicaragua. 
  In her opening statement, President Chamorro discusses the 
topics they addressed at the meeting: "We have spoken about many 
things. Great concern was expressed over preventive health 
measures. We are going to work jointly on this. We are also 
going to work jointly to prevent drug trafficking and money 
laundering. We are also going to take steps to prevent problems 
on our oceans and lakes. Fishing boats will be identified to 
avoid problems in an attempt to prevent it from ever being said 
again that Nicaragua seized a small boat or that Costa Rica 
seized another. We do not want these problems." She adds: 
"There is no protocol here, because I do not think Nicaragua and 
Costa Rica need a protocol. What we want is brotherhood." 
  In his opening statement, President Figueres thanks 
President 
Chamorro for the invitation and notes the excellent relations 
between their two countries, adding: "We hope to continue to 
strengthen these relations, and, as a result of these meetings, 
very specific solutions will be found to eliminate within the 
next months and years those very small pebbles in our shoes -- 
small problems we sometimes have had in our bilateral relations." 
  Explaining the issues they discussed, Figueres indicates 
that 
they dealt with social, economic, and political matters. He 
notes that they discussed programs against dengue fever and the 
need to strengthen housing and sports programs. In terms of 
economics, he reports they discussed bilateral trade: "I would 
like to mention the challenges we are facing in bilateral 
relations. Of course, we talked at length about trade. The 
economy and agricultural ministers have been working in order 
that, within 45 days, we will have clear and definite mechanisms 
to remove the obstacles that have existed in our bilateral trade 
and so that we can have a more productive and simpler trade 
process." 
  Figueres states that he and Chamorro reviewed the problem of 
cross-border smuggling, especially the problem of cattle 
rustling, which has increased in recent years. He goes on to 
state they also discussed fishing and tourism problems, adding: 
"We want our ministries to find a mechanism to warn the boats of 
one country that they are sailing in territorial waters of the 
other country. The truth is that the boats are not acting with 
ill-intent. They are not crossing the border on purpose. We 
want to establish a means by which they know when they are 
nearing the limits of their territorial waters, and, in turn, we 
will no longer have the problems we are experiencing today." 
  In outlining the political issues they discussed, Figueres 
says: "We talked about border issues and the opportunities our 
common border provides in strengthening the ties between our 
countries. We discussed the operating hours of border 
checkpoints and decided to extend them, improving the border 
crossing process for Nicaraguans, Costa Ricans, and foreign 
tourists." 
  During the question and answer segment of the news 
conference, President Chamorro replies to a reporter's question 
on whether or not Nicaragua will accept the entry of Haitian 
refugees as the U.S. Government has requested: "As far as 
Nicaragua is concerned, as well as all Central Americans are 
concerned, we have been presented with a minor suggestion from 
Vice President Gore. We will decide on this. We are reviewing 
it in advance of our next meeting in December, and, at that 
time, we will announce the results of our review." 
  In answering the same question, President Figueres states: 
"In Costa Rica's case, it is a situation we still have to review 
with Presidency Minister Elias Soley and Foreign Minister 
Fernando Naranjo. I believe that Costa Rica, as a country that 
is always respectful of human rights, must study this carefully, 
and that the appropriate forum to discuss this topic is one in 
which all of the countries of the continent are present."
