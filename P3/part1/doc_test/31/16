<F P=106> [Interview with Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon </F>
Fournier by Jacobo Zabludovsky; place not given; from the "24 
Hours" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zabludovsky] We will interview Costa Rican 
President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier. Good evening, Mr. 
President. 
  [Calderon] Good evening, Jacobo. It is a pleasure to be here 
tonight. This is a very important day for my country because 
the free trade agreement with Mexico will create extraordinary 
opportunities for development in Costa Rica. Our country will 
be able to integrate its economy with Mexico's great economy, an 
economy with 90 million participants. 
  [Zabludovsky] Could you briefly tell us how the agreements 
signed today will benefit Costa Rica and Mexico? 
  [Calderon] We must stress one very important aspect: Mexico 
has shown its solidarity with Latin America. One of Mexico's 
most outstanding foreign policy achievements was the free trade 
agreement with the United States, which made it possible to 
integrate the Mexican economy into the world's strongest 
economy. This creates jobs and will bring development to 
Mexico, well-being to the Mexican people, and more opportunities 
for all. 
  By the same token, our free trade agreement with Mexico 
means 
that Costa Rica is entering a country with a population of 90 
million citizens, a country with a growing economy, a country 
that will become part of the First World at the beginning of the 
21st century through the free trade agreement. 
  What does it mean for Mexico? As always, Mexico has shown 
its solidarity with Latin America. The free trade agreement 
with the United States and Canada has made Mexico a stronger 
country that has opened its doors to its Latin American 
neighbors to give us the same opportunities. 
  [Zabludovsky] Last night Nicaraguan President Violeta de 
Chamorro expressed her hope that Nicaragua will also join this 
agreement. Do you think the free trade agreement between Costa 
Rica and Mexico can be extended to other countries in the area? 
  [Calderon] Definitely. That has been President Salinas de 
Gortari's wish from the beginning. At a meeting in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez three years ago, Central American countries agreed to 
sign a free trade agreement with Mexico. Costa Rica had the 
opportunity to advance and persevered until the agreement was 
signed today. The rest of Central America will follow to 
acquire the same advantages that Mexico has given Costa Rica 
today. [passage omitted]
