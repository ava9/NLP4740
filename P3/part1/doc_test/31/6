<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Angel Calderon, whose father's Costa Rican political career ended in 
exile, was sworn in Tuesday as president of Central America's most enduring 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking his father's one-time populist ideals and briefly acknowledging the 
foreign activism and peacemaking role of his predecessor, Oscar Arias Sanchez, 
Calderon promised to tackle Costa Rica's deficit. He also pledged to help lead, 
by example, a region that until only recently has been torn by civil war and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the combination of economic growth and social justice can immunize 
democracies against the totalitarian dangers of the extreme right and the 
extreme left," he told a capacity crowd at the 25,000-seat National Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
During his 40-minute speech, Calderon was flanked by all of Central America's 
heads of state, including Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro. Most of the leaders, like Calderon, are newly elected moderate 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said regional troubles appear to have eased and that many of the 
Central American nations have edged toward Costa Rica's century-old example of 
democratic stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Being now halfway down the road toward a better future, it is for us, the 
presidents of Central America, to assume the responsibility of leading our 
peoples into a new stage in the process, in which the great goal will no longer 
be to silence the uproar of cannon fire, but to take off at last toward 
economic development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush, appearing calm and proud on her first solo venture 
abroad to represent her husband, was cheered when she led the U.S. delegation 
into the stadium. Earlier, she had delivered a letter from her husband, in 
which he pledged to work with Calderon to "bring peace, democracy and 
development to the region." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's Feb. 4 victory ended eight years of rule by Arias' National 
Liberation Party. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the 10th consecutive election in Costa Rica since Rafael Calderon 
Guardia, president from 1940 to 1944, sparked a civil war after he tried to 
nullify the vote in his losing 1948 electoral campaign. The family was driven 
into exile in Nicaragua, where Rafael Angel Calderon, known as Junior, was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, 41, has tried to follow in his father's footsteps almost since he 
graduated from the University of Costa Rica law school in 1972. He served in 
various government posts and lost two presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But in his most current bid, at the head of the Social Christian Unity Party, 
he had the help of Roger Ailes, President Bush's campaign wizard. Ailes 
refashioned Calderon's image from that of a hard-liner on foreign issues into 
that of a man of the people -- a reflection of his father's early political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Ailes was part of the U.S. delegation Tuesday along with John H. Sununu, the 
President's chief of staff, and his wife, Nancy; former Puerto Rican President 
Luis Ferre, and the Bushes' son, Jeb. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon promised to reduce the $35-million deficit of Costa Rica, a country 
the size of West Virginia with a population of 2.2 million, by forcing 
"self-sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will encourage new markets and bolster tourism but insisted he will 
keep his campaign promise to build 160,000 housing units by his term's end.
