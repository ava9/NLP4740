  [Text] San Jose, 6 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- While Costa Rican 
businessmen and government considered the signing of the Free 
Trade Agreement (TLC) with Mexico a landmark in Costa Rican 
history, union leaders expressed great reservations about this 
economic opening and the consequences it will have for the 
country. 
  The signing of the TLC by Presidents Rafael Angel Calderon 
(Costa Rica) and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (Mexico) in Mexico 
City yesterday, Tuesday, was given wide coverage by the Costa 
Rican media. A television station even broadcast the event live. 
  Costa Rican businessmen and government officials estimate 
that with the TLC, which has to be ratified by the parliaments 
in both countries, exports to Mexico should go from $60 million 
to $250 million in the next five years. This would make Mexico 
Costa Rica's fourth commercial partner, after the United States, 
the European Union, and Central America. 
  In its editorial today, LA NACION newspaper pointed out that 
the signing of the TLC, considered to be one of the most 
advanced of the ones signed in Latin America, "gives a greater 
momentum to a new era of commercial opening," whose commercial 
benefits "are as great as the challenges it poses." After 
highlighting the benefits the TLC can bring to the country, 
offering a market of more than 85 million people to the Costa 
Rican producers, the newspaper warned, however, that "one cannot 
rest on one's laurels because the challenges imposed by this new 
reality are many." "More than ever before, it is necessary to 
expand the economic modernization program," the newspaper 
appraised. LA NACION published a big photograph of Calderon and 
Salinas signing the agreement in its front page, two pages with 
information related to the TLC, and one with the Costa Rican 
president's speech. 
  The LA REPUBLICA newspaper, for its part, gave less coverage 
to this story and published a small photo of Calderon and 
Salinas de Gortari in its first page and highlighted that the 
signing of the TLC opens a ""new era in the relations between 
Costa Rica and Mexico." Costa Rican business sectors are 
focusing on the possibility of developing joint investments, 
starting next January, when the TLC, which will regulate the 
trade in approximately 12,000 products, will go into effect. 
  Carlos Alvarado, the Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce 
president, announced that this same week, Costa Rican 
businessmen will start to make contacts in order to attract 
financial investments. 
  Chamber of Industries President Samuel Yankelewitz said the 
TLC "includes all the elements for things to go well" and 
considered it was "just and balanced" for both nations. 
  Doris Osterlof, the executive director of the Export 
Chamber, 
asserted: "Our industry is prepared" to compete with the 
Mexicans. 
  However, Albino Vargas, secretary general of the National 
Association of Public Employees (ANEP,) questioned the Treaty 
because the labor sector had not participated in the three years 
of negotiations and also because the TLC does not state clearly 
the workers' benefits. 
  Another union leader, Guillermo Garcia, told ACAN-EFE the 
TLC 
will benefit the country's development but said unions had 
reservations about the new economic model (the commercial 
opening) and the consequences it can have. 
  Garcia added that the Costa Rican Government will have to 
abrogate protection measures for workers and labor organizations 
because of the pressures the economic opening will have on Costa 
Rican society. 
  The experience of the decades between the 1960's and the 
1980's, Garcia underscored, left a negative balance because "we 
were asked for sacrifice in exchange for future economic bonanza 
and the economic models that were implemented prompted a larger 
social gap and an unfair distribution of the benefits resulting 
from production."
