<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kang Yu-feng in San Jose on 7 May; </F>
from the "Hookup" program] 
  [Text] Jose Maria Figueres, who is to become the next 
president of Costa Rica, announced his policy on the ROC at a 
joint news conference with President Li Teng-hui. Through an 
interpreter, he stressed that Costa Rica will continue its 
efforts to help the ROC gain deserving status in the 
international community. He also pointed out that it is 
appropriate for the ROC to join the UN and that at every 
occasion Costa Rica will support the ROC, which firmly defends 
democracy and has traditional ties of friendship with Costa Rica. 
  [Begin Figueres recording] We will always stand on the side 
of the ROC and continue to fight for the ROC when necessary, so 
that the ROC will gain deserving status in the international 
community. We will not only continue our support for our 
traditional friend, but also render support, at every 
international occasion, to a country that defends democracy 
consistently. [end recording] 
  President Jose Maria Figueres also expressed his wish to 
visit the ROC after he is sworn in and state affairs are in 
order, so as to draw on the ROC's experiences in every field. 
President Li Teng-hui expressed heartfelt thanks for the 
promise by the new Costa Rican Government. Besides, he 
stressed, as a sovereign state, the ROC is currently practicing 
pragmatic diplomacy and promoting cross-strait relations. There 
is no controversy in doing these simultaneously. He hoped the 
two sides of the strait would achieve mutual understanding. 
There is nothing inappropriate in the ROC trying to find a way 
to practice diplomacy and join the UN. 
  [Begin President Li recording] It is very important for the 
two sides to foster mutual understanding. The ROC, however, 
needs to find a way to practice diplomacy as a sovereign state. 
In my opinion, these activities should proceed simultaneously. 
Since the ROC meets the requirement that a UN member state be 
peace-loving, it is very appropriate for the ROC to join the UN. 
[end recording] 
  When answering a question at the news conference about 
solving the issue of Costa Rica's agricultural development, 
President Li Teng-hui, an agricultural expert, modestly said 
that President Jose Maria Figueres, a former agricultural 
minister, knows more about agriculture than he and surely has 
concrete plans. Li said the ROC Government and the private 
sector will help him fulfill these plans.
