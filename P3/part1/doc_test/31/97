  [Text] San Jose, 16 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres said today he will continue his country's 
economic opening but in an "intelligent manner" to compete in 
terms of the quality and utilization of technologies and not a 
cheap labor force. 
  During a lunch with the Costa Rican Union of Private 
Enterprise Chambers and Associations (UCCAEP), the man who will 
be governing Costa Rica beginning 8 May warned in his 
administration he will seek a "true commercial opening." 
  "We have opened the economy, but we need greater vitality to 
compete more intelligently with greater courage, not with lower 
wages," Figures said, adding he will strengthen and improve the 
quality of social programs. 
  He promised businessmen, however, he will respect 
"macroeconomic balances" by lowering the fiscal and commercial 
deficits and will promote tax reform not to impose more taxes 
but to improve the collection of existing ones. 
  UCCAEP President Marco Vinicio Ruiz said "the key of 
success" 
for Costa Rican society depends fundamentally on achieving a 
successful and high quality incorporation into the world economy. 
  "This can only be attained if the country advances in 
congruence with improving competitiveness and Costa Ricans' 
quality of life," the business group leader said.
