  [Text] San Jose, 20 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican 
Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle today denied that relations 
between his country and the United States suffered a serious 
setback during the current administration, as various sectors 
claim. 
  Lacle said that "we have enjoyed good relations" with the 
United States, despite "certain discrepancies" following the 
expropiation of a farm in northern Costa Rica from a U.S. 
citizen who asked that the United States apply sanctions against 
Costa Rica. This sanction aimed freezing a $250 million IDB 
loan at the beginning of 1993, an idea that was finally vetoed 
in Costa Rica's favor following intense diplomatic efforts by 
San Jose. 
  The Santa Elena Hacienda, comprised of 15,000 hectares, is 
now part of a national park bordering Nicaragua. The property 
is claimed by John Hamilton. By mutual consent the case has 
been submitted to international arbitration in order to 
establish its true value 15 years after its confiscation. 
  Another incident that created tension between Costa Rica and 
the United States was a claim by U.S. trade unions about alleged 
labor right violations by Costa Rican authorities. Following 
negotiations, Costa Rica managed to have the charges dropped, 
which had been filed with the U.S. commerce secretary. In 
exchange, Costa Rica promised to support a series of labor 
reforms, some of which are still being discussed by the 
Legislative Assembly, where they face strong opposition from 
certain deputies and chambers of commerce. 
  The Costa Rican Government, headed by Social Christian 
Rafael 
Angel Calderon, ends its tenure on 8 May when Social Democrat 
Jose Maria Figueres takes office. Today, Figueres ends a visit 
to the United States where he has met with authorities.
