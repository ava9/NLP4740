  [Text] On 8 March in Washington D.C., Foreign Relations 
Minister Bernd Niehaus asked Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, to urge the 
United States to stop "twisting" the arms of Caribbean nations 
to get them to support Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's bid 
to become OAS secretary general. 
  The minister met with Watson before departing for Santiago, 
Chile, where he will attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's 
inauguration. President Gaviria and Oscar Arias, former Costa 
Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, will also attend 
the inauguration. Arias also has expressed interest in 
obtaining the OAS post. 
  President Rafael Angel Calderon said the only topic Niehaus 
and Watson discussed at their 8 March meeting was the upcoming 
election for the post of OAS secretary general. 
  Calderon added: "We respect the U.S. position to choose 
President Gaviria, but we cannot accept the twisting of arms of 
small Caribbean nations. Niehaus wanted to make this point very 
clear." Calderon made these statements at the inauguration of 
the Monument to the Costa Rican Teacher. 
  In addition, the head of state stressed that Foreign 
Minister 
Niehaus told Watson he expects to maintain good relations with 
the United States as OAS secretary general. 
  The Foreign Ministry's Press Office reported that Deputy 
Foreign Minister Hernan Castro is visiting Saint Vincent to meet 
with representatives of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to 
discuss banana marketing strategies. This visit also seeks to 
reinforce bilateral relations in the wake of statements by 
Caricom Secretary General Edwin Carrington, who said at least 
three countries in the region -- namely, Dominica, Saint 
Vincent, and Saint Lucia -- had withdrawn their support for the 
Costa Rican OAS candidacy. 
  Niehaus, however, noted that this problem has been 
completely 
overcome and that he still has 22 votes in his favor, including 
the votes of the 13 small Caricom states. Meanwhile, President 
Calderon underscored that he has been in contact with the 
Caribbean ministers, adding that Costa Rica is proposing a fair 
and balanced plan that will not hurt their economies. 
  Costa Rica has advocated the broadening of the quota system 
while maintaining a contingency [contingente] that favors the 
islands to ensure that bananas continue to be their main source 
of revenue.
