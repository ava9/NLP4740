  [Text] President Rafael Angel Calderon has received the 
best evaluation in his entire term as president. The results of 
the latest Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup) 
poll, which was conducted from 3 to 6 January 1994, indicate 
that favorable opinions on his administration surpassed the 
negative ones by 42 points. 
  Fifty-one percent of the 1,010 Costa Ricans polled by CID 
evaluated Calderon's work favorably. Out of those 616, 35 
percent said his work had been very good, and 65 percent said it 
had been good. In addition, 37 percent maintained that his 
government's work has been neither good nor bad; 9 percent had 
an unfavorable opinion; and 3 percent did not reply. 
  Calderon started his government in 1990. The opinions 
against him were two points higher than the favorable ones in 
November of that year. He continued to fall in the ratings 
until he got to minus 25 points in July 1991, which was his 
lowest point. From then on the favorable opinions started to 
increase, however, mainly because the period of economic reforms 
"with a high social cost" ended and current Presidency Minister 
Rolando Lacle--who is responsible for the official government 
campaign called "Costa Rica excels" [Costa Rica se supera]--was 
appointed. This perception of improvement is more frequent 
among people with a higher education and those who are Social 
Christian Unity Party followers and who intend to vote for 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez. 
  It is evident that when the Calderon Fournier administration 
ends the president will have the satisfaction of having obtained 
the backing of most citizens, making him the president who has 
received the second highest rating from Costa Ricans. In 
increasing order, at the end of their presidential terms, 
Rodrigo Carazo had a minus 65 points, Luis Alberto Monge had 
plus 25, Rafael Angel Calderon plus 42 points, and Oscar Arias 
plus 60 points, which is the highest score received by a 
president. 
  As in Arias' case, a president's popularity or high scores 
for a good administration are not decisive factors to win a 
campaign, as, after Arias' term, his party's candidate, Carlos 
Manuel Castillo, lost the elections. 
  There is a relation between the political party, the 
president's opinion, and the way people perceive the country's 
future, however. The polls show that the Social Christians as 
well as citizens with a higher education are more optimistic 
when appraising the perspectives for the next two years. This 
indicates that the current government's work has given them 
confidence for the future. In total, 28 percent of Costa Ricans 
believe the future will be better, 29 percent that it will be 
worse, 28 percent that it will be the same, and 15 percent did 
not answer that question. 
  If two lines where drawn--one to measure pessimism and the 
other optimism--we could see how, according to the CID/Gallup 
studies, expectations have been decreasing constantly. In 1990, 
negative expectations scored 65 percent, and this figure stands 
at 29 percent. In contrast, the feeling that the country's 
situation is going to improve has shown a sustained growth. 
Only 6 percent of Costa Ricans thought this way 14 years ago, 
and 28 percent do so now. 
  On this occasion, the poll asked what special benefit did 
the 
community, where the pollee lived, obtain from President 
Calderon's government. In order of importance, the granting of 
bonds, especially for housing, and the building and repair of 
roads were the specific benefits the people mentioned more 
often. Less frequently mentioned were the community centers and 
homes developed by First Lady Gloria Bejarano. The latter was 
the opinion of 35 percent of the people polled. In addition, 47 
percent of the citizens believe the government has done nothing 
for their community, and 18 percent had no opinion. The 
unfavorable opinions prevailed among those who live in the 
interior of the country and National Liberation Party followers.
