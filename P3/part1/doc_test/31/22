  [Text] San Jose, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that he will talk to Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro about the dispute over the San Juan 
River, which delimits the border between the two countries, 
during her 27 March visit. San Jose Municipality invited 
Chamorro to visit Costa Rica to open the Nicaragua Park in this 
capital. She will seize the opportunity to meet with Calderon. 
  The dispute emerged over an alleged five-dollar charge, 
which 
is considered illegal by Costa Rican authorities, collected from 
tourists navigating along the San Juan River which delimits 
almost 200 of the 320 km that the two countries share. 
  Last weekend the Costa Rican president hinted that the next 
administration, which will be inaugurated on 8 May, could take 
this dispute to the International Court of Justice, 
headquartered at The Hague (the Netherlands), in case it cannot 
be solved through other means. Calderon today stressed the 
cordial relationship between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and said 
that he will talk to Chamorro to find a solution to the said 
charge which Nicaraguan authorities consider legal. 
  Nicaragua has sovereignty over the San Juan River, which 
drains Lake Nicaragua, but according to border treaties signed 
last century, Costa Rica also has the right to navigate it 
freely. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus today told 
ACAN-EFE that the matter could be taken to the International 
Court of Justice at The Hague, but he is hopeful it can be 
solved through talks between the two nations. He said that he 
hoped to talk today to his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal, 
to find a solution to this problem, which arose due to Costa 
Rican tourist enterprises.
