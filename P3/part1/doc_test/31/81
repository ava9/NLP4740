  [Text] The trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico, 
which goes into force on 1 January 1995, will constitute Costa 
Rica's first step toward joining NAFTA, which has been signed by 
Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 
  Mexico had wanted to sign an agreement with all of the 
Central American countries, but the pressure exerted by both 
President Salinas and President Calderon -- both of whom were 
eager to sign a bilateral agreement of such great significance 
for their countries -- was decisive. 
  This agreement is undoubtedly one of President Calderon's 
personal victories, and it will represent great benefits for 
Costa Rica's development, particularly because it strengthens 
our independence vis-a-vis the unionist pressure by the 
remaining Central American countries.
