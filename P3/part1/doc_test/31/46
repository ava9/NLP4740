  [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus today said the U.S. blockade against Cuba 
"is not the proper medicine" to get this country to return to a 
democratic system. According to Niehaus, a candidate for post 
of OAS secretary general, "bloodshed" has to be avoided in Cuba, 
and a change in Cuba's current political system -- a system that 
has been in place for more than 30 years -- has to be achieved 
through dialogue and respect for the people's self-determination. 
  The head of Costa Rican diplomacy said: "None of us want our 
Cuban brothers to shed one drop of blood. We have to talk to 
them to avoid this. They are part of the American family that 
is outside" the OAS because of the isolation decreed against it 
by the organization in the 1960's. 
  Nevertheless, Niehaus warned that for Cuba to be readmitted 
as a member of the American community of nations, it has to 
respectfully adhere to the principles of the OAS Charter and to 
the defense of human rights. In this sense, the foreign 
minister said, he agreed that Cuba should not be invited to any 
American Summit -- the next summit has been scheduled in the 
United States at the end of 1994 -- until a democratic change 
takes place on the island governed by Fidel Castro, the Marxist 
leader who took power in the 1959 revolution. 
  According to Niehaus, had Western Europe isolated the Soviet 
Union, "we would still have the USSR." In this way, he 
reiterated that it was counterproductive to continue using the 
method of isolation to achieve change in Cuba. Regarding the 
renewal of relations between Cuba and Costa Rica, which were 
broken off more than 30 years ago, Niehaus said this is not the 
only way to get closer to the Havana regime, and he added that 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon was the one who had 
to ultimately decide this issue. 
  Today Niehaus met with foreign reporters covering Costa 
Rica's electoral process that ends tomorrow with the election of 
a new president, two vice presidents, 57 deputies, and 
authorities for the 81 Costa Rican municipalities.
