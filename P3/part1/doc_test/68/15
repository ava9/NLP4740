<F P=106> [Article by Danny Morrison, a Sinn Fein "strategist": </F>
"Morrison: Why We Haven't Said `Yes'" -- last four paragraphs 
are IRISH PRESS footnote] 
  [Text] On December 15, the BBC broadcast live the release 
of the Downing Street Declaration. 
  Extended bulletins coincided with one of our lock-up periods 
here, but a large number of us put our names down for the 
canteen, where there is a television, and watched events unfold. 
  Whoever first described the Declaration as a "masterpiece of 
ambiguity" was telling no lie. 
  There was little mistaking the smug tone of John Major in 
the 
Commons later that afternoon, when he interpreted the 
Declaration as meaning: 
  "No" to united Ireland, or to the value of achieving a 
United 
Ireland. 
  "No" to joint authority 
  "No" to any change in the Unionist veto. 
  Later, his Government's pro-Unionist bias became even more 
evident when he said: "I have gone to great trouble to ensure 
that the constitutional guarantee is firmly enshrined in the 
joint declaration. 
  "So there can be no doubt that those people who care about 
the Union -- and we are primarily concerned about the people in 
Northern Ireland who care about the Union -- shall have it 
within their own hands, with the full support of the government, 
to remain within the Union for so long as that is their wish." 
  You might think that people serving 25 to 35 years' 
imprisonment would be clutching at every straw, would have been 
reduced to a measure of desperation by the vicissitudes of a 
long, hard, unprecedented and seemingly endless struggle. 
  Not so. 
  Sacrifices have been made, are being made and will continue 
to be made until the conditions for a peace are at least 
approximated. 
  The problem does not lie in the 26 counties. While Albert 
Reynolds is perceived as more sincere and committed than any 
other Taoiseach in the past 25 years, and although he is a 
co-signatory to the Declaration, the fact remains that it is the 
British who exercise power and control over the North -- and 
appear not to be prepared to relinquish or share it. 
  It is the British whom we do not trust. 
  I remember a written British declaration to the Blanket-men 
in December, 1980, offering them peace and progress in this jail 
if they would only end the hunger strike. But when that hunger 
strike was ended, Britain reneged on its declaration and put the 
boot in. 
  The result was the second hunger strike, 10 men dead and 
scores of others killed on the streets. My analogy is that 
acceptance of the Declaration -- about which we do not have all 
the facts -- followed by disillusionment as a result of 
misunderstanding, could put back the hopes for peace. 
  In our contribution to Sinn Fein's Commission for Peace, we 
have said that we realise there will be a crucial stage, "a 
negotiating stage, a time of potential peace and perhaps 
imperfect peace, but a genuine peace, when many of our demands 
may not be met." 
  We have said: "We realise that at such a crucial stage we 
will have to compromise to close gaps, to demonstrate gestures 
of reconciliation, to give assurances and to move the situation 
forward. It is time the British government expressed a similar 
willingness." 
  It appears to have given no ground. In the language of 
"throwing down the gauntlet" and "no quarter" there is no room 
for dissent. 
  It threatens increased repression if we reject the 
Declaration. It refuses to clarify. 
  Are these the actions of a party interested in making peace? 
  Northern Editor Anne Cadwallader writes: Danny Morrison, one 
of the leading political strategists in Sinn Fein over the past 
20 years, is serving an eight-year sentence for false 
imprisonment. 
  In this article, detailing his response to the Declaration, 
he quotes for the first time from the prisoners' submission to 
the Sinn Fein Peace Commission and provides a unique insight 
into party thinking, both inside and outside the Maze [prison]. 
  In the 10 weeks since the Declaration was signed, the 
prisoners have been debating their response, one that will be 
carefully studied by their republican colleagues outside and by 
the two governments. Significantly, as Morrison reveals, the 
prisoners' submission to the Peace Commission refers to the need 
for "compromise," and indicates that Sinn Fein might need to 
accept an "imperfect peace" in the short term. 
  His comments that the republican movement will need to move 
to "close gaps" and make "gestures of reconciliation" is the 
type of language that will be welcomed by the government.
