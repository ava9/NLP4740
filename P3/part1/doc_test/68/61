  [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- Hungary's new Parliament 
ended its first session today. The next plenary session will 
take place next week. 
  On behalf of the outgoing government, Prime Minister Peter 
Boross greeted the new National Assembly and the new 
parliamentary officials. 
  The acting prime minister gave a short summary of the 
governing coalition's activities over the past four years. 
  Boross pointed out that Hungary has become a genuinely 
independent, sovereign country, both in political and economic 
terms, while, simultaneously, the institutions of parliamentary 
democracy and rule of law have been established. The political 
stability marking the past few years as well as the recent 
elections have proven the viability of this new, deeply-rooted 
system of institutions, he said. 
  Concerning the transformation of the country's economic 
structure, Boross recalled that the establishment of a market 
economy started in the absence of both of the main components; 
namely, proprietors and capital. 
  Addressing foreign-policy issues, Boross said that after 
four 
decades of isolation, Hungary not only found 70 percent of its 
markets in the advanced industrial states, it also got involved 
in the work of the Council of Europe, the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Parliament, and it 
signed an association agreement with the European Union. 
  The acting prime minister stressed that his government never 
forgot about the ethnic Hungarian communities abroad, which it 
always considered to be an integral part of the nation. 
  In conclusion, Boross announced that, in keeping with the 
constitution, the mandate of his government has now expired. 
From now until the formation of the new government, the 
outgoing government will operate as a caretaker government with 
limited powers, he said. 
  The deputies resolved to put two joint proposals by Prime 
Minister Designate Gyula Horn and Deputy Prime Minister 
Designate Gabor Kuncze on the agenda and label them "urgent." 
The first proposal is to amend the list of ministries of the 
Republic of Hungary, as the new government wishes to dissolve 
the Ministry of International Economic Relations. The second 
proposal is to amend the law on the legal status of mayors in 
such a way that holding the post of mayor should no longer be 
incompatible with also being a deputy. 
  Speaker Zoltan Gal said that Jozsef Torgyan, parliamentary 
leader of the Independent Smallholders' Party, proposed that 
Parliament should set up committees to investigate both the 
explosion that destroyed a door of the Parliament building on 
June 11, and the brutal police action that followed the recent 
soccer cup final between the teams of Kispest-Honved and 
Ferencvaros. The proposal can be put on the agenda only if 
Torgyan presents 78 supporting signatures for it, Gal said. 
  The Speaker said Acting Prime Minister Peter Boross informed 
him that the current government withdraws all its proposals 
presented to, but not yet discussed by, Parliament, with the 
exception of reports and information materials. The prime 
minister added that he is responding to the request by the 
chairmen of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of 
Free Democrats with this step. 
  Gal announced that, in keeping with the constitution, he has 
called for a special session of Parliament on July 4-5, to make 
decisions on the proposals labelled "urgent." 
  At the end of the founding session, the recording secretary 
of Parliament read out a letter by Boross to the Speaker in 
which the acting prime minister announced that, after 
coordination with the parliamentary parties and an agreement 
with the new governing parties, he proposes that the President 
of the Republic should relieve Hungarian Television Deputy 
President Gabor Nahlik and Hungarian Radio Deputy President 
Laszlo Csucs of their post.
