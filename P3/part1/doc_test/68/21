Crisis engulfed China on Thursday as the nation's leaders appeared split over 
whether to use the army to put down massive demonstrations demanding that 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping step down. 
</P>
<P>
Reports circulated among some Chinese officials and Communist Party members 
that commanders of the elite 38th Army have refused orders to move into Beijing 
and that other generals also refused to move troops. Some army units, however, 
were said to have begun heading toward the capital from outlying regions. 
</P>
<P>
The 38th Army, stationed about 100 miles southwest of Beijing, is reputed to be 
one of China's best-trained and most reliable units. Some soldiers from the 
38th were moved to Beijing late last month when authorities were trying to 
control large-scale student marches. 
</P>
<P>
Central Beijing was the scene of a second day of mass protest Thursday as 
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators -- some estimates placed the total at 1 
million -- gathered in and near Tian An Men Square. Slogans were broadly aimed 
against the entire leadership but also focused with growing intensity on the 
84-year-old Deng. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn this morning, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, 
looking somber and tired, appeared at the square to speak with pro-democracy 
students who have been on a hunger strike since Saturday, and he pleaded with 
them to end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We were too late coming. I'm sorry," Zhao said in a seven-minute speech later 
broadcast on state-run television. "Your criticism of us is justified. I'm not 
here to ask your forgiveness. I'm just saying that your bodies have become very 
weak. Your hunger strike is already in its seventh day. Things can't go on like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleads With Students 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who was accompanied by Premier Li Peng, said that "the situation in 
Beijing can't go on like this" and pleaded with the students to "understand 
what a serious point you've brought things to." He promised that government and 
party leaders would continue to listen to the students' views even after they 
end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao's comments were made in the security of one of about 150 buses parked in 
the square to provide demonstrators with shelter from thunderstorms. Students 
on the bus appeared to react favorably to Zhao's speech and seemed happy to get 
his autograph. But students in the square later said that a large majority of 
the protesters were not satisfied and would continue their demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"This talk by Zhao Ziyang is the same as the three recent discussions they've 
had with students," said one protester. "They're cheating us all the time. 
They're not sincere, and they're doing as little as they can. They have to come 
see us -- that's the least they can do. They're not doing any more than they 
have to. These little talks do not solve problems, and they are not a real 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
In one of these earlier talks, Premier Li, who has been one of the key targets 
of criticism, spoke Thursday with 12 protest leaders, telling them that 
"disorder has now occurred in Beijing and spread to the whole country." He also 
appealed unsuccessfully to the students to end their protest. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the day Thursday, open-backed trucks raced through Beijing, 
horns blaring, carrying workers with banners that criticized Deng and 
proclaimed support for the 2,000 or so hunger-striking students still in Tian 
An Men Square. More than 1,000 hunger strikers have been taken away for 
treatment, medical workers say, but some have returned to the square after 
partially recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"Victory Is Within Sight," declared one banner on a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, widely viewed as the most enthusiastic advocate of rapid reform among 
China's top leaders, continued to be spared specific criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Many protesters said Thursday that their actions might help Zhao consolidate 
power as Deng's successor, but these same people denied having any enthusiasm 
for him. A group of half a dozen students interviewed in Tian An Men Square 
said the key goal of the demonstrations is to force elderly and hard-line 
orthodox leaders from power and place the government in the hands of "the 
reform faction" headed by Zhao. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just choosing the lesser of two evils," one of the students said. "We 
aren't supporting or opposing Zhao Ziyang. We still haven't expressed an 
opinion about him." 
</P>
<P>
In his 50-minute meeting with student leaders, held in the Great Hall of the 
People and broadcast later over government television, Li appeared to hint at a 
possible crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of the People's Republic of China is responsible for the whole 
nation," Li said. "We have the duty to safeguard the students' lives, 
factories, the fruits of socialism and our capital." 
</P>
<P>
Li suggested to the student leaders that "all hunger strikers be hospitalized 
right now, without waiting until they are critically ill," according to the New 
China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The students should leave the square without preconditions," Li continued. 
"Tell them to leave the square." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently angered, one of the student leaders, 21-year-old Wuer Kaixi, 
retorted: "Whether we leave the square or not is not ours to decide. The 
responsibility is on the government side." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting then collapsed when one student leader told Li, "This is not a 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Party leader Zhao, since first making a conciliatory statement toward the 
students on May 4, has taken the lead in promoting a soft approach toward the 
pro-democracy demonstrations, which began in mid-April. He has repeatedly 
stated that the students are patriotic and that many of their goals, such as 
political reform, more funding of education and an end to official corruption, 
conform with what the Communist Party itself wants to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday evening national television news program showed pre-dawn visits to 
hospitalized hunger strikers by Zhao, Li and two other members of the 
Politburo's Standing Committee, Hu Qili and Qiao Shi. 
</P>
<P>
"Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng and the other leaders affirmed the enthusiastic 
patriotism of the students," the television news reported. "They said that the 
zeal of the students to demand democracy and the rule of law, oppose corruption 
and push forward reform is very commendable." 
</P>
<P>
The newscast quoted Zhao as stating that "the goals of the Communist Party and 
the government are the same as those of the students -- there is no basic 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
"There are various methods we can use to share our thoughts and solve 
problems," Zhao said. "There's no need to use the method of a hunger strike. 
You're still very young, you still have a lot of time to make contributions to 
the nation. You should take care of your health." 
</P>
<P>
Li, in his later talk with students, declared: "The situation will not develop 
as you wish and expect, even though you have patriotic zeal. . . . I do not 
intend to blame the students for all the turmoil. But I hope you will think 
over what the final consequences might be should the situation worsen." 
</P>
<P>
Support for the student demonstrators, who remain at the core of the protest, 
has come from broad sectors of society in the last few days, including 
employees of many mainstream organizations controlled by the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, official newspaper of the Communist Party, reported that 
more than 1,000 of its own employees had marched in Wednesday's demonstrations, 
with some high-ranking editors and reporters marching in front.
