Here are excerpts, translated by the official New China News Agency, from a 
speech by Premier Li Peng about the student demonstrations: 
</P>
<P>
The capital is in a critical situation. The anarchic state is going from bad to 
worse, and law and discipline are being violated. 
</P>
<P>
More and more students and other people were involved in demonstrations and 
many colleges and universities had come to a standstill. Traffic jams took 
place everywhere, the party and government offices were affected and public 
security was deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
Some activities on the agenda of the Sino-Soviet summit that attracted 
worldwide attention had to be canceled, greatly damaging China's international 
image and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a handful of persons are using the hunger strikers as "hostages" to 
coerce and force the party and the government to yield to their political 
demands. In this regard, they have no iota of humanism. The party and the 
government have on one hand taken every possible measure to treat and rescue 
the fasting students. On the other hand, they have held several dialogues with 
representatives of the fasting students and have earnestly promised to continue 
to listen to their opinions in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Beijing is still worsening, and has already affected many 
other cities in the country. In places, the number of demonstrators and 
protesters is increasing. In some places, there have occurred many incidents in 
which people broke into local party and government organs, along with beating, 
smashing, looting, burnings and other undermining activities that seriously 
violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
All these have shown that this will lead to a nationwide turmoil if no quick 
action is taken to turn and stabilize the situation. The nation's reforms and 
opening to the outside world, and the fate and future of the People's Republic 
are facing serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
The party and government have pointed out time and again that the students are 
kind-hearted and they do not want to create turmoil. Instead, these patriotic 
students hope to promote democracy and overcome corruption, and this is in line 
with the goals the party and government have strived to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Now it has become more and more clear that the very few people who attempt to 
create turmoil want to reach their political goals -- negating the leadership 
of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system and violating the 
democratic and legal channels. They spread rumors and smear and hurt party and 
government leaders. They concentrate their attack on Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who 
has made great contributions to China's opening to the outside world. . . . 
Their purpose is to overthrow the people's government elected by the National 
People's Congress and totally negate the people's democratic dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances we are forced to take resolute and decisive measures 
to put an end to the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
I urgently appeal on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council: 
</P>
<P>
To those students now on hunger strike in Tian An Men Square to end the fasting 
immediately, leave the square, receive medical treatment and recover their 
health as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
To students and people in all walks of life to immediately stop all 
demonstrations and give no more so-called support to the fasting students in 
the interest of humanitarianism. Whatever the intent, further "support" will 
push the fasting students to desperation. 
</P>
<P>
I now call on the whole party, the whole army and the whole nation to make 
concerted efforts and act immediately at all posts so as to stop the turmoil 
and stabilize the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Comrades, our party is a party in power and our government, a people's 
government. To be responsible to our sacred motherland and to the entire 
Chinese people, we must adopt firm and resolute measures to end the turmoil 
swiftly, maintain the leadership of the party as well as the socialist system. 
</P>
<P>
We also hope the people in the capital will fully support the People's 
Liberation Army, police and armed police in their efforts to maintain order in 
the capital.
