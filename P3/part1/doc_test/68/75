  [Text] Bangkok, May 16 KYODO -- A Thai political activist 
vowed Monday [16 May] to go on a hunger strike to pressure the 
government to make further steps toward enacting true democracy 
in Thailand. 
  Chalat Worachat [spelling of name as received], 51, told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE he was determined to start a hunger strike on 
May 25 and would not stop until the government starts the 
process of writing a new constitution stipulating direct 
elections for provincial governors and members of municipal 
councils, or resign or dissolve the House of Representatives. 
  Chalat went on a hunger strike two years ago which triggered 
a mass protest that led to a bloody political crackdown in May 
1992. The then military-dominated government was toppled after 
dozens of people were killed or went missing during the Army's 
suppression. 
  "I'll go on the fast to continue the cause of my struggle 
two 
years ago," Chalat said. He fasted for 47 days in 1992 and 
stopped on may 24 after the resignation of the then Premier Gen. 
Suchinda Kraphrayun. 
  Chalat, serving his second term as an elected member of 
Parliament, has gone on four hunger strikes during the past 10 
years and has been on a lone demonstration in front of 
Parliament since April 8. 
  Chalat made public his decision to go on a hunger strike 
last 
week, prompting a number of politicians and political activists 
to try to dissuade him. 
  A group of leading politicians and academics, led by 
Chamlong 
Simuang and two rectors of leading universities, met Monday and 
issued a resolution calling on Chalat to postpone his hunger 
strike. They said the four-point demands he is making need more 
time and that his hunger strike might trigger another political 
upheaval in the country. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai warned Sunday against 
unrealistic demands when he laid a wreath in remembrance of 
victims of the may 1992 uprising. He called on Thais to respect 
the principles of democracy and avoid repetition of the 1992 
unrest. 
  The present five-party coalition government, derived from an 
election after the upheaval, has been widely criticized by 
pro-democracy forces of inadequacy in moving the country forward 
on a democratic path. The government's attempt to amend the 
constitution was defeated in Parliament in March.
