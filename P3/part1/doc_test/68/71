  [Text] Hanoi, May 26 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Thursday that 
a leading political dissident was on a hunger strike to protest 
harsh prison treatment. The US Human Rights/Asia Watch 
organisation said Tuesday that professor Doan Viet Hoat went 
began a hunger strike in April after being put in chains at a 
reeducation camp in northern Vietnam for refusing forced labour. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that Hoat was not 
on hunger strike, had not been forced to work and had not been 
treated any differently than other prisoners. But the spokesman 
confirmed that Hoat, former vice-rector of the Van Anh Buddhist 
University, had been transferred to another prison camp closer 
to the Laos border. 
  "This is a normal transfer under Vietnamese law," he told 
AFP. But Asia Watch maintains that the camp, Thanh Cam, is for 
hardened criminals. 
  Hoat, who suffers from serious kidney problems, was being 
held in Ba Sao prison camp, south of Hanoi, before his transfer. 
Asia Watch expressed concern for his health since he had been 
put in chains. It also said Hoat's wife had been refused 
permission to see him. 
  The spokesman said the reports were untrue and maintained 
that Hoat was in normal health. Hoat was jailed for 15 years in 
July 1993 for activities "violating Vietnam's penal code." 
  On Tuesday, Hanoi denied reports that four Buddhist monks, 
jailed following violent incidents in Hue a year ago, were on 
hunger strike at a reeducation camp in the southwest.
