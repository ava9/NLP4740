  [Text] The free Trade Unions of the Romanian Radio and 
Television has sent us the following communique: 
  Taking into consideration the decision of the Romanian 
Government by which Mr. Paul Everac was released from his office 
as general director of the Romanian Television, as well as the 
pledges assumed by the Deputy Speaker of Romania's Parliament 
Dan Martian, promising that the bill on the organization and 
functioning of the Romanian radio and television societies will 
be debated in parliament in emergency procedures beginning with 
1 February 1994 [beginning of the ordinary session of 
parliament], the Free Trade Unions of the Romanian Radio and 
Television declare the following things: 
  1. The protest action by staging a hunger strike of 
[television union head] Dumitru Iuga is suspended, effective 
immediately. 
  2. The non-observance of the pledges assumed by the chamber 
of deputies, as well as any attempts to stall the passing of the 
aforementioned bill will trigger an amplified resumption of the 
protest actions. 
  The communique is signed by Dumitru Iuga, the chairman of 
the 
Free Trade Unions of the Romanian Radio and Television.
