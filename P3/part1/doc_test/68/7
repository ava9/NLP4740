  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 25 Apr -- The hunger strike that was 
maintained for two weeks in the center of the Mongolian capital 
by representatives of opposition parties calling for the 
government's resignation ended today. This development follows 
Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray's refusal to sign 
with the activists the document they had insisted upon. At his 
meeting with the hunger strikers he justified his refusal by 
saying that neither the country's Constitution nor the law on 
government contained any provisions about prior conclusion of 
agreements with individuals or organizations on the resignation 
of the cabinet of ministers. 
  The prime minister urged the hunger strikers to respect the 
stand taken by the president, the recommendations brought by the 
National Security Council, and the decision passed by 
parliament, who all asked them to end their action. 
  At the same time the government pledged to take into 
consideration a number of demands issued by the hunger strikers. 
Laws on press freedom and on the struggle against corruption are 
to be drafted in the near future.
