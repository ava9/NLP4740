CIVIL rights activist the Rev Jesse Jackson yesterday urged President Bill
Clinton to end the crisis over Aids-infected Haitians quarantined at a US
Navy base, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Jackson is on hunger strike in sympathy with 267 Haitians infected with
the HIV virus that causes Aids who are quarantined at the US naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
'Mr Clinton's policy on Haiti is a sound one - restore democracy, return
(exiled Haitian President Jean Bertrand) Aristide, but delaying becomes
denial,' Mr Jackson said.
'There must be a sense of urgency about restoring democracy because if you
restore democracy quickly then you end the crisis around Guantanamo Bay and
the embargo (against Haiti) and the blockade, as well as the mass exodus'
from Haiti, he said on US television.
Mr Jackson said he would continue his hunger strike for at least this week
and might try to enlist more hunger strikers unless there is action on the
Haitian situation.
'It's a kind of leprosy island, and there they are desperate, they're in the
dark and they're dying,' he said.
He called on Clinton to address the Haiti situation in his speech tonight
before a joint session of Congress.
Mr Clinton has said he wants to lift the immigration prohibitions preventing
people with Aids from entering the US, but has taken no action.
Overall, Clinton has in effect adopted former President George Bush's policy
on Haiti to return fleeing Haitians to their island homeland but he has sent
emissaries there to try to restore democracy.
