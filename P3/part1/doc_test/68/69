<TEXT>
<P>
Janos Kadar, who was installed by the Kremlin to suppress the Hungarian 
revolution in 1956 and presided over the Communist regime in Budapest for 32 
years, died Thursday at the age of 77. 
</P>
<P>
His death, in a Budapest hospital of pneumonia and the complications of old 
age, came 14 months after he was ousted as party leader and a few weeks after 
he was stripped of his last -- and largely ceremonial -- post as party 
president. His passing marks the end of a political era in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid decline in Kadar's health coincided with a period of equally swift 
political change, which has seen the Kadar period come under increasingly harsh 
criticism as the country prepares for its first free parliamentary elections, 
likely to be held next spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of Nagy Controversy 
</P>
<P>
In a watershed event last month, former Premier Imre Nagy, who was executed as 
a traitor in 1958 for his actions during the revolution, was reburied as a 
national hero in a solemn daylong ceremony. It was Kadar, in charge of the 
country during the show trial that convicted Nagy, who approved the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The period following the revolution is described by most Hungarians as one of 
the darkest periods of the nation's history, and Kadar's name is indelibly 
linked with the trials and executions of hundreds of others who were convicted 
of "counterrevolutionary" activities for participating in the revolt, finally 
crushed in two days by a Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, Kadar's regime mellowed somewhat, and Hungary, under 
his leadership, was one of the first countries in the Soviet Bloc to take steps 
toward economic liberalization. Kadar was also far more tolerant of political 
dissent than the hard-line leaders who ruled neighboring Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
With what could be regarded as some cleverness, he initiated some of the most 
significant changes at times when the leaders of the Soviet Union were largely 
preoccupied with upheavals in other sections of their East European empire. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, when attention was focused on the turmoil in Czechoslovakia, Kadar 
introduced a plan that encouraged the development of cooperative enterprises, 
an initial step toward creating small private businesses, and urged Hungarians 
to take second jobs in the so-called second economy. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980-81, when Soviet attention was fixed on the worsening crisis of the 
Solidarity movement in Poland, Kadar took further steps at economic 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
These moves were dubbed, with some derision, "goulash communism," but they 
presaged by more than 15 years some of the same economic reforms that would be 
initiated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Innovations 
</P>
<P>
It was partly Kadar's economic innovations -- helped by foreign borrowing that 
has left Hungary with an $18-billion debt, the largest per capita in the Soviet 
Bloc -- that brought Hungary the highest standard of living in Communist 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, however, Hungary's economy began to run into problems, 
largely because of what many economists regarded as the irreconcilable conflict 
between Communist central planning and the steady pressure of an emerging 
free-market system. The result has been large price increases, inflation that 
has reached 18% and austerity measures. Increasingly, younger party leaders 
spoke of Kadar as an obstacle to continued change. 
</P>
<P>
Although criticism of the Kadar period -- particularly the early years of his 
regime -- had increased sharply in recent months, many Hungarian political 
figures credit Kadar's leadership with paving the way for the current crop of 
reformers who have risen to prominence in the Hungarian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's tolerance of a certain level of dissent among opposition groups and 
within the party itself helped give rise to the forces that toppled him in May, 
1988, when Karoly Grosz, once regarded as a Kadar protege, orchestrated a 
special party conference, took over as party leader and shunted Kadar aside to 
the ceremonial role as party president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failing Health Cited 
</P>
<P>
In April, officials announced that failing health prevented Kadar from 
continuing in the job, and Grosz said in an interview afterward that the former 
leader was relieved because he was "sometimes not in control of his thoughts or 
his actions." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Grosz made those comments, his own leadership was under severe attack 
by party liberals, eager to show the party's commitment to reform before it is 
faced with the challenge of open elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
In a Central Committee meeting on June 24, Grosz found himself isolated as a 
centrist between party hard-liners and reformers. The reformers, with the 
numerical advantage and the Communist equivalent of "political momentum" on 
their side, elected veteran reform leader Reszo Nyers as party chairman. A 
four-man Presidium that includes Grosz, Nyers, Premier Miklos Nemeth and 
Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, will run the party. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its immediate fortunes, the party today and the climate in which it 
exists is remote from the one Kadar inherited in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined Party in 1932 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, his career was typical of figures who rose to prominence in the 
aftermath of the Stalinist period in Eastern Europe. He had joined the party in 
1931 and was jailed for three years for its illegal activities, but he was 
appointed to the party's Central Committee in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
After the war and the Communist takeover, he was interior minister -- and thus 
head of the police apparatus -- in the hard-line regime of Matyas Rakosi, who 
had him jailed in 1951 on charges of spying, treason and following the line of 
Josip Broz Tito, the Yugoslav leader who broke with Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar was released after two years, and when the Hungarian revolt broke out in 
October, 1956,Kadar was called on by the Soviets to take over the government 
from Imre Nagy, who held power for 13 days at the height of the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's hand in the turmoil and violence surrounding the revolution has never 
been made clear, but it is generally thought that it was he who summoned the 
Soviet tanks into Budapest on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the stain of the Nagy trial and execution for which many Hungarians 
have never been able to excuse Kadar, and the recent attacks on his rule as 
well as the ceremonial reburial of Nagy last month were said to have caused the 
former leader great pain. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published earlier this year, Kadar seemed to acknowledge the 
public's view of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nagy's tragedy is my own personal tragedy as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Kadar are scheduled for July 13, after the conclusion of 
President Bush's visit to Hungary next week.
