In the glare of TV lights, Parliament on Wednesday adopted a series of 
constitutional amendments declaring Hungary a republic and marking the nation's 
dramatic return to a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in a nationally televised session voted 333 to 5, with eight 
abstentions, to accept nearly 100 modifications to the 1949 constitution drawn 
up after the Communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The vote formally ends one-party domination in the East Bloc nation, which was 
officially renamed the Republic of Hungary. Like other East Bloc nations, it 
had defined itself as a people's republic in which all power belonged to the 
workers and the Communist Party was the leading force. 
</P>
<P>
Under the modified constitution, Hungary will become an independent, democratic 
and constitutional republic asserting "the values of both bourgeois democracy 
and democratic socialism," according to Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the changes, affecting 90% of the old constitution, could be seen 
as creating a "transitional constitution" to change Hungary's political system. 
</P>
<P>
The new constitution not only sets the constitutional basis for the multi-party 
system but also codifies human and civil rights and separates the judiciary, 
executive and legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's first multi-party parliamentary elections since 1947 are due to take 
place by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating all references to the 
leading role of the recently dissolved Hungarian Socialist Workers' (Communist) 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Political parties may be freely established and may freely function," the 
amendment declared. 
</P>
<P>
An entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted by the new 
Parliament after the national elections, but Justice Minister Kulcsar has said 
the amendments are necessary to make next year's elections legal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they abolish the 21-member collective presidential council headed 
by Bruno Straub, nominally head of state, which had broad powers, including 
acting for Parliament when it was not sitting, as well as overruling 
parliamentary decisions. In its place, a new post of president of the republic 
has been created. This role will be filled by Speaker of Parliament Matyas 
Szuros until a presidential election takes place, tentatively scheduled for 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Szuros proclaimed Wednesday a historic day for Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"A parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built in Hungary on the 
ruins of a dictatorship of sorts," he told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new amendments, the new president will be the commander in chief of 
the armed forces, is authorized to call national and regional elections, may 
initiate a referendum but may not be a leader of any political party. 
</P>
<P>
The president may dissolve Parliament if it fails to approve a new government 
or votes for no-confidence in the government four times in one year. 
</P>
<P>
A completely new constitution will be drafted by Parliament after the 
multi-party elections, which the must be held by next summer according to the 
amendments adopted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy, postponing a 
decision on opposition calls for a referendum on when to elect the head of 
state. Government leaders want the election next month, but opposition leaders 
say it's too soon. 
</P>
<P>
The voting came on the heels of another landmark decision -- the dissolution of 
the Communist Party and its replacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party, which 
has vowed commitment to a democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
Before the key votes, Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth called an emergency Cabinet 
meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone the election to the new 
state presidency until after next year's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties say they have no time or resources to organize against 
Socialist Party candidate Imre Pozsgay. Banking on an overall opposition 
majority after next year's elections, they want the president to be appointed 
by the new Parliament.
