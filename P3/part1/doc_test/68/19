  [Text] Viktor Luchin has been reinstated as a 
Constitutional Court (CC) justice and ended his hunger strike. 
  "I do not feel triumphant," he told Interfax Friday morning 
[14 January]. "The justices acted as professionals." He said 
that the court members reinstated him in a nine to four vote by 
secret ballot. 
  Luchin went on a hunger strike Tuesday demanding a vote on 
his membership which was suspended on December 1 because of his 
alleged political activities. 
  A CC source told Interfax that in a seven to six vote by 
show 
of hands the court had put off consideration of reinstating 
Valery Zorkin. 
  The source believes that by reinstating Luchin the CC 
justices "disavowed the presidential decree advising that the 
seats occupied by Luchin and Zorkin should be regarded vacant."
