The House on Thursday attempted to reward Hungary's democratic reforms by 
voting to grant the Communist nation most-favored-nation status for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was adopted on a 221 to 169 roll-call vote despite Republican 
protests that it would hamper President Bush's conduct of foreign policy. The 
bill's prospects for passage in the Senate are considered good. 
</P>
<P>
It would extend for three years U.S. government credits and loan guarantees and 
continue until 1992 the lower tariffs on imports from Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has enjoyed most-favored status since 1978 by presidential decrees. The 
House action thus was largely a symbolic reward for Hungary's dramatic shift 
away from Soviet-influenced Communist rule and toward a Western-oriented 
economic and political system. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a historic surge toward freedom," said California Rep. Tom 
Lantos (D-San Mateo), who was born in Budapest. "Americans should be rejoicing 
that our values are sweeping through Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But foes of the bill, such as Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Ill.), argued that 
Hungary is still under Communist control and influenced by the Warsaw Pact. He 
added: "An open and democratic Hungary is a long way off." 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill came as Hungary hosted thousands of East German refugees 
who crossed the East German-Hungarian border in hopes of receiving asylum in 
West Germany. The decision to tear down barbed wire on Hungary's border with 
Austria -- literally tearing down the Iron Curtain -- also figured in the House 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The symbolism of the action was diminished, however, by the sizable 
Republican-led opposition. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Budapest last spring, Bush promised to grant Hungary 
permanent most-favored status -- putting it on a par with nearly all of 
America's other trading partners -- if its Parliament approved a series of 
measures dealing with immigration and other reforms at a coming session. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Hungary, the only Communist governments to gain most-favored status 
have been Romania, from 1975 to 1988, and China, from 1980 to the present. 
</P>
<P>
Although some members argued for continuing the annual presidential extensions 
of most-favored status to Hungary, most argued that the Hungarians deserve a 
reward that would encourage other East Bloc nations to follow their lead.
