  [Text] President Sanchez de Lozada last night confirmed the 
police action against the main group of hunger strikers, and 
warned that the government will no longer negotiate with the COB 
[Bolivian Labor Federation] if pressure measures continue. 
  During a phone conversation with the HATA news agency, 
Sanchez de Lozada said the government is determined not to 
negotiate under any form of pressure. We can immediately hold 
negotiations as proposed by COB leaders but without pressure. He 
said this shortly after police forces entered COB's La Paz 
headquarters and took to the police clinic -- other report 
mentions the (Dengel) clinic, which we will confirm in the next 
few minutes -- the six hunger strikers, including the three La 
Paz teachers led by Wilma Plata. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: We adopted this decision because we 
cannot let them die. This is an intolerable situation and we 
have the mission to preserve the life and health of the 
citizens, in keeping with the Constitution. 
  He said the police action was carried out against the hunger 
strikers at COB headquarters because they were facing the most 
critical situation. He added that the government will take a 
firm stand tonight and will not allow the COB and peasant 
federation to carry out the roadblocks scheduled to begin on 28 
April. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: We will not tolerate any roadblocks. 
We will take firm and responsible actions. He urged workers 
leaders to give up their intransigent attitude and hold 
negotiations. 
  During a news conference in La Paz at 2330 last night, the 
government confirmed the police operation and issued a 
communique, the main topics of which are: 
  1) The six hunger strikers were taken to a local clinic 
following a judge's order. This measure was adopted to protect 
their lives. 
  2) The government as always is willing to continue holding 
negotiations with the COB in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding. To this end all forms of pressure must be lifted. 
  During the news conference, Social Communications Minister 
Ernesto Machicado, Justice Minister Rene Blattman, and Labor 
Minister Reynaldo Peters pointed out that government officials 
only seek to preserve the citizens' lives and [words indistinct] 
in Bolivian territory. 
  Blattman said: The government has termed it absolutely 
necessary to protect the human being, the health and security of 
people. We took action in the face of a true emergency situation. 
  Peters stressed the need to lift all forms of pressure to 
allow negotiations between the COB and the government. We think 
COB leaders must reflect and bear in mind higher interests. We 
can create true conditions for peace in Bolivia only under 
democracy and with lives placed at the interest of the Republic. 
  He said the government has no official information on a 
Catholic Church initiative in the situation. 
  As for the 27 people arrested during the violent 
demonstration staged on 22 April, the ministers said they will 
be placed at the disposal of the court on charges of aggression 
and robbery. 
  The ministers stated that this is not a form of pressure. It 
was adopted to preserve people's security and prevent attacks 
against their property. 
  They regretted the COB's demand to release them because a 
crime must be punished in compliance with the law. They 
concluded by saying the government is firmly determined to 
guarantee social peace.
