A group of 25 people protesting the actions of the South Korean government 
ended a four-day hunger strike Wednesday at a South-Central Los Angeles church. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who ranged from students and businessmen to ministers and a 
12-year-old girl, began their fast Sunday to coincide with a hunger strike 
begun a day earlier by a young South Korean woman. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a 20-year-old college student named Im Suk Yong, was denied 
permission to return to her country after visiting North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Her local supporters held their protest at the Good Samaritan United 
Presbyterian Church on Adams Boulevard. The demonstration was one of five 
hunger strikes held by Korean Americans in various cities. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's fast in North Korea drew attention in Los Angeles -- which is home 
to more than 200,000 Korean immigrants -- to the emotionally charged issue of 
the reunification of communist North Korea and its capitalist neighbor to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
"To Koreans, the matter of reunification is the number one concern," said Noh 
Kil-nam, president of the Los Angeles-based Korea Study Council, a sponsor of 
the hunger strike. "It's a very hot issue with not only Koreans in Korea, but 
Korean residents in Japan, the U.S. and in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The original fast overseas began after the South Korean government issued a 
directive prohibiting Im from crossing the demilitarized zone that divides 
North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
She had attended a banned youth festival last month in the North Korean capital 
of Pyongyang. As a symbol of openness between the two Koreas, Im intended to 
return home by walking through Panmunjom, the village separating the north and 
south, but she was stopped by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government, claiming that she had violated its national 
security laws by the visiting the north, would not allow her to pass through 
the zone. 
</P>
<P>
In protest, Im last week launched a fast and her cause was soon taken up by 
Koreans in various countries. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, however, called off her fast Wednesday, stating that she had 
"won a great victory" and that she would continue to struggle for reunification 
and her return to the south. 
</P>
<P>
"Support for reunification is widespread," said Yuk Dae Sung, a Los Angeles 
student who took part in the hunger strike here. Yuk told a press conference 
that he met Im at the North Korean youth festival last month, and he held up 
photographs showing Im surrounded by a large group of students. 
</P>
<P>
Yuk said Koreans do not dispute that reunification is their primary issue. "How 
to achieve it is the important matter," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A local Korean minister agreed that the reunification issue is of prime 
importance to his community, but disputed the methods of Im and other student 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what is reality, or what is propaganda, when governments talk," 
said Mark Song Matsumura. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost 99% of Korean immigrants feel Im Suk Yong is wrong," he said. "Korean 
Americans say she is part of a farfetched student outcry for immediate 
reunification. They think she has been pushed into it."
