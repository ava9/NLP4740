<TEXT>
HUNGARY has established a foreign exchange, ending the central bank's
official mono-poly and underpinning progress towards currency
convertibility.
Commercial banks begin foreign exchange trading among themselves this month,
freed of the obligation to sell hard currency to the state and to stick
precisely to the official exchange rate. With liberalisation, the banks have
also gained the right to make forward and swap deals.
However, the new interbank foreign exchange market exists within tight
contraints.
Exchange rate movements are restricted to within a narrow band of 0.25 per
cent either side of a fixed central rate. This may later broaden to 2.25 per
cent.
