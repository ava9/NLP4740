Mongolia's opposition groups negotiated with the government Saturday on 
arrangements for a referendum to gauge public approval of the country's 
parliament, the Great Hural. 
</P>
<P>
The talks took place a day after an opposition hunger strike ended when 
Communist Party leaders agreed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Damdindorj Ninj, who leads one of the four opposition groups pushing for a 
multi-party democracy, said he is confident that the country's leaders will 
follow through on their promises. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our victory," Ninj was quoted as saying. "I'm very hopeful the 
government will keep its promises." 
</P>
<P>
The leadership pledged Friday to hold an extra congress in April to change 
Communist Party rules and elect new party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to hold a referendum to give the people an opportunity to say 
whether they have confidence in the Great Hural. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that both the opposition and the government will meet to draft a 
new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Ninj and 28 other protesters took part in a three-day hunger strike in 
Sukhbator Square in the center of the capital, Ulan Bator, to demand the 
resignations of President Jambyn Batmonh and the rest of the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh announced on television and radio Friday night that the entire 
Politburo will resign at a special plenum session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
National television also broadcast live talks between two ranking officials and 
representatives of the opposition groups Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the news broke that the leadership would resign, the hunger strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
"People were hugging each other for joy and shouting hurray," one resident 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike proved to be a very powerful weapon because Mongolians were 
horrified at the spectacle of the hunger strikers, who carried on despite 
subzero temperatures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of Ulan Bator were quiet Saturday, and workers called off a general 
strike.
