</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months after he decided to give up his fight to remain in the United States 
and accept deportation, Orlando Bosch, the Cuban-born anti-Castro pediatrician 
the U.S. government calls a terrorist, remains locked up here in a federal 
prison. A State Department source said Monday efforts continue to find a 
country willing to take Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
But Bosch's daughter maintains that U.S. officials are lying. "They're not 
looking for any place to send him," said Myriam Bosch. "They're just holding 
him. They just want him to rot in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bosch, 64, is three days into a seven-day hunger strike designed to put the 
U.S. government on notice. If no action is taken within 30 to 60 days after the 
week-long strike ends, he said in a statement released by his daughter, he will 
fast until death. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear he will starve himself to death," said Myriam Bosch. "And if this 
government lets that happen, it will be beyond comprehension. But it's 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Orlando Bosch -- called a patriot by many in Miami's Cuban 
community, and a national security risk by the U.S. Justice Department -- has 
been a 30-year saga here, and in most accounts it's a tale filled with 
intrigue, politics and violence. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Cuba for exile in Miami in 1960, Bosch briefly practiced medicine 
until he was discovered storing explosives in a hospital where he worked. After 
that, he became a full-time anti-Castro activist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968 Bosch was convicted of firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in the 
Miami harbor in what was said to be a protest against that country's trade with 
Cuba. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, he was paroled after four. But he fled 
the United States in 1974 after being subpoenaed to testify in an inquiry into 
the assassination of a controversial exile leader in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Bosch first turned up in Venezuela, and later, in the employ of the Chilean 
secret police. He was back in Venezuala in 1976 when a bomb ripped through a 
Cubana airlines plane, killing 73 people, including several members of the 
Cuban national fencing team. Bosch was charged with being involved in the 
bombing, and although tried three times, he was never convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, after 11 years in Venezuelan jails, he returned to the 
United States and was immediately arrested for parole violation. Last November, 
after a federal court upheld the government's decision to deport him, Bosch 
declined to appeal, saying he would take his chances in a third country. 
Although the United States says he will not be sent to Cuba, Bosch's family has 
long argued that he would be a target of Castro agents anywhere outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Bosch has drawn support from Florida Republicans such as U.S. Sen. 
Connie Mack and U.S. Rep. Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, and within the Cuban community 
people have often taken to the streets to demand he be freed. But his hunger 
strike has attracted little notice -- in part, according to his daughter 
Myriam, "because there are certain leaders in the Cuban community who don't 
want him out; they feel threatened by him." 
</P>
<P>
Myriam Bosch hopes that her father's hunger strike may bring about his release. 
"He's kind of weak," she said. "He has bleeding ulcers, angina, and he should 
be on a special diet. But what's he going to do, rot in jail for not having 
done anything? Frankly, I think the U.S. government has some sort of deal with 
Castro. Why else would they not find a country to take him?"
