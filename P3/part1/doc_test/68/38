<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the feuding Romanian and ethnic Hungarian communities in this 
divided Transylvanian city agreed on some moves Thursday to end tensions that 
resulted in six deaths, hundreds of injured and a wave of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican headed compromise talks between the Hungarian 
Democratic Union and the Vatra Romanesca nationalist movement. 
</P>
<P>
While confrontations in the city's central square continued to flare, the 
Rompres news agency said the Hungarian minority had won a demand for students 
to be educated exclusively in Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
A statement said Vatra Romanesca accepted that the Hungarians, outnumbered four 
to one by Romanians in Transylvania, did not want to separate the northern 
province from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
It said both sides called for an end to political strikes apparently called 
mainly by Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators on Thursday taunted soldiers trying to keep peace between 
Romanian nationalists and ethnic Hungarians. About 1,000 youths approached 
tanks guarding Tirgu Mures' central square, shouting, "Transylvania is 
Romanian" and "We want justice -- no privileges."
