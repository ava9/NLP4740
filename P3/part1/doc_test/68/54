  [Text] During a press conference on Tuesday 
Director-General of the International Kurdish Cultural Center 
Tariel Broyev accused the Russian Government of "terrorism 
against the Kurdish people and of trying to mend the Russian 
economy at the Kurds' expense." 
  To quote Broyev, the Kurds of the Middle East and the CIS 
countries will go on a hunger strike to demand that Russia 
change its policy in relation to the Kurds. 
  Broyev told Interfax that his decision to end a 16-day 
hunger 
strike did not mean that he had given up his campaign. "The 
strike has been terminated at the request of political 
organizations of Kurdistan and the Middle East," he said. 
  On March 15, Broyev went on a hunger strike in protest at 
political and economic pressure put on the Kurdish center and on 
him personally by the Russian Government. Broyev demanded that 
Russia change its attitude to the Kurdish problem and help 
Kurdish refugees in the Middle East and the former Soviet 
republics. 
  Broyev also told Interfax that two attempts had been made on 
his life after he ended the strike. He laid the blame for his 
attempted assassination on the Russian special services. He 
also stated that he would seek political refuge for his family.
