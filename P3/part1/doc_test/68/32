SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Inmate Hunger Strikes. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 4, 1980 (45 FR 23365). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.62 state that staff shall refer to medical staff for evaluation and, when appropriate,
for treatment, an inmate who is observed to be on a hunger strike. These regulations also stipulate that when considered
medically appropriate, medical staff shall place an inmate engaged in a hunger strike in a hospital. Also, when isolation
is necessary to measure food and liquid intake/output, medical staff may place the inmate in a locked hospital or other
medically appropriate room. Paragraph (a) of this section has been amended for editorial clarity and to include a
reference to mental health staff. Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that medical staff shall place an inmate
engaged in a hunger strike in a medically appropriate locked room for close monitoring. The reasons for the revision
to paragraph (b) are both semantic and operational. Some Bureau facilities, identified as Medical Referral Centers,
are the equivalent of hospitals. The remaining Bureau of Prisons facilities more typically include health service
units; these units are not hospitals, although they may be commonly referred to as such. Removing the reference to
a hospital room therefore is more accurate in describing actual practice at typical Bureau facilities. Section 549.63
(d) separately requires that inmates be transferred to Bureau Medical Referral Centers, other institutions considered
to be medically appropriate, or to community hospitals when medical staff consider it medically mandatory. Section
549.62 (b) is intended to provide for the initial operational management of a hunger strike where the patient faces
no immediate or obvious medical risk. The requirement for use of a locked room in all cases is deemed necessary for reasons
of institution security and is intended to ensure the integrity of monitoring by medical staff. The revised section
does not preclude a health services unit room from being used for this purpose; it does, however, allow for the use of
other rooms. Regardless of the location, Bureau medical staff are responsible for determining that the room meets
the medical needs of the inmate.

References to specific medical procedures in &sect;549.63 (a)(6) and (7) have been replaced by more general statements
(i.e., radiographs and laboratory studies as clinically indicated). This has been done to allow medical staff flexibility
in using available medical technology. Paragraph (c) of this section is amended to specify that the physician is responsible
for making various decisions. This paragraph had previously designated medical staff as being responsible. Paragraph
(d) had stated that when medical staff consider it necessary in order to provide appropriate medical treatment, an
inmate on a hunger strike will be transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, to another Bureau institution
considered medically appropriate, or to a community hospital. The amendment to this rule stipulates that when medical
staff consider it medically mandatory, an inmate on a hunger strike will be transferred to a Medical Referral Center.
This amendment is necessary to reflect the increase in the number of available Bureau medical facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.64 state that an inmate may not make commissary purchases while under hunger strike
management. The amendment to this rule states that an inmate may not make commissary food purchases while under hunger
strike management. This change clarifies that an inmate on a hunger strike is prohibited only from making food purchases
from the commissary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 549.65 also state that a medical officer determines if the inmate's life or permanent
health will be threatened if treatment is not initiated immediately or if forced medical treatment is necessary.
The amended regulations stipulate that a physician make these determinations. The amended regulations provide
an even greater assurance that a medical professional will handle this medically related issue and that the inmate
will receive proper care even though not necessarily in a hospital. Section 549.66 has been similarly amended for
the same reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the heading of 28 CFR 549.60 has been revised for editorial reasons.
