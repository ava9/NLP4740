FT  04 JAN 93 / Europe 1993: What it's taken to get this far
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DONE
1985: European Community launches plans for single market, 282 necessary
measures outlined
1987: Political backing provided as the Single European Act comes into force
1989: A market worth 15 per cent of EC's GNP begins to open up with first
competitive tenders for public contracts
1990: Money moves freely as exchange controls are lifted in most of EC
1991: Graduates' qualifications increasingly recognised across the Community
1993
Jan 1: No border checks for goods as the frontier-controlled VAT and excise
system is abolished, together with 60m tax forms.
Government curbs on air fares lifted
Banks free to set up branches anywhere in the Community
Exchange controls to end, but Greece given extension
Later: Single market extended to six Efta states in second half of 1993
Passport checks for internal EC flights should end in December, but UK,
Denmark and Ireland may resist.
PENDING
1994: Higher education diplomas recognised throughout EC.
Open competition for all public authority contracts, including utilities
Insurance companies free to set up and sell policies across frontiers
1996: Stockbrokers get 'single passport' to operate anywhere in EC
Banks able to deal on all EC stock exchanges except in Greece, Portugal and
Spain
1997: Single VAT system applied to traders and consumers, if member-states
agree to a permanent change
1999: Duty-free sales end on internal flights and ferry crossings
2000: Free internal market in cars - deadline for removing all controls on
Japanese imports
PROBLEMS
Originial plan: 5 per cent of 1985 measures still to be adopted at Community
level
National measures: EC directives cannot be fully implemented unless they are
transformed into national legislation.  Between 20 per cent &amp; 30 per cent of
EC measures have still to be enacted in most countries
Energy: No agreement in sight for consumers to buy gas &amp; electricity from
any Community supplier
Telecoms: Competition in equipment &amp; services, but no legislation yet to
open up monopolies in ordinary phone calls
Postal Services: Gradual liberalisation promised, but no legislation drafted
so far
Company law: Directive harmonising takeover procedure under review;
voluntary European Company Statute for mulitinationals stalled
Monetary law: By 1999, according to Maastricht, depending on strict economic
conditions
