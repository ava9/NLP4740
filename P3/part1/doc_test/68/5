<TEXT>
<P>
Political detainees ended a mass hunger strike today after the South African 
government, fearing a situation "too ghastly to contemplate," indicated that it 
will free most of the 1,000 prisoners held without trial, their lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to suspend our hunger strike," more than 300 strikers in 
Johannesburg's main prison, Diepkloof, and in city hospitals said in a 
statement issued through lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the prisoners had been starving themselves for 24 days and were risking 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Johannesburg prisoners said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok 
indicated during intensive talks this week that he will reconsider the cases of 
each detainee around the country and will release many of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received indications from the minister that perhaps the majority of 
them will be released," lawyer Kathleen Satchwell told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent compromise solution avoided grave suffering to prisoners and 
headed off a major political crisis for Pretoria. Neither side claimed a total 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall Short of Demands 
</P>
<P>
The reported undertakings by Vlok fell short of demands by the hunger strikers 
that they should be released immediately and unconditionally and for an end to 
detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not advance our cause to say they have lost and we have won, (but) we 
are glad we have got to where we have got," said Anglican Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu, who issued a statement in Cape Town after the meeting that appealed to 
the hunger strikers to suspend their protest. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Vlok told the church leaders that he agreed with them that the death of a 
hunger striker would have consequences 'too ghastly to contemplate.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, the strikers in Johannesburg, who took food at 7 a.m., said in a 
statement that they do not feel their action has been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, an important victory has been won. We have succeeded in our 
principal objective -- to highlight the desperate plight of detainees and to 
protest arbitrary detention," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory for negotiation," a spokesman for Vlok, who asked not to be 
named, said in Cape Town. He acknowledged that the hunger strike hastened a 
review of detainees' cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Began Jan. 23 
</P>
<P>
The first group of strikers began their fast Jan. 23. They said they had no 
alternative because, under emergency laws, Vlok could hold them indefinitely 
without bringing them to court or even giving a reason for continuing to jail 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether more than 100 detainees at Port Elizabeth's St. Albans 
prison, who stopped eating about 10 days ago, had ended their protest. Lawyers 
representing them were due to meet Vlok later today. 
</P>
<P>
Churchmen who saw Vlok, including heads of the country's Roman Catholic, 
Reformed, Methodist and Anglican churches, said they will watch to ensure that 
he honors his assurances to free a substantial number within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member church delegation that met with Vlok included the Rev. Allan 
Boesak, who had fasted since Monday in solidarity with the hunger strikers. He 
said he is suspending his fast for two weeks because of the prospect of 
widespread releases.
