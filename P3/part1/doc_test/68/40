  [Text] Budapest, 17 February (MTI) -- Hungary's Government 
has decided NATO's AWACS surveillance aircraft may not stay in 
Hungarian airspace during any air strikes on Bosnian Serb 
positions, Andras Kelemen, state secretary of foreign affairs, 
told reporters today. 
  The government has asked Parliament's Defense and Foreign 
Affairs Committees to discuss this position. Prime Minister 
Peter Boross will inform NATO Secretary-General Manfred Worner 
on the committees' conclusions immediately, the state secretary 
said. 
  The Hungarian Government agrees that the bloodshed in Bosnia 
should be brought to an end, if required, even by resolute 
military action. In the absence of a NATO guarantee, however, 
Hungary cannot take part in such an act. In view of the 400,000 
ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina and other parts of Serbia, 
Hungary would like to avoid even the suspicion of a connection 
with any military action. 
  Under the Hungarian Constitution, participation in a 
military 
action requires parliamentary approval. Since the government 
has not asked for such approval, the idea that someone use 
Hungarian airspace for an air strike in Bosnia cannot be raised 
in the framework of constitutional order, Kelemen said. 
  The AWACS aircraft patrolling in Hungary are monitoring the 
fronts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina but are not authorized 
to provide logistical support for any air strike, Prime Minister 
Boross told NATO Headquarters last week. He indicated that 
modifying the mandate of AWACS fell within the scope of the 
Hungarian Parliament. 
  "NATO has not asked us to allow AWACS aircraft to control an 
air strike on Bosnian Serb positions. Nor will the government 
ask Parliament to extend the AWACS patrols' mandate," Kelemen 
said. 
  The state secretary added that a Hungarian role in a 
possible 
NATO air strike in Bosnia could trigger anti-Hungarian hysteria 
in both Serbia and the "Krajinas" under Serbian control. 
  Hungary's charge d'affaires in Belgrade has duly informed 
the 
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry on the Hungarian Government's 
position. On Monday [14 February] the Hungarian Foreign Ministry 
informed Yugoslavia's charge d'affaires in Budapest. 
  Kelemen said the Hungarian Foreign Ministry did not plan to 
recall the families of Hungarian diplomats accredited to Serbia 
and Montenegro. The Belgrade Embassy, he said, has not reported 
that any Hungarian citizen would be in danger. 
  In reply to a question, the state secretary said that the 
Hungarian position on the AWACS planes did not influence the 
peace partnership established between Hungary and NATO last week.
