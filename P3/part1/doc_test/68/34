  [Text] Yesterday, the health workers and the government 
reached an agreement by which the workers received a 12 percent 
salary increase. Therefore, after solving their problem, the 
health workers, about 600 of them, decided to lift the hunger 
strike and left for home, happy after several days of fasting. 
  This agreement could create problems for the COB [Bolivian 
Labor Federation] in view of the possibility that other sectors 
may do the same, thus breaking up the united struggle. The COB 
said, however, that this agreement will not weaken the workers' 
struggle for their demands, which will again be negotiated. 
  Yesterday the government asked the COB to lift the coercive 
measures. Today, after a COB assembly, a decision was made to 
maintain the hunger strike and the indefinite strike of some 
sectors, and to suspend the street demonstrations over the 
entire country, starting this afternoon, until next Sunday when 
the march celebrating Labor Day will be held. 
  [Begin COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas recording] This 
demonstration of flexibility, of political will shown by the COB 
and the workers, should be responded to by the government 
through new proposals which would serve as a basis for 
discussion to reach a solution to the conflict. [end recording] 
  On 1 May, workers will concentrate in the Plaza San 
Francisco 
to start the march to celebrate Labor Day. And on 3 May, the 
COB will hold a national assembly. 
  The government has, however, a different opinion of the 
decision made by the COB. The government believes that all 
coercive measures should be lifted to continue with the 
negotiations tonight. 
  [Begin Communications Minister Ernesto Machicao recording] 
The information I have about the COB's decision is still 
unofficial in reference to the efforts made over the last few 
days and weeks to have the coercive measures lifted. [end 
recording] 
  We should remember that the COB said it would only stop the 
street demonstrations, not the hungers strikes and the 
indefinite strike. But despite this decision, the step taken by 
the health workers is an important factor in the COB-government 
negotiations. 
  [Begin Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters recording] The salary 
increase granted to the health workers and the increase we are 
studying for the teachers will be implemented thanks to the 
savings made in each of these sectors. The salaries paid to 
people who did not work but got paid as a result of corruption 
will now be used for the salary increases in those sectors. 
This will be one of the main proposals we will take today to 
the COB. [end recording] 
  The COB, however, has not lost its hope of getting a higher 
salary increase percentage.
