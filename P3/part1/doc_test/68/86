  [Excerpt] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl has promised Hungary support in its efforts for full 
membership of the European Union. Germany would accompany 
Hungary on this path "with advice, but above all with actions," 
Kohl said at a news conference in Budapest today at the end of 
his official visit to Hungary. Without Hungary, Europe is only a 
torso and such a Europe is undesirable. 
  He will use Germany's EU presidency, which begins on 1 July, 
to win support in the EU for Hungary's admission, as he has done 
with Spain and Portugal, among others, the chancellor said. He 
will moreover place on the table the "proposal, as yet not 
popular in Europe" that Hungarian deputies should enter the 
European parliament in an advisory capacity. 
  This is naturally above all help for self-help, said Kohl. 
The key to EU membership lies with Hungary itself, which is 
today a "notable example of stability in a difficult period of 
transformation." The Budapest government is the only one in 
Eastern Europe to last a full legislative period and can point 
to considerable successes in spite of all its problems. 
  Germany supports the French proposal of reaching a joint 
stance on the Bosnian issue, as well as President Yeltsin's 
warning to the Serbs. The Russian president must also be 
included in future developments. 
  Kohl spoke against the idea, voiced in Budapest recently by 
Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber, of introducing partial 
EU membership. The principle still holds that the chancellor is 
the one who determines the main direction of policy, Kohl said 
in response to a query. The best preparation for EU membership 
is closer links between the community and those states that wish 
to join. To this end "the terminology has to be sorted out," 
Kohl stressed. For example, Poland is not in eastern Europe, as 
is so often said, but in central Europe. 
  Prime Minister Peter Boross indicated that Hungary will 
shortly be approaching the UN in connection with possible 
compensation for the losses it has incurred from the blockade 
against Serbia. The close cooperation with Germany is an 
important factor in involving his country in Europe's economic 
system. He expressed the hope that with German help Hungary 
will become a full EU member by the year 2000 or perhaps even 
earlier. [passage omitted]
