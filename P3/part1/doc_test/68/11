<F P=106> [Unnattributed "special dispatch": "Wang Dan Ends His </F>
Hunger Strike, But Says He Will Not Yield to Public Security 
Police"] 
  [Text] Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement in Beijing and who was on a 48-hour 
hunger strike in protest against public security police watching 
him day and night, ended his "symbolic" action quietly at his 
Beijing residence at 2100 yesterday evening. However, when 
answering a question from a reporter of this newspaper by 
long-distance telephone, Wang Dan said that he would certainly 
escalate to a move of confrontation if the public security 
police stepped up the above-said surveillance. 
  Wang Dan said he was feeling weak as his current hunger 
strike was the longest he had experienced since 4 June 1989. As 
it was anticipated, the public security police remained 
indifferent. He thinks that his personal safety is less 
guaranteed now than at any time before, including his time in 
jail. His present situation is precisely as former U.S. 
President Roosevelt said: "Living in the freedom of terror." 
According to his judgment, the authorities around-the-clock 
surveillance is aimed at controlling his remarks on one hand, 
and threatening and intimidating him on the other. He believes 
he has never said anything wrong or false, so he will not shut 
his mouth because of that. However, he pointed out that if the 
public security bureau's surveillance is stepped up, he would 
employ another method to escalate his protest. 
  Wang Dan said that the public security's close watch of him 
had caused a lot of inconvenience in his daily life. He was 
unable to call on some friends whom he wanted to see, because 
"no one is willing to have contact with policemen." 
  He also disclosed that when he returned to his home town in 
Shandong around 4 June this year, he had stayed the night at an 
inn, and now that inn has been closed up.
