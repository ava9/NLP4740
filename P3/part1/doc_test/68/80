  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 23 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- About 5,000 
people marched through the Mongolian capital's central streets 
today, chanting slogans demanding the government's resignation 
and the dissolution of parliament. Then the demonstrators 
assembled on a city square to give moral support to Mongolian 
opposition members who have been on a hunger strike for 11 
consecutive days. Following the hospitalization of several 
hunger strikers, 34 of them now remain. The opposition forces 
intend to use the hunger strike to compel the government to 
resign. Accusations of official corruption and discontent with 
government policy in spheres such as social welfare, education, 
and agriculture have served as the formal pretext for the 
protests. 
  No serious incidents occurred, with the exception of 
attempts 
by government supporters to use smoke bombs and firecrackers to 
hinder the demonstration. The security forces monitored 
[kontrolirovali] the situation, observed the demonstrators from 
afar and did not intervene in the events. 
  The country's President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat had a meeting 
with the hunger strikers several days ago. However, the hunger 
strikers, who were joined by former Vice President 
Radnaasumbereliyn Gonchigdorj, refused to stop their action in 
spite of attempts at persuasion. They say they will strike 
until the government agrees to make concessions.
