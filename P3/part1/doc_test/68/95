</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hungarian proverb holds that when a listing rider attempts to right himself 
in the saddle, he usually falls off the other side of the horse. 
</P>
<P>
And this, liberal politicians say, is what has happened to Hungary's drive to 
transfer state-run industries to private ownership: First the government gave 
away the store, and now it is wary of all foreign investment, the key to 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by a string of controversial sales that enriched a few at the expense of 
many, the center-right government that was voted into power this spring is 
scrambling to put up barriers against shady deals, get-rich-quick schemes and 
"golden parachutes" for departing Communist managers. 
</P>
<P>
As the most economically developed of the emerging democracies of Eastern 
Europe, Hungary is the first to have to grapple with deciding what to sell and 
what to keep. 
</P>
<P>
It put out the welcome mat for foreign investment, recognizing the need for 
Western expertise, technology and money to buy backward factories from the 
state and upgrade them to produce export-quality goods to help pay off 
staggering foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
But a public backlash against outside ownership is threatened after sales that 
have deeded over Hungary's leading newspapers to foreign publishers and sold 
promising tourist and service industries at a fraction of their worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are only at the beginning of capitalism," said Matyas Eorsi, a member of 
Parliament from the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats and a lawyer handling 
foreign trade contracts. "It's like a gold rush, and there are no fancy rules 
to guide it." 
</P>
<P>
Eorsi argues that Hungary needs immediate infusions of foreign capital, and he 
advocates a virtual open season on national assets, risking a few unwise 
transactions in creating an instant market that will eventually demand fair 
value for the assets leaving state hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It is better to have some scandalous transactions go through if the result is 
a speeding up of privatization," Eorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
But the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum argues that it's time for 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bod, head of the economics committee in Parliament and a top adviser with 
the Forum, contends that the tax breaks offered as inducements for foreign 
investment are going to publishers of pornography -- a flourishing industry in 
Hungary -- and to those who took over prosperous businesses, not the failing 
enterprises the authorities hoped to give over to capitalism for another try at 
profit making. 
</P>
<P>
After investment laws were liberalized last year, several questionable deals 
were pushed through to make investment in Hungary appear attractive to 
foreigners, Bod said. 
</P>
<P>
In a few other cases, valuable businesses that had been run by the state, like 
the network of Apisz stationery stores and the HungarHotels chain, were quietly 
sold off for much less than what would be their market value if a market 
existed to determine such things, Bod said. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that the lack of an anti-monopoly law has allowed foreign 
publishers, such as West Germany's Axel Springer organization, to buy out the 
fledgling free press only recently liberated from Communist Party control. 
</P>
<P>
Springer now owns more than a dozen newspapers and 40 trade journals in 
Hungary, and publishing magnates Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell recently 
purchased large shares of the nation's most reform-minded publications. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum is pushing for more regulation of the conversion to private ownership 
among foreign investors and Hungarians alike, although the latter are relegated 
to a minor role in privatization because of the dearth of savings and ready 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
An international commission of economics experts determined in early April that 
Hungary's industries are worth about $30 billion. The report estimated that 
Hungarians could afford to buy only 1% of these properties a year, putting the 
burden on foreign buyers to break the state's grip on commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude toward foreign capital is very important," Bod said. "In general, 
that attitude is still very positive, but every case of corruption undermines 
this asset of support." 
</P>
<P>
In a rare show of unity among Hungary's fractious political parties, a State 
Property Agency was established in March to work with Parliament in drafting 
guidelines for privatization. The government has also contracted with the 
London-based accounting firm Price Waterhouse and the Chicago-based law firm 
Baker &amp; McKenzie to serve as international advisers in the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Birch, a partner in the Price Waterhouse Budapest office, says a certain 
amount of caution is sensible when heading into uncharted waters. To date there 
is no precedent for converting a socialist, centrally planned economy into a 
free market. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Western business world is automatically wary of the capitalist 
instinct to make a quick profit, nations such as Hungary are not. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Europe is very fragile because the people don't have that kind of 
expertise, and they lack the experience of having to protect themselves," Birch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that some industrial and service spheres should be shielded from 
foreign influence but says those decisions rest with the elected authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The State Property Agency operates outside the control of the government, 
answering only to Parliament, which has yet to draft a single law. 
</P>
<P>
Agency director Istvan Tompe argues that Hungary should sell off failing firms 
to outside investors but hold on to lucrative businesses and those that are 
traditional responsibilities of the state. He says health care, banking, 
tourism and transport should stay in the hands of the government. 
</P>
<P>
State-owned hotels, restaurants and travel agencies in Budapest and at Lake 
Balaton are major hard-currency earners for the Hungarian government, as is the 
national airline, Malev. 
</P>
<P>
Whether to designate certain industries as off-limits for foreign investors 
will be decided by Parliament, which only in early May began the complicated 
task of building a new legislative framework. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, decisions about what should be sold, how soon and for how much 
are still the exclusive domain of Hungarian industrial managers -- often the 
Communist Party bosses that the new government plans to remove. 
</P>
<P>
Under the economic reforms of 1984-85, a first step toward privatization was 
taken by creating ownership councils in most factories and state enterprises. 
The councils were intended to make decisions in the interest of all employees, 
who as Hungarian citizens were considered owners of their state enterprises. 
But the council members tended to be the same officials who managed the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
This has put the industrial chieftains who are responsible for enterprises that 
are over-staffed and underproductive in the position of making decisions that 
also determine the factories' future. 
</P>
<P>
Some Communist Party figures, anticipating imminent dismissal, have arranged 
the transfer of their enterprises to foreign consortia. With no oversight 
authorities, deals were struck behind closed doors that gave the retreating 
managers a sizable payoff -- the golden parachute -- in return for undervaluing 
the facility being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Bod contends that the Apisz stationery chain was sold for one-seventh of its 
value and that one-third of the shares ended up in the hands of a departing 
Communist bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, the Czechoslovak-born newspaper magnate, reportedly got a 
bargain-basement price of $800,000 for 40% of Magyar Hirlap, the former 
government daily. 
</P>
<P>
Springer has evaded even the cursory review of the State Property Agency by 
labeling its newspaper holdings start-ups instead of takeovers. The West German 
group hired the publications' staffs and rented the same offices and printing 
facilities, then invited advertisers to switch over to the new papers. 
</P>
<P>
With no regulatory legislation, the moves cannot be deemed illegal. But the 
Free Democrats have called on Parliament to freeze Springer transactions in 
Hungary pending investigation of how it obtained its current holdings and until 
after legislation can be enacted to prevent media monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, watching the 
progress of the first projects before embarking on their own commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here with the prejudice that it might not be time to invest yet, 
because of the Gold Rush mentality," said Kevin Kinsella, managing general 
partner of Avalon Ventures of La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsella visited Hungary with 40 other American businessmen in April. He said 
that he was impressed with the Hungarians' entrepreneurial spirit but that in 
the absence of any track record "we might want to let things settle out here 
first."
