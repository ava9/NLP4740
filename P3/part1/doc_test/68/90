  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The tense 
situation shaped down in the country due to the political hunger 
strike announced by the activists of the Mongolian Democratic 
Association (MDA) in the capital might be solved positively 
shortly. 
  Such hope is arising in connection with today's events 
around 
the hunger strike participants of that for the fifth day are 
demanding the resignation of the government by P. Jasray. At 
13.43 the former vice president of the country, chairman of the 
Social-Democratic Party, member of the parliament R. Gonchigdorj 
has joined in the hunger strikers. 
  At the afternoon sitting of the parliament the leader of the 
MDA and member of the parliament T. Elbegdorj said that he 
refuses his deputyship and walked out the sitting. 
  The president of the country P. Ochirbat asked in his speech 
addressing the parliament to discuss at the morning meeting both 
the demands of hungers and the opinion of the prime minister on 
this point. 
  At present the leaderships of the ins and outs are holding 
meetings in their headquarters. It is likely that the president 
has delivered them the draft of compromising solution of the 
problem and attaining an agreement between the main political 
forces. 
  In order to provide preparations for a meeting the president 
has received the representatives of hunger strikers. The 
meeting lasted more than three hours. The meeting were attended 
by representatives of all organizations participating in the 
hunger strike -- the MDA, Union for New Progress, the Union of 
Mongolian Students and the SDP as well.
