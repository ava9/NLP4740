  [Text] All Muslim-Bosniak prisoners in Mostar's Heliodrom 
prison, except two, today ended their hunger strike. 
  At his first news conference today Vlado Sojic, new defense 
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said, I quote, 
that he feels like a minister of peace rather than war as he was 
appointed at the time of the Washington agreement. Asked 
whether the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was over he nevertheless 
said: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] Unfortunately, the war is not over. 
[end recording] 
  Of course, Sojic said, the Croat side will continue to do 
everything, just as it has been doing hitherto, to achieve peace 
through negotiations. He then called on his fighters to be 
patient enough until a final peace, given the fact that they 
have managed to save Croat territories and the Croat population. 
Replying to a question as to who started the war and whether 
the Croats are the losers, Sojic says: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] The Croats did not start the war, 
nor 
are they the losers. As to what extent they are the winners, 
one can speculate in various ways. [end recording] 
  Minister Sojic also added that the Croats had so far always 
accepted every peace agreement, ranging from the Cutillero 
agreement to this latest Redman one. Asked whether the Croats 
and Muslim can live together after so much bloodshed, Sojic says: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] The, shall I say, memories of the 
war 
with the Muslims are still fresh, so it is hard to talk about 
coexistence, particularly so where there has been fighting, but 
I nevertheless believe that Croats and Muslims can live in a 
common state if it is organized in a democratic way and secures 
the national rights of all peoples. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]
