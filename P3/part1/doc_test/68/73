PRAGUE: REBIRTH BY STUDENTS;

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE OPPOSITION WON THE FIRST ROUND OF REVOLUTION. NOW COME 
HARDER QUESTIONS: WHO WILL GOVERN, HOW TO PROCEED?

By Karel Kovanda, Karel Kovanda, a student dissident in Prague, 1968, now a 
computer-industry manager in California, was sent to Czechoslovakia by Global

SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current Prague revolution began without me in mid-November; my anguish 
about sitting in Santa Cruz increased daily until I grabbed an opportunity to 
go back to Czechoslovakia, to visit the city where I grew up, attended college, 
earned my first political credentials as a dissident -- the city where old 
friends are often closer than brothers. 
</P>
<P>
This revolution is not much like the Prague Spring of 1968. First, this is 
indeed a revolution; 1968 was a reform. No matter how strong the push of 
popular forces, no matter how enlightened the leadership of Alexander Dubcek, 
the 1968 process was managed -- and its limits dictated -- by the Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 no such limits are apparent. The Communist Party is being swept away, 
almost as an irrelevant irritant, stripped of its hitherto constitutionally 
guaranteed "leading role." This is a step we never dreamed of in 1968. The 
country is heading for free elections; the Communist Party might win only 10% 
of the electorate, losing two-thirds of its own members' votes. In 1968, such 
results were unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone I saw in Prague was astonished by the speed of change: They talked 
about 10 years for Poland, 10 months for Hungary, 10 weeks for East Germany and 
10 days for Czechoslovakia. Not boasting -- pure wonderment. They understood 
that speed was multiplied by developments in other East European countries; 
there could have been no Prague without a Warsaw, no Prague without a Budapest 
or Berlin. But they also told each other that speed is testimony to the 
rottenness of the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
Dizzying speed, however exhilarating, makes it hard to see where you are going. 
The leadership of the Civic Forum, an umbrella group that has emerged as the 
most powerful opposition voice, relies on a handful of individuals who carry 
extraordinary physical and psychological burdens. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Vaclav Havel, the best-known personality of the Forum, has more 
mandates than minutes. He is needed everywhere simultaneously: to negotiate 
with the government, to confer with colleagues, to meet emissaries from the 
provinces, to address the public, to draft documents, to comment on position 
papers. To maintain some semblance of physical control, Havel seems to travel 
with a half-dozen karate experts -- guarding him from journalists as much as 
from other dangers. When I saw him in Prague at the end of November, the strain 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum was operating out of execrable spaces. Headquarters were in the 
basement of the Laterna Magica theater in the center of Prague: only a couple 
of telephones, none with multiple lines; no copying machines on site, never 
mind faxes or computers, no secretarial support to speak of. Information flowed 
by courier. The press of people trying to get into the basement was constant. 
Only one narrow section of the entrance was kept open; a visitor's business had 
to be ascertained before entry to the foyer of the theater; to reach the 
basement, one needed a special pass reserved for Civic Forum activists. 
</P>
<P>
An old friend from 1968 was my passport. Vlado Prikazsky is a former radio 
journalist who covered "our" student strike in November, 1968. He was kicked 
off the air during subsequent government purges. Now Vlado is back in action, 
part of the Civic Forum, one of dozens of old friends reunited after more than 
20 years. With each of them, I continued interrupted conversation. The only 
evidences of time passed were our graying hair and pictures of 15-year-old 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The old friends helped reconstruct what had happened. The first phase of the 
revolution erupted on Friday, Nov. 17, when a special unit of riot police from 
the Interior Ministry savagely beat up as many as 2,000 demonstrators, most of 
them students. The assault was unprovoked; the protest was nonviolent. The 
demonstrators' only crime was failure to disperse; instead, they sat down on 
the cold Prague pavement and refused to budge. Vlado took me to the site; the 
pavement has become a little shrine, adorned with dozens of candles. 
</P>
<P>
Police brutality lit the fuse. Over the weekend, students made nationwide plans 
for a general strike and people started gathering in the city center, at 
Wenceslas Square. The regime realized it had gone too far; the Wenceslas Square 
crowd was not attacked. On Nov. 20, the demonstrators issued a list of demands, 
vowing to strike until demands were met. 
</P>
<P>
This is a students' revolution. They spearheaded it, had the courage to face 
police, mobilized the population at large -- frequently against the wishes of 
parents who had found a way of cohabiting with the regime. 
</P>
<P>
I visited a couple of universities and talked to striking students. They wanted 
to know about Prague Spring -- about democratic political processes the regime 
never taught. 
</P>
<P>
The students were joined in the strike by actors who added professional skills 
to convey the message, helping win over factory workers. In the battle for 
hearts and minds, Communist Party propaganda hacks were completely outclassed. 
Theaters were open every evening for panel discussions with students and other 
opposition speakers. And every night every house was packed. 
</P>
<P>
During my visit, what can best be described as a revolutionary gala was held at 
the National Theater. Arias from Bedrich Smetana's patriotic operas were 
sandwiched between appearances by popular scholars and actors -- some of whom 
had been banned from the stage for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a disciplined, gentle, even good-humored revolution. Hundreds of 
thousands of people gathered daily in city center, with no police presence. Not 
a single window was broken. Current playfulness contrasts dramatically with the 
dourness of the Communist Party. A Hungarian dissident addressed the crowds one 
day and apologized for his awkwardness with the Czech language. The crowd 
roared immediate response; one man yelled, "He speaks better than Jakes," 
referring to Milos Jakes, the former party boss famous for his inability to 
string a decent sentence together. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nov. 21, a loudspeaker was installed on Wenceslas Square. Civic 
Forum leaders could at last address the throng and the people took direction. 
From then on, revolution was unstoppable -- short of a Tian An Men Square 
massacre. Even the soon-to-be deposed apparatchiks didn't have the stomach for 
that, although there is evidence that militia troops were brought in to the 
outskirts of Prague from outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
The people have won the first phase hands-down. The opposition demands 
presented to Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec were accepted -- including free 
elections. Then Adamec resigned. His designated successor was Marian Calfa. The 
people were still unsure last week. They had won but could hardly believe it. 
It all seemed too easy. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult phase has opened, with questions about composition of the 
government, the timing of elections, the identity of Civic Forum -- a political 
party or a Solidarity-type trade union? Prime ministers change within days. 
Real economic and social difficulties remain. Parties spring up from nowhere, 
frequently representing no more than the megalomania of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The chasm between freedom of speech and freedom to vent hot air grows more 
apparent. No multiparty elections have been held since 1946. Ignorance about 
the democratic process, about electoral systems, about campaign mechanisms is 
endemic. 
</P>
<P>
Yet fundamental assets are equally apparent: a smart people who will work hard, 
determined to end the nightmare of communist control. Many of us who have been 
biding time abroad are now deciding how best to contribute to the new 
Czechoslovakia, the one students have freed.
