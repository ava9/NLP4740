WAYS TO END HUNGER NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Thank you for your article (Aug. 11) on hunger conditions here in Orange 
County. There is no valid reason why hunger should exist here or elsewhere in 
the world -- there is enough food. But one reason it does is because people are 
uninformed. Articles such as those written by Carla Rivera provide education 
and information so that someday we can end hunger. Beyond education, it is even 
more important that we ask why hunger exists, find the answers and then get our 
legislators and Congress to establish policies and enact laws which will 
provide the key answers. We must treat the causes as well as the symptoms, as 
was done in the 1970s when hunger in the United States was essentially ended.

One main cause of hunger in the United States now is low wages. Many people do 
not realize that national minimum wages were not allowed to rise all during the 
1980s even though the cost of living rose about 70%. This was a deliberate 
policy of the Reagan Administration. In addition, Social Security taxes rose, 
and income tax policies were changed. As a result, low- and middle-income 
Americans have had to bear a larger share of the tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
With the combination of fixed minimum wages, higher taxes on lower-income 
people, greatly increased housing costs and new jobs being mostly service types 
at minimum wage, it is no surprise that there are so many hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, many people are sympathetic to those in need and have given time 
and money to direct aid. However, it is critical now that local, state and 
federal governments establish policies regarding wage levels, employment, 
affordable housing and health care, which will -- in a fair manner -- help 
those on the lower rungs of the ladder help themselves, as they want to do.
