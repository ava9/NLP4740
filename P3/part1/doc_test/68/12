  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- As was 
informed by the special issue of the newspaper "ERH CHOLOO" the 
Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray has refused to sign an 
agreement with the participants of the hunger strike going on 
their action demanding the resignation of the government. 
  He gave such reason for his refusal as that neither in the 
Constitution of the country nor in the law on the government 
there is proper provision providing for a preliminary arriving 
at an agreement on resignation of the government with 
individuals or organizations. During the meeting with the 
representatives of the hunger strikers on 24 April the prime 
minister also called upon the strikers to discontinue the hunger 
strike as a sign of respect of the stand by the president, the 
recommendations of the Council for Ensuring the National 
Security and the decisions by the parliament. 
  In the agreement on concord there is provided for as a 
condition for ending the hunger strike the resignation of the 
government in case their failure to fulfill their programme of 
action for the year 1994. 
  In association with the fact that the head of the government 
has denied this proposal it has been decided to continue the 
hunger strike of members and supporters of the Mongolian 
Democratic Association, Union of Mongolian Students and Union 
for New Progress demanding the resignation of the government. 
The hunger strike is being continued for 15 days. 
  The participants of the counterhunger strike in support of 
the government have stopped their action on 23 April.
