  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- The first freely elected 
Hungarian parliament in forty years, convened on May 2, 1990, 
ended its work on April 7, 1994, after 378 days of sessions. In 
this time, deputies passed 432 laws that created and expanded 
the framework of a democratic law-governed state, continued the 
creation of a social market economy, and accelerated the 
emergence of capitalist property relations. 
  One of the most important laws passed, regulated on 
compensation, as a result of which 670,000 people acquired about 
one-third of the arable land, and two-fifths of the forests. 
The minority law ensures extensive personal, cultural, and 
administrative autonomy to the ethnic and national minorities 
that account for about one-tenth of the Hungarian population. 
  Under the 1989 electoral law approved in the former system, 
176 of the 386 deputies in the single-chamber Parliament were 
elected from individual constituencies, 152 from regional lists, 
and 58 from national lists. 
  An electoral majority made it possible for the conservative, 
Christian parties to form a government. The ruling center-right 
coalition, first led by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, then, 
following his death in December 1993, by Prime Minister Peter 
Boross, initially consisted of 165 deputies of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF), 44 deputies of the Independent 
Smallholders+ Party (FKGP), and 21 deputies of the Christian 
Democratic People"s Party (KDNP). The opposition parties were 
the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) with 94 deputies, 
the liberal Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ) with 22 
deputies, and the Hungarian Socialist Party with 33 deputies. 
Apart from these six parties, seven independent deputies also 
won seats. (The proportions changed significantly over the four 
years, the government majority was reduced to a minimum, the 
number of independent deputies rose fourfold, and new party 
groups were set up.) 
  There were very few professional politicians among the 358 
men and 28 women deputies, but very many with higher 
qualifications: 244 deputies had had professional careers, 80 
scientific careers, 20 were entrepreneurs or farmers, and only 
10 were from the former political elite. As regards their 
former occupations, 33 deputies were researchers, 27 lawyers, 22 
hospital doctors, 21 company managers, 20 journalists, 17 
university professors or secondary school teachers. 
  In order to increase government stability, the two strongest 
parties agreed with each other at the end of April, 1990, on the 
principles for a partial amendment of the Constitution, which 
was approved by deputies. The parts of the amendemnt which 
affected Parliament were the election of the President by 
deputies (Arpad Goncz has been President of the Republic since 
1990), and that the scope of authority of the president extends, 
under certain conditions, to the dissolution of Parliament. 
Parliament elects the prime minister, the president appoints 
the ministers on the proposal of the prime minister. An 
absolute majority (50 percent of deputies plus one vote) is 
needed to elect a prime minister, or for a no- confidence vote 
against him. A constructive no-confidence motion (supported by 
one-fifth of the deputies, also having to include the name of 
the new prime ministerial candidate) can be submitted only 
against the prime minister. 
  The legal measure in force lists 20 basic institutions and 
basic rights for which qualified, two-thirds majority is needed 
(that is votes from two-thirds of the deputies) to amend them. 
These include changes to the Constitution, making peace 
agreements, and declaring war or states of emergency. 
  These created the unique features of Hungarian 
parliamentarism, which shifted the focus of legislation from the 
English model to the German "chancellorship" model. With the 
two-thirds majority laws, the Constitution also ensured 
legislative rights to the opposition. Apart from the general 
principle of government accountability, parliamentary control 
also includes a reporting obligation for the government and 
certain of its ministers. However, with the introduction of the 
conservative no-confidenc vote, the government can be 
overthrowin only through the person of the prime minister. A 
characteristic element in preparation of laws is that the role 
of parliamentary groups is greater than that of parliamentary 
committees. However, the House rules provide extensive 
opportunities for control by institutionalizing questions to the 
prime minister and ministers, political debates, contributions 
before the session, and submitting amendment proposals.
