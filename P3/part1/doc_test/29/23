  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (AFP) -- A Chinese delegation led 
by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited the U.S. Embassy 
Wednesday to pay its respects to former U.S. President Richard 
Nixon who died last week. 
  Qian, who is also vice-premier, and Luo Gan, 
secretary-general of the State Council, observed a moment's 
silence in front of a picture of Nixon hanging in the dining 
room of the U.S. ambassador's residence. Qian, copying from a 
prepared text, then wrote a message of condolence in a special 
book. 
  "Nixon, when he was president of the United States, opened 
the door to Sino-US relations and made a valuable historical 
contribution. I want to express my heartfelt sorrow," Qian 
wrote. Luo wrote a similar message, expressing his sympathy for 
Nixon's relatives. 
  Wreaths "expressing deep condolences" from President Jiang 
Zemin, Premier Li Peng and vice premier in charge of the economy 
Zhu Rongji, surrounded the Nixon portrait. 
  Nixon is best remembered in China for his historic 1972 
visit 
here which ended decades of mutual hostility and paved the way 
for the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later.
