Albert W. Bates, former editorial page director of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot 
and one-time public relations assistant to the U.S. postmaster general, died 
Saturday in Hemet after a long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Bates was with the Daily Pilot from 1961 until 1972, when he joined the U.S. 
Postal Service during the Nixon Administration. He retired from that post in 
1974. He began his newspaper career in the Midwest, and from 1929 to 1934 
served as executive director of Sigma Delta Chi, the national journalism 
society now known as the Society of Professional Journalists. He was one of 
only two people to twice win the society's coveted Wells Key for services to 
journalism and the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the society in the middle of the Depression, Bates became a public 
relations consultant for the meat packing firm of Swift and Co. in Chicago. He 
moved to Honolulu in the late 1940s as a director of public relations for a 
company there. He later became vice president of Hill and Knowlton publishers 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
While with the Daily Pilot, Bates received the California Newspaper Publisher's 
Assn. award in 1968 for the best editorial page in California. 
</P>
<P>
He also belonged to the Public Relations Society of America, the National Press 
Club, Orange County Press Club, Dutch Treat Club-West and the Huntington Beach 
Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Marianne of Hemet; two daughters, Lynn Bryan of 
Etna, Calif., and Katheryn Hill of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Albert K. Bates of 
Summer Town, Tenn., and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
No funeral services are planned. The family has requested that any memorial 
contribution be sent to the Ramona Hospice in Hemet.
