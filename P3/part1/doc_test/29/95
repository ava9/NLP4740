  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leader, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, asked the U.S. "not to support those who 
had lost the parliamentary elections on December 12, that is to 
say Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, Shakhray and others who consider 
themselves democrats. This was announced by Zhirinovskiy after a 
meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon which lasted 
for about an hour and a half. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, the former U.S. President "has 
the 
right understanding of the situation in the world and of our 
problems." 
  "The main point that I wanted to make known to U.S. 
President 
Bill Clinton is that he must not be afraid of me," Zhirinovskiy 
emphasized. He said Russia was moving towards a military regime 
and the danger stemmed from those who had lost the elections, 
from the so-called radical democrats. 
  Commenting on the chances of candidates running for 
presidential elections "which may take place earlier than within 
two years," Zhirinovskiy said his only real contender was former 
Russian vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy. According to the LDP 
leader, neither Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, nor Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov, neither Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and Shakhray, nor 
candidates from "the Communist, pro-communist or patriotic 
forces" could be his contenders. 
  Richard Nixon's advisor, Dmitri Simes, told the news 
conference that Zhirinovskiy had told Nixon that Yeltsin was 
"losing his influence." According to Symes, Nixon gave neither 
personal comments nor assessments during their conversation. 
  Asked whether Nixon changed his opinion of Zhirinovskiy 
after 
their meeting, Simes said that Nixon had been "informed that Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy could perform in different genres and in different 
situations. I am confident that the way Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke 
today made due impression on President Nixon and he could place 
it in a certain context, since he knew both the speeches and 
political history of Mr. Zhirinovskiy." 
  Shortly after his meeting with Zhirinovskiy, Nixon received 
the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia faction in the 
State Duma, Nikolay Travkin. Their meeting lasted for 1 hour 20 
minutes. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Travkin said the conversation 
mainly focused on economic issues and prospects for equal 
partnership between Russia and the U.S. According to Travkin, 
he told Nixon that Russia would "not fall into coups and civil 
wars," because Russia had everything needed to avoid it. The 
only thing "lacking is political will, that of the president in 
the first place. You seem the only optimist here," concluded 
Nixon.
