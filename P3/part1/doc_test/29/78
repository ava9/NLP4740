  [Text] Moscow, 12 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin regards as closed the recent incident when he 
refused to receive the former U.S. President Richard Nixon who 
is on a private visit to Russia. ITAR-TASS learned this from an 
official source in the Kremlin, who also said that Yeltsin was 
in favor of Nixon holding meetings with representatives of 
different branches of power in Russia. However, the Russian 
president himself will still be unable to receive the former 
U.S. President because of the death of his wife's, Naina 
Yeltsina's, mother several days ago. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by Nixon's aides 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Robert Dole, the leader of 
the Republican group in the U.S. Senate and one of the most 
influential American legislators, approached the Russian head of 
state with requests to settle the complicated situation around 
this issue. 
  Representatives of Nixon have reported that on Monday [14 
March] he will make a speech at a sitting of the Russian State 
Duma Committee for International Affairs at the invitation of 
the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin.
