The urge to kill Don Henley first hit Mojo Nixon as he watched the pony-tailed 
former Eagle accept a Grammy for "Record of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the innocence? How about the end of Don Henley? 
</P>
<P>
"The Grammys really put me over the top. I didn't want to watch, but my wife 
insisted," singer-songwriter Nixon recalled. "The whole thing just made me 
furious. . . . Don Henley and Phil Collins and now George Michael -- they want 
to be taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said of Nixon, who was inspired to write "Don Henley Must 
Die" for his current album, "Otis." The song is a hysterical, screaming 
indictment of "big, bloated Henley-esque rock stars," Mojo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to Don directly, but he should be honored. Maybe we could get 
together, have a couple of drinks, I don't know," said the 33-year-old Nixon 
about Henley, whose "The End of the Innocence" took one of the top honors at 
this year's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first time Mojo, the self-described court jester of rock 'n' roll, 
has taken aim at a well-known target. 
</P>
<P>
His last album included "Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love 
Child"; in "Elvis Is Everywhere," he branded Michael J. Fox "the anti-Elvis"; 
and he once suggested in song a drug-testing method for Nancy Reagan that is 
too tasteless to print in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said the surviving victims of his songs are generally good-natured. But a 
few Elvis fans became irate over his homage to the King, which credited Presley 
with creating Stonehenge, the pyramids and the Bermuda Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis and his fans are a little nutty, but that's what makes it great," said 
Nixon, who last year set up a phone line for Elvis-spotters to call in their 
sightings. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 500 calls a day -- people with Elvis and Liberace at their house, 
worshipping Jackie's hair. People with Elvis out front mowing the lawn. It's 
great," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's experiences are not limited to music; he played the role of Jerry Lee 
Lewis' drummer in "Great Balls of Fire," an experience that allowed him to hang 
out with "The Killer." 
</P>
<P>
"With Jerry Lee alive, you can't make the movie you want to see, because Jerry 
Lee would kill you, and that wouldn't be good," Nixon explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Lee was awfully good to me, but then I wasn't married to him." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is Mojo's greatest fantasy: to become the target of the 
record-stickering movement, to write the lyrics that drive Florida Gov. Bob 
Martinez crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been striving for that," Nixon said. "I'm sending my records to Tipper 
Gore and this idiot down in Florida, but it doesn't seem to be working."
