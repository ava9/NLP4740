FT  17 JUN 93 / Connally always in LBJ's shadow: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Bowden Connally, who died on Tuesday at the age of 76, might have been
the second coming of another legendary politician from Texas, Lyndon Baines
Johnson, but in the end the most important national post he held was as US
Treasury secretary from 1971-72.
Silver haired and silver tongued, the Democrat-turned-Republican lawyer from
Floresville, Texas, always aimed high and thought big.
He cut his political spurs running LBJ's first campaign for the House and as
his administrative assistant in the Senate in the late 1940s, and his
business ones as a legal adviser to Mr Sid Richardson, the notorious Texas
oilman, in the 1950s.
With these connections and credentials, President John F Kennedy named him
secretary of the navy in 1961. Two years later he was governor of his native
home state. On November 23 that year in Dallas he was in the car in which
the president was assassinated and he was himself severely wounded.
Three times elected governor, he was nonetheless increasingly out of sorts
with the national Democratic party as it swung to the left. In 1971, while
retaining his nominal party loyalty, he took the extraordinary political
gamble of accepting President Richard Nixon's invitation to become Treasury
secretary. He only formally became a Republican after LBJ's death in 1973.
The two years he served Mr Nixon were distinctive, to put it mildly, as he
imposed his style and bluster on the US and the global economic community.
Not only did he preside over the imposition of wage and price controls in
1971 but he also supervised the demise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed
exchange rates when he took the US off the gold standard at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington in the same year.
Mostly untainted by the Watergate affair, but not by subsequent financial
scandals of his own, Mr Connally so impressed Mr Nixon that the president
had to be dissuaded in 1972 from ditching vice-president Spiro Agnew in his
favour.
Mr Nixon returned the compliment in his final days by trying to block
federal charges that Mr Connally had accepted illegal political donations
from the milk lobby (he was subsequently acquitted).
But by then it was already assumed that his sights were set on the White
House itself. In this he never got far past the starting post, neither in
1976 nor, most ignominiously, in 1980 when he spent more than Dollars 12m
from his own pocket and secured precisely one delegate to the Republican
convention that year.
He was heard making complimentary noises about a fellow Texan, Mr Ross
Perot, in last year's election.
The 1980s were generally a disaster. A real estate venture with a former
Texas lieutenant governor went sour, forcing him to file for bankruptcy and
to put up his considerable private collection of art, furniture and assorted
mementoes for public auction.
But he remained active in Texas politics until the Senate primary two months
ago when he sought to prevent the victory of Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison,
installed this week as the new Republican senator.
Mr Connally was always known for his quotability. One that has endured for
for nearly 20 years was a famous blast against Japan, when he threatened
that if he had his way their cars 'would never leave the docks at Yokohama'.
His failure to achieve his ultimate ambition may be ascribed to several
factors.
He was a political turncoat and was thus spurned by Democrats, while never
fully trusted by Republicans, and was ultimately upstaged by Mr Ronald
Reagan, ironically also a turncoat but without Mr Connally's reputation as
an opportunist.
His financial wheeling and dealing, if very much in the Texas mould, also
looked out of place in the post-Watergate era of a new morality.
He ended where he began, in LBJ's long shadow, teaching an occasional class
in political science at the department of the University of Texas named
after the former president. It was said to be wildly popular.
