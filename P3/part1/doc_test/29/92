Mary Duque, the indefatigable altruist who helped raise more than $100 million 
for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, died Sunday night. She was believed to be 
87. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Barker, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Mrs. Duque died in her 
sleep at her Hancock Park home. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years -- and at an average rate of nearly $3 million a year -- 
Mrs. Duque raised money so crippled children could learn to walk again and sick 
children could return to their homes and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Childrens Hospital, with its 331 beds, 30 outpatient clinics and various other 
treatment programs, is considered the leading pediatric facility in the Western 
United States. Founded in 1901, it has been affiliated with the USC School of 
Medicine since 1932 and is the only pediatric trauma center in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
During her time on the hospital's board of directors, beginning in 1947 and 
culminating in her election to the board presidency in 1970 -- a post she still 
held at her death -- Mrs. Duque expanded women's support groups to nearly 3,700 
members serving in three dozen units in addition to the seven auxiliaries she 
found when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
She personally pursued the purchase of the latest in medical equipment while 
finding time to attend the baptisms and funerals of the hospital's staff and 
their families, most of whom she considered friends. 
</P>
<P>
She solicited funds from people ranging from those she barely knew to those she 
had known since birth. 
</P>
<P>
Her late brother, Harold McAlister, was responsible for a single gift valued at 
$11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Call, chairman of the hospital board, on Monday remembered Mrs. 
Duque as "a driving force behind the unprecedented growth of Childrens 
Hospital. . . . Mary was a rare human being with a special capacity for giving 
and a unique ability to inspire it in others." 
</P>
<P>
H. Russell Smith, an industrialist and chairman emeritus of the hospital board, 
described her simply as the "greatest giver of the opportunity to give by 
others in the history of Los Angeles. She built Childrens Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Duque (pronounced Du-kee), always skittish about her exact age, brought 
toys to patients, helped bring the hospital back from the brink of bankruptcy 
in 1980 and, almost until her death, visited the hospital daily. 
</P>
<P>
In the mornings she greeted the nursing staff with "Good morning, darling 
girls," and left at night saying "Goodby, darling girls." 
</P>
<P>
Friends were in awe of her cheerful energy and said she spoke in "triplicate," 
saying "thank you, thank you, thank you" or "hello, hello, hello." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 26, 1973, the main building at the hospital at Sunset Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue was named for her at a ceremony attended by hundreds of hospital 
staff, friends and admirers. In 1984, a Mary Duque Emeritus Endowment was 
started at the hospital, to honor its single greatest fund-raiser and to 
support teaching and research activities among the hospital's department heads. 
</P>
<P>
Born Mary McAlister to a banking family in St. Joseph, Mo., she came to Los 
Angeles as an infant, attended Westlake and Marlborough schools and then UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. She married attorney Gabriel C. Duque before graduating from 
college and had two sons, Gabriel Jr., who died in 1977, and James. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Duque had earned honorary degrees and several awards, among them selection 
in 1951 as a Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year. In 1969 she became the first 
recipient of the Dorothy Chandler Achievement Award given to former Times Women 
of the Year who have risen to even greater heights in their volunteer or 
professional careers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked many years ago how she had managed to raise such an enormous amount of 
money for a single cause, she disclaimed any special knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child were lying injured in the street, everybody would rush to help, 
wouldn't they?" she asked. "It's the same here. Everyone wants to help. I just 
keep busy doing little things." 
</P>
<P>
Besides her son, Mrs. Duque, a widow, is survived by eight grandchildren and 
two great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers her family is asking contributions 
to the Mary Duque Fund, Childrens Hospital, Box 29, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los 
Angeles 90027.
