  [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said here today that he was "deeply grateful" to late 
former U.S. President Richard Nixon "for his wise counsel on 
many occasions" over the past year. 
  Clinton made the remarks from the White House Rose Garden 
when formally announcing that Nixon had died in New York at 
09:08 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time. 
  He hailed Nixon's contributions in reaching out to countries 
such as China and the former Soviet Union. 
  Clinton said that Nixon "had the wisdom to know when the 
time 
was right to reach out to the Soviet Union and China." 
  He said that his relationship with Nixon was "warm and 
constructive" and that "he went out of his way to give me his 
best advice." 
  Clinton said that he would attend Nixon's funeral in 
California. 
  The U.S. national flag, the Strip and Star [as received], 
will flow at half mast for 30 days, beginning this evening, to 
honor the passing away of Nixon.
