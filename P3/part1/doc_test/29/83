With former President Richard M. Nixon still avoiding most public events, 
organizers of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace put finishing touches 
on the facility today and prepared for this afternoon's arrival of President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At the library, William E. Simon, Nixon's secretary of the Treasury, hosted a 
luncheon for about 50 longtime supporters of Nixon and the library. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Charles (Bebe) Rebozo, one of Nixon's closest friends. 
Max Fisher, an oil magnate and Nixon friend, was also among the guests, as was 
Carl N. Karcher, founder of Orange County-based Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to arrive late this afternoon at El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, and from there will travel to the Anaheim Hilton, where he and his 
party are spending the night. Bush will also keep a low profile today, but will 
host a California Republican Party fund-raising breakfast Thursday before 
attending the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Former members of Nixon's staff are also arriving today and plan a reunion 
cocktail reception at the library. The party is organized by the February 
Group, an organization of former Nixon aides, and Nixon himself is expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be the real first and last conclave of those who have been 
associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his second inaugural," said Patrick 
J. Buchanan, a former Nixon speech writer.
