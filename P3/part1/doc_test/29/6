<P>
Dr. Norman Nixon, a longtime resident who had long and distinguished careers in 
both pediatric medicine and psychiatry, died here Nov. 9 of a stroke. He was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, a native of Burlington, Iowa, started his medical career in Los Angeles, 
where he served on the staff of Los Angeles Children's Hospital before moving 
on to private practice in pediatrics in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While serving as an Army Medical Corps physician at the Santa Ana Army Air Base 
in World War II, Nixon was struck by the number of combat veterans returning 
home with psychological problems, so he turned to psychiatry. After retraining 
at Columbia University in New York, Nixon practiced psychiatry in Philadelphia 
until 1958, when he returned to California and established an office in Laguna 
Beach, where he practiced until 1972. 
</P>
<P>
After three years in Hawaii, Nixon again returned to Orange County and was an 
associate clinical professor of psychiatry at UC Irvine until his retirement in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also established himself as a civic leader, serving on the boards of 
directors of the Laguna Playhouse, the Big Brothers of Orange County and the 
Orange County Mental Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was also president of the Laguna Chamber Music Society, an organizer of 
the South Coast Child Guidance Center and a member of the advisory boards of 
the Art Institute of Southern California and the Laguna Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Virginia Bishop Nixon; a son, William Bishop Nixon 
of Santa Barbara; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
