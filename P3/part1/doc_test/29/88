When Richard Milhous Nixon steps into his birthplace during opening ceremonies 
for his presidential library, it will be as if he had never left home. 
</P>
<P>
There, in its original position against a living room wall, will be the piano 
Nixon practiced on as a boy. In the kitchen will be the same highchair in which 
he and his brothers once sat to eat. And in the bedroom of his parents, Frank 
and Hannah Nixon, will be the very bed upon which Nixon was born 77 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The wood-frame farmhouse built by Nixon's father in 1912 has been restored as a 
nearly identical replica of the home in which the former President spent the 
first nine years of his life before the family moved to Whittier. Even the same 
pepper and palm trees still shade the simple house. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Nixon family and does reflect the family and what it possessed," 
said Ken Raymond, a partner in the San Francisco firm that restored the former 
President's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Dwarfed by the sleek new presidential library next door, the little white house 
is nevertheless considered a prominent feature of the $21-million Richard M. 
Nixon Library and Birthplace. According to officials of the Nixon library 
foundation, the library would not be in Yorba Linda were it not for the 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of view it as the heartbeat of the library," said Raymond, of the 
historical restoration firm of Brown, Raymond, Boulton &amp; Szabo. "It is 
where he was born. The house is a singular expression of the President's 
roots." 
</P>
<P>
The house shows the humble beginnings from which Nixon ascended to the 
presidency. The family lived in poverty under the crushing weight of medical 
expenses for two of Nixon's seriously ill brothers, said Stephen Ambrose, a 
University of New Orleans historian who has authored two Nixon biographies. One 
of Nixon's five brothers died in childhood, Ambrose added. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our last log cabin President," Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Spartan by today's standards, the 900-square-foot house does not contain a 
bathtub and is so compact that almost the entire ground floor can be viewed 
from the living room. Upstairs is the cramped attic loft where Nixon slept with 
his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
As basic as the house is, restoring the home to its original condition was no 
easy feat. The project, which took more than 20 years to complete and cost 
about $450,000, involved everyone from restoration experts to a network of 
Nixon family members who gathered heirlooms to re-create the rooms the Nixon 
boys played in. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to salvage the old house first began in 1968, when Nixon won the 
Republican presidential nomination and civic leaders in his hometown of Yorba 
Linda recognized the historical importance of the home. By that time, it had 
been occupied by a series of people, many of them custodians for the Richard 
Nixon Elementary School that formerly occupied the library site. 
</P>
<P>
Roland E. Bigonger, a Yorba Linda city councilman and local lawyer, joined five 
other civic leaders in forming the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Yorba Linda School District owned the home, Bigonger, now 68, and 
still a councilman, said the district allowed the birthplace foundation to 
maintain and repair it. The foundation put in a standing offer to buy the home 
if the district ever wanted to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
When Nixon was elected President in 1968, Bigonger said the foundation erected 
a flagpole next to the house and installed a plaque noting the site as a 
presidential birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Nixon's sister-in-law, Clara Jane Nixon, set about 
gathering furniture, books and other belongings that Frank and Hannah Nixon had 
used to adorn their Yorba Linda home. Clara Jane Nixon, 70, widow of Nixon's 
brother, Donald, said the vast majority of the items fell into her hands after 
Hannah Nixon's death in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard had just a few things he wanted," said Clara Nixon of Irvine. "The 
rest of it we didn't know what to do with." 
</P>
<P>
With her brother-in-law about to become the nation's 37th President, Clara 
Nixon said she decided to store most of the belongings in the garage of the 
home she and her husband had in Newport Beach, anticipating that some day the 
items would be historically valuable. 
</P>
<P>
She also put out the call to other family members for heirlooms. It turned out 
that her daughter in Yorba Linda had the family's original dinner table. One of 
Hannah Nixon's sisters was using the family's china cabinet. The bed on which 
Nixon was born -- and an 1875 quilt used to cover it -- were found hanging in 
Nixon's grandparents' barn in east Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of safeguarding the family keepsakes, Clara Nixon decided to 
turn them over to the Nixon Birthplace Foundation, which put the items into 
storage in a Santa Ana warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
After Nixon's resignation in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal, Bigonger said the 
birthplace foundation entered what he calls its dark period. For the next three 
years, he said, foundation members gathered as usual in Bigonger's Yorba Linda 
law office, but the meetings were perfunctory and accomplished little. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to hang on," Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
Events began picking up again in 1977 when the Yorba Linda School District 
agreed to sell the Nixon farmhouse and its 1.1-acre tract for $125,000. (The 
Nixon Elementary School was demolished about four years ago because of 
declining enrollment.) Until 1988, when the birthplace foundation merged with 
the library foundation, the house was occupied by maintenance workers who took 
care of it in lieu of paying rent, Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
While ground was being broken for the adjoining library in 1988, Raymond and 
his staff of designers and architects took a look inside the old farmhouse to 
assess what it would take to restore the place. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond said the group was in for a shock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete disaster," said Raymond, who directed the interior 
restoration. "It had not been loved for many years." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, he said, was that each occupant of the home had made 
modifications over the years that, when combined, completely altered the house. 
Walls had been torn down, doors and tiling had been added and a shower and tub 
had been installed where, in Nixon's youth, there had been only a wall-mounted 
sink. And the kitchen had been expanded to include the room where Nixon's 
mother did her canning. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, architects encountered another formidable challenge: virtually all of 
the wood siding was rotted and had to be replaced, said George Szabo, a San 
Diego architect and partner in Raymond's firm, which directed the outside 
restoration. Window frames and the shingle roof also needed replacing, Szabo 
said. And the concrete foundation that Frank Nixon had poured nearly 80 years 
earlier was so badly deteriorated that the house had to be lifted and a new 
foundation poured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The original structure of the house, however, remained intact. The chimney was 
solid. The original trim around the exterior and some floors, walls and plaster 
on the inside were also in good enough shape to remain in place, Szabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (original) craftsmanship was excellent," Szabo said. "It's impressive the 
way it came out. We just brought it back to what it was." 
</P>
<P>
In their restoration work, Raymond and Szabo relied heavily upon advice from 
the former President. In a three-hour meeting at Nixon's New Jersey home last 
October, Raymond said the former President was adamant on a number of points. 
</P>
<P>
"He would say, 'This item was here and this item was there,' " Raymond said. 
"He was very, very clear." 
</P>
<P>
Using Nixon's recollections as a guide, Raymond said he furnished the house as 
closely as he could to match the original. More than 90% of the furnishings 
were in the house at the time the Nixons occupied it, Raymond said. Other 
items, including the stove and beds in the boys' room, were not the family's 
but are representative of the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the restoration was completed in June, Clara Jane Nixon accompanied 
reporters on a tour of the Nixon farmhouse. Standing in the living room that 
she had heard so much about from her late husband, she nodded her head in 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We always dreamed of opening the little home to the public," Clara Nixon said. 
"Now you're going to see this happen."
