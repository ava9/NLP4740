  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- Former Prime Minister 
Chong Il-kwon died of lymph cancer at a hospital in Hawaii late 
Monday [17 January] (Tuesday morning in Korea). He was 77. 
  Since he stepped down as president of the Korea Freedom 
League in April 1991, Chong had been undergoing cancer therapy 
in Washington and Hawaii. 
  He was hospitalized late last year when his illness got 
worse. 
  A graduate of the Japanese Military Academy, Chong was 
general commander during the Korean war (1950-53) and served as 
ambassador to Washington, foreign minister, prime minister 
(1964-1970), a two- term parliamentarian, and house speaker. 
  He is survived by his 47-year-old wife, Pak Hye-su, and two 
children. 
  His body is due to arrive in Seoul around Wednesday.
