open in Norway today

When Norway's Stein Gruben soars off the ski jump with flaming torch in hand
to open the Lillehammer Winter Olympics this afternoon, be prepared for an
explosion of Norwegian national pride and an exuberant celebration of the
country's folksy culture.
Snorting reindeer, swishing sleighs, galloping horses, frolicking trolls and
the music of massed fiddles will fill the snow-carpeted arena above the
postcard-perfect lakeside resort for the opening ceremony.
Above all, there will be dozens of men, women and children on skis. The
primitive-looking pictograms being used as symbols for the Lillehammer games
are derived from 4,000-year-old rock carvings of skiiers found in the Arctic
north of Norway.
More recently, skiing has even played a political role in a country -
notably when the ski-borne heroes of Telemark sabotaged a heavy water plant
crucial to Nazi attempts to make a nuclear bomb during the second world war.
So Norwegians expect great things of their winter athletes. They won no
fewer than nine gold, six silver and five bronze medals in the 1992
Albertville winter games, ranking third in the medals table behind Germany
and the CIS. This year at Lillehammer, they are widely tipped to do even
better.
Hosting the games has, therefore, been seized by Norway as a perfect
opportunity to present itself as a successful small country opening it arms
confidently to the wider world.
But there is a paradox to this picture - one that Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, the
foreign minister, described this week as the conflict between the missionary
and the viking.
To many Norwegians, the games exemplify their independence of spirit,
showing that Norway needs no help in living its life 'on the northern
outskirts of the globe', as Ms Ase Kleveland, the culture minister, put it.
These viking-like characteristics are best illustrated by Norway's stubborn
insistence last year on resuming commercial whaling, in the face of strong
international opposition, and its continued culling of baby seals.
It is also to be found in Norwegian resistance to joining the European
Union, due to be tested in a referendum before the end of this year. This
week, Norway's prickly nature was again evident in a spate of inhospitable
criticism from Norwegian athletes and the domestic media of Mr Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the Spanish president of the International Olympic Committee,
which oversees the organisation of the Olympics. Mr Samaranch was accused of
being undemocratic and was also publicly reminded of his past links with the
late General Franco's fascist regime.
But the Olympics are also a chance for Norway to show what Mr Godal called
its missionary side, evident in its efforts at mediation last year, which
helped produce the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Norway also has a long record of commitment to United Nations peacekeeping
operations and is a world leader in dispensing development aid, on which it
spends more than 1 per cent of GNP each year. Moreover, Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the Labour party prime minister, has been a champion of world
environmental awareness - notwithstanding her backing for Minke whale
hunting.
Mr Tore Hagebakken is one of those who hopes the games will promote Norway's
international instincts. The Labour mayor of Gjovik, an Olympic site close
to Lillehammer best known for its extraordinary ice hockey stadium blasted
out of the inside of a mountain, points optimistically to the latest opinion
poll, which shows that opposition to EU membership is falling sharply.
'It is difficult to win the (pro-EU) argument in Norway,' he says. 'People
are afraid they will lose their independence. But I hope the games will
change this a little bit. We wanted to bring the games here to be more
international - to show we have a lot of friends in Europe and all over the
world and there is nothing to be afraid of.'
Certainly, if the attitude of the 30,000 Norwegians who packed Thursday's
rehearsal for the opening Olympic ceremony is a guide, there is now great
national enthusiasm for hosting the games, despite initial disquiet over the
escalating costs incurred during a recession.
The Labour government has ended up spending NKr7bn (Pounds 632m) on the
games, more than three times the estimates made when Lillehammer won the
Olympics in 1989. A net deficit of NKr4.3bn is projected, and there are
doubts about the future economic viability of many Olympic sites. These
include two new ski jumps, a bobsleigh run, three skating rinks and the
Hamar Olympic hall, a speed-skating stadium in the shape of an upturned
viking ship.
But one factor in the high spending has been widely welcomed and has set a
standard for future Olympic Games, whether winter and summer. For the first
time a host city has made a priority of organising the games along
'environmentally friendly' lines.
After an acrimonious fight with the Norwegian Society for the Conservation
of Nature over the siting of the Hamar speed skating hall, which encroaches
on important wetlands for migrant birds, the Lillehammer Olympic Organising
Committee embraced the idea of running a 'green games'. A member of the
conservation society was employed to direct the environmental effort - which
was made one of the 'success criteria' for the games.
The results have been significant. The bobsleigh run was moved from its
original site to a less obtrusive position; the ski jumps were built below
the skyline; the athletes' village blends with local architecture and
includes several buildings that can be moved elsewhere after the games; and,
during construction, contractors were fined up to Dollars 7,000 for each
tree they knocked down.
The effort to be environmentally friendly goes well beyond the construction
of the games infrastructure. A huge recycling effort means all meals are
being served on plates made of potato and maize starch and eaten with
similarly-made utensils - all of which can be turned into compost. All the
bullets from the guns of the biathletes - participants in the cross-country
skiing and shooting event - will, for the first time, be collected for
recycling using special target backdrops.
The only aspect of the environment the organisers have no control over is
the weather. With 1.3m of snow already blanketing Lillehammer, the last
thing the Winter Olympics need is more winter weather. The Lillehammer
Olympic Organising Committee is praying for clear skies.
