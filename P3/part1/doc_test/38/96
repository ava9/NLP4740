It's 10 years this week that the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team stuck its foot into 
the glass slipper and walked away with a gold medal at Lake Placid, a fairy 
tale if there ever was one, and, boy, where does the time go? Herb Brooks 
looked so young and mean back then, and like his players it's hard to imagine 
him ever growing old. And now Herb Brooks is 52. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lake Placid has aged, too, a few of the details growing fuzzy, 
the mind playing a few tricks. But the story endures because the kids from the 
U S of A did more than just capture a championship. They began the Olympics as 
longshots; they left as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
These weren't high-priced superstars tooling around in Ferraris and hanging out 
at Elaine's. They were collegians and failed minor-leaguers giving it their 
best shot and, what the heck, seeing what could happen. The Soviets were big 
and powerful -- invincible, we all thought. Team USA was made up of youngsters 
from down the block who mowed your lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a meeting we had early on, after the team was picked," said Rob 
McClanahan, then a center and now a sales broker in Chicago. "Herb gave us a 
talk and although he didn't say this exactly, the message was something like, 
'If we play very well, get some breaks, we could win a bronze medal. If we play 
over our heads, catch a huge break, we can get a silver. The gold is the 
Russians'. Forget about it."' 
</P>
<P>
But it's been a long time, so every once in a while the memories become 
blurred. A guy will say, "Remember the night the USA beat the Soviets and won 
the gold medal?" And, of course, it didn't happen that way at all. The United 
States beat the Soviets all right, but it was two days later -- Feb. 24, 1980 
-- that the Americans clinched the gold medal by defeating Finland. Odd, but 
that game is like a footnote now. 
</P>
<P>
"Know what?" said Mark Johnson, who plays for the New Jersey Devils these days. 
"Everyone thinks we won the gold medal in the game against the Russians, except 
the people who were there." It's, like, as long as they beat the Soviets, 
nothing else matters. 
</P>
<P>
But it does. Those upstarts from small towns like Grand Rapids, Minn., and 
Charleston, Mass., tossing their sticks in the air, Mike Eruzione collapsed in 
tears, Jim Craig wrapped in an American flag and asking, "Where's my father?" 
-- that was like something out of a TV movie that, naturally, it became. If you 
happened to miss it, it was called "Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie?" McClanahan said. "To me, it was a little sappy." 
</P>
<P>
Like anything else, the movie exaggerated a few facts, ignored some others, and 
squashed eight months of practice, travel and competition into three hours in 
prime time. It came across like a real tearjerker, all hearts and flowers. The 
fact is, the Olympians rode a bumpy path to Lake Placid. People forget that. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Americans arrived, they were exhausted and cranky from a 
nationwide tour. There was some squabbling. And the country really didn't take 
much notice of the team until the game against the Soviets, a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets had demolished the United States, 10-3, in a pre-Olympic game at 
Madison Square Garden. So Brooks figured he'd better have something good to say 
to inspire his young players. 
</P>
<P>
The locker room was hushed when he stood up before the game, reached into his 
pocket and fished out a wrinkled slip of paper. And then he said: 
</P>
<P>
"You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is 
your moment." 
</P>
<P>
As speeches go, it was right up there with Knute Rockne telling Notre Dame to 
win one for the Gipper. But, it turns out, Brooks really hadn't been sure of 
what he wanted to say. He scribbled down a few notes and phrases and then kind 
of blurted them out, not exactly the way the story's been passed down. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks laughs about it now. "It just sort of came out the way it did," he said. 
"Let me tell you something, it was no Gettysburg Address." 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say it did the job. Johnson's shot with one second left in the first 
period pulled the United States into a 2-2 tie and the Soviets, panicking, 
yanked their famous goalie, Vladislav Tretiak. Behind 3-2 in the third period, 
the Americans fought back with goals by Dave Silk and Eruzione, won the game, 
4-3, and the fable began to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The natural reaction was to think that the dispirited Soviets had nothing but 
contempt for the Americans. It also was natural to think the Americans loved 
sticking it to the Soviets, them being Communists and all. But as Eruzione 
said, "We were athletes, and to us it was an athletic event. We didn't think of 
it as a political event." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, they were too busy slapping helmets and trying to grasp the 
enormity of their victory. And the Soviets, well, they understood and 
appreciated just what the U.S. players had achieved, although it wasn't until 
later that congratulations were passed along in a whisper and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after leaving the ice, Johnson was in an office supplying a urine 
sample to the drug-testing people when he caught the eye of Boris Mikhailov, 
the Soviet captain, sitting on a bench across the room. Mikhailov motioned 
Johnson closer. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys play very well," he said, his thick accent right out of a spy flick. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me," Johnson said. "I didn't expect it. To be honest, he sounded 
happy for us." 
</P>
<P>
That victory got the puck rolling. The Americans, cast in the role of upstarts, 
had a wholesome appeal, even if some of it was contrived. True, they were 
bouncy, happy, working-class kids, but their closeness has always been a little 
overstated. Remember, some teammates got bugged when Brooks bent the rules and 
let defenseman Ken Morrow keep his beard. 
</P>
<P>
"We were close," Morrow said. "But we also had a lot of different groups -- 
cliques -- guys from Boston, guys from Michigan, a big Minnesota contingent. 
There was always a lot of kidding going on, a lot of rivalry. What I'm trying 
to say is, we were just like any normal team." 
</P>
<P>
Morrow would go on to win four Stanley Cups with the New York Islanders after 
winning the gold medal, which must be some kind of record, and now is an 
assistant coach with the New York Rangers' farm team in Flint, Mich. Craig 
rebounded from a brief, checkered NHL career, eventually was cleared of 
criminal charges stemming from a fatal automobile accident and currently is a 
sales representative in Brockton, Mass. Mark Pavelich, who always skated to his 
own beat, hunts and fishes in the Minnesota woods. 
</P>
<P>
But it's funny how things work out sometimes. Johnson and Viacheslav Fetisov, 
the great Soviet defenseman, are teammates now with the Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the Olympians, plus Brooks and assistant coach Craig Patrick, rode 
the wave of popularity to careers in the NHL. For most of them, though, there's 
been nothing like the afternoon they beat the Finns, 4-2, for the gold medal 
while the crowd in Lake Placid chanted, "U!S!A!" 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we write history books," Brooks said. "It gives us perspective. And 
the perspective we have now is that we proved that certain ingredients and the 
proper intangibles shared by a group can make things happen for the betterment 
of that group; that a work ethic, comradeship, and love and respect for 
teammates can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"And we learned good things happen if the group has its head screwed on right." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the line that everyone remembers is Al Michaels shouting: "Do you 
believe in miracles?" Now, the word "miracle" gets a lot of exposure, what with 
every game-winning, ground-rule double immediately videotaped and immortalized. 
The Americans, all freckles and goose bumps, coming out of nowhere to beat the 
odds and win the gold, that may not exactly qualify as a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
But it's close.
