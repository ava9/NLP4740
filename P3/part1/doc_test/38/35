FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: Ice skaters turn up the heat - The red-hot drama at
Lillehammer / Winter Olympics

Skating is the story of the winter Olympics, which start today in
Lillehammer, a little town in Norway 120 miles north of Oslo. The hot news
includes the return of Torvill and Dean; the physical attack on America's
ice belle, Nancy Kerrigan; and the re-appearance of German star Katarina
Witt - once described, memorably, as 'sex on skates'. All are themes that
will have global audiences glued to their television screens.
British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won gold medals in
the 1984 Olympics. Judges gave them unanimous 6.0s for artistic merit as
they glided around the rink to Ravel's stirring Bolero. Their 100 per cent
score is unique. Since then, they have been professionals, taking their own
highly-profitable ice show on tour from the tropics to the Arctic.
They are taking a huge gamble in Norway, though. Revision of the rules by
the International Skating Union allows professionals such as Torvill and
Dean, Witt and US male gold medallist Brian Boitano to bid once more for
glory at an 'amateur' level. But it does not explain why they feel compelled
to do it.
Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the women's individual gold medal in 1992 at
Albertville, does not understand. She says she cannot imagine why anyone
would turn their backs on the certain rewards of professionalism for the
plain fare and butterflies of a fortnight at Lillehammer (pop: 23,000).
Since December, Torvill and Dean's comeback trail has included wins at the
British championships and victory - by the narrowest of margins - at the
more demanding European titles in Copenhagen. But no one ever has returned
to the Olympics after a decade and won gold.
To this, Dean retorts: 'Obviously, we think we can win. Jayne wouldn't be
trying if we didn't think it was possible. We're not doing this to make up
the numbers. It's costing us a lot of money, possibly into six figures if
you include lost professional opportunities.
'We've been skating solidly for 10 years and we're better than we were in
1984. Doing six numbers a night in an ice show is harder work than one
four-minute number. We've developed artistically and our stamina is just as
good.'
Their four-minute turn in Norway will be as a virtual reincarnation of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers, sashaying to the swing notes of Let's Face the
Music and Dance. New ISU rules ban such highly-wrought routines as Bolero;
the new ones are much lighter in tone.
Despite that, Witt is performing her routine to the idealistic 1960s' ballad
Where Have all the Flowers Gone? Gold medallist in 1984 and 1988, she is
only 28 and claims her return to the Olympic front-line is in pursuit of
global peace.
Witt's recent progress, however, has been as erratic as the world's quest
for harmony. She fell heavily when unveiling her new programme at a
Frankfurt show, managed only second in her national competition, and burst
into tears when a lacklustre showing in Copenhagen left her no higher than
eighth.
Yet, her supporters within skating - and they are legion - insist that
Witt's forte always has been artistic and emotional expression on the ice.
Triple jumps may be left to the youngsters but 'Kati' can bring on the
tears, especially for the big event.
Little by way of choreographed drama, though, could match the attack in
Detroit last month on US skater Nancy Kerrigan. She was competing at her
country's national championships and attempting to qualify for Lillehammer.
As the glamorous Kerrigan sat at the rink-side, an assailant smashed at her
knee with an iron bar. Screaming in pain, she was taken to hospital. Later,
Jeff Gillooly, former husband of Kerrigan's main US rival, Tonya Harding,
admitted his involvement in the assault.
More damning still, Gillooly claimed to federal prosecutors that he,
Harding, her bodyguard Shawn Eckardt and two other men conspired to injure
Kerrigan and keep her out of the Olympics.
Harding has proclaimed her innocence and no independent evidence has been
produced to implicate her. Nevertheless, the US Figure Skating Association
plans a disciplinary hearing while leaving the actual decision as to whether
she can compete in Norway to the US Olympic Association.
Adding to the confusion, one of the most powerful figures in the
International Olympic Committee, Canadian lawyer Dick Pound, has suggested
that while the matter remains in legal limbo, Harding should be allowed to
take part.
Harding herself has launched a Dollars 20m lawsuit against the USOA and
sought an injunction restraining it from taking any action to discipline her
before the resolution of any legal proceedings arising from the assault. US
team spirit in Lillehammer should prove interesting.
Kerrigan, meanwhile, seems to have emerged with her position enhanced. She
has been pronounced physically and mentally fit for the Olympics, and it is
inconceivable that a team selector would keep her on the bench.
After watching her perform at a practice rink, US Olympic official Chuck
Foster said: 'If there were any doubt or any questions about Nancy
Kerrigan's skating condition, she answered them for us totally.'
