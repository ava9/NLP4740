Carol Davidson will return home to North Hollywood with three U.S. Olympic 
Festival medals, but not the one she wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, 30, won a medal in every event -- except women's singles. Arditch 
Lonnon of St. Paul, Minn., knocked off Davidson 21-18, 9-21, 13-21, 23-21, 
21-16, in the quarterfinal round Thursday night at Oklahoma Christian College's 
Payne Field House. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson was the second-highest-ranked player in the Olympic Festival field. 
Only Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., was rated higher, and Davidson had 
already defeated her once in team competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ai later defeated Lonnon to win the gold medal, 21-12, 21-14, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
"With this field I felt I should have won the tournament," Davidson said. 
"Normally I can hit, but I played too defensive. I didn't play smart." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson advanced to the quarterfinals with a perfect record in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
She defeated Kristey Reed of Enola, Pa., 21-11, 21-8; Donna Sakai of Lanham, 
Md., 21-17, 21-14; and Kerry Terrel of Richland, Wash., 21-11, 21-15. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, the 1986 U. S. women's amateur singles champion, has won nine medals 
-- two golds, one silver and six bronze -- in five Festival appearances. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she won a gold medal in women's doubles and bronzes in the team and 
mixed doubles events. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
For the second match in a row, the North team, with Coley Kyman at middle 
blocker, won its first game then lost three in a row. This time it was the West 
that took advantage for a 6-15, 15-5, 15-13, 15-12 victory at Lloyd Noble Arena 
in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman, a two-time City 3-A player of the year at Reseda High who will be a 
freshman at Cal State Northridge in the fall, was second on the North with 15 
kills. He also had a team-high two service aces and a stuff block. 
</P>
<P>
TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fruin, Kevin Withrow and Mike Hurdle combined to score 12 goals for the 
West, but the South pulled out an 18-14 win at the State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Fruin, from Camarillo, had five goals; Withrow, from Thousand Oaks, had four; 
and Hurdle, from Reseda, added three. 
</P>
<P>
FIELD HOCKEY 
</P>
<P>
The two teams dominated by Valley-area players -- the West and the South -- 
will battle for bronze today. 
</P>
<P>
The North defeated the West, 2-1, on a penalty stroke shoot-out at Cameron 
University in Lawton, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The North's opponent in Friday's gold-medal game will be the East, which scored 
four second-half goals to defeat the South, 4-2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Derek Wallace, a former Chatsworth High standout, took the loss as the East 
turned 13 hits and five errors into a 13-2 victory over the West at All Sports 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The East, which will play the North in Saturday's gold medal game, was paced by 
Doug Hecker of Wantgh, N. Y., and pitcher Rob Mosser of Oley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Hecker went 4 for 5 with two doubles, two triples and five runs batted in. 
Mosser pitched a three-hitter and retired 18 in a row from the third inning 
through the eighth.
