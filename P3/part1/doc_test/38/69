for green shoots in the snow

THE GREEN shoots of recovery are beginning to show in the ski industry, a
mainstay of the Rhone Alpes economy, but they are still fragile.
There are mixed reasons for this in the region which traditionally attracts
60 per cent of all French winter sports bookings. One is fall-out from the
1992 winter Olympics in the Tarentaise resorts around Albertville. Another
is two seasons of better snow following three years of dismally bald pistes.
Then there is a recovery in consumer spending in the US - an important
market for Salomon and Skis Rossignol, the leading ski equipment makers
based near Annecy and Grenoble respectively.
The winter Olympics gave the region's ski industry the biggest shot in the
arm since the 1968 Olympic games came to Grenoble. Like most shots in the
arm, it caused initial pain to the patient - in the form of a decline in
winter sports bookings during the games early last year. Holiday skiers were
frightened off by the prospect of crowds and traffic jams.
Excellent December snowfalls attracted them back to the slopes in large
numbers. Christmas week ski resort bookings were up by 15 per cent,
according to the Rhone-Alpes regional council. But much of the snow had
melted by late January. The industry fears that mass cancellations for
February, usually the peak month, could ruin the season's good start.
'We are finding a new optimism in the market. But our fortunes are more
sensitive to changes in the climate than in the economy,' says Mr
Jean-Jacques Bompard, secretary general of Skis Rossignol, the world's
largest supplier of skis (under its own name and as Dynastar).
New motorways and express rail lines have been built around the Olympic
sites. The Olympics also provided some communes with ice rinks and halls
surplus to immediate requirements - a financial headache for some, but an
improvement in the capacity of the winter tourism industry.
Whether economic recovery proves real or illusory, both the leading ski
equipment groups have long come to accept that they live in a mature market.
Skis Rossignol, for example, forecasts that world demand for skis from all
producers should rise from 5.9m pairs in 1991-1992 to more than 6m pairs
this season, of which more than a quarter will be Rossignol brands. Yet that
only brings sales back to the same level as four years ago.
To guarantee long term survival, both groups have followed a similar
strategy: trimming operating costs and diversifying into other sports
equipment.
Salomon, the larger of the two companies with sales of FFr1.5bn last year,
was the first to diversify beyond its core business of ski-bindings, in
which it is world market leader with a 44 per cent share. In 1984 it bought
Taylor Made, a US golf club maker which has since prospered. Then came an
innovative ski model, made of a single shell rather than of the conventional
sandwich design. Since its launch in 1989, this model has taken at least a
fifth of the market for skis priced at FFr2,000 and up.
'We could have bought a ski company, but there would have been no point
because we would have had to invest in complete retooling for our new
design. I am glad we started from scratch,' says Mr Jean-Francois Gautier,
the young chief executive brought in two years ago by Mr Georges Salomon,
the retiring company founder.
The group had to suffer 380 French job losses two years ago - a serious blow
to the small lakeside town of Annecy. Since then, however, it seems to have
turned the corner.
Rossignol, which still devotes 64 per cent of turnover to skis, has followed
a slightly different diversification strategy. It began in 1977 with the
launch of a line of tennis rackets which has since proved a flop. Rossignol
stopped production in France last year and has now turned to Asian
subcontractors.
Rossignol's main diversifications outside skis are its two lines of ski
boots, its own and Lange, a maker of competition boots it bought in 1989,
which now account for nearly a fifth pf its sales and 11.5 per cent of the
world downhill boot market.
Rossignol's recovery has been weaker than Salomon's, but Mr Bompard is
expecting a profit this year. Everything hinges on the weather.
