WHEN the Olympic party is winding down, one's attention turns to farewells.
Some stars have announced their retirement from Olympic competition. In
other cases a glance at the calendar provides its own brutal conclusion.
Evelyn Ashford is going of her own accord. The US 100 metres runner has been
among the best-loved of that country's galaxy of sprinters.
Now 35, she first competed at the 1976 Montreal Games, coming fifth in the
100m. She holds the second-fastest time ever for the distance and has broken
11 seconds 33 times.
At the Los Angeles Games Ashford won two gold medals, taking another in the
4x100m relay in Seoul. Watch for a tidal wave of emotion in the big stadium
when she runs her final relay tomorrow.
Fate has been less kind to another, equally talented, female runner. Ana
Quirot has had the misfortune to be Cuban in a decade when politics have
been as big a factor at the Olympics as the stopwatch.
Since the early 1980s she has been winning World Cups and Pan-American
titles. What Ana did not do, because of boycotts, was run in the Los Angeles
or Seoul Games. Barcelona was her first Olympics, and a bronze medal was the
best this fine athlete could manage.
One must wonder if Carl Lewis will thrill another Olympic stadium? He had
some claim to bad luck in the sprint trials for the US team but a look at
Linford Christie's gold medal in the 100m gives a clue to their joint
futures.
At 32 Christie was older by four years than any previous 100m champion and
his chances of repeating the triumph in four years' time, in Atlanta, must
be minuscule. Lewis is just a few months younger than the British star.
Predicting the age at which swimmers need to find another pool has become
risky. Money has kept mature swimmers such as US hero Matt Biondi in the
water far longer than one would have predicted at Seoul, where he won seven
medals, five of them gold. Biondi has won two gold medals in Barcelona. 'If
you've been around the block, you know how to go around the block,' shrugs
Biondi, 26.
British swimming stars Adrian Moorhouse and Sharron Davies have both
announced their goodbyes to Olympic competition. Both have been British
swimming's only instantly recognisable characters and the sport will miss
their charisma.
On top of the water rather than in it, Barcelona seems certain to sound the
swansong for Italy's extraordinary Abbagnale brothers. Rowing has seldom
seen a duo such as Giuseppe, 33, and Carmine, 30.
In the coxed pairs they have won seven of the last nine world championships
and came to Barcelona looking for their third consecutive Olympic gold
medal. Ironically, Britain's Searle brothers - Jonathan, 23, and Gregory, 20
 -took the gold medal in that event. They are exactly 10 years younger than
the Abbagnales.
Another, somewhat larger, ensemble we may not see again is American
basketball's Dream Team. US officials are saying that the squad for the next
Games may exclude National Basketball Association players. 'Bird', 'Magic'
and 'Air' have looked too much like Ugly Americans with their squabbles over
sponsorship and status.
Finally, Adios] to a few animals. That much-loved horse Murphy Himself has
raced his final cross-country event for British rider Ian Stark, who says
that Murphy was the greatest horse he ever rode.
Few people have said such kind things about Cobi, the squashy little mascot
used to market the Games. Atlanta's designers are working in secrecy on his
successor.
