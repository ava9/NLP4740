And the new world champion in the men's downhill is . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pirmin Zurbriggen? Guess again, he tied for 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Girardelli? Nope, Luxembourg's one-man ski team was 21st. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mueller? No, but you're getting warmer. The defending gold medalist from 
1987 placed second and got the silver medal this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Give up? 
</P>
<P>
It was Hansjoerg Tauscher, so little known that his biography wasn't even 
included in the sport's bible, "Ski Racing Redbook," for the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, the country that gave the world tennis stars Steffi Graf and 
Boris Becker, now has a ski champion, too. He is 21, from Oberstdorf, and his 
best finish in a World Cup downhill so far this season was a fifth place at 
Laax, Switzerland, last month. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in future cup races, he's the reigning titleholder until 
the next World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, Jan. 
21-Feb. 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, starting No. 9, sailed down the 2 1/8-mile Beaver Creek course in 2 
minutes 10.39 seconds Monday, edging Mueller, who was No. 11, by .19 of a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, 31, who earned his fifth straight medal -- one gold and four silvers 
-- in world championship and Olympic competition since 1984, led a Swiss sweep 
of the four places behind Tauscher. Karl Alpiger earned the bronze by finishing 
another .09 behind Mueller, and was followed by countrymen Daniel Mahrer and 
William Besse. 
</P>
<P>
If there was any prerace hint that this might be Tauscher's day, it could have 
been the fact that he was racing on Volkl skis, the same make used by 
Switzerland's Maria Walliser when she demolished the women's downhill field by 
1 1/2 seconds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they are very effective on courses made soft by a fresh snowfall, 
according to Mueller, who uses Blizzard skis. 
</P>
<P>
But Tauscher said: "Yes, the ski plays a big role, as was shown today and 
yesterday, but you still have to be able to ski the ski." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller did not seem disappointed with his second place, saying, "Every 
downhiller likes to win, but any medal is a good job, especially on this easy 
course and under the changed conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The new snow in the last three days made it easy for anybody to win. We have 
not had conditions like this in a major race for five or six years. There was 
just not enough time to make the necessary adjustments in technique or (skis)." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller was not surprised that his teammate Zurbriggen, the 1988 Olympic 
downhill champion, and Girardelli, who won three of the last four World Cup 
downhills, fared so poorly here. 
</P>
<P>
"They have had the same difficulties under similar conditions before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher didn't worry about the new snow or anything else. He just skied as if 
he owned the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good run, but it wasn't perfect," he said. "I never thought I could 
beat the kings, Mueller and Zurbriggen. They have always been my heroes, along 
with Markus Wasmeier (of West Germany), so this is a fantasy come true. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not even able to realize yet what this gold medal will mean. It is going 
to take weeks or months for me to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was surprised by his victory, Tauscher said, "When I had that 
finish in the top five at Laax, I knew that I might have a chance to win a race 
sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Tauscher, it turns out, came to skiing somewhat reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 2 years old the first time I skied and I didn't enjoy it a bit," he 
said. "But later, after I started to school, I decided to try skiing again, and 
this time I liked it. Then I began racing and moving up through the different 
levels until I got to where I am now." 
</P>
<P>
Which is the new official king of the downhill for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, trying for his second straight gold medal after winning the men's 
combined last week, congratulated Tauscher but said, "I had no chance in this 
race. On such a course, your equipment must be perfectly suited to the snow 
conditions. If it's not, you can forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen, who at least finished six places higher than Girardelli, said, "I 
can't be too unhappy, since I have already won many titles. Tauscher had a 
great race, but unfortunately, when you make one mistake on this course, you 
have lost the race. 
</P>
<P>
"My ribs (injured in a training spill last Wednesday) still bother me somewhat, 
but I hope to win a medal yet." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing 15th place with Zurbriggen, exactly 2 seconds behind the winner, were 
Christophe Ple of France and -- surprise -- an American, Jeff Olson, 23, of 
Bozeman, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more shocking, another U.S. racer finished ahead of Olson. Tommy 
Moe, 11 days short of his 19th birthday, was 13th, 1.88 seconds out, after 
starting No. 35. 
</P>
<P>
The native of Missoula, Mont., who now lives in Palmer, Alaska, said he had 
never been higher than 52nd in six World Cup downhills. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Mueller that the course "was not really tough," but added, 
"You've just got to nail every section." 
</P>
<P>
Moe nailed enough of them to build up U.S. hopes for '91 and the Winter 
Olympics the following year at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's race, delayed two days by the early-weekend storm, was held in subzero 
temperatures but under sunny skies, with a crowd of about 2,000 shivering in 
the finish area. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tamara McKinney of the United States, winner of the women's combined 
gold medal last week, will again challenge Switzerland's Vreni Schneider in the 
women's slalom at Beaver Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Then the remaining events -- the two super-G races Wednesday, the men's giant 
slalom Thursday, the women's giant slalom Saturday and the men's slalom Sunday 
-- will be held on Vail Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look now, but after the first four events, the Swiss, who won eight of 10 
gold medals in the 1987 world championships on their home slopes in 
Crans-Montana, have only one gold medal here -- the same as West Germany, 
Luxembourg and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schneider figures to break up that deadlock before sundown today.
