FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (11): Nothing is left to
chance - Ski technology / Olympic skiers are constantly seeking new
developments in the shape and structure of skis to help them go faster. But
is the skill of skiing being eclipsed by its hardware?

Downhill ski racing, one of the fastest Olympic sports in which speeds of
80-90mph are often achieved, might leave the Olympic founders turning in
their graves.
Surrounded by the kind of road show more normally seen in Formula One motor
racing, ski racers receive the attentions and obsessions of coaches,
physiotherapists, waxing specialists and video technicians.
Armed with different pairs of skis for each snow temperature, nothing is
left to chance. Results hinge on hundredths of a second and the slimmest
advantages can be worth extracting. Surprise equipment can be a useful
gambit.
Franz Klammer, appearing at the 1976 Innsbruck Games with large holes in his
ski tips, achieved a publicity sensation for his then ski sponsor, Fischer.
The tip of a ski creates a little pocket of air turbulence, so the open tip
was more than a talking point. There was a desperate scramble to copy the
idea until ski makers realised they could achieve the same result by simply
shortening and reducing the height of the tip.
In common with all technology-tied sports, competitors are strictly
regulated. The International Ski Federation (FIS) lays down rules on what
equipment is, and is not, permitted. Several years ago, a Scottish inventor
came up with a device that would pump a lubricant through holes in a ski to
reduce its friction against snow. The FIS banned this device because it
might pollute the snow for subsequent racers.
More recently, controversy has surrounded the use of another speed-enhancing
accessory called the Derbyflex and now known as the Deflex. This is an alloy
suspension unit like a shallow bridge, screwed into the top of the ski, on
to which the bindings are mounted. Under the suspension plate lies a
dampening layer of viscoelastic material that absorbs shocks from the ski.
Skis fitted with the Deflex proved to be so fast when first used a few
winters ago that racers rushed to pay cash for the device - unheard of in a
sport where top racers are themselves paid handsomely to bolt their feet to
designated ski brands.
Skiing on a raised platform has other advantages. Firstly, the ski has less
of a flat spot under the boot; it flexes more naturally and hugs the terrain
more closely. Secondly, the racer gains extra leverage in turning the ski;
the tilting of the boot is transmitted more into a carving effect at the
ski's edges.
Racers are now fitting riser pads to take their boots even higher. I am
using 1 centimetre spacers,' says British downhiller Martin Bell. 'In
addition to the Deflex, that means I am now 2.2 cm above the ski (almost one
inch). The boots drag less in soft snow which could be another speed
advantage.'
It is a distinct reversal from the position a few years ago, when racers
insisted on having their feet as close and sensitive to the snow as
possible, sometimes by thinning out the soles of their ski boots.
The under-surface of a ski is, of course, its primary speed component. The
ski base - a sheet of polyethylene only two millimetres thick, edged by
thin, sharpened, strips of steel - has always been a subject of myth and
fetish. Service technicians spend hours grinding, filing, waxing, scraping
and polishing ski soles.
Recently, the emphasis has switched from waxing the sole to 'structuring'
it. Structuring is the brushing or grinding of tiny grooves into the smooth
plastic surface to break up suction, which is a particular problem in
warmer, wetter snow.
A ski-maker's real secrets are locked into the core of the ski, and the many
layers of advanced materials above and below the core. In spite of the use
of advanced alloys and composite materials, wood remains the chosen core
material. Many racers, however, know very little about the constituent
materials of their skis and the racing divisions of ski factories are run as
semi-autonomous and secret departments.
The outer shape of skis has generated much discussion recently. Equipment
market leader Salomon launched its 'monocoque' ski four years ago and
insists that this form of chassis, where an outer shell of composite
materials controls the performance of the ski, supersedes traditional ski
construction.
Salomon has started to make the break in terms of winning race medals but
its competitors continue to win races with conventional skis where the
construction emphasis is more on the ski's innards.
At the Albertville Olympics, racers took the unusual step of choosing
shorter, slower skis simply to get down the run intact. The steep, testing,
Bellevarde Face downhill above Val d'Isere contained so many tight turns
that most racers reduced their ski lengths by up to 8 cm simply to get
through the gates. The normal length of 223cm became 215cm. At Lillehammer,
on a more gliding course, racers are likely to be back on 223s.
One element of a racer's kit is so critical and personal that changes are
viewed with a mixture of suspicion and superstition: ski boots.
Ski racers - much to the frustration of the manufacturers of high-gloss,
colourful, new models - often use boots that are several seasons old. The
shells are often hacked about to create the right flex pattern, sometimes
with additional pieces bolted on. The inner boot is often in embarrassingly
tatty condition, usually custom foamed for the closest fit, but often with
pieces shaved away or specially layered with extra pads.
Because Norway's mountains are less steep and testing than the Alps - the
highlight of the skiing at Lillehammer will be the Nordic cross-country and
jumping events. Here, technology has had a gentler impact, but is equally
influential.
Watch out for the first examples of cable-free bindings under the feet of
Nordic ski jumpers. These are new bindings that grip the toe of the boot
without the aid of a cable pulling it forward at the heel.
In cross-country skiing, the recent introduction of a 'skating' technique,
where skiers propel themselves by pulling one ski out of the track and
diagonally skating it, is having a marked effect on the kind of boots used.
More ankle support is needed from the boot, with bindings and skis that
maximise the driving effect of the skate. No other area of ski equipment
puts lightness at such a premium.
