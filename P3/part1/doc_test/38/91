Florence Griffith Joyner, named the Sullivan Award winner for 1988 as the 
nation's top amateur athlete, says she's finding retirement difficult to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would miss it this much," said FloJo, who announced her 
retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I looked forward to the days when I wouldn't have to get up and run 
around and lift weights, but I really miss it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner won three gold medals and a silver at the 1988 Olympics at 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by her husband, Al Joyner, and wiping away tears, she said: "It took 
me 20 years to get a world record and a gold medal. If I had to do it all over, 
I wouldn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
She thanked her husband, who served as her coach in the final months of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done so much," she said. "Getting up in the morning for workouts and 
sometimes at midnight. He gave up a lot of his career." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the long jump, is now being coached by 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked myself, 'Was I this hard on her?' " he said. "She shows no pity for 
me. She really makes me work." 
</P>
<P>
The stop in Indianapolis is just another mark on a hectic international travel 
schedule the 29-year-old from Los Angeles has maintained since setting two 
world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent months I've been to Germany, Harvard, New York, back to Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Houston and back to San Francisco. I'll be home a couple of days 
and then I'll be on the road again," she said. "In May, I'll be heading to 
Japan for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner joins her sister-in-law, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, on the list of 
Sullivan winners. Joyner-Kersee was the 1986 winner. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is way beyond anything I ever dreamed," Griffith Joyner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other Olympians also were finalists -- swimmers Matt Biondi and Janet 
Evans, figure skater Brian Boitano, kayaker Greg Barton, speedskater Bonnie 
Blair, volleyball player Karch Kiraly, boxer Roy Jones, basketball player 
Katrina McClain and wrestler John Smith.
