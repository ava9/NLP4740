Bear Mountain's big expansion plans appear to be on track again after a public 
meeting Tuesday night at Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well," said Tim Cohee, vice president of the ski area 
formerly known as Goldmine. "We're optimistic that details will be worked out 
with the city and the U.S. Forest Service, so that we can begin work in July or 
August." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, officials of S-K-I, which also owns Killington in Vermont, 
expressed frustration at the slow progress in obtaining approval for the eight- 
to 10-year development program at their recently acquired resort in the San 
Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But Cohee said Wednesday that $4 million worth of improvements are planned for 
this summer, including construction of a major quad chairlift and the addition 
of 20 acres of ski terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The lift, Bear Mountain's 11th, will boost the uphill capacity from 6,100 
skiers an hour to about 7,000, and the skiable acreage will increase to about 
165. When completed, the plan calls for 18 lifts with a capacity of 9,600 
skiers, serving 314 acres, plus expanded snow-making and base facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Cohee said that Bear Mountain will wind up this season on either April 8 or 15 
with about a 4% decrease in skier-days from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That indicates we made a significant recovery after a slow start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three other Southland ski areas are still operating, with snow depths 
ranging from eight to 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, near Wrightwood, will close Sunday night, but Snow Valley, near 
Running Springs, and Snow Summit, at Big Bear, hope to run their lifts at least 
through Easter Sunday, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Valley, where Slide Peak is still open, will play host to its first Easter 
Carnival Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Money raised will benefit the 
California Special Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Summit, whose skier-turnout total will wind up "close to last year's," 
according to Carrie Shirreffs, communications director, plans to stage its 
annual Springfest April 9-14. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cramer, manager of Mountain High, said he was happy with the way this 
season turned out, adding, "We'll finish with about the same numbers as last 
year, 345,000 skier-days." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, which recently told the U.S. Forest Service it has abandoned 
plans to connect its East and West mountains because of the prohibitive cost of 
the required environmental impact studies, will concentrate this summer on 
building an eight-mile pipeline from a new water source in the Mojave Desert, 
to increase its snow-making capability. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mark Ward of Ski Sunrise, Mountain High's neighbor in the San 
Gabriel Mountains, said: "We had a pretty good year, despite missing most of 
the Christmas holidays. We finally closed last weekend after having spring 
skiing at 9 a.m., summer skiing at 10 a.m. and water skiing at 11 a.m.

The U.S. Pro Tour will stop at Keystone, Colo., this weekend for its 
next-to-last meet. Roland Pfeifer of Austria tops the standings with 468 1/2 
points, six more than countryman Bernhard Knauss. Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., 
is third with 455, followed by defending champion Jorgen Sundqvist of Sweden 
with 434. Mahre won his sixth slalom of the season last Saturday at Steamboat, 
Colo., and is tied for the lead with Austrian Christian Orlainsky after two of 
the three events in the Million Dollar Plymouth Super Series, being conducted 
within the overall tour. The co-leaders have 135 points, 7 1/2 more than 
Pfeifer and Knauss, who are tied for third. The tour and super series finals 
will both be held April 5-8 at Aspen, Colo.

his pro debut at Steamboat but failed to qualify for the round of 32 in either 
the giant slalom or slalom. . . . Catharina Glasser-Bjerner of Sweden won the 
Women's Pro Ski Tour's overall title by taking the giant slalom last Saturday 
at Keystone, with Birgit Hussauf of Austria placing second and Andreja Leskovek 
of Yugoslavia third. Former U.S. racer Beth Madsen of Aspen won the slalom 
Sunday and finished fourth to earn rookie-of-the-year honors. . . . The Subaru 
U.S. Freestyle Championships will be held today through Sunday at Winter Park,
