It is said that he could be figure skating's king. Instead, Christopher Bowman 
seems to prefer playing the court jester. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a choice of doing it straight or improvising, the 1989 U.S. men's 
champion often makes like Robin Williams. In skating and in life. 
</P>
<P>
In sixth place after the short program at the Goodwill Games, Bowman's 
intentions going into Friday night's free skating program were anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, he said he might be tempted -- again -- to abandon his 
usual routine and ad-lib a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Would he be, as he once proclaimed, "Hans Brinker from hell", or settle for 
Bowman the Showman? 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, neither. He deviated from his plans some, but not entirely by 
design. 
</P>
<P>
A triple axel and a triple salchow both became singles. But only out of 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Having trained for less than a month, Bowman, 23, was out of shape and playing 
it safe. His caution was very out of character. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been somewhat of a glass house lately, wondering when the stones were 
going to come down," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
There were cracks showing after Thursday night's short program, but Bowman 
recovered some with Friday's fairly stylish free-skating routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared I was going to walk away from this event sad and not 
learning anything," Bowman said. "I turned it into something positive." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, from Van Nuys, finished sixth among eight skaters. Canada's Kurt 
Browning, two-time world champion, won the gold medal, with Viktor Petrenko of 
the Soviet Union taking silver and U.S. champion Todd Eldredge placing third 
for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge was in fifth place after Thursday's original program. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman failed to move up, but he stuck with his program. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in March at the World Championships in Halifax, 
Canada, he was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
In fifth place after the short program, Bowman had a change of plans halfway 
through his free-skating exercise. He decided the routine that he, his coach 
and a handful of other advisers had worked on for months wasn't quite difficult 
enough. It needed a touch more pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
So, after considering his options for a few mili-seconds, Bowman did what any 
true showman would do. He made the rest of it up on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
His daring paid off. He jumped two places in the standings and won a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Carroll has been Bowman's coach for 18 years, but their relationship has 
been on thin ice since Bowman free-lanced his way through the World 
Championships. Maybe before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one crazy person in the sport," Carroll once lamented during a 
light-hearted moment, "why is it I have to be the one who coaches him?" 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's comments after the World Championships carried a more serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to remain Christopher's friend, I cannot be his coach," Carroll 
said privately. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was still with Bowman this week, but seemed none to pleased about it. 
He declined interview requests all week, telling a spokesman he was "tired of 
lying and covering" for Bowman and that he had "nothing positive to say." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, whose list of strait-laced proteges includes Linda Fratianne, seems to 
have tired of Bowman's antics. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, when Bowman, a cherubic 5-year-old, used to act up in 
Carroll's class at Van Nuys Iceland, the coach simply picked him up and tossed 
him in a waste basket to show him who was boss. It's not so simple now. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman and Carroll clashed before the Goodwill Games. Bowman wanted to come. 
Carroll didn't. "He was very reluctant about coming to this event because he 
felt they if you're not totally prepared than you shouldn't be going," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In pairs skating, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov led a medals sweep by 
the Soviets. Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the United States' top-ranked team, 
was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also swept the ice-dancing competition, with Sergei Ponomarenko and 
Marina Klimova winning the gold medal.
