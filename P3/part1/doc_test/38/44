  [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Physical 
Culture and Sports Commission held a tea party this afternoon at 
Beijing's Shoudu Stadium to warmly welcome the Chinese sports 
delegation which participated in the 17th Winter Olympic Games. 
On behalf of the State Council, Li Tieying, state councilor and 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, attended the tea 
party and congratulated the skillful Chinese winter sports 
athletes who achieved good results at the games. [passage 
omitted] 
  Speaking at the meeting, Comrade Li Tieying pointed out: 
China's winter sports started relatively late. It only 
developed and made great progress during the 15 years since 
reform and opening up. Reluctant to be left behind, coaches and 
athletes have continued to forward new goals as well as strived 
to achieve them. These are exactly the characteristics in New 
China's sports: work hard, keep forging ahead, and vie for the 
nation's glory. [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out: It was not easy for the Chinese delegation 
to obtain such results from a field of strong competitors at the 
Winter Olympic Games. The spirit of unity and arduous struggle 
they demonstrated was even more valuable. The unfair practice 
[bu gong zheng zuo fa 0008 0361 2973 0254 3127] of obvious and 
intentional shielding [ming xian di you yi tan hu 2494 7359 4104 
2589 1942 5917 6233] of one side while accusing [ze nan 6307 
7181] the other occurred in the short-track speed skating 
competition. It aroused the righteous indignation [yi fen 5030 
2001] of all fair-minded people while toughened and tested the 
Chinese team. Zhang Yanmei overcame difficulty, triumphed over 
disturbances, did well from start to finish to complete her 
competition, and won a silver medal, winning praises from public 
opinion. 
  Finally, Li Tieying expressed hope that China's winter 
sports 
athletes would earnestly sum up their experiences and lessons to 
find out where they lag behind others, and address existing 
problems. They should emancipate their minds; deepen reform; 
boldly explore and innovate; draw on the experiences of nations 
strong in winter sports and combine them with China's own 
characteristics; seize opportunities; determine their 
directions; implement outlined measures; and strive for progress 
so as to achieve "zero" breakthrough in their quest for gold 
medals in the next Winter Olympic Games. 
  Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports 
Commission, as well as He Zhenliang, Yuan Weimin, Xu Yinsheng, 
and Liu Ji, vice ministers of the commission, also attended the 
tea party and affirmed the Chinese delegation's achievements. 
They pointed out the athletes' inadequacies and encouraged them 
to strive for greater improvement and for the country's glory in 
the future.
