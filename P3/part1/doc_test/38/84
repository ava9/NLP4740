  [Text] The prejudice of a few foreigners against the 
Chinese people is quite deep-rooted. This is how we often feel. 
The causes may be quite complicated, but they contain traces of 
colonial ideas. As many Chinese residing abroad put it, behind a 
gentle and cultured appearance is a kind of coldness and 
contempt. For example, during a short-distance speed-skating 
race at the Winter Olympics, all the spectators saw that an 
athlete of a certain country used her arm to block Chinese 
athlete Zhang Yanmei to gain an unfair advantage. However, when 
the Chinese team leader lodged a protest, some went as far as to 
say: "It is already pretty good that you won second place." 
(See page 1 of the 26 February issue of ZHONGGUO TIYU BAO 
[CHINA SPORTS NEWSPAPER]) It seems that the rules of 
competition did not really matter, that the person already had a 
pretty good idea of which country's athlete would be in which 
place, and therefore, the enforcement of the rules differed with 
different people. 
  We do not intend to comment on whether or not the foreign 
athlete concerned harbored any motive in violating the rule. 
The right and wrong are self-evident since there are rules, and 
their were feelings expressed by the spectators. Nor do we want 
to overly criticize the referees. It is understandable that, in 
a hotly contested athletic competition, mistakes in judgment are 
sometimes unavoidable. However, it would be quite wrong to say 
that, because she was Chinese, even she was first in skill, she 
could only win the second- or third-place medals and that she 
had to thank the judge for his favor. 
  Such incidents have occurred more than once and are not 
confined to athletic competition. However, that person had, 
perhaps, talked recklessly and let the truth slip out. When you 
cannot win a medal, people laugh at you and hold you up to 
ridicule, and when you win a medal, they try to find fault with 
you, and belittle and hurt you in an enigmatic manner. In their 
minds, achievements and glory -- and gold medals -- should not 
belong to the Chinese. However, things are going contrary to 
their wishes. The Chinese have not been obstructed by hidden 
obstacles, but have become champions again and again. It is 
similar to the poem: "The wall cannot conceal the spring within 
a garden, and a branch of red apricot flowers is stretching over 
the wall." The branch of red apricot flowers that is China will 
remain beautiful and fragrant. 
  The so-called "It is already pretty good that you won second 
place" is a strange idea not worthy of refutation. However, it 
is excellent material for teaching with negative examples. It 
helps us see clearly the true color of the overbearing and 
imperious nature of some people in the international family. 
  In the eyes of some people, China is poor, backward, 
uncivilized, and not worth being mentioned at all. The Chinese 
people are still the "rural flocks" who are physically weak and 
have a wretched appearance. This is not strange. Since the 
middle of the last century, the "great Westerners" have resorted 
to beating and killing when dealing with China, signed many 
unequal treaties which humiliated the Chinese people, and took 
almost anything they wanted. Although this page of history is 
now turned, that sense of racial superiority is hard to discard. 
"When I eat the steamed bun, it is right and proper; when you 
eat the steamed bread of corn, you should content yourself with 
it." In the big international family, the Chinese people could 
only be the henchmen, and henchmen ought to be included by the 
great gentlemen. Of course, the great gentlemen are not willing 
to face the progress made by China. Perhaps they will continue 
to cling to their prejudice; or maybe they will become jealous 
when they see that they can do nothing about it, and conclude 
that they are unhappy anyway. This is not strange, for the rise 
of a nation as big as China means the fall of hegemony. If we 
link this historical background to "it is already pretty good 
that you won second place," it is not difficult to see the 
thoughts, ideas, and worries of some people. 
  The Chinese people can still remember, though not very well, 
the Paris Conference 70 years ago. Concession did not win any 
understanding and sympathy, but invited endless bullying. When 
we look back, we can still see the storms and rains of this 
century. There can be only one conclusion: Not relying on 
heaven, and not relying on earth, the Chinese people can only 
rely on themselves, and only a strong, stable, and prosperous 
China can win the respect of the people of the world. We will 
not beg the people who hold prejudices against China to change 
their views, but we must stand up courageously in the face of 
humiliation, work hard to become strong, make earnest efforts to 
invigorate the country, and prove by our real strength that 
China is great and strong and that the Chinese nation is an 
excellent nation. Facts are most convincing. 
  The whole world can see that the Chinese people are heading 
toward prosperity and rushing to a bright 21st century, and no 
one can stop the trend, whether they like it or not. The 
Chinese people have already broken their "zero" record of 
Olympic medals, have won some gold medals, and will win more 
gold medals as well. The page of the old history is turned. 
"It is already pretty good that you won second place" is only 
an outdated elegy of the old colonialism. The Chinese people, 
who have already stood up, will surely be able to compile a most 
beautiful and grandiose chapter. If you do not believe, wait 
and see!
