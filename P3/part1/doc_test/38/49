Yugoslavia's Mateja Svet overcame a small first-run deficit and captured the 
gold medal in women's slalom today at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Svet, just four-hundredths of a second behind American Tamara McKinney after 
the first run, was considerably faster than McKinney on the second run. 
</P>
<P>
Svet finished with a combined time of 1:30.88, holding off Swiss ace Vreni 
Schneider, who had a blistering second run to move from eighth to second place 
at 1:31.49. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, gold medalist in the combined last week, settled for the bronze in 
the slalom at 1:31.56. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain was fourth in 1:31.75, and Ingrid 
Salvenmoser of Austria took fifth in 1:32.57. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurmountable Lead 
</P>
<P>
Svet, silver medalist behind Schneider in the 1988 Olympic slalom, had built 
what proved to be an insurmountable lead over Schneider in the opening heat. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, taking advantage of a first-run course set by U.S. coach Martin 
Rufener, led the way at 43.98 seconds. Svet was clocked in 44.02. The heavily 
favored Schneider, who has won all five slaloms on the World Cup circuit this 
season, finished a disappointing eighth, 1.47 seconds off McKinney's lead. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider cracked a 46.04 in her second run -- more than seven-tenths of a 
second faster than anyone else -- on a course set by a Swedish coach. 
</P>
<P>
Svet, 20, had a mistake-free run of 46.86 to stay in front, and when McKinney 
could manage no better than 47.58, Svet got the gold. 
</P>
<P>
It was her fourth medal in World Championship competition. She won three medals 
-- one silver and two bronze -- at the last World Championships in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Five skiers in the first seed of 15 -- Austria's Anita Wachter, Swiss teammates 
Brigitte Oertli and Christine von Gruenigen, France's Patricia Chauvet and 
Yugoslavia's Veronika Sarec -- missed gates or fell and did not complete their 
first runs. 
</P>
<P>
Among those bowing out in the second run were Ulrike Maier of Austria and 
Brigitte Gadient of Switzerland.
