Florence Griffith Joyner, the Queen of Seoul, who orchestrated three golden 
hits and one silver at the Summer Olympics and authored two record-smashing 
performances during 1988, today was named Associated Press Female Athlete of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner kept the award in the family. Her sister-in-law, Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, was the 1987 winner. 
</P>
<P>
"FloJo" brought attention to herself not only with sensational accomplishments 
on the track, but also with her dazzling racing attire, her mandarin-like 
fingernails, her flashy rings, her flowing hair and her radiant smile. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was her track performances that earned Griffith Joyner the award over 
such outstanding candidates as West German Steffi Graf, only the third women's 
tennis player to win the Grand Slam; Joyner-Kersee, a double Olympic gold 
medalist; American Olympic swimming star Janet Evans; East German Katarina 
Witt, the Olympic figure skating gold medalist, and East German Kristin Otto, 
winner of six Olympic swimming gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who won Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter 
dashes and the 400-meter relay, along with a silver in the 1,600-meter relay 
and set world records in the 100 and 200 during 1988, collected 549 points in 
balloting by a national panel of 155 sports writers and broadcasters. She 
received 78 first-place votes, 48 seconds and 15 thirds. Points were alloted on 
a 5-3-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, winner of the U.S., French and Australian opens and Wimbledon, along with 
the Olympic gold medal, completing a "Golden Slam," finished second with 420 
points.
