Ondrej Nepela, the 1972 Olympic figure skating champion from Czechoslovakia, 
has died in a West German hospital after a long illness, the West German Ice 
Skating Union said today. He was 38. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela died late Thursday in a Mannheim hospital. The federation's statement 
did not specify Nepela's illness. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela became Czechoslovakia's first Olympic figure skating champion when he 
won the men's title at the 1972 Winter Games in Saporro, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He reigned as world champion from 1971 to 1973 and won five European titles 
between 1969 and 1973. Nepela then joined the American Holiday on Ice 
professional show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Nepela came to Mannheim and became the coach of West German figure 
skater Claudia Leistner, who won the European title last month in Birmingham, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Nepela was hospitalized after the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and never 
returned to the ice.
