  [Text] Seoul, April 27 KYODO -- North Korea has rejected a 
request from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
sample and analyze fuel at a key nuclear facility, a South 
Korean daily reported Wednesday [27 April]. 
  Pyongyang told the IAEA Monday that the IAEA's request to 
inspect a 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 
kilometers north of Pyongyang, is inappropriate, the TONG-A ILBO 
said. 
  The IAEA is insisting that North Korea allow a full check of 
North Korea's nuclear stockpiles, in addition to monitoring 
replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear plant. 
  In a front-page story dispatched from Vienna, the daily 
quoted North Korean diplomat Yun Ho-chin as saying that he 
notified the IAEA it would not be granted permission to conduct 
eight tests when the fuel rods are exchanged at the nuclear 
reactor. 
  The IAEA says the inspections would reveal the current level 
of North Korea's nuclear program and how much plutonium has 
already been recovered from the spent nuclear fuel. 
  Yun, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Austria, 
said 
the IAEA can ensure that nuclear materials are not being 
diverted to military purposes when it observes the removal of 
the reactor core, according to the report. 
  North Korea has nothing more to say to the IAEA, Yun was 
quoted saying. 
  The Yongbyon reactor was started up in 1986. Its fuel rods 
are almost exhausted and are due for replacement. The reactor 
was previously shut down for 100 days in 1989 for unknown 
reasons. 
  The nuclear complex at Yongbyon has been the focus of 
Western 
allegations that North Korea is engaged in a covert nuclear arms 
development program.
