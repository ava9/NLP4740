demands and protests at US military 'provocations'

US negotiators admitted at the weekend that talks with North Korea on its
nuclear facilities were making little headway, as Pyongyang repeated that it
would not accept international inspection of two suspect nuclear sites and
warned that US military exercises were 'provocations'.
The atmosphere at the talks has been further clouded by remarks by the US
Pacific Fleet Commander, Admiral Ronald Zlatoper, that US naval manoeuvres
off the Korean coast sent 'a very strong message' to North Korea comparable
with the pressure on Haiti's military leaders to step aside.
In a predictably angry reaction, North Korea's foreign ministry said the US
naval presence amounted to 'undisguised military provocations' that could
wreck the Geneva negotiations and end the freeze of the country's nuclear
power programme.
Nevertheless, despite the bluster, the two sides met twice over the weekend
at working level and were due to meet again last night or today. The current
negotiating session, which began on Friday, is expected to last about a
week.
The US team had hoped this time to reach a final settlement of the dispute
with North Korea, based on the preliminary accord reached on August 12.
But Pyongyang has since raised new demands and seemingly gone back on
aspects of the earlier agreement.
The two sides agreed in August that, as part of a final settlement,
Pyongyang would freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy
Authority (IAEA). In return, it would be given two light-water atomic
reactors, help with its interim energy needs and the coveted diplomatic
links with Washington.
However, Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's chief negotiator at the Geneva talks,
reaffirmed that Pyongyang would not accept special inspections of two
undeclared sites where the IAEA believes diverted plutonium may be stored.
North Korea is also demanding 'several billion' dollars in compensation for
giving up its graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme. This is in
addition to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) estimated cost of providing the
more 'proliferation-proof' light-water reactors, which produce less
weapons-grade plutonium.
In addition, Pyongyang is refusing to accept South Korean nuclear
technology, saying it wants German or Russian reactors. The US, which is
trying to put together a multinational consortium to meet North Korea's
energy needs, including South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, says this
demand is not practical.
There is also the vexed question of the 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a
holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea says it is willing
to encase them in concrete but the US wants the fuel rods shipped to a third
country such as China.
