<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Sin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that during inspection of 
Yongbyon, which began 3 March, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team discovered that some seals, which 
were installed by IAEA to confirm nuclear safeguards of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea, were destroyed. As a result, it is 
highly likely that considerable controversies will be touched 
off concerning the guarantee of transparency of North Korean 
nuclear development. 
  In the course of inspecting seven nuclear facilities in 
North 
Korea on six occasions in 1993, the IAEA inspected six 
monitoring cameras, 40 seals, and three radioactivity sensor 
facilities. In the event that damage of these facilities is 
confirmed, suspicion that nuclear material was transferred from 
North Korean nuclear facilities to some other place will be 
raised. Thus, there is a possibility that the continuity of 
safeguards of North Korean nuclear facilities may not be 
recognized. 
  A source in Washington said that with discovery of such seal 
damage, the conclusion of the results of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities will be the focus of people's 
attention. The likelihood that the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March in Geneva will 
be held as scheduled is doubtful. 
  It was reported that in the course of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities, disputes arose between IAEA and 
North Korea over the issue of continuing the inspection and the 
damage to the seals. 
  The team has to leave Pyongyang on 14 March as the IAEA 
inspection team was granted two-week entry visas upon its 
arrival in Pyongyang on 1 March. 
  This being the situation, this week will likely be the 
climax 
of IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and the 
possibility of resolving the issue of the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and the South before 21 March is very 
slim because North Korea has continually showed an attitude of 
rejection. 
  Another source observed that North Korea will likely drag on 
the controversy surrounding the inspection and the issue of 
North-South special envoy exchange even after 21 March when the 
third round of high-level talks are scheduled to be held. Thus, 
the possibility of high-level talks being held on the scheduled 
date is slim. 
  Meanwhile, Christine Shelley, a U.S. State Department 
spokesperson, on 9 March said that the U.S. Government regrets 
the fact that the IAEA nuclear inspection of North Korea is not 
proceeding smoothly and expressed the hope that North Korea will 
keep its promise to sincerely allow IAEA inspections until the 
inspections are concluded. Commenting on friction between North 
Korea and IAEA over nuclear inspections, Shelley said that she 
hopes the IAEA can settle the inspection issue and that the 
inspections will be concluded. Shelley stressed that regardless 
of progress in the North-South working contact, the exchange of 
North-South special envoys, with satisfactory nuclear inspection 
results, are a precondition for holding the third round of 
high-level talks agreed to by North Korea.
