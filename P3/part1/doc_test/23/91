a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected 
Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the 
International Community": "Irritated South Korea Concerned by 
the Possibility of Sanctions Provoking Military Clashes"] 
  [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of the 
National Security Council to discuss North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons. During the meeting, the South 
Korean president stated with a grim expression on his face, 
"North Korea's nuclear program is targeting us, and we have to 
keep the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons by all means." 
This was the first such meeting that the president had called 
since taking office. 
  Commenting on the North Korean nuclear issue, South Koreans 
have said: "The DPRK's nuclear program is putting 70 million 
Koreans both in the North and South at risk. The DPRK's nuclear 
program is a fragrant violation of the joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." South Koreans 
consider the North's nuclear program to be a major obstacle to 
maintaining peace and stability in Asia. Many South Koreans 
believe that "if North Korea has nuclear arms, Japan will arm 
itself with nuclear arms." 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song has repeatedly stated: 
"We 
have neither the capability to develop nuclear weapons nor the 
intention of doing so. We do not need nuclear weapons." The 
DPRK declared last March that it would leave the nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) after rejecting special inspections 
of facilities that were suspected of being used to develop 
nuclear weapons. On 13 June, North Korea announced its 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
further deepening suspicions about its development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The ROK has called on North Korea to settle the nuclear 
issue 
based on the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula on which the two Koreas agreed in December 
1991. In line with the joint declaration, the two Koreas set up 
the North-South Joint Committee on Nuclear Management to conduct 
mutual nuclear inspections in addition to nuclear inspections by 
the IAEA, but the joint committee has remained stalled since 
January 1993, when meetings broke off after the two Koreas 
failed to find areas of agreement to carry out the mutual 
nuclear inspections. 
  Inter-Korea prime ministerial talks were scheduled to be 
held 
in Seoul in December 1992, but North Korea unilaterally called 
them off. Working-level talks have been held since last October 
to discuss an exchange of envoys to make arrangements for 
North-South summit talks. At one point, there existed the mood 
at a meeting to reach an agreement on an exchange of envoys. At 
the eighth round of the working-level meetings in March, South 
Korea asserted that the North Korean nuclear issue should be 
resolved as a matter of priority. In reacting against the ROK's 
assertion, the DPRK broke off the meeting after saying, "Seoul 
will be turned into a sea of fire." Since then, North and South 
Korea have had no channel for dialogue. 
  The DPRK has made it clear that the United States is its 
sole 
counterpart for discussing the nuclear issue, in showing no 
willingness to hold a dialogue with South Korea. This stand by 
North Korea has irritated the South. The resumption of the 
North-South dialogue is a precondition for holding high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks. The condition for resuming the North-South 
dialogue was dropped because the issue of holding the third 
round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks encountered rough sailing. 
  Whenever the question has been raised about imposing 
sanctions on the North since it announced its withdrawal from 
the NPT, the ROK has persuaded the nations involved to take 
"mild measures against North Korea." The ROK has been concerned 
that hard-line measures such as sanctions could incite North 
Korea to provoke military clashes on the Korean peninsula. 
  Experts on the Korean peninsula point out that debates in 
the 
UN Security Council on sanctions against the DPRK mean another 
"crisis" on the Korean peninsula, following the crisis that 
arose from an attempt by North Korean commandos to attack 
Chongwadae (the presidential office) following the end of the 
1950-53 Korean war. 
  South Korea has made one concession after another to North 
Korea in a bid to prevent a recurrence of the past tragedy, but 
the DPRK nuclear issue has been aggravated. South Korea, a 
counterpart of North Korea, has been unable to talk directly to 
North Korea about the nuclear issue. The ROK strongly believes 
that the only way to have North Korea change its stand is to 
push for UN sanctions in concert with Japan and the United 
States while seeking cooperation from Russia and China. 
  On 15 June, former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea 
through Panmunjom. South Koreans are now watching intently to 
see what results his trip to North Korea will bring about.
