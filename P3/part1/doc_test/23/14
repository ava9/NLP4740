An international nuclear inspection team is expected to arrive in North
Korea tomorrow as the first step under a deal concluded between Washington
and Pyongyang at the weekend.
North Korea agreed to allow entry to an inspection team from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to examine seven declared facilities at
the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
The North this week will also begin 'working level' discussions with South
Korea on preparations for an exchange of presidential envoys by mid-March.
This could pave the way for an unprecedented summit meeting between the
leaders of the two Koreas.
South Korean President Kim Young-sam offered on Friday to meet his North
Korean counterpart, Mr Kim Il-sung, in an attempt to resolve suspicions
about the North's nuclear programme.
In return, the US agreed to hold a new round of high-level negotiations with
North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
The talks will begin on March 21, timed to coincide with the end of the IAEA
inspections.
The US and South Korea will also cancel this spring's joint Team Spirit
military exercise if the North fully co-operates with the IAEA inspections
and progress is achieved in the inter-Korean talks.
The planned deployment of US Patriot missiles, meant to protect South Korea
against the threat of an attack by North Korean Scud missiles, may also be
delayed.
Details of the package deal will be formally announced tomorrow as soon as
the IAEA team arrives in North Korea.
However, analysts in Seoul warn that the conditional nature of the US and
South Korean concessions could provide a pretext for the North to raise
last-minute objections. Pyongyang has consistently demanded firm guarantees
on the suspension of Team Spirit and new US-North Korean talks in return for
allowing the IAEA into Yongbyon.
Disagreements over how the two sides would co-ordinate their actions delayed
the planned trip of the IAEA inspectors to North Korea this month after
Pyongyang agreed in principle to their visit.
The IAEA will try to determine whether the North has diverted plutonium from
its Yongbyon reactor since the last full inspections were conducted a year
ago.
But that examination will not end the controversy over the North's nuclear
programme. The IAEA still wants to investigate two undeclared facilities,
believed to be nuclear waste sites, at Yongbyon to determine if the North
extracted more plutonium than it declared after it shut down its reactor in
1989.
The North has repeatedly said it will not allow an inspection of these two
sites. It threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
last March and blocked regular IAEA inspections after the IAEA demanded to
see the two undeclared sites.
But officials in Seoul believe the North may be using this issue to win US
diplomatic recognition in return for accepting the IAEA demand.
