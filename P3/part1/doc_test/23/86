  [Text] Vienna, May 20 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday [20 May] North Korea has 
already begun removing spent fuel rods from a 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang. 
  The U.N. Nuclear Monitoring Agency said it has sent a letter 
to North Korea warning that the continued removal of the rods 
would be a violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  On Thursday, U.S. Government and diplomatic sources in 
Washington reported the three-member IAEA inspection team had 
determined that a small number of the estimated 8,000 fuel rods 
had already been removed from the reactor. 
  The IAEA and the United States fear that plutonium extracted 
from the rods may be diverted to a suspected nuclear arms 
development program. 
  The IAEA has said the future removal of the fuel rods 
without 
the agency's supervision and without marking and separating them 
would be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  This would force the watchdog agency to refer the problem to 
the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Department sources said the IAEA 
team's 
checks of the monitoring cameras and seals at the radiochemical 
laboratory at the complex in Yongbyon are progressing smoothly 
and should be completed soon. 
  Another IAEA inspection team in March was denied access to 
the laboratory by the North Koreans, raising suspicions that 
Pyongyang is trying to build a nuclear bomb.
