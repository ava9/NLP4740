  [Text] Beijing, March 1 KYODO -- A seven-member inspection 
team arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to resume inspections of 
North Korea's seven declared nuclear facilities after a lapse of 
more than a year, informed sources in Beijing said. The 
inspections are expected to take about two weeks. 
  The team members, led by Olli Heinonen, left Beijing earlier 
in the day, where they arrived on Monday from Vienna. North 
Korea agreed to the inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday in New York at a working-level 
meeting with U.S. Officials. 
  North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear 
sites in 1992, but threatened to pull out of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to allow checks 
of two undeclared facilities suspected of being related to a 
clandestine nuclear arms development program. Inspections of 
the six declared facilities in the Yongbyon nuclear complex, 
some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, and one site at Kim 
Il-song University in the North Korean capital are expected to 
get under way Wednesday. The inspections, however, will not 
include the two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear 
waste storage facilities that could reveal the nature of the 
North Korean nuclear program. 
  IAEA inspectors have said that to make the checks meaningful 
they would have to examine the nuclear fuel rods to determine if 
plutonium, which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic 
arsenal, had been extracted. 
  The issue of inspecting the two undeclared sites at Yongbyon 
and examining the nuclear fuel rods has been left to the next 
round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang, 
which according to North Korean officials is scheduled for March 
21 in Geneva. 
  Meanwhile, Pyongyang rejected a South Korean request on 
Tuesday to reopen the inter-Korean dialogue, proposing instead 
to meet Thursday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. In 
response to the delay, the South Korean Government held off its 
decision to cancel the "Team Spirit" U.S.-South Korea joint 
military exercises. 
  Reopening the inter-Korean dialogue and calling off the 
military exercises had been half of a four-item agreement 
reached February 25 in a working-level meeting in New York 
between U.S. and North Korean representatives. The agreement 
had been reached to ensure IAEA inspectors access to the North 
Korean facilities. 
  Although Pyongyang had agreed with the IAEA on February 15 
to 
permit the checks, it held back issuing the necessary visas to 
the inspection team and demanded that a date be set for a third 
round of high-level talks with the U.S. 
  Following the meeting in New York, North Korean 
representatives said that the third round would open March 21 in 
Geneva, but Washington is insisting that Seoul-Pyongyang talks 
on the exchange of special envoys be initiated first. North and 
South have agreed to make the Korean peninsula nuclear- free, 
but North Korea has insisted that the issue can only be resolved 
through a bilateral dialogue with Washington.
