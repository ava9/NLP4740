  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
expressed regret Tuesday over North Korea's reported decision to 
quit the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reject 
further inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  In a related development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked over the phone 
Tuesday morning and shared concern over Pyongyang's decision, 
government sources said. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement 
Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its 
decision to leave the IAEA and reject further inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, as reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL 
NEWS AGENCY on Monday night. 
  The spokesman said in the statement that the North Korean 
action runs counter to the international community's calls for 
Pyongyang to abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements. 
  The Japanese reaction to the North Korean announcement came 
as other world leaders were busy exploring steps to deal with 
the looming crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  In Washington, the White House said President Bill Clinton 
talked with Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about 
an international conference on North Korea. 
  Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow 
on 
June 2 that Russia, the United States, Japan, China, the United 
Nations and the IAEA should join North and South Korea in 
holding a conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
  At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright 
told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to 
the UN Security Council in the next couple of days. 
  Kakizawa told Christopher that Japan intends to cope calmly 
with the North Korean nuclear problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. 
  The top government spokesman also revealed that Hata will 
talk to Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday. 
  The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton, 
Kumagai said.
