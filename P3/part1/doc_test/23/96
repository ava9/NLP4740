  [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador 
to China said Friday [20 May] that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) can inspect and measure spent fuel rods 
from their nuclear reactor only after bilateral talks with the 
United States are resumed. 
  Ambassador Chu Chang-chun told reporters the dialogue with 
the U.S., which was suspended after two rounds last July, should 
be continued if the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to 
be resolved. 
  Technicians at North Korea's 5-megawatt Yongbyon 
experimental 
nuclear reactor began replacing spent fuel rods Saturday without 
inspectors from the IAEA present, a move which violates the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and other agreements 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  Three IAEA inspectors now at Yongbyon have not been allowed 
to take samples or make tests on the spent rods, reports said. 
  "We will contain the spent fuel rods in a safe place and 
display them before the inspectors. Then the inspectors can 
verify that our nuclear materials have not been diverted to 
nonpeaceful purposes," Chu said. 
  "This will be the inspection for the continuity of the 
safeguards, this is to show the transparency of our nuclear 
activities," he said. 
  "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North 
Korea) 
and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then 
the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he 
added. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA has insisted that the spent rods must 
be sorted and examined to see whether any spent fuel has been 
diverted to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  Chu claimed that North Korea unilaterally suspended 
withdrawal from the NPT last summer when talks with the U.S. 
began and now has ''a special status'' within the treaty which 
releases it from its NPT obligations. 
  ''We cannot allow the agency to conduct the routine and ad 
hoc inspections because it is contrary to the special status of 
our country,'' Chu said. 
  The ambassador blamed the U.S. for fabricating the North 
Korean nuclear issue as a means to slander his country, while 
demanding that the U.S. honor its commitment to provide 
Pyongyang with a light-water nuclear reactor. 
  Chu also accused Japan of nuclear ambitions, while 
continuing 
to maintain that up to 1,000 nuclear devices are on the Korean 
peninsula and they are all U.S.-made. 
  "That is why we insist that talks be held between the DPRK 
and the U.S.," he said. 
  The 15-month-long dispute has become central to North Korean 
relations with the U.S. as well as the eventual easing of 
tension and possible reunification of the Korean peninsula.
