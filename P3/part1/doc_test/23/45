  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
instructed security-related cabinet ministers on Tuesday to do 
their utmost to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
through dialogue even if it is referred to the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  "The (South Korean) Government will not abandon its efforts 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue 
even if it is referred to the Security Council," Kim said. "Even 
if dialogue fails, the government has to prepare for everything 
so that the people can trust their government and have 
confidence in the government with regard to their safety and 
survival," Kim said. 
  The presidential instruction came at a Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] meeting attended by Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang, Deputy Prime Minister and head of the National 
Unification Board Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, 
Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae and others. 
  The meeting was convened amid rising international tension 
after the United States said it will have to refer the North 
Korean nuclear question to the U.N. Security Council if 
Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fail 
to reach agreement on IAEA inspections by Feb. 21. 
  President Kim reiterated the Seoul government's position 
that 
it does not want to see North Korea isolated from the world 
community. 
  "North Korea will have to allow comprehensive inspection by 
the IAEA of its nuclear facilities as it has promised, and a 
political solution to the nuclear issue has to be achieved 
through sincere dialogue between South and North Korea," Kim 
said. 
  "North Korea is facing a grave point by refusing to accept 
(IAEA) inspection," Kim said. "The (Seoul) government should 
maintain the principles and consistency of its policy while 
exercising flexibility in order to resolve the nuclear problem." 
  President Kim went on to stress that "it is important above 
all else to maintain close cooperation with the United States 
and other countries," according to Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs. 
  Kim then told Foreign Minister Han to hold close 
consultations with U.S. Government leaders when he visits 
Washington on Wednesday. 
  With regard to the perceived rise in tension on the Korean 
peninsula, the president said that the ministers should inform 
the people of as many developments as possible. 
  In addition, Kim instructed them to strengthen 
inter-ministry 
cooperation as the North Korean nuclear issue reaches an 
important turning point before and after the IAEA Board of 
Governors' meeting Feb. 21. 
  Briefing reporters on the background of Tuesday's security 
meeting, Chong said that considerable efforts will be made to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear question even after it is brought 
to the Security Council. 
  Chong said he did not believe the Security Council would 
impose economic sanctions immediately against North Korea. 
  Rather, the world body would have to go through many stages 
before deciding to impose sanctions. 
  That is why the Seoul government will continue its efforts 
to 
resolve the question through dialogue even after it is referred 
to the Security Council, he said. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported to the meeting that 
the frequency of exercises by the North Korean Army and Air 
Force has been on the rise recently. His ministry has obtained 
evidence that defensive exercises around the nuclear complex in 
Yongbyong, north of Pyongyang, are being strengthened and work 
to reinforce underground facilities stepped up, Yi said. 
  North Korea is also stepping up propaganda efforts to 
denounce South Korea, he said. Despite these actions, Yi said 
there were no signs that North Korea would launch a provocation 
in the immediate future. Asked whether South Korea has been able 
to detect signs of an imminent provocation by the North, Chong 
said that under the worst circumstances, "we can detect it one 
or two days ahead." 
  "The people can trust our ability to detect it," Chong said. 
  The reason that President Kim convened the year's first 
national security meeting one day before the three-day lunar new 
year's holiday begins, is because the deadline for resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue is approaching fast and because there 
is no indication it will be solved soon. 
  President Kim apparently wanted to reassess the government's 
policy and dispel the rising sense of anxiety here, fueled by 
foreign reports that warn of an imminent crisis in Korea.
