  [Text] New York, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's top 
leader Kim Il-song flatly denied possessing or thinking of 
possessing nuclear weapons in a press conference with Western 
reporters Friday. 
  He said he wants to visit the United States to do some 
hunting, fishing and to "make friends." 
  The 82-year-old ruler of the most isolated nation of the 
world said anyone who wants a war on the Korean peninsula must 
be out of his mind, adding his country will never use nuclear 
weapons against Koreans. 
  Parts of his two and half hour press conference was 
broadcast 
on Cable News Network (CNN) whose Beijing bureau chief Mike 
Chinoy was among the Western press group that went into North 
Korea to report on Kim's birthday April 15. 
  He reacted with irritation when asked about North Korea's 
suspected nuclear program, saying the international community 
demands to see nuclear weapons that North Korea simply doesn't 
have. 
  It's useless to own nuclear weapons, Kim said in the press 
conference, North Korea doesn't have the delivery system to 
launch such weapons, and his country is too small to attempt 
nuclear tests. 
  But other than denying any nuclear development, Kim made no 
reference to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s demands 
for additional inspection on the North Korean nuclear complex. 
  Kim described how he was proud of his heir-apparent son Kim 
Chong-il and denied reports of his failing health, saying he is 
in good condition.
