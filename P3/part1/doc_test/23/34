North Korea appears to be backing away from a promise made to the US
agreeing in principle to full international inspections of its seven
declared nuclear facilities.
Negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency
on these inspections have reached an impasse after Pyongyang said it would
bar full access to a 5MW reactor and a 'radiochemical laboratory', believed
to be a plutonium reprocessing facility, at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
North Korea said at the weekend it had agreed in re-cent talks with the US
to allow inspections that would guarantee 'the continuity of (nuclear)
safeguards'. But it was under no obligation to accept full IAEA inspections,
since it had only 'suspended temporarily' its March 1993 decision to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The IAEA wants to inspect the reactor's fuel rods and substances used in the
radiochemical laboratory to guarantee that the North has not diverted
plutonium for its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
But North Korea will only permit the replacement of film and batteries for
surveillance cameras at these sites. The IAEA has refused the offer, stating
that the North must submit to the full range of IAEA inspections initially
accepted in 1992.
North Korea claimed it agreed to new, limited IAEA inspections in return for
the promised suspension of this year's US-South Korean 'Team Spirit'
military exercise, which has not yet been announced.
Pyongyang appears to be toughening its stance on regular IAEA inspections of
its declared nuclear facilities, explaining that they will only be allowed
after the US holds another round of high-level talks with the North in an
attempt to improve relations.
The US has rejected that demand, saying it will discuss improved ties only
if the North permits regular IAEA inspections and renews talks with South
Korea on denuclearisation.
The US has indicated that if North Korean fails to reach an inspection
accord with the IAEA, it will ask the UN Security Council to impose
sanctions on Pyongyang. China and Japan are urging caution in transferring
the issue to the UN since it could increase tensions in the Korean
peninsula.
