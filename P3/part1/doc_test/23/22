SOUTH KOREA yesterday indicated that it would adopt a tougher attitude on
the North Korean nuclear issue after Pyongyang rejected a proposal by Seoul
to resume talks on mutual nuclear inspections.
'We gave everything we could give at the last round of North Korea-US
high-level talks. Now it's time to show Pyongyang what sticks are in store,'
said Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister.
During its discussions with the US last month, North Korea was offered
improved relations with Washington and the supply of safer light-water
reactors to replace its graphite-moderated ones if it accepted full nuclear
inspections by South Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA). The IAEA wants to examine sites to determine if North Korea is
reprocessing more plutonium than it has disclosed, for possible use in
developing nuclear weapons.
North Korea said on Monday that it rejected holding talks with the South
through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission and instead insisted
that the dispute about Pyongyang's nuclear programme be linked to a summit
meeting between the presidents of the two Koreas.
Seoul refuses the Pyongyang demand for a summit, calling it 'premature'
until the nuclear dispute is resolved.
Both the US and South Korea have suggested that they may ask the UN Security
Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea by the end of September
unless Pyongyang shows results in talks with the IAEA and South Korea on the
nuclear issue.
IAEA inspectors yesterday completed maintenance work on monitoring equipment
installed at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex.
But the IAEA is still barred from two nuclear waste sites. The IAEA demand
to view these sites triggered North Korea's announcement last March that it
was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, although it later
suspended the threatened action after holding talks with the US.
