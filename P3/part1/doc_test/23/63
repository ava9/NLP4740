  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Monday [28 
February] the scheduled resumption of international inspections 
of North Korea's nuclear sites Tuesday but called on Pyongyang 
for further efforts to dispel allegations that it is developing 
nuclear weapons. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a 
press conference Japan welcomes the scheduled inspections of 
North Korea's declared nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following an accord between 
Pyongyang and Washington last weekend. 
  Saito said the focal point now lies on whether the 
inspections, slated to begin Tuesday, will be fully carried out, 
whether North Korea "seriously" engages in dialogue with South 
Korea, and as a result, whether a third round of talks will 
resume between North Korea and the United States. 
  More important, he said, is to seek a drastic solution to 
North Korea's nuclear problem through Pyongyang's complete 
return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), 
implementation of special inspections of its nuclear sites and 
carrying out a joint declaration with Seoul to denuclearize the 
Korean peninsula. 
  "We strongly expect North Korea to take positive measures to 
achieve that," Saito said. 
  Japan also welcomes the U.S. initiative leading up to now, 
Saito said. Tokyo will continue to maintain close contact with 
Washington, Seoul and other related countries and make efforts 
toward solutions to the problem, he said. 
  An IAEA inspection team left Vienna Sunday to inspect seven 
declared nuclear sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang. The seven-member group is expected to arrive in 
Pyongyang Tuesday. 
  But so far, North Korea has rejected pressure to allow 
inspections of two other undeclared sites at the nuclear complex 
that are suspected of being part of a nuclear weapons project. 
  The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the 
IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog. 
  North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear 
facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the NPT last 
March when pressed to open to checks of the two undeclared 
facilities.
