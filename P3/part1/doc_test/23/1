  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The top policymaker of 
Japan's main opposition party on Wednesday [16 February] blasted 
as insufficient North Korea's acceptance of inspections of its 
seven nuclear facilities and urged it to allow checks on the two 
most controversial sites. 
  "I'm disgruntled at the fact that the latest agreement 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) has not cleared up all the ambiguities," said Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy 
Affairs Research council. 
  Addressing a news conference at the Japan National Press 
Club, Hashimoto said, "there are still some murky points, as 
North Korea has not agreed to accept inspection of its two 
nuclear waste reprocessing facilities." 
  The IAEA has said the two facilities, located in a nuclear 
complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang, might yield evidence of 
how much plutonium North Korea has produced in the past. 
  The IAEA and the United States have said they are keen to 
check the discrepancies between the actual amount of plutonium 
North Korea has produced and a much smaller amount of plutonium 
the nation has admitted manufacturing in the past. 
  They have expressed concern that missing plutonium from the 
Yongbyon nuclear reactors might have been diverted to produce 
nuclear bombs. 
  Hashimoto's comment came a day after North Korea told the 
IAEA it will allow IAEA monitors to inspect the seven nuclear 
sites, while keeping out them out of the two critical facilities. 
  Hashimoto, a former Finance Minister, said the LDP will take 
up the issue of these ambiguities during question-and-answer 
sessions at the House of Representatives Budget Committee in a 
regular Diet session that reconvened Wednesday. 
  He urged the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to take a firmer stand in responding to a proposal -- 
now before the UN Security Council -- to slap trade sanctions on 
North Korea if it fails to allow full inspection of all the 
facilities the IAEA is demanding to see. 
  "The LDP's own study indicates that the Hosokawa 
administration has not compiled any crisis management program" 
to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, he said. 
  Hashimoto said the LDP "will not consider exchanges" between 
party officials and the North Korean Government following the 
1993 fall from grace of former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru 
who had kept ties with the Pyongyang authorities. 
  "Although it is true that Mr. Kanemaru held talks with the 
North Korean Government, he did so as a mere individual," he 
said. He said the LDP had never sought to build ties with the 
North Korean leadership as a party policy. 
  He was speaking about a suprapartisan delegation to 
Pyongyang 
in September 1990 led by Kanemaru and then Social Democratic 
Party chairman Makoto Tanabe. Their talks with North Korean 
leader Kim Il-song later led to the start of diplomatic 
normalization talks between the two countries. 
  The normalization talks broke down after Pyongyang refused 
to 
comply with the IAEA's demands to inspect its nuclear facilities.
