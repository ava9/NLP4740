  [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- Three inspectors from the 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Beijing on Monday [16 
May] on their way to monitor the refueling of a North Korean 
nuclear facility. 
  The team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency is 
scheduled to leave Beijing for Pyongyang on Tuesday and to begin 
inspection of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear plant at 
Yongbyon, near Pyongyang, on Wednesday. 
  Despite a North Korean announcement Saturday that it had 
removed seals and started replacing spent fuel rods at the 
reactor, the team will continue with a previous agreement and 
monitor the refueling process, team leader Olli Heinonen said. 
  An IAEA spokesman said Saturday in Vienna that if North 
Korea 
commits a serious violation of the nuclear safeguard agreement, 
such as removing seals from the fuel rod container, the team may 
suspend the scheduled inspections. 
  "We just want to check and see for ourselves and then we'll 
all be much wiser," Heinonen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in Beijing. 
  Heinonen, who has been to North Korea "many times," refused 
to comment on the nuclear situation there, nor would he comment 
on whether his team shares any concerns over North Korean safety 
precautions. 
  "We've been to many countries and we've seen many plants and 
many situations," he said. 
  The Yongbyon plant is at present supposedly undergoing its 
initial refueling, although U.S. intelligence reports say the 
plant may have been refueled in 1989. 
  The IAEA inspectors hope to verify whether refueling took 
place in 1989 and whether or not any of the spent fuel has been 
diverted to other uses, particularly military uses. 
  The IAEA team also hopes to inspect a laboratory that it was 
denied access to during an uncompleted inspection in March, 
Heinonen said. 
  Western countries suspect the lab is involved in a program 
to 
produce nuclear arms. 
  Heinonen said his team will collect as much data as possible 
and return "in about a week" to Vienna where the inspectors will 
formulate a report with other IAEA experts.
