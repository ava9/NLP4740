  [Text] Seoul has given Washington the go-ahead to hold a 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks on condition that 
Pyongyang promises to delay the scheduled refueling at a 
Yongbyon reactor, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "Pyongyang's promise not to go ahead with the replacement of 
spent fuel rods will effectively remove a major hurdle for the 
third round of talks," he said. 
  As Pyongyang has already promised to accept an additional 
inspection at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, its 
promise almost completely removes stumbling blocks to the 
long-delayed talks between the United States and North Korea, he 
added. 
  The second round of talks was held on July 11 last year in 
Geneva and the United States promised to support the replacement 
of North Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water 
reactors which yield almost no plutonium usable for nuclear 
bombs. 
  Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
sent 
a telex to Pyongyang, notifying it that it would send inspectors 
in the next few days if the "core discharge campaign is 
deferred," according to a copy of the telex message obtained 
from the ministry. 
  "This team is to carry out the activities which the agency 
was not enabled to implement during the inspection in March at 
the reprocessing plant (radiochemical laboratory). It is 
further to perform such activities as the servicing of cameras 
and checking of seals," it added. 
  The international nuclear watchdog called on Pyongyang to 
allow "IAEA inspectors to select and secure for measurements 
later this year a representative sample of fuel rods." 
  Pyongyang has strongly opposed the sample-taking at the 
reactor, insisting it is not related to the continuity of 
safeguards. Therefore, the IAEA's flexibility on the timing of 
measurements is apparently designed to bypass Pyongyang's strong 
opposition for an early resolution to the nuclear issue. 
  The IAEA's telex can also be interpreted as a concession to 
North Korea because it said last week that it would not send an 
inspection team unless North Korea allowed experts to carry out 
full tests of the reactor's spent fuel. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry official said that the 
inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor will be further discussed 
at the third round of talks as insisted by Pyongyang. 
  However, he expressed a pessimism on the prospects of 
Pyongyang agreeing to complete inspections at the nuclear 
reactor, which is decisive to determining the state of the North 
Korean nuclear development program which started in 1986. 
  "If the IAEA succeeds in the inspection at the reactor, 
North 
Korea will completely lose all use of its nuclear card," he said. 
  So far, North Korea has made use of the "nuclear card" to 
secure concessions from South Korea and the United States. 
  He also denied the possibility that Pyongyang could go ahead 
with the refueling of the reactor without international 
supervision. 
  "In that case, Pyongyang would also lose the nuclear card 
because it would mean a complete breakdown of all 
nuclear-related talks, which would lead to U.N. sanctions," he 
said. 
  Therefore, South Korea and the United States are in the 
process of preparing another set of carrots and sticks to remove 
all doubts surrounding the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
