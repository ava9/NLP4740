International fears over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme
abated yesterday in the wake of a deal that will open the country to
inspections and improve ties with the US.
The pact is a sign that Mr Kim Jong-il, North Korea's new leader, is
prepared to broaden his country's international contacts. It raised hopes he
will speed opening the country to foreign investment.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the agreement 'goes a
long way' to removing a potential North Korean nuclear threat'.
In Washington last night, President Bill Clinton described the agreement 'as
good for the US, good for our allies and good for the safety of the entire
world'. The deal 'represents the first step on the road to a nuclear-free
(Korean) peninsula'.
Mr Clinton said he was instructing Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US
delegation in the tortuous negotiation, to sign the accord in Geneva on
Friday as scheduled. Mr Gallucci announced the breakthrough in talks with
North Korean officials at midnight on Monday, saying the agreement had to be
referred back to respective governments for approval.
Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister and head of the
delegation to the Geneva talks, said the planned replacement of North
Korea's existing graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme with
light-water reactor technology would 'completely eliminate and dispel'
suspicions about Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear weapons.
The agreement is linked to the gradual improvement of bilateral relations
between Washington and Pyongyang, which, Mr Kang said, would 'make a
significant contribution to greater security in Asia and the rest of the
world'.
The deal apparently provides for a delay in inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency to determine whether North Korea has reprocessed
plutonium for nuclear weapons. South Korean officials had expressed concern
that such a delay would give Pyongyang more time to produce a bomb from
plutonium it is suspected of reprocessing five years ago.
There were also doubts in Seoul about providing North Korea with
international aid that could revive its troubled economy when it appears to
be heading towards collapse. But officials yesterday acknowledged they had
little choice but to accept the accord concluded by the US, South Korea's
main military and economic ally.
The agreement, however, contains several advantages for South Korea,
including securing a foothold in the North through the supply of safe
light-water reactors to Pyongyang. North Korea made a last-minute compromise
to secure the deal by agreeing to resume talks with Seoul on the
de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
Officials said Seoul is preparing to relax restrictions on investments by
South Korean companies in the North if the agreement proceeds smoothly.
Mr Han indicated that Pyongyang may have been anxious to reach an agreement
with the US on the nuclear issue because it would boost the prestige of Mr
Kim Jong-il before he formally takes over the leadership of North Korea in
the next several weeks.
North Korea has achieved several long-sought goals under the deal, including
improved ties with the US and provision of energy supplies that could
reverse its economic decline.
