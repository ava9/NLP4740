  [Text] Vienna, March 21 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) convened a meeting Monday [21 March] in 
Vienna of its Board of Governors to discuss North Korea's 
refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to make a full inspection of 
its nuclear facilities. 
  The Board of Governors will hear a report from IAEA Director 
General Hans Blix about the inspection work by a group of 
inspectors on North Korean facilities but North Korea threatened 
Monday to quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A 
North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that 
Pyongyang has "no alternative" but to (?reactivate) 1993 
decision to leave the international pact on the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog body is expected to pass a 
resolution that will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the 
U.N. Security Council, Agency sources said. 
  If the matter is referred, the Security Council may discuss 
possible economic sanctions against North Korea, the sources 
said. 
  China, one of the five permanent members on the Security 
Council, may oppose any tough action against North Korea with 
which Beijing has maintained close relations, they said. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during weekend 
meetings with Chinese Premier Li Peng, voiced grave concern over 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, saying 
the international community's patience is nearing its limit. 
  Li told Hosokawa that the international community should try 
to solve the problem through patient negotiations. 
  Li also said it is important to give North Korea "what it 
needs." The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North 
Korea needs. 
  A group of IAEA nuclear experts returned from North Korea 
earlier this month after being unable to verify whether nuclear 
material had been diverted from a radiochemical laboratory in 
Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  Amid mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula over North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development program, the United States 
and South Korea are moving toward resuming the Team Spirit 
military exercises. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam instructed his ministers 
Monday to consult with the United States about when to hold the 
Team Spirit military exercise, Presidential Press Secretary Chu 
Ton-sik said. 
  Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported South Korea and the U.S. 
plan to deploy Patriot air defense missiles at U.S. military 
bases in South Korea next month.
