  [Text] Washington, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Robert Gallucci, 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, 
says the United States hopes to resume working-level contacts 
with North Korea in New York this week. 
  "We hope that this week we'll be able to get back to North 
Korea -- almost certainly using the New York channel ... that we 
conduct talks at either the office-director or deputy 
assistant-secretary level," he said Tuesday. 
  Gallucci, who was recently named chairman of the senior 
policy steering group on Korea, made the remarks at the 
department's regular weekly press briefing upon returning from a 
trip to South Korea, China and Japan. 
  "We have consulted our allies, particularly South Korea, 
that 
we'll be able to go back to North Korea with a proposal," he 
said. 
  Gallucci declined to go into further detail about what the 
United States and its allies would propose. 
  But he said the new offer looked very much like the Feb. 25 
proposal in that it would contain similar elements. 
  One of these elements, of course, requires that North Korea 
maintain the continuity of safeguards, Gallucci said. 
  Washington is prepared to hold a third round of high-level 
talks with Pyongyang, he added. 
  Reiterating that the United States prefers a diplomatic 
solution to the nuclear dispute, Gallucci noted that the "Team 
Spirit" military exercise was suspended as "envisioned" in the 
Feb. 25 agreement between the United States and North Korea. 
  "Inter-Korean dialogue could also be an element," he said. 
"Advancing inter-Korean dialogue in some modality would also 
figure in such an arrangement." 
  Gallucci said the United States and its allies were not 
aiming to bring the North Korean nuclear issue back to the UN 
Security Council. 
  "Our objective is to stay away from the security council, 
get 
on with negotiations, and settle this through a diplomatic route 
and not have to go back to the security council," he said. 
  But if the director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) makes a report judged by the security 
council to necessitate its further involvement, it will act 
accordingly, he said. 
  "(and) if they (security council) .... take up the issue, 
there is no doubt that there will be discussion about when and 
if sanctions ought to be considered, and what kinds of sanctions 
ought to be considered," he said. 
  He said the mere presence of IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at 
the 5- megawatt reactor is insufficient. 
  Gallucci declined to make any further comments, however. 
"I'm 
not going to go very far down that road because that's a road 
that really the IAEA has control of, as it ought to," he said. 
"It will not be sufficent for the IAEA inspectors to be in North 
Korea while this is happening. 
  "They (IAEA inspectors) are going to have more demanding 
sets 
of activities to be conducted if they are going to provide the 
assurances with respect to the history and disposition of that 
fuel that we expect of the agency," he said. 
  In any event, Gallucci said the United States would like to 
see North Korea's nuclear program essentially frozen while "we 
are engaged in these discussions." 
  "We would ask them to reconsider that step of refueling the 
reactor," he said. 
  He added, however, this was not a precondition for 
U.S.-North 
Korean talks. "We just generally think that is not a step in the 
right direction," he said. 
  Asked about the impression he had received from Chinese 
leaders in Beijing on the North Korean problem, Gallucci said, 
"they do not believe that the best route to a settlement of this 
issue is through UN Security Council sanctions." 
  "We also agree that this is not the best route," he said. 
"But it is for us the alternative if we can't find a diplomatic 
solution and negotiate a settlement."
