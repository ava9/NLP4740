Nuclear Weapons -- Classified Document of the Russian Defense 
Ministry Obtained"] 
  [Text] The international community has suspected North 
Korea of developing nuclear weapons and I recently obtained a 
document decisively proving that it already possesses nuclear 
weapons. The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian 
Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear 
technology. 
  The document is entitled: "The Russian Federation's Basic 
Military and Political Concept on the Current Military Situation 
in the Asian and Pacific Region." 
  The document is a classified report that was compiled on 22 
October 1993 by the Russian Federation's Defense Ministry for 
Defense Minister Grachev. 
  The report, compiled by the Military Strategy Research 
Center 
under the General Staff of the Armed Forces, was also submitted 
to the Russian Government leaders. According to information I 
have obtained, the report has been sent to the U.S. Defense 
Department at President Yeltsin's instruction. In other words, 
the report is not a highly classified document. As the title 
indicates, the report proposes Russia's strategic blueprint for 
all of Asia. What draws our attention in the report is North 
Korea's nuclear development. It devotes five pages out of 36 to 
North Korea's nuclear development. 
  The report gives a general picture of North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  It says: "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] 
has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the DPRK has test-fired 
medium-range ballistic missiles. It has also refused to allow 
nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic 
organization [name as received]. These moves by the DPRK have 
heightened the potentially tense situation in the region." 
  The report also indicates that North Korea's threat to the 
security of Russia, the United States, and Japan is drastically 
growing. 
  What is of great interest to the Japanese is a section on 
page 20 of the report. The section was written about North 
Korea's nuclear development for senior officers of the General 
Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders. 
  The section entitled "Technology Information" says: Now, 
nine 
people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear 
physicists in North Korea. Seventeen experts are working on the 
missile manufacturing technology and four of them recently 
returned to their countries. 
  Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later 
half of the 1980's. At that time, North Korea was engaged in 
developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with the 
direct assistance of the Soviet Union. The Nodong-1 weighs 
1,000-1,500 kg with a warhead tip. The missile has a range of 
1,000-1,600 km with a 100-200 meter margin of hit probability. 
Its explosive warhead ranges from one to two megatons. The 
warhead is of the Hiroshima type. The missile flies at the 
maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile 
with nuclear warheads is in the final stage. 
  At the same time, North Korea is developing Nodong-2. The 
major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the 
Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads. 
  According to the report, North Korea now has 10-12 kg of 
uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium-239. According to Russian 
nuclear experts, they are enough to manufacture three to five 
nuclear warheads. The massive nuclear complex is located in 
Yongbyun, 90 km north of Pyongyang. The Soviet Union provided 
North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of 
greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium. 
  The report describes North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development as in the "final stage" which has attracted 
attention of the American and European journalists and the 
world. Since the report is an official document that the Russian 
military, which continued to help North Korea's nuclear 
development, compiled on the basis of interviews with Russian 
engineers who returned home from North Korea, it is 100 percent 
reliable. 
  In an interview with me, a senior officer with the Military 
Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed 
Forces, which compiled the report, gave details of North Korea's 
nuclear development. In the interview, he revealed not only the 
existence of nuclear arms in North Korea, but fearful facts. The 
following are questions and answers: 
  [Unidentified officer] "In my view, nuclear inspections are 
a 
ridiculous story. North Korea has already completed the 
development of Hiroshima-type atomic bomb and it is widely known 
among us that North Korea has at least one atomic bomb. The 
North Koreans are using Russian scientists to promote the 
manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the `Nuclear 
Development Project' which they have worked out on their own. 
Perhaps they have already completed manufacturing them." 
  "According to an analysis by Soviet nuclear physicists in 
1992, it was said that North Korea was promoting a plan designed 
to produce at least three atomic bombs, similar to the atomic 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima, by the end of 1994. Therefore, it is 
highly possible that they have already finished building a bomb 
or two." 
  [Kato] What makes you so positive? 
  [Unidentified officer] "It is a matter of common knowledge 
that the former Soviet government supplied low level radioactive 
materials to the north. However, North Koreans are enriching 
these materials and producing high-grade uranium and plutonium 
by using centrifugal separators, which the former Soviet Union 
gave to North Korea, at an underground nuclear reprocessing 
plant in Yongbyun. Moreover, it was confirmed that there are 
several rich uranium veins in the north. 
  In the past, the Soviet Union provided North Korea with 
uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well. The Soviet 
Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development 
in North Korea. Because of the help from the Soviet Union, the 
north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium. Roughly speaking, it 
is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight 
kilograms of plutonium. Judging from the quantity of plutonium 
they have, I do not think my view is far from the truth. 
However, we know the details and actual conditions of the 
development program because we have interviewed scientists who 
came back from there." 
  [Kato] But, Russia is officially saying it is not supporting 
North Korean nuclear development. 
  [Unidentified officer] "That is right but the fact is 
different. As is written in the report, Russian technicians are 
engaged in North Korean nuclear development. They get paid 
$3,000 or $4,000 per month. In addition, they are given high 
quality houses, cars, clothes, and other daily necessities. 
They are given special treatment. The total number of Russian 
technicians, who were sent to North Korea, was well over 100. 
However, some of them are not coming back. They are staying 
there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their 
names. Now, you understand that the scientists were not ordered 
by the government to go to Pyongyang. We know all about their 
movements, including the number of scientists who emigrated to 
third nations after they went to Pyongyang." 
  [Kato] According to a news report, it is said the Nodong-1 
will be deployed soon. Is that true? 
  [Unidentified officer] "After the experimental launching of 
the Nodong-1 in the Sea of Japan on 29 May last year, several 
missiles, including a new remote control system which was 
successfully produced, were sold to Iran. However, judging from 
this fact, there is no doubt that North Korea is steadily 
perfecting its missile development." 
  He also disclosed surprising facts. 
  "Currently, North Korea has three different kinds of 
missiles, which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. They 
are Scud-A, B and C types which were manufactured in the north 
under a production license, and they have 300 such missiles in 
all. The missile, called Nodong in Japan, is called Tsurudo [as 
published] in Russia. Its capabilities are written in the 
report. However, what we should pay attention to is the 
Nodong-2, which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace 
Nodong-1. Reportedly, the flight range of the Nodong-2 is 6,000 
kilometers. Therefore, we can say it is a real intercontinental 
ballistic missile [ICBM]. Of course, it will be capable of 
attacking not only the entire Asian region but also part of the 
United States." 
  [Kato] Just a minute. Why does North Korea need an ICBM? 
  [Unidentified officer] "We do not know that for sure. 
However, we can take a guess. Probably, the Gulf war became a 
motive. That is because Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il saw 
Tomahawk's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy 
during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will 
immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war. 
They do not need to develop missiles which have the same 
capabilities as American rockets. However, I suppose they 
immediately started to develop the Nodong-2, feeling the need to 
own an ICBM to use as a long-range assault weapon." 
  [Kato] Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change 
its missile development plan? Do you have some concrete 
evidence? 
  [Unidentified officer] "Of course. Previously, North Korea 
was using a liquid fuel method for all of its missile 
development. However, the Gulf war revealed that this method had 
a fatal defect. It was proved that missile bases, no matter how 
well they are hidden underground, are helpless against cruise 
missile attacks as long as their locations are known. 
  "For that reason, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il have 
reportedly made an urgent decision to develop solid-fuel-type 
rockets like the SCUD missiles developed by Iraq. It may be 
safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the 
North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through 
the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more 
advanced missile development technology, including know-how of 
developing missiles with the sold fuel type method. Whatever 
the case may be, North Korea's demand concerning ICBM 
development technology is persistent and urgent." 
  If what the senior officer said is true, not only Japan but 
also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of 
Kim Il-song. In fact, reportedly, the United States and Russia, 
fearing North Korea's suspected nuclear development, have 
already started preparing for the North Korean threat. 
  Actually, the senior officer said the report described above 
has been written on the assumption that the world will be 
exposed to North Korea's nuclear threat. 
  As he said, the report emphasizes that Japan, the United 
States, and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean 
threat. 
  The following are the major points of the report: 
  1) Within the Russian military authorities, there are some 
groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  2) It is impossible to ensure the future security of 
Russia without joint cooperation with Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea. 
  3) Should the military authorities cooperate with North 
Korea, it would double Japan's and South Korea's distrust of 
Russia. Therefore, in view of ensuring security, it is extremely 
dangerous to cooperate with North Korea. 
  4) In particular, Russia's relations with Japan are 
important to improving its relations with the United States, and 
Russia should not incite Japan. 
  5) Russia's plan to establish a regional missile 
interception network in cooperation with the United States and 
Japan is for regional defense purposes. Therefore, it is absurd 
to cooperate with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  In conclusion, the report even proposes that the outflow to 
North Korea of Russian experts for missile development, of 
materials for missile development, and nuclear resources should 
be prevented; that an accord between Russia and North Korea on 
missile development technology should be abolished; and that 
Russia should not help North Korea smuggle its missiles to the 
third countries. 
  The senior officer also disclosed another astonishing fact. 
  He said: "Concerned over the threat of North Korea, 
including 
nuclear attack in the Far East and the Pacific region, Japan's 
Defense Agency, the Russian Defense Ministry, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense are conducting meetings to seek a possible 
tripartite emergency defense system aimed at coping with a North 
Korean missile attack. 
  "Particularly, they have agreed that it is necessary to 
urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which 
North Korea is developing secretly. 
  "As far as I know, when the summit was held, (then) Director 
General of the Defense Agency Nakanishi, who accompanied Prime 
Minister Hosokawa on his visit to Vancouver, reportedly met with 
a high-raking official of the U.S. Department of Defense and 
obtained information on progress in North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  "Meanwhile, a high-ranking Japanese Defense Agency official 
visited Moscow, and his visit was briefly reported by ITAR-TASS 
saying a meeting was held between Japanese and Russian defense 
officials. However, in fact, at the meeting, in-depth 
discussions were held on such topics as progress in North 
Korea's nuclear development, and its strike capability. 
  "At the meeting, they agreed to hold a Japan-Russia meeting 
of defense officials in Tokyo around February 1994 (recently the 
meeting was scheduled for 1-2 February). When the meeting is 
held, Russia will bring a more detailed, precise report on North 
Korea's military power. Actually, the Military Strategy 
Research Center has been ordered to work out a report needed for 
the meeting." 
  It is true that former Director-General of the Defense 
Agency 
Nakanishi was eager to develop a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) 
system jointly with the United States. It is also true that 
after Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the United States for 
the summit meeting, Japanese ministries and agencies concerned 
with North Korean issues have started seriously studying 
possible economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the 
people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed 
by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects 
the future security of Japan. Meanwhile, the government is 
seeking a new framework for security. The situation is getting 
serious, and for Japan, this is no time to be carried away by 
"Hosokawa's performance." 
  The senior officer also said: "Russia is not the only 
country 
which provides North Korea with nuclear resources. You probably 
do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea. 
It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been 
brought in to North Korea only recently. 
  "It is said the source of that uranium is factories in 
Mordai 
[as published] and Choera [as published] in China. If so, 
nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level 
radioactive material. However, if it is so inclined, North 
Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how. 
  "What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea 
already has at least one atomic bomb and 1,000-kilometer range 
missiles."
