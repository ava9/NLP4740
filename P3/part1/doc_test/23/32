  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The 2nd economic committee 
of the Worker's (Nodong) Party, which is directly controlled by 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il, is 
managing Pyongyang's nuclear development through enormous 
expenditures, a former North Korean worker at a uranium 
refinery, who defected to the South early this month, told a 
Japanese vernacular newspaper Friday. 
  "North Korea succeeded in extracting 12 kilograms of 
plutonium in 1988," 35-year-old Kim Tae-ho said in Seoul in an 
interview with the YOMIURI SHIMBUN. 
  On the surface, North Korea's nuclear program is seemingly 
under the control of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry, but in 
fact it is managed by party Secretary Chon Pyong-ho, chief of 
the 2nd Economic Committee, Kim said. 
  The 2nd Economic Committee commands the logistics and atomic 
energy industries and the nuclear program is managed by its 
subordinate agency, called the 5th General Machinery Industry 
Bureau, he said. 
  All facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex are 
administered by the 5th Machinery Industry General Bureau and 
Economic Committee Chief Chon are operating them under direct 
instructions from Kim Il- song and his son. 
  Saying he had heard stories from several of his friends 
working as nuclear researchers, Kim told the YOMIURI that North 
Korea first succeeded in withdrawing plutonium from spent fuel 
in the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 
1988. 
  "Kim Il-song and his son were so happy that they went down 
to 
the reactor and gave each of the researchers and engineers a 
color television receiver," he said. 
  The extracted plutonium was estimated to weigh 12 kilograms, 
sufficient to produce two nuclear bombs, Kim pointed out. "In 
light of North Korea's technology, they (North Koreans) have yet 
to produce nuclear bombs, but I think they are near completion, 
he said. 
  He said a military coup was attempted in a bid to overthrow 
the Kim Il-song regime early last year. It was led by Vice 
Marshal Kim Pong-yul and several generals who studied in the 
former Soviet Union. They were all captured after their coup 
plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director Yi 
Pong-won, Kim said. 
  Before fleeing to South Korea, Kim worked at a uranium 
refinery in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province, which sends ore 
to a processing factory in Yongbyon. The ore is known to be 
processed into fuel rods for use at nuclear reactors.
