to win concessions on inspections

South Korea has voiced doubts about North Korea's claims that it is removing
spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor without the supervision of
international observers, who want to test them for clues to the North's
suspected nuclear weapons programme.
The US has warned that North Korea's action could scuttle negotiations over
international inspections of the North's nuclear sites and force the United
Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions.
But officials in Seoul believe Pyongyang's notification of the fuel rod
replacement to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday may be part
of a bluff to win new concessions on inspection procedures.
North Korea may be trying to force the US to hold a new round of high-level
talks before allowing the IAEA access to the fuel rods. The status of the
nuclear reactor refuelling may be revealed later this week, when the IAEA is
expected to resume an inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities that
were blocked in March.
North Korea last week agreed to accept the inspectors after the IAEA
promised it would not demand immediate inspection of the fuel rods being
unloaded from the 5MW reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
The IAEA wants to analyse the fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has
previously diverted plutonium from the reactor to develop nuclear devices.
The reactor started operation in 1986, but was shut down for three months in
1989. The IAEA suspects that North Korea could have unloaded some of the
rods during that period and reprocessed the fuel for nuclear weapons.
A dispute over the fuel rods has blocked progress over nuclear inspections
in recent weeks. The IAEA previously asked to examine the fuel rods once
they were removed from the reactor. But North Korea rejected the demand and
threatened to replace the fuel rods without IAEA supervision, which would
violate the international nuclear safeguards agreement.
The US has expressed concern that unsupervised replacement of the fuel rods
would allow North Korea to divert enough plutonium to produce four or five
nuclear devices in addition to the two it is suspected of already
possessing.
Washington threatened to ask the UN Security Council to impose sanctions
against North Korea if it replaced the fuel rods without international
oversight.
The conditions for the IAEA's supervision and testing of the fuel rods could
be the subject of a new round of high-level talks between the US and North
Korea.
