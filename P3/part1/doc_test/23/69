    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and reports carried by Seoul vernacular dailies on 22 
April on the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry regarding North Korea's possible possession of enough 
plutonium to produce four or five nuclear weapons. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 200-word 
report entitled "North Korea Will Possess Enough Plutonium To 
Produce Four or Five Nuclear Weapons." The report begins: "U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry said on 21 April that there 
is political tension, but no military tension, on the Korean 
peninsula. The United States does not want a war to be waged on 
the Korean peninsula, nor provoke a war, nor invite it." 
  Referring to the remarks by U.S. Government officials in the 
past that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to produce 
one or two nuclear weapons, the report writes: "U.S. Secretary 
of Defense Perry said that North Korea will have enough extra 
plutonium within weeks to produce four or five nuclear weapons." 
  CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled 
"The Remarks by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry." 
Referring to his remarks that there is no danger of a war on 
the Korean peninsula, the editorial expresses relief, because 
Perry's remarks must have been made based on good information. 
  The editorial continues: "It is important to make people 
trust in the government's readiness in dealing with North 
Korea," referring to the people's attachment of more importance 
to the government's action and steps. The editorial adds that 
"it is important for the government to always prepare for the 
danger of war." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 300-word report 
entitled "There Is No Immediate Danger of War on the Korean 
Peninsula." Referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry's remarks that media reports on tension on the Korean 
peninsula is exaggerated, the report writes: "He said that 
North Korea would change fuel bars in its 5-megawatt reactor 
within weeks and this fuel would provide sufficient plutonium to 
make four or five nuclear bombs." 
  HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled 
"The Changing Situation Regarding the North Korean Nuclear 
Issue." Referring to the meeting between ROK National Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae and U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry on the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial writes: 
"It is very significant that the ROK and United States have 
agreed to strengthen their joint combatant capabilities to 
prepare for a surprise attack by North Korea." 
  The editorial continues: "The ROK and U.S. Governments have 
set the timing of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise at 
around November, which is an expression of their firm will to 
cooperate on dealing with North Korea." Noting remarks by U.S. 
Government officials that North Korea possesses enough plutonium 
to produce nuclear weapons, the editorial writes: "These 
remarks attract the people's attention because they negate the 
remarks made by President Kim Il-song that North Korea will not 
produce nuclear weapons, nor feel the need to produce them." 
  Referring to North Korea's reaction to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, request for additional inspections 
of its nuclear facilities, the editorial writes: "It is not 
hard to access the background of North Korea's change of 
attitude. The reason North Korea has changed its attitude is 
the fact that there is only a few days remaining until the IAEA 
deadline for additional inspections, as set forth in the 
presidential statement by the UN Security Council." 
  The editorial continues: "The change in North Korea's 
attitude is to gain much more support from the United States 
during the third round of U.S.-DPRK high-level talks," and urges 
the government to be more prudent in dealing with North Korea in 
close cooperation with the United States. The editorial 
concludes: "It is important for the government to ask the 
United States to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks 
after North Korea accepts overall inspections [chonmyon sachal] 
of its nuclear facilities, as well as special inspections of its 
two nuclear waste material storage facilities [haekpyogimul 
chojangso]." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "ROK, U.S. Reaction to North Korean Nuclear 
Issue." The editorial writes the decisions made by ROK and U.S. 
defense ministers are very significant because it will prevent 
any difference between ROK and U.S. opinions regarding the North 
Korean nuclear issue and strengthens military alliance between 
the two countries. 
  The editorial continues that the decision to modernize the 
combined forces is more significant because "reaffirming the 
need for improvement of combat capacity, which is discussed in 
every annual Security Consultative Meeting, reflects the 
importance at this point." 
  The editorial stresses that in the meantime, the ROK and the 
United States should not rule out peaceful and diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "If North Korea Has Nuclear Bombs." 
Referring to the "shocking" remarks of U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry that North Korea will be able to make four to five nuclear 
bombs within weeks, the editorial writes it serves as a warning 
to the ROK Government's relaxed judgment underestimating North 
Korea's nuclear capability. 
  Denouncing the government's inconsistent policy on North 
Korean affairs, the editorial urges "immediate" and "major" 
changes of the security policy, the establishment of an 
independent intelligence system, and a review of the hasty 
denuclearization decision giving up nuclear reprocessing 
facilities. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,100-word 
article 
by reporter Yi Sang-ki entitled "Did He Sell Weapons or Not?" 
The article reports that although Secretary Perry denied he had 
tried to sell U.S. weapons, "there is a high possibility that 
the subject was discussed by the working-level officials of 
Secretary Perry's entourage by noting that the purchase of arms 
systems, including the global positioning system, was included 
on the agenda." 
  The article also analyzes that ROK Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae hinted at additional arms purchases by saying that 
priority will be given to counter-battery capability, 
night-fighting capability, and the enhancement of 
inter-operability to improve the combined forces. 
  The article reports that some officials of the ROK Defense 
Ministry expect more pressure to buy U.S. weapons and that the 
Defense Ministry is establishing its own new purchasing 
strategies irrespective of U.S. pressure.
