  [Text] Vienna, June 8 KYODO -- North Korea has virtually 
finished removing fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, defying 
demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to stop 
refueling, an IAEA spokesman said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  IAEA inspectors on the spot have confirmed the situation, 
the 
spokesman said. 
  The IAEA submitted a report last week to the United Nations 
Security Council saying Pyongyang has made it impossible to 
determine whether plutonium has been secretly taken from the 
fuel rods to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  An IAEA Board of Governors regular meeting now in session in 
Vienna is expected to resume debate as early as Thursday, and is 
likely to demand that North Korea accept inspections of its two 
undeclared nuclear facilities as a possible alternative means of 
judging if it has been developing nuclear arms. 
  The undeclared sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 
kilometers north of Pyongyang are suspected of being secretly 
used to develop nuclear arms. 
  North Korea has rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing 
fuel rods from the 5-megawatt reactor, also in Yongbyon. The 
nuclear watchdog said removal would spoil chances to determine 
if plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix said at the IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting Tuesday that it is now impossible for the U.N. 
agency to know whether North Korea is developing nuclear arms. 
  Blix also said inspections of two unreported sites suspected 
as nuclear waste facilities are now "even more important" and 
urged Pyongyang to cooperate. 
  Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the IAEA in Vienna, 
said Tuesday that North Korea will "never" allow special 
international inspections of the undeclared nuclear facilities, 
adding that the organization can carry out satisfactory 
inspections by checking the removed fuel rods.
