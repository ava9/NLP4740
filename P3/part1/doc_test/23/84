  [Text] Vienna (DPA) -- The International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) is still waiting with the inspection of the 
5-megawatt research reactor in the North Korean nuclear center 
of Yongbyon. The authority first wants binding promises from 
Pyongyang that the inspectors are permitted to carry out 
important control measures, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer 
told DPA in Vienna on Thursday [28 April]. "We will certainly 
not only stand aside and watch!" 
  Last week, North Korea had offered to allow the IAEA to 
monitor the necessary exchange of the fuel rods. In the letter, 
the IAEA inspectors had been invited to be "present." "We 
explained to North Korea once again that we want to carry out 
inspection activities and what they are," Meyer said. As 
reported from diplomatic circles in Vienna, the nuclear 
authority wants to measure above all the burned-out fuel rods. 
The diplomats hope that such analyses will provide them with 
the information on whether plutonium was set aside for the 
construction of nuclear bombs. 
  As early as in its first answer to Pyongyang, which accepted 
in principle the invitation from North Korea, the nuclear 
authority had pointed out that inspections are also becoming 
necessary again in the other nuclear plants. In particular, the 
radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon is at issue. In contrasts 
to all agreements, North Korea denied access to the laboratory 
to the experts of the UN organization in the course of the 
latest IAEA inspection one month ago. As a result, the nuclear 
authority decided to refer the nuclear dispute to the UN 
Security Council.
