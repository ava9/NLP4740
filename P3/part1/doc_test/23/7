  [Text] New York, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has 
fulfilled conditions for a resumption of high-level talks with 
the United States by not diverting spent nuclear fuel to 
military purposes, according to U.N. diplomatic sources familiar 
with Washington-Pyongyang negotiations. 
  The sources said late Monday Pyongyang's First Vice Foreign 
Minister Kang Sok-chu said in a June 3 statement that North 
Korea will not divert to military use any radioactive material 
from fuel rods withdrawn recently from an experimental nuclear 
reactor. 
  In the statement, Kang asserted it is still possible to test 
the spent fuel rods to ensure that no plutonium has been 
diverted to military purposes. 
  Kang urged the U.S. to resume talks with Pyongyang in order 
to reach a package solution to the nuclear issue but also said 
economic sanctions would be regarded as a "declaration of war." 
  During refueling operations of the research reactor in the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang 
last month, North Korea rejected demands by International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors that they be allowed to take 
samples from the 8,000 rods being withdrawn. 
  North Korean officials said it was setting aside 40 rods for 
testing later by the IAEA inspectors, but the Vienna-based U.N. 
monitoring agency rejected the offer as insufficient to ensure 
the continuity of the safeguards agreement. 
  The U.S. and other Western nations suspect that Pyongyang 
may be attempting to build an atomic weapons arsenal and are 
threatening U.N. sanctions if it continues to reject IAEA 
demands for checks. 
  Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes, but its intransigence over the inspections has fueled 
suspicions it may be trying to conceal a weapons development 
program. 
  Washington is offering to resume high-level talks with 
Pyongyang but wants to see a freeze on the suspected North 
Korean nuclear program. 
  This would include allowing two IAEA inspectors to remain in 
North Korea, no reprocessing of the discharged fuel rods and no 
reloading of the Yongbyon reactor. 
  Kang suggested in the June 3 statement that when a 
comprehensive resolution to the issue is reached with the U.S., 
North Korea would allow regular and special IAEA inspections of 
its nuclear facilities, return to the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and change to the safer light-water type of nuclear 
reactor.
