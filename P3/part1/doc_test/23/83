  [Text] Seoul, April 21 KYODO -- North Korea has told the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it will allow 
inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at its 
5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear site, the 
Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) reported Thursday [21 April]. 
  Pyongyang, in a telegram sent Wednesday to the UN nuclear 
watchdog, said it will exchange the fuel rods at the reactor 
soon and permit IAEA inspectors to monitor the process, 
according to KBS. 
  North Korea, however, stopped short of mentioning the 
possibility of complying with nuclear safeguard obligations by 
accepting additional inspections of its nuclear installations by 
the IAEA, KBS said. 
  The IAEA is reportedly expected to convey its position on 
the 
North Korean offer at an early date, the report said. 
  KBS said that the North Korean proposal seems to aim at 
breaking the nuclear impasse by making a counterproposal at a 
time when they are obligated to allow additional international 
inspections of the radiochemical laboratory. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a press conference 
Thursday that North Korea is close to removing the spent fuel 
from the 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor, enabling it to extract 
enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs. 
  Perry pointed to the need to monitor the removal of the 
fuel, 
saying, ``We believe it is critical that this operation is 
supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency.'' 
  A six-member IAEA inspection team went to North Korea in 
early March but was denied access to the radiochemical 
laboratory. The agency said the tests it wanted to carry out at 
the laboratory were necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has 
diverted nuclear materials. 
  The IAEA referred the matter on March 22 to the UN Security 
Council, which issued a presidential statement on March 31 
urging North Korea to allow the nuclear watchdog to complete the 
inspections. 
  North Korea denies western assertions that it is developing 
a 
nuclear arsenal, but refuses to allow international inspectors 
into some of its nuclear facilities.
