  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has agreed 
to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
conduct inspection on all seven reported nuclear facilities, the 
IAEA announced Tuesday. At a working-level contact in Vienna 
Tuesday, North Korea informed the IAEA that it will accept all 
IAEA conditions for inspection, the announcement said. 
  Meanwhile in New York, North Korea and the United States 
resumed their working-level meeting Tuesday to negotiate 
followup measures on IAEA inspection. 
  At the Vienna meeting, the IAEA told North Korea it plans to 
send a team of inspectors as soon as possible. It was reported 
that the team would be able to leave before Feb. 21 when the 
IAEA convenes a Board of Governors meeting. The team would 
probably leave Vienna for Pyongyang over the weekend if airline 
flight arrangements are made before that, sources said. 
  The IAEA said the purpose of the upcoming inspection is to 
see whether the nuclear materials in the seven reported 
facilities had been converted for other uses since February last 
year when the IAEA last conducted inspection. In addition, the 
IAEA plans to replace films and batteries for surveillance 
cameras after checking them to see if the IAEA seals were 
intact, IAEA officials said. These works will be conducted 
along with other basic inspection activities, the officials 
added. 
  The main point of the agreement was North Korea's acceptance 
of all the conditions the IAEA had laid out for the forthcoming 
inspection, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said. He declined, 
however, to disclose the details of inspection activities. 
  Meyer also explained that the agreement does not mean that 
there was a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Tuesday's agreement covers the upcoming inspection only, he 
said. The IAEA would not characterize the forthcoming 
inspection as being ad hoc or routine. 
  The inspection team, comprising six to seven experts, is 
expected to stay in North Korea for two to three weeks, IAEA 
officials said. 
  Councilor Yun Ho-chin of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna 
said that the agreement was reached in order to maintain 
continuity in nuclear safeguards. "We are satisfied with the 
outcome (of the negotiations)," he said. 
  In another development, North Korea is reportedly sending a 
high-level delegation to the IAEA board meeting Feb. 21. It was 
not immediately known, however, who would lead the delegation. 
The IAEA-North Korean agreement came after six rounds of talks 
since Pyongyang and Washington reached an accord in New York on 
Jan. 7. Despite Tuesday's agreement, the question of inspecting 
two unreported nuclear sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex is 
still pending, presumably for the two sides to discuss later.
