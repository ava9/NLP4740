FT  06 JUN 94 / Seoul on hook of unattractive options: There are risks in
both war and sanctions

The deepening crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme is provoking much
soul-searching in South Korea.
The possibility that United Nations economic sanctions could trigger a
military response from North Korea is raising doubts about whether the South
should risk going to war to stop the North from possessing a nuclear weapon.
A conflict could cost several million civilian lives and the destruction of
Seoul, the South Korean capital, which lies only 35 miles from the
demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas.
The no-war scenario is also alarming. An international trade embargo could
cause the tottering North Korean economy to collapse and with it the
government of President Kim Il-sung - a prospect that scares Seoul almost as
much as a military conflict.
Such a premature reunification of Korea would force South Korea to spend as
much as Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133.3bn) on reconstruction costs to absorb the
North, while diverting resources from the South's push to create an advanced
industrial base that would compete effectively against the West and Japan.
The complexity of the situation is in sharp contrast to the clear-cut cold
war view of North Korea during the 1961-1987 period of military rule in
South Korea. The government and public then widely regarded North Korea as a
dangerous foe that must be brought quickly to its knees.
That attitude has not completely disappeared under the democratic government
of President Kim Young-sam. The military and intelligence service contend
that North Korea is intent on developing a nuclear weapon, possibly to
support a forced reunification on Pyongyang's terms.
They warn that North Korea has talked about reunifying the 'fatherland' in
1995, the symbolic 50th anniversary of Korea's division after the
peninsula's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
North Korea's apparent efforts to destroy evidence of its suspected nuclear
weapons programme by removing spent fuel rods from its reactor and hiding
them from international inspectors has strengthened the position of South
Korean officials who favour a hard line toward Pyongyang.
But the belief that North Korea still harbours hostile intentions toward the
South has been met with increased scepticism among some South Koreans,
particularly those born after the Korean War ended in 1953.
The South's growing prosperity and democratic progress have increased
national self-confidence. It has supported the perception that the South has
already won its cold war against the struggling and isolated North and has
little to fear from it.
Government officials who favour a conciliatory approach toward North Korea
argue that Pyongyang is using its nuclear programme as a bargaining chip to
win security guarantees from the US, including diplomatic recognition and
economic aid.
These officials believe that the North may not even have the technical
capability to build a nuclear weapon, but Pyongyang needs to create the
impression that it is pursuing such a programme to bolster its negotiating
position with the US.
The action by North Korea to bar international inspections of the spent fuel
rods is part of its strategy to maintain uncertainty over the extent of the
programme until Pyongyang wins the concessions it seeks, according to this
theory.
Outside government, there are widening generational differences on the North
Korean issue. University students believe that the US and Japan, rather than
North Korea, represent the biggest potential threats to South Korea,
according to a recent survey.
Radical students view the nuclear dispute in a pan-Korean nationalist
perspective, claiming that the crisis has been provoked by the US to reverse
Washington's dwindling influence on the Korean peninsula and to force Seoul
to buy US weapons, such as the Patriot missile. Anti-American feeling is
widespread among students because of past US support for the country's
military rulers.
Distrust toward Japan is even greater as it develops a nuclear reprocessing
capability and the potential means to build a atomic bomb. Opposition
politicians are demanding that South Korea should acquire nuclear processing
facilities in response.
There is growing public sentiment that a North Korean nuclear bomb programme
may not be such a bad thing as South Korea could inherit it after
reunification and use it to defend Korea against Japan.
The best-selling book in South Korea recently has been a thriller describing
a secret joint North-South programme to build a nuclear weapon, which is
then used to stop a Japanese attack on Korea in the late-1990s. 'Many people
find the book thought-provoking and wonder why South Korea shouldn't have a
nuclear weapon,' said one Korean journalist.
The popularity of the novel suggests that one unexpected result of the North
Korea nuclear dispute could be growing public acceptance for a more
assertive and independent South Korean foreign policy, including the
possession of its own nuclear arsenal.
