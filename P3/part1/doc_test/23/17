  [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea on Friday [20 
May] rejected demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) that it halt removal of spent fuel rods without proper 
inspections at an experimental nuclear reactor 90 kilometers 
north of Pyongyang. 
  North Korean Ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun told 
reporters that a resolution of the issue would be conditioned on 
resumption of bilateral talks with the United States, suspended 
after two rounds last July. 
  "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North 
Korea) 
and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then 
the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he 
said. 
  Earlier in the day, the IAEA confirmed that despite its 
warnings, North Korea had started removing spent fuel rods from 
its 5-megawatt experimental reactor without IAEA inspectors 
present. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said it has sent a letter 
to 
North Korea, warning that further removal of the rods without 
proper inspections would be a violation of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and safeguard agreements concluded 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  The IAEA demanded the operations be suspended until 
arrangements can be made to ensure the rods are properly marked 
and separated for sampling. 
  The three IAEA inspectors now at the Yongbyon nuclear 
complex 
since Wednesday have not been allowed to take samples or make 
tests on the spent rods. 
  The IAEA has insisted that the rods must be sorted and 
examined to see whether plutonium has been diverted for a 
nuclear weapons program. 
  Without the samples, the IAEA has said it will not be able 
to 
determine whether North Korea has complied with a nuclear 
safeguards agreement. 
  The Vienna-based agency said it is preparing to dispatch 
another delegation of experts to North Korea to discuss 
safeguards measures. 
  U.S. officials have said that spent fuel currently being 
withdrawn from the reactor could provide enough plutonium to 
build four or five atomic bombs. 
  Refusal to comply with the IAEA's demands would also raise 
the possibility the watchdog agency will refer the problem to 
the U.N. Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions. 
  On Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton reacted cautiously 
to reports that Pyongyang has begun removing spent fuel rods 
without the presence of international inspectors. 
  "I want to know what the facts are, and when I do, then I 
will make a more definite statement," he told reporters. 
  Clinton called it "an error" for North Korea to thwart IAEA 
inspections after it had agreed to comply with them. 
  A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed regret 
and concern Friday that North Korea has already begun removing 
the rods in defiance of international demands not to do so. 
  Seoul also urged Pyongyang to immediately resume talks with 
the IAEA to discuss matters of full compliance with their 
nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  "South Korea will consult closely with allies about what 
steps it will take, watching the result of talks between North 
Korea and the IAEA," the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY 
(KCNA) quoted North Korean President Kim Il-song as saying in a 
recent interview, "we feel no need to develop nuclear weapons 
and even if we were to manufacture one or two of them, they 
would be useless." 
  North Korea insists its nuclear power program is only for 
peaceful purposes, but refusal to comply with inspection demands 
has aroused suspicions that it may be trying to build an atomic 
bomb. 
  A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, told reporters in Washington that the U.S. will 
drop its "patient diplomacy" if Pyongyang is found to have 
cheated on nuclear inspections. 
  "We're prepared to consider other options," he said, adding 
that the U.S. sees an advantage in exhausting diplomatic means 
to persuade the North Koreans to give up their alleged nuclear 
development before applying sanctions. 
  The U.S. has indicated it would pursue economic sanctions 
against Pyongyang through the United Nations or together with 
Japan and South Korea if the nuclear program is not made more 
transparent. 
  Pyongyang has said it would consider sanctions an act of 
war.
