FT  19 OCT 94 / A pact shaped in distrust: The US-North Korea nuclear accord

When the US and North Korea sign their nuclear agreement on Friday, it will
set in motion a train of events that could last almost a decade before the
dispute is completely settled.
The goal is to remove suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme while
breaking Pyongyang's diplomatic isolation and providing it with much-needed
economic aid in the form of new nuclear reactors and other energy supplies.
The accord consists of phased steps designed to provide each side with
leverage to make sure that the other adheres to its promises. This reflects
the deep mutual distrust which exists between the US and North Korea and
which prevented an agreement being reached earlier.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, yesterday described the
agreement as a combination of steps in an 'incremental process'.
The elements of the deal, details of which will be announced on Friday,
include North Korea abandoning its nuclear programme and accepting full
international inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for improved
ties with the US and economic aid. Pyongyang also promises to resume
negotiations with South Korea on the implementation of their 1991
non-nuclear pact.
Many pitfalls lie along the way, with parts of the carefully calibrated
timetable remaining unclear.
The first steps are likely in the next month or two. They include North
Korea returning to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepting ad hoc
and regular inspections at its Yongbyon nuclear complex from the
International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea threatened to withdraw from
the NPT in March 1993 and later 'suspended' its treaty obligations, which
provoked its confrontation with the US and South Korea.
At the same time, North Korea will freeze its programme. This includes
suspending the operation of its 5MW graphite reactor and halting
construction of two larger 50MW and 200MW reactors, which can produce
considerable amounts of weapons-grade plutonium. It will also close its
suspected nuclear reprocessing centre. All these facilities are later to be
dismantled.
North Korea will place in dry storage spent fuel that it withdrew from its
5MW reactor last spring. The fuel, which could produce enough plutonium for
four or five nuclear bombs, will later be transferred to a third country for
reprocessing.
But Pyongyang will only accept at a later stage special inspections by the
IAEA to determine if it had reprocessed plutonium for one or two nuclear
bombs in 1989. The IAEA wants to examine two undeclared nuclear waste dumps
to answer this question.
The special inspection demand triggered North Korea's threatened withdrawal
from the NPT and lies at the core of the dispute. North Korea may only allow
the special inspections once equipment for new and safer light-water
reactors is delivered over the next several years, but before they are
completely built.
North Korea has agreed to resume negotiations with South Korea on their 1991
de-nuclearisation treaty. However, South Korea is demanding inspections that
are more intrusive than those to be conducted by the IAEA, and prospects for
those talks remain uncertain.
Disagreements over South Korea's demand for spot or challenge inspections of
suspected nuclear facilities in the North led to the breakdown of the talks
in 1992.
In return for the North Korean concessions, the US has offered several
promises. They include a guarantee to provide North Korea with two 1,000MW
light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies while they are being
constructed during the next decade. This would help solve North Korea's
chronic energy shortage, which has been one of the main reasons for its
declining economy.
The light-water reactors are dependent on imported enriched uranium for
fuel, making it easier for the US and other countries to maintain control
over the future North Korean nuclear programme. They also produce plutonium
less suitable for the manufacturing of atomic weapons. The current graphite
reactors use uranium mined in North Korea.
The light-water reactors will be supplied by an international consortium,
probably led by the US. But the reactors are expected to be built by South
Korean companies using a Westinghouse design. Seoul will also provide the
bulk of the financing for the Dollars 4bn project, although contributions
are also expected from Japan and other countries, according to Mr Han.
In the meantime, North Korea will start receiving heavy fuel oil fuel
supplies from an international consortium to replace energy lost from the
shutdown of the graphite reactors.
The US has also promised to improve ties with North Korea by establishing
liaison offices. It is also expected to ease its trade embargo against North
Korea and possibly offer a pledge not to launch a nuclear attack against
North Korea, a guarantee Pyongyang has long sought.
However, the pace of US-North Korean negotiations may be determined by
progress in the inter-Korean talks, although Mr Han said there were 'not
one-to-one preconditional constraints' between the two.
South Korean has insisted on linking the resumption of inter-Korean talks
with the US-North Korean accord out of concern that Pyongyang is trying to
drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington on the nuclear issue.
