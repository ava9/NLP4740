with Washington could lead to a united Korean peninsula

The nuclear agreement between the US and North Korea signed last Friday
could prove a turning point for the Korean peninsula.
The deal looks set to reverse North Korea's flagging economic fortunes and
increase the links between North and South - offering the best hope yet for
the reunification of the two countries, divided since 1945.
Promises of improved diplomatic ties, and security guarantees, should
encourage North Korea to open to foreign investment and goods, as well as
energy supplies. However, mutual distrust could still unravel the deal's mix
of concessions and incentives.
North Korean reform has already gathered momentum this year. The death in
July of President Kim Il-sung, the country's only leader since its
establishment in 1948, marked the end of the old guard, which favoured the
policy of juche (self-reliance).
The expected assumption of power by his son, Mr Kim Jong-il, in the next few
weeks will strengthen the influence of a younger generation of technocrats,
who support an opening of the country and appear to have the approval of the
new leader.
This emerging class argues that North Korea must change course to avoid
economic collapse. Dwindling economic aid in the past four years from
Russia, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and China has led to
energy and food shortages and a 5 per cent annual contraction of the
economy.
'North Korea is shifting from the aggressive guerrilla-style communism of
Kim Il-sung and his dream of forced reunification of the Korean peninsula to
a pragmatic policy of emphasising domestic economic issues and maintaining
political control a la China,' said Mr Michael Breen, editor of Korea
Countdown, a Seoul-based newsletter on North Korea.
The role of North Korean technocrats in the complex nuclear negotiations of
the past 19 months supports the view that Pyongyang has exploited
international concerns over its nuclear programme to win diplomatic and
economic support for its economic revival.
North Korea 'has finally got everyone's attention,' said Mr Stephen Linton
of the Center for Korean Studies at Columbia University in the US. 'After
almost a half century of enmity' between North Korea and the US, they 'seem
to be sincerely committed to making progress toward a lasting peace.'
North Korea has certainly reaped significant economic benefits from the
nuclear agreement. In return for abandoning its nuclear programme, which is
capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, the country will receive oil
supplies from the west, followed by safer modern light-water reactors. These
will help the country deal with the chronic energy problems that have been
the prime cause of its economic troubles.
The US has also promised improved diplomatic ties, which could clear the way
for additional western aid and trade. The easing or lifting of the US trade
embargo against North Korea could allow the country to join the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank. This would give it access to
multilateral financing, which could be used to support the development of
free economic zones for foreign investment and to repair the country's
crumbling roads and railways.
The normalisation of relations with the US would also encourage improved
links with Japan, which could bring billions of dollars in reparations from
Tokyo for its colonial occupation of Korea.
The security guarantees given by the US as part of the nuclear deal may also
see Pyongyang's attitude to the outside world become less paranoid. The US
has pledged that its nuclear weapons will never be used against North Korea,
and has agreed to suspend the annual large-scale US-South Korean 'Team
Spirit' military exercises.
Such notable diplomatic gains, so soon after his father's death, are likely
to bolster Mr Kim Jong-il's prestige and remove doubts among possible rivals
about his capability to run the country.
Nonetheless, Pyongyang is taking risks in accepting the nuclear agreement.
North Korea will become dependent on its former enemies in the west for
crucial energy supplies, including oil and enriched uranium to fuel its new
reactors. This will give Washington unprecedented leverage in influencing
future developments in the North, unless Pyongyang can find alternative
sources, such as China.
A more serious danger for Pyongyang is that growing foreign influence could
undermine a government that has built public support on decades of intense
and ceaseless propaganda.
'Kim Jong-il knows that a major relaxation would permit people to focus on
the internal causes of their troubles, which is the regime itself and the
system it enforces,' said Mr Bradley Martin, a Fulbright scholar who is
preparing a book on North Korea.
Mr Breen adds: 'The dilemma for North Korea is that it needs to open, but
the question is how much without causing internal troubles.'
Pyongyang is betting on economic aid halting the slide in living standards,
and on increased domestic production of consumer goods by both foreign and
local companies. But some analysts believe North Korea cannot save its
economy without widespread reforms that would dismantle its
centrally-planned economy and weaken political control.
The nuclear agreement is also risky for the US and its South Korean ally.
The delay in international inspections of some of the North's nuclear
facilities gives Pyongyang several more years to perfect at least one atomic
bomb from the plutonium it may have already reprocessed.
Moreover, some officials in Seoul are concerned that Washington's promise
never to launch a nuclear strike against North Korea leaves South Korea
vulnerable by removing it from the US nuclear umbrella.
They predict that once Pyongyang achieves diplomatic ties with the US, it
will increase pressure on Washington to sign a formal treaty ending the
1950-1953 Korean war and to withdraw 40,000 American troops from South
Korea.
Seoul has gained one important advantage from the nuclear agreement,
however. If implemented, the treaty is more likely to bring a gradual
reunification of the two Koreas, than a sudden collapse of the North,
requiring a costly rescue by the South.
The turmoil caused by the German unification process has prompted fear among
South Koreans of the effects of a similar process on their own doorstep.
Rapid unification with a broken economy might cripple South Korea's efforts
to become an advanced industrial nation by forcing it to divert scarce
resources to reconstruct the North. According to some government estimates,
such a process could cost as much as Dollars 250bn-Dollars 400bn over 10
years.
Instead, the nuclear pact opens the way for South Korea to start investing
in the North, laying the foundation for a smooth merger of the two Koreas in
perhaps the next decade or two.
The South's leading conglomerates, or chaebol, are already preparing plans,
with Pyongyang's approval, to establish light industrial factories in the
North. Seoul's central role in constructing the new light-water reactors for
North Korea will also begin the process of connecting the two countries'
infrastructures.
But much could go wrong during the nuclear agreement's protracted timetable.
The North Koreans are tough bargainers and may try to exploit the terms of
the accord to wring new concessions from the west, such as the conclusion of
a US-North Korean peace treaty. Much will also depend on Mr Kim Jong-il's
ability to deliver Pyongyang's side of the bargain - and he is thought to be
in poor health.
The agreement has begun a process that will gather momentum. It has struck a
fine balance between North Korea's economic gains and the world's security
gains: unification could quickly turn the Koreas into one of the world's
economic powerhouses. But it remains an ambitious undertaking.
