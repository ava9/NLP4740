North Korea has already developed five nuclear bombs and plans to build
more, a senior North Korean defector claimed yesterday.
Mr Kang Myong-do, a son-in-law of the North Korean prime minister, said the
nuclear weapons programme was meant to protect the North against the US and
South Korea.
'By possessing nuclear weapons, North Korea thinks it can be relieved from
security worries and will be able to divert resources from the arms industry
to agriculture and light industry,' which could help rescue its shrinking
economy.
Mr Kang appeared at a news conference yesterday with Mr Cho Myong-chol, the
son of a former construction minister, who defected last week. They are the
two most senior North Korean officials to have fled to South Korea.
South Korea's decision to hold a press conference appears to be part of a
renewed propaganda war between Seoul and Pyongyang following President Kim's
death.
Their appearance was almost certainly meant to embarrass North Korea as it
celebrated Victory Day, which marks the end of the Korean war in 1953.
North Korea, which routinely claims that defectors have been kidnapped by
Seoul, is likely to react strongly. The increased tensions between the two
Koreas are reducing chances of a summit between their two leaders after it
was postponed due to Mr Kim Il-sung's death.
Analysts are also interested in what effect Mr Kang's defection will have on
the future of Prime Minister Kang Song-san, the third-ranking official in
North Korea.
Mr Kang, whose arrival in Seoul from China in May was disclosed only
yesterday, claimed the North's nuclear policy was to make about 10 nuclear
bombs before revealing their existence.
Some analysts were sceptical about Mr Kang's allegations. They expressed
doubts about the North's technical capability to assemble nuclear devices
and the number of bombs claimed by Mr Kang.
Mr Kim Jong-il, the new North Korean leader, 'is trying his utmost to
postpone nuclear inspections until the North manufactures as many nuclear
warheads as needed. By then, the US could not attack the North because of
the North's possession of nuclear bombs and could use them as a card in
negotiations with the US to win diplomatic recognition and economic aid,' he
claimed.
The US Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea has
reprocessed enough plutonium to make one or two nuclear devices.
Mr Kang's claim that the North has acquired five nuclear bombs was based on
a discussion he had with a senior security official at the Yongbyon nuclear
complex.
The two defectors expressed opposition to Mr Kim Jong-il's recent assumption
of power following the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung.
But they said Mr Kim was in firm control of North Korea, having exercised
extensive administrative powers since 1985. However, food shortages and
other economic problems threatened his rule, while the military was divided
in its loyalty to him.
