CHINA yesterday clashed with other members of the International Atomic
Energy Agency's governing board over North Korea's nuclear programme.
At a meeting of the 35 governors in Vienna, China refused to back a motion
referring the dispute over inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities to
the United Nations Security Council. Talks are due to continue today. An
IAEA official said the board could overrule China with a majority vote.
However, Algeria, chairing the meeting, urged consensus.
The meeting was also expected to call on Mr Hans Blix, the agency's director
general, to continue efforts to find a way out of the dispute.
On February 25, the IAEA gave North Korea a month to agree to inspections of
two facilities near its Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea announced 15
days later that it was withdrawing from the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which it signed in 1985.
Western governments have been counting on a co-operative attitude from China
in their efforts to persuade North Korea to change its mind. But Beijing has
already made clear it opposes the imposition of Security Council sanctions.
South Korea yesterday continued to urge a cautious response and suggested
that the problem could be resolved through diplomacy.
President Kim Young-sam said he expected talks between the two Koreas could
resume soon following the recent end of the US-South Korean 'Team Spirit'
military exercise that Pyongyang cited as one reason for its rejection of
the treaty.
Meanwhile, the North Korean ambassador to Vienna indicated yesterday there
was room for compromise on inspections. Mr Kim Kwang-sup told South Korea's
state television that Pyongyang is willing to accept 'temporary inspections'
of nuclear facilities by the IAEA.
