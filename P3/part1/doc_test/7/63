The era of private space travel was launched today when the nation's first 
licensed commercial rocket, carrying six experiments, soared into the sky for a 
brief suborbital flight and its payload parachuted back to Earth.

Starfire 1, owned by Space Services Inc. of America, a small Houston company 
run by developer David Hannah Jr. and Mercury 7 astronaut Deke Slayton, blasted 
off into clear blue skies at 8:40 a.m. from White Sands Missile Range.

The flight was paid for by the Consortium for Materials Development in Space at
