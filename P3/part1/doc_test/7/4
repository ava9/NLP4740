  [Text] Moscow, 3 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today sent greetings to the participants of the joint 
Russian-American space flight on the American space shuttle 
Discovery. 
  In his address circulated by the presidential press service, 
Boris Yeltsin says, among other things, that this space flight 
is not a routine event. For the first time a Russian national, 
Sergey Krikalev, joins an American space crew. 
  The Russian president says that the Russian space station 
Mir 
is soon to host an American astronaut. He says: "This is a 
prominent example of cooperation and partnership, which is being 
established and strengthened between our two countries and 
peoples. The relations between Russia and America are becoming 
increasingly based on trust. We are beginning to realize ever 
more clearly that we must unite our efforts in order to resolve 
complicated issues, both on the Earth and in space, for the 
benefit of our peoples and in the interest of all mankind." 
  The Russian president hopes the participants in the joint 
Russian-American space flight will complete their work 
successfully and return safely to their home planet.
