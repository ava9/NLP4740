  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- Forty eight carrier 
rockets blasted off the launching pads of Baykonur (Kazakhstan) 
and Plesetsk (Russia) during 1993. The rockets launched 59 
different space apparatuses into orbit. The share of Plesetsk 
northern "space harbour" -- amounted to 26 carrier rockets and 
36 space apparatuses. 
  A two-thirds of the space apparatus launchings were carried 
out for the Russian Defence Ministry, and the rest were for 
other ministries and departments. The most often used rockets 
were the R-7a -- three-stage "Soyuz" carrier rockets (18 
launchings) and the "Molnia" four-stage -- (8). Sixty-five per 
cent of all space apparatuses were put into orbit during the 
first half of 1993. The second quarter of 1993 turned out to be 
the busiest period, with 24 Russian satellite launchings. 
  Such a tight launching schedule of launchings became 
possible 
only thanks to the hard work put in by the personnel of space 
military forces of Russia, three of whom, officers Aleksey 
Metelkin, Andrey Nesytov and Vladimir Dubovik (all from 
Plesetsk) were decorated with military awards on orders of the 
president of the Russian Federation for displaying courage in 
conditions which endangered their lives. 
  But the number of launches in 1993 was less than that 
carried 
out in 1992, when 55 carrier rockets put 75 space apparatuses 
into orbit. This was, firstly, due to the introduction of a new 
generation of space systems with long-term functioning periods 
in space. For example, the global navigational satellite system 
was inducted in 1993. Secondly, due to inadequate state 
financing, 1993 was the first year not a single carrier rocket 
complex for scientific purposes was launched. 
  Besides this, the "Proton" carrier rocket disaster of May 
27, 
1993 delayed carrier rocket launchings for four months. As a 
result, only three "Proton" launchings could take place by the 
end of 1993. 
  Nevertheless, the new year promises to be sufficiently busy. 
This year's programme will begin with the launching of the 
"Soyuz TM-18" manned space ship which is scheduled to be put 
into orbit on January 8.
