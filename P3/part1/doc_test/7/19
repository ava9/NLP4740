Inspired in part by a letter written by Nobel Peace laureate Andrei D. Sakharov 
just before his death, the United States has agreed to join the Soviet Union in 
operating the first orbiting radiotelescope, the two countries announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint appearance, Vice President Dan Quayle and Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. 
Dubinin hailed the venture as a harbinger of a new era of cooperation between 
the world's dominant space powers. Quayle called it a "significant step," to be 
followed by a "fresh look at international cooperation and all of the options 
that will be available to us." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials plan to launch their Radioastron telescope into Earth orbit 
sometime between 1993 and 1995. Its 33-foot antenna dish will be tuned to 
distant galaxies and objects such as neutron stars and pulsars, which present 
intriguing clues about the nature of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement between the two countries, the United States will provide 
ground-based recorder terminals to receive and process data transmitted by the 
telescope. It also will make U.S. radiotelescope dishes in this country and in 
the Southern Hemisphere available to work in conjunction with the orbiting 
Soviet instrument. 
</P>
<P>
American scientists will be asked to join Soviet colleagues in planning the 
two-to-five-year mission, including the selection of stars and galaxies to be 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
Details regarding the use of U.S. radiotelescopes in the effort still are being 
worked out by the National Science Foundation and the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory. But National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said 
the use of American dishes will permit the orbiting Soviet instrument to make 
useful observations 90% of the time while it is on orbit, instead of 40% 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen other nations also are participating in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the most notable cooperative venture between the United States and 
Soviet space programs was in July, 1975, when an American Apollo spacecraft 
made an orbital rendezvous and docked with a Soviet Soyuz vehicle, allowing 
astronaut crews to exchange visits. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed in 1987 that the two countries 
cooperate in the exploration of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, NASA Administrator Richard Truly received a letter from 
Sakharov, the famed Soviet physicist and political dissident, urging the United 
States to participate with the Soviets in the Radioastron project. 
</P>
<P>
It was said to have been one of the last letters signed by Sakharov before he 
died last Dec. 14 from an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, American space officials already were looking for potential 
cooperative undertakings with the Soviets. Truly referred the letter to the 
National Space Council. Quayle, the panel's chairman, became interested and 
pursued it with Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
The recording equipment the United States will provide for the Radioastron 
project already has been designed, and an export licensed has been obtained to 
ship four units to the Soviet Union for use in the project. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lending recording and processing equipment, the United States 
will make its tracking and data acquisition network around the world available 
to support the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle declined to speculate where the cooperative undertaking may lead, but he 
said the Bush Administration believes that the United States is "entering a 
golden era in relation to space exploration." 
</P>
<P>
The endeavor, Dubinin predicted, will be a "good and wonderful project," the 
beginning of "a new phase" in U.S.-Soviet relations.
