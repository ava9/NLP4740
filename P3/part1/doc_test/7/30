<F P=106> [Article by Leonard Nikishin, under the rubric "Crisis of </F>
Genre": "Russia Has Given the Astro-Vehicle to America;" first 
paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] A third of a century separates us from 12 
April 1961, when the first space flight was performed. Over that 
span of time, the world has changed in a way no one could have 
known, and space operations, with their broad scope, have lost 
their romantic aura and are being viewed today from pragmatic 
standpoints. But they won't have to answer to that criterion 
forever. 
  Twenty-five years ago, the steps taken by Armstrong and 
Aldrin on the Moon destroyed the propaganda myth about our 
preeminence in space, and since a similar Soviet program (highly 
secret) had crumbled completely, our leaders had to quickly save 
face with something else. The helping hand turned out to be 
excellent: an orbital station, an "outpost for man in the 
Universe." 
  They rivetted it together hastily, as we say. At that time, 
in the early '70s, the design bureau of Academician Vladimir 
Chelomey was slowly developing the Almaz manned station for 
military purposes (which ultimately was of no use to the 
military). The drawings for the structure of the living quarters 
had already been done. In Sergey Korolev's design bureau, those 
quarters were quickly filled with gear from the Soyuz 
spacecraft, and the Salyut-1 station was practically ready. 
Brezhnev, with obvious relief, announced that we were 
"travelling a different path, one that is step-by-step and 
focused," in the exploration of space. 
  The Americans had achieved the political objective of 
recovering the country's prestige, and with the end of the 
Apollo flights, they no longer thought about the Moon. But our 
fixation on orbital stations lasted decades. There was no 
particular mystery about it: here it turned out to be possible 
to have a propaganda gain, demonstrate the "power of socialism," 
strengthen "international friendship" in orbit, etc. Serving 
that aim were, primarily, the Salyuts, which followed one after 
the other, and, later, the Mir station. Of course, their 
numerous crews also performed scientific and technical research. 
The cosmonauts conducted observations of Earth and photographed 
it, they experimented with the production of new materials and 
biopreparations in microgravity, and space medicine garnered 
experience. In no way do I wish to cast aspersions on that 
research -- but it's important to note here that the results of 
that research turned out not to be commensurate with the immense 
amount of spending for the development and operation of the 
orbital stations. In addition, virtually nothing was later used 
by the national economy. 
  It was Yuriy Andropov, after he became general secretary, 
who 
raised the question, "Why are they up there circling around?" At 
his behest, the creation of a special commission got under way; 
but the general secretary died soon after, and with him the 
things he initiated. Then, during the years of perestroyka, 
Yegor Ligachev got interested in the same thing, but he was soon 
distracted by more important matters. 
  That's how orbital stations came to last to this day. The 
cosmonauts go aloft, stay in orbit, come down, and receive their 
stars in the established manner. And although the political gain 
today is -- let's put it this way -- minimal, the democratic 
authorities haven't set out to change anything here. Foreigners 
have worked successfully on the stations -- some for free, some 
for money that, for them, by and large, is insubstantial. 
  But the main thing is this: today, as it was two decades 
ago, 
everybody is busy. NPO Energiya, the Khrunichev Plant, the 
Progress Plant, the Center for Cosmonaut Training, the numerous 
medical professionals keeping track of the health of the 
celestial travellers, the space-forces officers, and -- as the 
last general secretary said -- so forth, and so forth. 
  That huge infrastructure operates at virtually the same tilt 
as in the days of the "great space victories," and it gets by on 
virtually just as much. And you won't find anybody who can 
explain clearly why this is being done. Oleg Baklanov, it's 
true, shared his uncommon thoughts on the pages of the newspaper 
DEN about the "karmic striving of Russia to the stars." 
  But in general, the golden days of the pioneers of space 
have 
already passed. And no matter how favorably inclined those in 
authority are toward it, they can no longer provide that endless 
flow of money. Buran, along with Energiya, had to be mothballed. 
They haven't managed to replace the ageing Mir with the Mir-2. 
And to tell the truth, the manned space flights were quietly 
winding down naturally. But something happened that broke the 
course of events. 
  The program for developing an orbital station in the United 
States has been in existence for 10 years, but its has never 
gotten off the drawing board. In a country with a flourishing 
economy, the state did not consider it possible to force 
expensive operations with fuzzy goals. Congress was stingy, and 
that's not surprising, in light of the strong criticism from the 
public. In fact, it's hard to consent to spending billions on 
something that is, as the NEW YORK TIMES put it, merely 
"adventures, and nothing more." 
  And here is where the Americans didn't so much luck out, as 
luck out incredibly. Russia showed up with its "karma." 
  An agreement was signed at the governmental level on the 
creation of the Alpha international orbital station with Russian 
participation. In fact, its proprietor will be the United 
States, which is giving Russia $400 million between 1994 and 
1997 for its contribution to the effort. 
  So what would seem to be so bad about that? International 
cooperation in the performance of such complex, expensive 
projects is a sacred matter. The question is, To what extent 
will we be participating, and how much will we be compensated 
for it? 
  The first stage of the creation of Alpha involves the 
development of the large fuel/energy unit and the living unit 
(base unit and service unit). And, of course, the transport 
systems. Russia is doing all that -- the Americans are limited 
to small units with science gear (and their expenses are cut by 
up to $2 billion a year). They are not rushing with their living 
module, leaving its development for after the year 2000. 
  And that's all for $400 million. By comparison, the 
Khrunichev Plant has concluded several contracts for launches of 
satellites atop the Proton rocket. The contracts are worth $600 
million. The annual cost of leasing Baykonur from Kazakhstan is 
about $150 million. "We're getting out of a tough spot today," 
Yuriy Koptev, director of the Russian Space Agency, blurted out, 
"and for three kopecks we're selling what it took decades to 
produce." 
  It's hard to blame the Americans -- why would they pass up 
an 
intellectual product that is incredibly inexpensive and swims 
right into their hands? But the question is, Why are we doing 
it? After all, the development, manufacture, launch, station 
flight control, and station supply -- all that goes far beyond 
the bounds of what is, in this case, the insignificant sum of 
$400 million. Everything can be explained simply: it's as hard 
to get extensions of that work in the context of a national 
program as it is easy to get money from the government for an 
international program. Just don't violate the agreements. It's 
strange that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin didn't see any of that 
when he was signing such an important document in the United 
States or when he was making substantial concessions to the 
Americans by restricting the transfer of cryogenic rocket-motor 
technologies to India. 
  The beginning of the operation of Alpha will be preceded by 
extensive operations by the Americans on the existing Russian 
orbital station Mir. American research equipment and gear is 
being installed on the Priroda and Spektr modules. Thus, the 
time will soon come when the station will be operated in the 
interests of the Americans. They will spend a total of nearly 
two years on Mir, and the cost of that will also come in at 
about $400 million; strictly speaking, that money will probably 
also go for support of those flights. 
  In general, the Mir station and all the designs adopted in 
the course of its development are of great interest to the 
Americans. In actuality, they are now completely revising it. 
The developers of the station's onboard systems were sent 
questionnaires containing 50-70 items. That unique transfer of 
know-how was indirectly stipulated in the contract, although in 
another place in the document, it said that the Mir station and 
the Space Shuttle (which nobody intends to acquaint us with) are 
national systems. 
  It's not hard to understand the interest displayed by the 
other side for our space technologies. In this country, there 
was a golden rain in that area; but in the United States, after 
the end of the Apollo program, there was never adequate 
government financing, private investment couldn't cover 
everything, and the best personnel, unlike with us, were 
certainly not concentrated in the space sector. 
  The interaction between the two sides is unique. All the 
joint documents, protocols, etc., are prepared by the Americans 
and signed in English only. At the same time, according to 
employees at the Russian Space Agency and NPO Energiya, the same 
small group of specialists went on the working visits to the 
United States, and they firmly attached themselves to those 
trips. Certainly not all of them speak or read English, and not 
all of the technical questions are within their competence. But 
they sign everything. 
  The scope of the work is large. The Alpha station in the 
final version is an entire space "settlement" with a set of 
national modules, although modestness here, as they say, would 
only be decorative. But the Americans are no longer arguing -- 
they have removed the main burden from themselves. 
  But we're still operating with the same spending mechanism. 
One wonders when reading the decree of the Council of Ministers 
of the Russian Federation titled "On State Support and Supply of 
Space Operations in the Russian Federation." It's as if written 
right from the decrees of the Central Committee and the Council 
of Ministers of the '70s, except that they were classified. 
Support, permit, allocate, disseminate... The last word pertains 
to all sorts of privileges -- the Russian Space Agency, of 
course, did not forget itself. There's even a markup for the tax 
"for classification" (it is still there, it seems). Not 15 
percent, as before, but 20. 
  It is felt that the impending, substantial budget spending 
does not scare our "marketeers," who, in concerns about space 
matters, have suddenly become (to the joy of the intellectual 
opposition) "state-men." But for which state?
