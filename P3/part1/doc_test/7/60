<F P=106> [Interview with cosmonaut Valeriy Baberdin by Sergey </F>
Turchenko; place and date not given: "Unemployment in the 
Skies"] 
  [Text] Our country has always been a great space power. 
No one can, or ever will, dispute its pioneering role in space. 
Admittedly, this applies to the "accursed communist past." The 
blessed "democratic" present has relegated the state to the 
backwaters of space research. The year now ending -- the year 
of the triumph of Yeltsinism -- has been particularly dreadful 
in this respect. State programs for the development of 
cosmonautics have totally withered away. The "Energiya" Science 
and Production Association, that major achievement of 
contemporary civilization, is on the verge of bankruptcy. There 
is unemployment among cosmonauts. The end of the year has 
brought a further extremely cruel blow directed against the 21st 
century: the signing by U.S. Vice President Gore and 
Chernomyrdin of what is for Russia a shackling agreement on 
creating a joint orbital station that will be the biggest ever. 
This was the subject with which we kicked off our conversation 
with cosmonaut and researcher Colonel Valeriy Vasilyevich 
Baberdin. 
  [Baberdin] If you look no further ahead than today, the 
agreement seems to be to Russia's advantage. The economy is in 
such a plight that the state is unable to properly subsidize the 
space industry. Our superhigh-technology production units are 
coming to a standstill or are on the verge of shutting down, and 
tens of thousands of highly professional specialists are 
threatened with unemployment. And now the Americans are 
offering $400 million to build the "Alpha" orbital station, as 
they call it. This may breathe life into our space complex for 
a while. But the question is the price we will pay for this 
temporary revival. Let us try to weigh up everything. 
  The development of cosmonautics in the USSR and the United 
States took different routes. The Americans got carried away 
with the shuttle and did not develop orbital stations. Now they 
have realized how necessary these are for research activity. 
They have calculated, pondered, and reflected: It is too 
expensive to start from scratch, it is considerably cheaper to 
utilize Soviet experience and potential, which are now available 
to them. 
  First, America does not have the technology for constructing 
stations in orbit. Only we have it. Second, the Americans have 
not developed sufficiently cheap and at the same time efficient 
carrier rockets to take the components and modules of a station 
into orbit. We still have the world's best fleet of such 
rockets. Third, they have no methods for training cosmonauts for 
long stints in an orbital station. Their missions last two 
weeks, ours last six months, a year, or even more. All these 
unique technologies and methods will go to them as a free gift 
together with the station we have contracted to build. 
  [Turchenko] But "Alpha" is intended as a joint venture, so 
we too will use the station.... 
  [Baberdin] I'm afraid there's a lot of eyewash here, just as 
there is with the numerous commercial joint ventures that have 
proliferated in Russia. It's not a matter of my own misgivings. 
Many specialists in Zvezdnyy [Gorodok] and the "Energiya" 
Science and Production Association are voicing serious fears in 
this regard. I received confirmation of them the other day from 
a conversation with a U.S. TV journalist specializing in space 
topics. He was frank. The United States is telling taxpayers: 
Look, Gore managed to reach agreement with Chernomyrdin and we 
have saved a lot of money. In the long term control of "Alpha" 
will be transferred to Houston, and missions to it will mostly 
be flown by shuttles on U.S. programs. 
  [Turchenko] So do we risk entering the 21st century with 
our main flight control center in Houston and an auxiliary one 
in Kaliningrad outside Moscow? 
  [Baberdin] It is even possible our center may become merely 
a museum, like the Cosmonaut Training Center. According to this 
project of the century, which will take practically all our 
space resources, Houston will also train our payload 
specialists, as the Americans call them. The point is that in 
the shuttle there is an upper deck housing the crew and a lower 
deck for the "passengers" -- the payload specialists who are 
being taken to work at the station. I am afraid we may all find 
ourselves on the lower deck of the U.S. craft in both the 
literal and metaphorical senses. 
  [Turchenko] Well, we are going to pay all too high a price 
for these $400 million. Incidentally, the figure is noteworthy. 
That is precisely the size of the contract that was being 
readied with India for the sale of carrier rocket technologies. 
But the Americans twisted our government's arm and forced it to 
abandon this contract. 
  [Baberdin] Correct. From that same conversation with an 
American TV journalist I learned that the United States is using 
"Alpha" to harness us to it mainly in order to prevent the 
spread of space technology. Obviously we lost nothing as a 
result of the Indian option, we merely gained, including that 
same sum of 400 million, whereas now.... There is also 
something else that is clear to me as a cosmonaut awaiting his 
turn for a mission: The "Alpha" project promises even more 
persistent unemployment among Russian cosmonauts. 
  [Turchenko] To what extent is that a factor at present? 
  [Baberdin] I cannot give precise figures, but I can offer a 
broad estimate. t present among cosmonauts alone there are 
around 15-16 people awaiting their turn for a mission. But 
there are also sizable reserve groups of specialists who have 
completed the training course. I will mention just a few. A 
detachment of women cosmonauts was once created on the basis of 
the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. The intention 
was to put an "all-female crew" into space. Economic problems 
made all this a remote prospect. A group of young scientists 
underwent training for research work in space. They too are no 
longer wanted. The military department designed its own "Almaz" 
orbital station. A subunit of military engineers was trained to 
work on it. Just a handful of them went into space; the rest 
had no luck. There are doctors in a similar position. The Test 
Flight Institute picked a subunit made up of the best test 
pilots and trained them for two years on "Buran" and...a halt 
has now been called. So just estimate how many space unemployed 
we have, so to speak. At the same time we have been forced to 
sell places in craft and the orbital station to foreign 
cosmonauts. 
  [Turchenko] But Russia at least has access to the results of 
their research? 
  [Baberdin] No. All materials are stored on diskette and our 
foreign colleagues take the experimental data with them. The 
only plus is that they usually leave us the research apparatus 
they have used in token of gratitude. Moreover, in preparing 
this apparatus for missions, our specialists acquire skills in 
using it. 
  [Turchenko] The year 1993 is drawing to its end.... Our 
country always used to proudly sum up the results of the space 
year, which were usually truly impressive. What about nowadays? 
  [Baberdin] There is a certain amount of momentum from past 
achievements and successes. As is well known, for several 
months know Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov have been 
working selflessly in orbit. But this year there was an 
incident that could not have happened before. Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov were supposed to go up to 
the "Mir" station back in the fall. But the carrier rocket was 
not ready. The "Progress" plant had made the casing, but the 
engines.... The Samara Engine Plant had ceased producing them 
because it was on the verge of bankruptcy, like "Progress," 
incidentally. Now they have found in store Russian State 
Committee for Hydrometeorology carrier rockets designed to 
launch "Meteor" satellites. Attempts are being made to adapt 
one of them for a manned craft. But it is capable of placing 
only a two-man crew in orbit. We have been forced to postpone 
the mission until 1994. A search for a solution to the problem 
is now under way. 
  [Turchenko] Yes, this is indeed a new chapter in our 
cosmonautics. What are your forecasts for the future? 
  [Baberdin] Until we grow a little wiser, we will build a 
station in order to develop American space travel. Such is the 
lot of a state that has suddenly decided to kiss goodbye to its 
own great history and to the status of a world space power and 
is voluntarily following in the wake of foreign interests.
