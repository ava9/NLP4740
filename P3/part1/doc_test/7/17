AIR/SPACE AMERICA DEMOTES ADMIRAL IN BID TO KEEP TROUBLED AIR SHOW FLYING

In a move apparently intended to bolster its chances of recapturing city 
permission to hold a 1990 air show, Air/Space America has relieved retired Rear 
Adm. Bill Walsh of financial responsibilities and demoted him from president to 
vice president for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wilson, former San Diego congressman, chief executive officer and one of 
the founders of the organization, said Thursday that Walsh requested the change 
of duty to reduce his working hours. Wilson insisted that the change in title 
is not a demotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a forward step we've been planning for some time, and we're taking it, 
and it's going to work to our advantage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Diego City Council members have pointed to a $4.2-million debt from 
the 1988 aerial extravaganza at Brown Field as one of the reasons for their 
Feb. 7 decision to revoke the organization's permit to stage a similar show 
next year and withdraw $300,000 in city support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reconsideration Due 
</P>
<P>
At least one councilman, Ed Struiksma, has said he is doubtful about supporting 
the organization's bid for another show with Walsh in charge. Councilman Bob 
Filner has also said that he sees no reason to reconsider Air/Space America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that some of the council members have indicated . . . that he's the 
problem," Wilson said. "But it's very easy to say that without knowing the 
man." 
</P>
<P>
The decision comes just weeks before Air/Space America is scheduled to request 
that the council reconsider its closed-door vote to cancel the air show. The 
hearing will be conducted in open session April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America is competing with an unnamed, rival group of aerial showmen 
that has proposed taking over the show. The group is led by four men who 
organized components of the show for Air/Space America last year, but have 
since broken away from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America has hired two men to handle finances along with Wilson, who 
also will take a more active role in organizing and promoting the show. Walsh's 
position is a new one that puts him in charge of arranging the show's events, 
Wilson said.
