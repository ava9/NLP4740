<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yaropolov, doctor of technical </F>
sciences, under main headline of "Space Ark. Who's At the 
Helm?": "Of the Competitors, We're the Assistants..."; first 
paragraph is source introduction before Yaropolov's piece] 
  [Text] The negotiations between Russia and the United 
States on cooperation in space may wind up with a decision to 
create a joint orbital space station. That aim evokes differing 
assessments from specialists. 
  The capabilities and infrastructure of the domestic space 
sector could be destroyed if Russia accepts NASA's proposal with 
regard to an international space station project. The 
development of the Alpha station, mainly with U.S. equipment and 
in cooperation with Europe, Japan, and Canada, could reduce us 
-- with two modules and a transport craft -- to a "second-string 
player." But it is Russia who is creating a space infrastructure 
for the United States, and that 3-3.5 years earlier than they 
had planned to do it on their own. But their attempts, which 
have cost them almost $10 billion, have not been successful. 
  The future station, built and serviced with the American 
space shuttles, can fly with an orbital inclination of 57ë, 
and maybe even 51ë. Consequently, it will not fly over all 
of Russia, as had been planned for our Mir-2 station. Recall 
that Mir-2 was supposed to lift off in 1997, to an orbit of 
65ë, which would make it possible to continue remote sensing 
of the ground. The Alpha enables survey of no more than 5 
percent of our country. 
  The United States will have the opportunity to use the 
orbital complex in its entirety. But no one knows yet whether 
Russian cosmonauts will get to operate the Alpha at all. The 
fact is that all the know-how with regard to the development of 
the orbital station has been valued at $800 million. Even though 
Russia herself invested tens of billions of rubles in that 
technology at a time when the ruble and the dollar were almost 
equivalent. 
  But since the whole station will go for roughly $40 billion 
and will be operated by the project participants on a percentage 
basis, according to how much was contributed, Russia's operating 
time will be no more than 10 days a year. When you recall that 
we have obligations to France in the manned program, then it's 
not clear at all for whom or for what purpose we will be 
creating Alpha. 
  Besides, Russian industry will lose vitally important 
orders. 
And the unique Cosmonaut Training Center in Zvezdnyy Gorodok 
will become virtually unnecessary -- the crews will start 
training in the States. And the Flight Control Center, with all 
its expensive equipment and highly skilled specialists, will 
lose its significance.
