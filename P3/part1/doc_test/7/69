SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: FLY ME TO THE MOON -- FOR A NOSTALGIC LOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
Elections come and go, but junkets are forever. 
</P>
<P>
Image-wise, these have not been good times for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his 
Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Those pictures of mass weddings of Moonies in South Korea are a trifle spooky. 
That 13-month federal prison sentence Moon served for tax evasion was a nasty 
bit of business. And, late last year, bishops of the United Methodist Church in 
South Korea complained that Moon's international conferences are nothing but 
Christian-bashing sessions. 
</P>
<P>
One group, however, is dedicated to repairing Moon's tattered persona in the 
United States: the Washington-based American Freedom Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's president is the Rev. Robert Grant, founder of the Christian 
Voice political action committee. Its director is Richard Ichord, former 
Republican congressman (1960-81) from Missouri and the last chairman of the 
now-defunct House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Grant wrote in the Washington Post that the coalition has received $5.2 million 
from "business interests of the Unification Church" since it was founded in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Grant took to the op-ed page to answer allegations by a former employee that 
the coalition is nothing but a front group to help Moon spread his cultish 
ministry. Nonsense, Grant said. The coalition is interested solely in 
"promoting traditional American values." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the coalition is organizing a junket to South Korea for a dozen 
or more former members of Congress and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the weeklong trip is to attend one of Moon's international 
conferences. Departure is Jan. 30; expenses are being paid by the AFC and the 
Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in the traveling party: former San Diego County Congressmen Lionel 
Van Deerlin and Bob Wilson and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a fellow Republican who served with Ichord on the Armed Services 
Committee, is also a board member of American Freedom Coalition, a paid 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson represented San Diego from 1952 to 1980 and is now a Washington lobbyist 
and director of Air/Space America in San Diego. He did not respond to repeated 
phone calls over three days. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deerlin, a Democrat who represented the South Bay from 1962 to 1980, said 
he views the trip merely as a free way to visit places he hasn't seen in 
decades, including Panmunjon, where American troops are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, if Ichord and the coalition are looking for someone to influence 
public opinion in favor of Moon, "I'm not much of a catch." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around the block a few times, you know," Van Deerlin said. "You 
don't grow up in politics in San Diego County without being able to defend 
yourself in all company. I don't think I'm going to be wooed and won over by 
anything I see or hear." 
</P>

<P>
They're Playing His Song 
</P>
<P>
Something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
* The space shuttle Columbia retrieved 12.5 million tomato seeds that had been 
in an orbiting satellite for six years, to test the effects of weightlessness 
and cosmic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds will be distributed to students around the country, who will report 
back to NASA on how the plants fare, as part of SEEDS (Space-Exposed Experiment 
Developed for Students). 
</P>
<P>
While hauling in the satellite, the astronauts played the theme song from 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," the cult classic by Steve Peace, movie maker 
and assemblyman from Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
* It could be hot today when a San Diego City Council committee considers the 
proposed Human Dignity Ordinance to ban discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Expect strong support from gay leaders and equally strong opposition from the 
religious right and Young Americans for Freedom. Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. 
Maher also opposes the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of council members like the proposal: Bernhardt, Filner, Hartley, 
Pratt and Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and O'Connor oppose it as an unneeded duplication of existing civil 
rights laws; McCarty and Roberts are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
If it passes, Christian groups are vowing a referendum to repeal it.
