  [Text] Public opinion believes that to rocket and space 
technology have almost incredible power to do harm, though its 
harmful effect on the environment is far smaller than that of 
some chemical recovery carbonization combines or integrated pulp 
and paper mills. Besides, Russian rockets do not destroy the 
ozone layer, unlike U.S. and French ones, which use 
powder-fuelled booster rockets. But the military-space forces 
are trying to minimize even this small risk. 
  [Begin A. Kuzin, doctor of technological sciences, 
recording] 
We have raised the question of incorporating an ecological 
element in every launch of booster rockets. This element will 
include searching for and collecting metallic fragments and 
utilizing them, as well as carrying out restorative work in 
restricted areas. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Galkin] There will soon be nowhere in our 
country where someone wishing to sow or let cattle graze need 
fear a piece of rocket falling on his head or poisonous fuel 
pouring down on him. One can say that these problems have 
already been solved. The military ecologists are turning their 
gaze toward the next millennium, when space around the Earth 
will have to be cleared of space flight debris. 
  [Begin Kuzin recording] These might be exotic methods using 
high-energy lasers to disperse relatively small pieces of space 
flight debris. These might also be minesweeper type facilities 
in space to gather large fragments and bring them back to land. 
[end recording] 
  [Galkin] So there is every reason to believe that earth- 
dwellers can avoid a global ecological disaster, at least 
according to these sources. [video shows rockets being launched,
