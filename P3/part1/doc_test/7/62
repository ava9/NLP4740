FT  14 MAR 92 / Touchdown to a troubled inheritance: George Graham examines
the challenges facing the new head of America's space agency

Mr Daniel Goldin, named this week by President George Bush to be the new
head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), is being
launched into one of the least envied tasks in Washington.
He takes the helm of the space agency as disputes over the level of funding
from the federal government and arguments about the viability of its most
important programmes have surrounded it with controversy.
His predecessor, Admiral Richard Truly, was sacked last month after a series
of policy disagreements with the White House's National Space Council, a
supervisory board for US space interests headed by Vice-President Dan
Quayle.
Mr Goldin's task is to change the very character of Nasa, whose critics
charge that it has become so deeply imbued with its own technology-driven
culture that it is incapable of carrying out its missions.
In Nasa's own strategic plan - a slim document entitled Vision 21, liberally
sprinkled with aphorisms from Goethe, Einstein and James Michener - these
missions are spelled out in ringing terms by Admiral Truly.
'Nasa exists to make the US the world leader in space exploration and
aeronautics research and, through our achievements, to inspire and better
the lives of all Americans,' he writes.
But despite its grand goals the agency must also conform to the political
imperatives of its masters: not only the Bush administration, but also
Congress, which holds its purse strings.
At a time of tight budgets, Nasa has found it impossible to make the hard
choices necessary to please both masters. Instead, it has clung to an array
of ambitious programmes that blithely assume that its funding will, somehow,
be increased in the future.
'Nasa is overcommitted relative to likely resources - in short, it is
chasing too much programme with too few dollars,' says Mr Mark Gebicke,
director of Nasa issues at the General Accounting Office.
Mr Gebicke estimates that Nasa's current programmes will cost Dollars 92.4bn
over the next five years, between Dollars 13bn and Dollars 21bn more than
its likely budget.
Congressman Dick Zimmer of New Jersey more bluntly describes Nasa's plans as
'a Buck Rogers budget. 'It's long on fantasy and it's short on reality.
There simply won't be enough money available in the future to complete all
the programmes that are described,' he complains.
Nasa's budgets rose steadily in the late 1980s, as it began to reap an early
peace dividend from reductions in military spending. But the budget now
faces a freeze in the face of the growing US federal deficit.
In particular, the 1990 budget compromise between Mr Bush and Congress, has
prevented the transfer of money from defence to civil expenditure.
In its bid to win a greater share of the dwindling federal funds pie, Nasa
has been handicapped by its own failures: not just calamities such as the
traumatic explosion of the Challenger Shuttle in 1986, or the fatal flaw in
the mirrors of the Hubble space telescope - although these have sapped
public confidence in the agency - but a more general failure to adapt its
own structures and culture to the realities of the 1990s.
Dominated by its highly skilled engineers, Nasa developed an arrogant belief
in its own superior technological prowess and an insistence on defining its
own projects.
Admiral Truly had made more progress than had been generally recognised in
modernising Nasa's structures and management, in line with the
recommendations of a 1990 report by a commission headed by Mr Norman
Augustine, head of Martin Marietta, a defence and space contractor.
But as a former astronaut, Mr Truly was protective of the Nasa culture, and
staunchly defended his organisation's choices. 'Truly was doing a much
better job of telling the president what Nasa wanted than telling Nasa what
the president wanted. You basically get the space programme the engineers
want to build, rather than the space programme the taxpayers want to pay
for,' says Mr Pike.
Mr Goldin's credentials suggest he will challenge this Nasa arrogance. He
has long experience in military and commercial space engineering, having
spent 25 years at TRW Inc, a Cleveland-based engineering group where he
headed the space and technology division. '
'He is not dedicated to the principle that if it was not developed in a Nasa
centre it's not worth looking at; and that was one of the White House's
goals,' says Mr John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute, a
Washington-based research organisation.
One of the results of Nasa's engineer-dominated culture is the emphasis on
the space Shuttle, which because of its live crew requires a degree of
reliability that cheaper, expendable rockets do not aim for.
The result is a system with undoubted merits for launching projects such as
the Hubble telescope, but at approximately Dollars 500m a launch an
extraordinarily costly method of propelling ordinary satellites into orbit.
The same culture lies behind the Space Station project. The Space Station
has been justified by its supporters mostly on the grounds of the important
scientific research it will enable, yet virtually every scientist in the US
sharply criticises the project, dubbed Freedom, for its negligible
contribution to science, and for sucking such a huge portion of available
money away from other research projects.
Putting a manned station into orbit will cost an estimated Dollars 40bn, and
operating costs thereafter would, according to the GAO, lift the overall
bill to Dollars 118bn.
But will the Space Station find a cure for everything from Aids to cancer,
as some of its backers in Nasa and Congress claim? Or, as their opponents
jibe, will it simply find out why astronauts vomit in space?
The Space Station is one of the principal issues in the increasingly heated
political debate over funding for Nasa. Many politicians no longer believe
the extravagant promises Nasa often makes for its projects. They see,
instead, an organisation that over the past 30 years has completed its
projects an average of 58 per cent behind schedule and 150 per cent over
budget.
The administration contains its fair share of space junkies - notably Mr
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget - who
believe in the dream of pushing back the frontiers of space.
But even staunch supporters of the Space Station such as Mr Quayle have
their own priorities which do not always coincide with those of Nasa. He has
forced Nasa to scale back its reliance on the Shuttle, refusing to order
another vehicle after the delivery of the Shuttle Endeavour this month and
compelling the agency to work with the Air Force on a new expendable launch
system.
Congress, too, has its Nasa supporters, but - with the possible exception of
former astronauts such as Senator John Glenn - they are motivated more by
the presence of space-related jobs in their districts.
'The people behind the space station have managed to put a piece of the
action in many congressional districts and have won over supporters with
that approach,' says Congressman Richard Durbin of Illinois, one of the
Space Station's fiercest opponents.
One striking example of this is the likely decision by Congress to write
back into the budget the one programme that Nasa did offer to axe this year:
the advanced solid rocket motor which was designed to boost the shuttle's
payload to allow it to lift bigger sections of the Space Station. The
controversial motor happens to be built in Yellow Creek, Mississippi, in the
district of Mr Jamie Whitten, the powerful chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee.
But many voters across the US are now showing less enthusiasm for the
challenge of space - particularly in an era when competition with the Soviet
Union has lost its meaning.
'I guess we just simply have to recognise that people today are less
interested in going to Mars and more concerned about the trip to the grocery
store,' concludes Congressman Ralph Hall, chairman of the House Space
Committee.
