Dan Quayle, noting he is the first American vice president born after World War 
II, celebrated with Australians today the Allied operation 47 years ago that 
beat back Japanese forces advancing toward this nation. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, on a five-day visit to commemorate Australian-American Friendship Week, 
said the two countries must dedicate their relationship "to keeping peace in 
this region." 
</P>
<P>
At a black-tie dinner, Quayle, 42, discussed the spirit of cooperation that 
took place in May, 1942, when American and Australian naval forces turned back 
the Japanese at the Battle of the Coral Sea off the northeast coast of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who arrived here from Canberra, read a proclamation from 
President Bush that said the relationship between the United States and 
Australia "has thrived in peace because of our mutual respect, shared ideals 
and coordinated strides toward a more secure and prosperous world." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Quayle, who has recently taken a keen interest in space policy as the 
head of the National Space Council, toured a National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration facility deep in the Australian bush. Asked about the recent 
resignations of six top NASA officials, Quayle said it is an "interesting 
problem" that the Administration must confront.
