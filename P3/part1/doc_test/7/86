<F P=106> [`Ke'-signed report: "Support for the Development of Air </F>
and Space Travel Is Essential"] 
  [Text] "State scientific support for the air and space 
industry is essential," said Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
opening the International Air and Space Show at Berlin's 
Schoenefeld Airport on Saturday [28 May]. "Although this 
industry is relatively small in terms of the number of employees 
and turnover, it is nevertheless of great strategic importance. 
The existence of an efficient air and space industry is of 
vital importance for Germany, if only because of its enormous 
technological development possibilities," said the minister. 
  "Although on the one hand the aviation and space market 
offers enormous growth opportunities over the next decade, and 
on the other hand the state's financial capabilities are 
becoming increasingly constrained, the state must nevertheless 
offer help because the German aviation and space enterprises 
will probably be unable to face competition from stronger 
enterprises on their own," Rexrodt continued. In this 
connection the minister spoke out in favor of the government 
concentrating on key technologies in Germany and gradually 
abolishing subsidies for those industrial branches that are of 
diminishing importance. 
  He recalled that the most successful joint European 
industrial program, the Airbus project, initiated by means of a 
German-French agreement exactly 25 years ago on 29 May 1969, or 
the development of the Ariana carrier rocket, which is used on 
60 percent of commercial satellite launches these days, would 
not have been possible without state assistance. "In this way, 
we also succeeded in constructing a competitive European 
counterweight to the market- dominant American space industry," 
said Rexrodt. 
  Against this background, Rexrodt sharply criticized German 
Aerospace's [Dasa] decision not to take part in this year's 
show. He said he was sorry that this enterprise did not 
consider it necessary to support the Berlin Air Show's efforts 
to regain its international importance. Earlier on, Wolfgang 
Piller, president of the Association of German Air and Space 
Industry, had said that the German aviation industry requires 
greater security, and warned that with the coming into effect of 
the GATT Treaty, the industry still lacks the opportunities that 
the U.S. aviation industry has. 
  The Berlin show, which was visited by over 40,000 people on 
its first day, was first of all overshadowed by a disaster. On 
the morning of opening day, a small Russian Yak-58 aircraft 
crashed on approach. The show lasts until 5 June. Some 134,000 
people visited it two years ago. 
  There is no doubt that a subject of great interest this year 
will be the new Airbus A-321, as a result of which the show is 
developing into an important trade and information forum between 
East and West. Thus, the countries of Central and East Europe 
are particularly well represented at this year's International 
Air and Space Show, which is organized by the Berlin Fair 
Committee and the Association of German Air and Space Industry, 
with the support of the Brandenburg and Berlin Laender and the 
German Federation.
