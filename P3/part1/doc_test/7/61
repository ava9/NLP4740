In a deal that could ultimately be worth up to $550 million, General Dynamics 
has been selected to provide rocket launch services for up to 10 Navy 
communications satellites, the biggest boost yet to its bid to become a force 
in the growing commercial space launch business. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the sale, General Dynamics will provide at least one Atlas 
rocket costing about $55 million to launch a Navy communications satellite into 
orbit in 1992 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. General Dynamics will be a 
subcontractor to Hughes Aircraft of El Segundo, which will build the 
$172-million satellite as well as manage the launch. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Navy has committed to buy just one Ultra High Frequency Follow-On 
satellite, the contract calls for up to nine additional satellite launches 
through 1995, bringing the contract's potential value to General Dynamics to 
$550 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the expectation is that expendable launch vehicles will be used, 
Hughes Aircraft spokesman Richard Dore cautioned that the Navy has the option 
of using future space shuttle missions to place some of the other UHF 
satellites, if ordered. 
</P>
<P>
To win the contract, General Dynamics beat out Martin Marietta Astronautics of 
Denver and industry leader Arianespace of France. With McDonnell Douglas Space 
Systems of Huntington Beach, the companies are the biggest players in the 
$1-billion-per-year commercial launch industry. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal will propel General Dynamics to a level equal to its 
competitors in the U.S. commercial rocket launch business, a market that 
developed in the aftermath of the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. 
The 10 Navy launches would bring the total Atlas launches in the works to 28, 
of which 17 are purely commercial contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, however, will result in minimal additional jobs at General 
Dynamics Space Systems' manufacturing facilities in San Diego, general manager 
Alan Lovelace said Tuesday. That's because the company has been steadily 
gearing up for the private launches over the past two years, investing $300 
million in expanded facilities and increasing payroll to more than 4,700 from 
3,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for (General Dynamics), in terms of the size of the 
contract plus that it was sought after by other contractors, including Martin 
Marietta," said George Podrasky, an aerospace analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in 
Chicago. "They had assumed a lot of risk in going ahead with the commercial 
Atlas, and the chance they took proved to be the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Challenger disaster, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration suspended all placement of commercial satellites by the manned 
space craft. Before the moratorium, NASA bought rockets from aerospace 
manufacturers and managed all launches. But with NASA out of the picture, a new 
market dominated by private manufacturers was created. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gaining Strength 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, which launches its spacecraft from French Guiana in South America, 
had a head start in commercial rocket business, getting started in 1980. 
Arianespace thus far has launched 41 payloads in 24 launches from French Guiana 
and has a backlog to launch 33 payloads. 
</P>
<P>
But McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta and now General Dynamics are gaining 
strength in the market. The first U.S. commercial launch is scheduled for Aug. 
25, when a Hughes telecommunications satellite built for British Space 
Broadcasting will be launched from Cape Canaveral atop a $50-million McDonnell 
Douglas Delta rocket. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems, which employs 8,000 at its Huntington Beach 
manufacturing facility, has eight additional commercial launches scheduled 
through 1991, spokesman Tom Williams said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Astronautics Group, which employs 10,000 at its Denver 
manufacturing base, has contracted to launch six payloads in five launches 
aboard its Titan rockets, the first of which, an Intelsat VI telecommunications 
satellite, is scheduled for lift off this fall, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
