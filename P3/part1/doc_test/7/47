THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has been left
leaderless after President George Bush fired the former astronaut who had
headed it for the last three years.
Admiral Richard Truly commanded two space shuttle missions and then took
over the reeling shuttle programme after the explosion of the Challenger
rocket in 1986. He stepped into Nasa's top job in 1989.
He was asked to resign because of a widening rift with the Bush
administration over the space agency's role and aims.
Adm Truly has clashed repeatedly with the National Space Council, an
advisory committee headed by vice-president Dan Quayle which has overruled
Nasa decisions.
The sacking of Adm Truly will leave Nasa doubly bereft, in that the post of
Nasa deputy administrator has been empty since Mr James Thompson resigned in
November.
As a former astronaut, Adm Truly has been viewed as a staunch defender of
manned space flight in general, and of the shuttle programme in particular,
against those who Nasa's money to scientific programmes launched by cheaper,
throwaway rockets.
Nasa's budget is under increasing pressure. After years of double digit
increases, Congress authorised only a 3.5 per cent increase last year to
Dollars 14.3bn. The administration has asked for a 4.7 per cent increase to
Dollars 14.99bn this year.
Outside commissions have been critical of the agency's concentration on the
shuttle - which costs more per launch than a lower technology rocket and
cannot carry such large payloads.
Mr Quayle's council has now decreed that Nasa will order no more shuttles
after Endeavour, which is due to start flying this year as the fourth vessel
in Nasa's space fleet.
Instead, Nasa has been ordered to develop a new generation of unmanned space
launch vehicles.
However, Nasa and the Quayle council have teamed up to fight off outside
criticism, notably on the Dollars 40bn Freedom space station project.
Widely derided by the US scientific community for draining funds from other
more immediately useful scientific research, the space station has also been
attacked by a commission headed by Mr Thomas Stafford, a former Apollo
astronaut, which said it would be scarcely more advanced than Skylab,
launched in 1973 at a fraction of the cost.
Another commission headed by Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin
Marietta - one of the prime contractors for the shuttle and the space
station - also recommended downsizing the space station and shifting funds
to scientific projects.
Nasa claimed the Augustine report as an endorsement of the space station,
however, because it did not recommend its outright cancellation.
