S.D. CANCELS 1990 AIR SHOW AT BROWN FIELD AFTER AUDIT

The City Council has canceled the 1990 Air/Space America show at Brown Field, 
citing an auditor's prediction that its organizers would owe creditors nearly 
$5 million even if they staged a successful show next year, city officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson announced the unanimous decision, reached in closed 
session Tuesday, during a Wednesday meeting of the council's Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Besides revoking Air/Space America's permit to use any city-owned airstrip, the 
council voted to withdraw the $300,000 in hotel tax funds that it was prepared 
to spend on the show, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Cities Considered 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, president of Air/Space America, expressed disappointment at the 
decision but predicted he will reach agreement within 45 days to stage the show 
in Palmdale, Calif., or Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed and somewhat shocked by the manner and time in which it 
occurred," Walsh said. "We've been working with the city . . . trying to please 
them and make them happy, because it would obviously be easier to put that '90 
show on in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson made it clear that the council has lost confidence in Air/Space 
America's ability to operate a successful show in 1990. According to two 
separate audits, organizers of the aerial extravaganza and trade show now owe 
creditors more than $4 million. They have yet to pay for an estimated $100,000 
in damage to Brown Field from the May, 1988, show or hand over a $100,000 rent 
payment owed the city. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by former San Diego Congressman Bob Wilson and by Walsh, a retired 
rear admiral, Air/Space America was envisioned as a biennial event designed to 
be America's answer to the Paris air show. The idea attracted support from 
well-known figures such as Sen. Barry Goldwater and former astronaut Wally 
Schirra. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people attended the first Air/Space America show, in 1988, which 
included trade booths, paratroop jumps, aerial acrobatics, $985 rides on the 
supersonic jet Concorde and tours of the Soviet Union's AH-124 transport, the 
world's biggest aircraft. The attendance was about half what Walsh had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a situation where we didn't have confidence in their business 
management, that we would be throwing good money after bad," said Councilman 
Bob Filner, whose district includes Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Other Shows 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the council also became concerned that Air/Space America might 
stage subsequent shows in other cities, causing the council to wonder whether 
its investment would pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Panarisi, director of consulting services for the auditing firm Deloitte, 
Haskins &amp; Sells, which was hired by the city, projected that the 1990 air 
show would lose about $600,000, a figure that would be added to Air/Space 
America's current $4.2-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our projections show that they would not quite break even for the 1990 show, 
and they would not even be able to pay for the debt" from the 1988 show, 
Panarisi said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh disputed both the calculation of the current debt and the predictions for 
1990, saying his organization owes about $2.9 million to more than 2 dozen 
creditors but would pay that off and end the 1990 show about $400,000 in the 
black. 
</P>
<P>
A city audit of Air/Space America's finances as of Sept. 30 shows that the 
group is $4.45 million in debt, which includes more than $1 million owed to 
Evergreen Chemical Products for applying a polymer to Brown Field soil that was 
designed to take the place of more expensive asphalt. Walsh and city officials 
claim the polymer was a complete failure, and Walsh is refusing to pay the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight firms have sued Air/Space America in an attempt to recoup 
payments, and nine have asked the city to pay them a total of $1.4 million in 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of the financial snafu stems from a 1987 City Council decision to 
waive a requirement that Air/Space America obtain a construction bond that 
normally would be used to pay off creditors in the event of financial problems. 
According to Filner, who was not on the council at the time, city staff members 
warned the council about the possibility of financial problems in several 
reports before the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the contractors attended Wednesday's council committee meeting and 
huddled privately with city lawyers afterward in the hope of determining their 
chances of recouping some money. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Air/Space America, the city and the contractors are all partners 
in this thing, whether we want to be or not," said Bob Spellman, managing 
partner of Rock Paving and Grading, which claims it is owed more than $49,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gotten some debts. The only way those debts can be paid is if they 
have another show, so far as I know," Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine months after the May air show, Brown Field operators are still 
repairing damage caused by the event, which Mike Tussey, airport operation 
manager, estimated will total $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than $8,000 was spent to repair a hole in the main runway that was created 
when the giant Soviet transport made a quick turn and came to a halt, Tussey 
said. Replacing the main road to the control tower, necessitated by the failure 
of the polymer substance to harden into a usable surface, cost nearly $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing a similar problem involving 41,000 square feet of space leased by the 
Experimental Aircraft Assn. will cost $18,000. And repairs to 70 lights torn 
off one of the taxiways will cost $6,000, Tussey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walsh said that Air/Space America hoped to receive a rent credit for 
installing a $550,000 underground drainage system, Filner claimed that the 
system actually increases the chances of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything they did, in fact, screwed up things more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its financial and permit woes, Air/Space America now faces possible 
competition from a Canadian group that hopes to stage an international air show 
near Vancouver in May. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which has secured more than $3 million from the Canadian and British 
Columbian governments, is billed as "North America's Premier Aerospace Trade 
Show and Symposium." 
</P>
<P>
"Airshow Canada is funded by the government to pay for things like promotion 
and marketing," according to show spokesman Mark Pond. "That's the key 
difference between us and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Funds exist for this show, and there won't be checks bounced. I heard very 
uncomplimentary things about the San Diego Air Show."
