'necessary force' to quell violence

PRESIDENT George Bush last night ordered 4,500 soldiers and marines to use
'whatever force is necessary to restore order' to the riot-torn city of Los
Angeles.
In a television broadcast to the nation, Mr Bush condemned the two days of
violence that followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles policemen accused
of beating Mr Rodney King, a black motorist.
'There can be no excuse for the murder, arson, theft or vandalism that have
terrorised the people of Los Angeles. The wanton destruction of life and
property is not a legitimate protest'.
Mr Bush's remarks came as the toll of human life, property and business
continued to rise. As many as 38 people, almost all black, are reported dead
and more than 1,000 injured, making it the second worst race riot in the US
this century, after the 47 killed in Detroit in 1967.
Yesterday disturbances spread to several other US cities, including Las
Vegas, where the National Guard has been called out, San Francisco, New
York, Atlanta and Seattle. None assumed the proportions of what has happened
in Los Angeles, although the police in San Francisco made some 1,400
arrests.
In New York last night hundreds of black, white and Hispanic protesters
rampaged through the streets of Lower Manhattan. They broke windows and
smashed taxis as riot police attempted to stop them. Several people were
arrested.
President Bush said he had found the videotape of Mr King's beating
'revolting,' but urged Americans to respect the process of law, 'whether or
not we agree with the outcome.'
'The verdict on Wednesday was not the end of the process,' he said. 'Federal
action in this case will be expeditious and will be fair. It will not be
driven by mob violence.'
Mr Bush's order had the effect of activating 3,000 infantry and 1,500
marines that had been on standby since morning. They may now fan out into
the streets of Los Angeles.
He said he had committed the troops - from a staging area near the riot-torn
city - and 5,200 state National Guard forces already on under federal
control because 'incidents of random lawlessness and terror' were still
going on.
He said the troops and guards had been placed under a single, unified
command under the overall supervision of General Colin Powell, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Mr Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by police officers set off the
rioting, yesterday made an emotional appeal for a return to calm. 'I just
want to say: can we all get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the
older people and the kids? We'll get our justice. They've won the battle but
they haven't won the war,' he said.
Although the officers who beat Mr King were acquitted on criminal charges of
assault, Mr King still has a civil lawsuit pending against them. In
addition, Mr William Barr, the US attorney general, said a federal
investigation of the possible violation of Mr King's civil rights was being
'aggressively pursued'.
Estimates of damage in Los Angeles were reported by the Mayor's office to be
as high as Dollars 550m (Pounds 310m).
Yesterday sporadic rioting and looting spread to parts of Los Angeles
unaffected on the first night, including Hollywood and Beverly Hills, and a
thick pall of smoke from hundreds of fires still hung over the whole area.
Some of the sharpest confrontations centred on Koreatown, about two miles
west of the downtown area. Korean shopowners armed themselves with pistols
and rifles and shot at bands of looters marauding through the streets. In
Seoul, President Roh Tae-woo called for additional protection for Korean
natives in Los Angeles.
The focus of violence began to change early yesterday from looting to
attacks on the police. Three policemen were shot and a paint factory, daubed
with anti-police graffiti, was set on fire. All schools in Los Angeles were
ordered to close again in spite of concerns that young people, who might
otherwise be at school, were roving the streets and adding to the problems.
Mr Bush's decision to deploy extra resources was taken after two White House
meetings, the first of which involved his domestic advisers, including Gen
Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and the second with black
civil rights leaders.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, repeated the president's
call for 'understanding and reason' saying 'anarchy must not prevail'.
The president's approach to what has happened in Los Angeles is fraught with
political risk in this election year. On Thursday he had expressed a similar
'understanding' for those frustrated by the verdict in the King case and
promised an investigation that could lead to a federal prosecution of the
acquitted policemen. But he later spoke only of the threat to law and order
posed by violence and it is now far from clear that a federal prosecution
will materialise.
Mr Bill Clinton, his likely Democrat opponent in the presidential election,
has also had to fine-tune some of his comments.
