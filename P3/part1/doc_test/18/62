WITH his economic 'summit' out of the way, President-elect Bill Clinton is
expected to announce further cabinet appointments as early as today.
Mr Warren Christopher is considered the most likely choice as secretary of
state, while Mr Les Aspin, the Wisconsin congressman, is now rated the
front-runner for the defence post.
It is becoming increasingly obvious Mr Clinton himself is making the
selections, using his own network of contacts and relying on one-on-one
interviews, rather than following the recommendations of his transition
team.
The choice of Mr Christopher to run foreign policy would be no surprise,
given his closeness to the president-elect and his experience as deputy
secretary of state in the Carter administration. His expertise in the Middle
East, sharpened by his leading diplomatic role in trying to free the US
hostages from Iran, is of obvious value.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey had also appeared to be a viable
candidate for the position. General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, reportedly hit it off with Mr Clinton when they met last
month, but has said he is happy to stay in the military. His term in his
present position expires next September.
Inside the White House, Mr Anthony Lake, now a university professor but
another long-time Clinton adviser and State Department veteran under Mr
Carter, is said to have the inside track for national security adviser.
Mr Aspin is a reigning congressional defence expert. Like Mr Clinton, he
went to Oxford and opposed the Vietnam war but is more conservative than
many Democrats over cutting the defence budget.
Mr Mike Espy, the black congressman from Mississippi, now apparently leads
the field to become secretary of agriculture. Mr Henry Cisneros, former
mayor of San Antonio, has let it be known he will not compete for the Texas
Senate seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary-designate,
presumably on the grounds that he is assured of the housing portfolio.
Mr Tim Wirth, outgoing senator from Colorado, is still considered the
likeliest energy secretary, with former Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona
said to be in line for the interior job.
