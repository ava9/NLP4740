U.S. Marines will storm Saudi Arabian beaches less than 30 miles south of the 
Kuwaiti border in a mock amphibious landing scheduled for this weekend, 
Pentagon officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which will simulate a tactic likely to be used in any actual U.S. 
military offensive, will be the first conducted in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Pentagon officials said it is intended to intensify 
pressure on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the exercise represents one of the most provocative gestures 
that the U.S. military has taken toward Iraqi troops dug into largely defensive 
positions just inside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that the exercise is expected to involve as many as 30 
U.S. warplanes and 2,500 Marines who have been afloat on 13 amphibious ships in 
the Persian Gulf for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's acknowledgment of the pending military maneuver came as Bush 
Administration officials tried to quell growing concern on Capitol Hill that 
the United States is pressing to initiate hostilities soon against Iraq. The 
plan sparked significant controversy among lawmakers briefed Tuesday by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, in remarks that were seen as confirming the apparent rush 
toward war, has warned that Congress must give the President latitude to 
respond to sudden threats by Iraq. "There are always those unforeseen kinds of 
provocations that might result in having to move first," White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, in confirming reports of the planned 
amphibious landing exercise, denied that the Marine maneuvers are designed to 
provoke a reaction from Iraqi troops that could be used to justify a U.S. 
military response. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how in the world you could describe these as provocative," 
Williams said. Calling the situation in the Persian Gulf "very fluid," he 
added: "We have to be able to exercise our forces throughout the region. 
Exercising them in sovereign Saudi territory to make them familiar with the 
entire area in which they could potentially be involved is a sensible thing to 
do with the units." 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Pentagon, however, acknowledged that this weekend's activity, 
which follows two previous exercises staged on the beaches of Oman, is designed 
to underscore U.S. military readiness for operations against Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close enough to get their attention, that's for sure," said one military 
officer familiar with the plans. "What are they going to think as they watch 
this on their scopes? It is definitely meant as a show of resolve, but not to 
create a response." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French radio station, Powell said that he does not 
believe that war in the Persian Gulf is imminent, despite the recent 
announcement that another 200,000 American troops will be dispatched there. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this show of resolve will convince Mr. Saddam Hussein that he should 
withdraw his forces," Powell said. "But at the moment, I don't think anyone 
should see that as indicating that a conflict is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing a site about 30 miles south of Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, 
commanders in the region rejected proposals to conduct the exercise even closer 
to Iraqi troop encampments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to mount a demonstration of resolve," a senior Pentagon 
official said. "But it's another thing to expose yourself unnecessarily to 
someone with a hair trigger." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's mock landing will include aerial support from Marine transport 
helicopters, attack choppers and Harrier fighter-bombers. Williams said that 
such exercises are the only way to maintain and sharpen the skills of Marines 
deployed in ships awaiting further orders offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also announced Tuesday that it has authorized the call-up of 
additional Navy reservists and will take similar steps for other services in 
the wake of the President's decision to send more troops to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood acted last Friday 
to raise the ceiling on calling up Navy reservists from 6,300 to 10,000. The 
Navy, which has called 4,616 reservists to active duty, had requested the 
additional authority and said that some of those to be called up will be 
members of construction battalions, called Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that the total number of reserve and National Guard troops called 
up now stands at 36,073. But he added that the planned expansion of the U.S. 
force in the gulf will require the Pentagon's civilian leaders to extend the 
other military services' reserve call-up authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has called 24,524 out of a ceiling of 25,000. The Air Force has called 
5,278 with a ceiling of 14,500, although a large number of Air Force reservists 
have volunteered for active duty. The Marine Corps has called 1,144 of 3,000 
and the Coast Guard 511 out of 1,250.
