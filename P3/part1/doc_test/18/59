President Bush told members of Congress today that Saddam Hussein must be made 
to realize "he's going to get his ass kicked" if the United States goes to war 
against Iraq, a lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a White House meeting, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) quoted 
Bush as saying he is convinced the Iraqi leader does not understand what he is 
up against. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed confrontation is to 
make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really aware that, to quote him (Bush), 
that 'If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,' " 
Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's remark was confirmed by another person at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke, the Pentagon adopted an aggressive stance a day after a senior 
officer questioned American combat readiness in the Persian Gulf, warning 
Hussein that U.S. air power could punish Iraq even if ground forces are not 
ready for all-out war by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials visiting the gulf and senior officers already there said 
today that Hussein should not interpret the comments by the deputy commander of 
America's gulf forces as a sign the United States would not attack until well 
past the U.N. deadline for withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller began the controversy in comments Wednesday to 
reporters accompanying Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on their weeklong gulf trip. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said ground forces yet to arrive in the region might not be combat-ready 
until well into February and recommended that Bush delay any military action 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
The commander of Army forces in Saudi Arabia, Lt. Gen. John Yeosock, was far 
more optimistic in comments today. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we are ready to perform whatever mission we are called upon to carry 
out," Yeosock said. He promised "a violent, fast battle" if war begins.
