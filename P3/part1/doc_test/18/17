With the deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait now less than six weeks 
away, the American political and military Establishment, like the nation at 
large, appears divided over the central policy question facing President Bush: 
</P>
<P>
Can economic sanctions force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait if 
the United States has the patience to wait 12 to 18 months? Or should the 
nation give up on sanctions and prepare for war as soon as next month? 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides, in a series of bellicose statements over the last week, 
have made their position clear. 
</P>
<P>
"By waiting, we will be risking, in effect, a victory for Saddam Hussein," 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to go on forever," Bush said in a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But after a week of congressional hearings, waiting is precisely the policy 
advocated by many leading congressional Democrats and a sizable number of 
Middle East experts and retired military officials. 
</P>
<P>
That split accentuates the risk that Bush faces in deciding whether to launch a 
war against Iraq. For if a war goes poorly, critics already will have 
established a strong position to second-guess the President's judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a war, we're never going to know whether they (the sanctions) would 
have worked, are we?" said Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and Bush's most powerful critic. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bush is really as close to pulling the trigger as his rhetoric implies 
is unknown. The Administration's impatient statements may be, at least in part, 
an attempt to scare Hussein out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But it is clear that the Administration and its critics disagree sharply on 
fundamental questions -- most important, whether economic sanctions can force 
Hussein to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal view" is that "he can ride them out," Secretary of Defense Dick 
Cheney told the Armed Services panel Monday. "There's no guarantee," he added, 
that even in five years, "sanctions will force him out of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, flatly told the committee that "the issue is not whether an embargo will 
work but whether we have the patience to let it take effect." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for everyone from the President to citizens at home trying to 
decide whom to believe, the question of the embargo's effectiveness appears to 
have no scientific, verifiable answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all operating on the basis of assessments we cannot prove," former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said in his congressional testimony. ". . 
. we are talking here, for everybody, of 51-49 types of decisions." 
</P>
<P>
A second disagreement surrounds U.S. objectives. Crowe and his predecessor as 
head of the joint chiefs, retired Air Force Gen. David C. Jones, both suggested 
that Americans should settle for prodding Iraq out of Kuwait even if that means 
leaving the rest of Hussein's military apparatus in place. 
</P>
<P>
But a much broader set of goals is advocated by some Administration officials, 
many non-governmental members of the Washington political-military policy 
Establishment and leaders of several Middle Eastern countries. 
</P>
<P>
Those goals, they say, should include depriving Iraq of its chemical weapons 
stockpiles and its ability to obtain nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush embraces those objectives -- a question he has left vague -- war almost 
certainly cannot be avoided, Jones testified. "I foresee no circumstances in 
which Iraq's leader would accept such conditions, except at the point of a 
gun," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show the public is even more deeply split than specialists and 
policy-makers. Roughly one-quarter to one-third of those responding to polls -- 
particularly women, blacks and low-income Americans -- appear to oppose any 
U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf at any time. The experts and 
policy-makers, overwhelmingly male, white and upper-income, include few voices 
renouncing force altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Among Americans who agree that the United States must ensure an Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait, by force if necessary, polls show considerable 
disagreement about how quickly a U.S. move should come and its final 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the most controversial question involves time: Which side gains more 
by waiting? 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and many of his fellow Democrats and their supporters argue that having 
imposed a nearly leakproof economic quarantine on Iraq, the United States 
should now sit back and wait, perhaps until the winter of 1992. By that time, 
Bush will be facing reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies already have absorbed the major cost of the 
embargo on Iraq -- higher oil prices -- and now face little extra cost for 
waiting, James R. Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense and former CIA 
director, told the Armed Services Committee. "In effect, we can leave Iraq in 
isolation until it comes to its senses," Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions have had a severe impact on the Iraqi economy, reducing 
overall non-military production by 40%, he noted. And by cutting off nearly all 
Iraqi oil exports -- normally worth roughly $1.5 billion a month -- the embargo 
is draining that nation's reserves of foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The probability that the economic sanctions will result in a satisfactory 
outcome is very high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials accept the numbers but disagree with Schlesinger's 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many industries have largely shut down" in Iraq because of shortages of spare 
parts and crucial raw materials, William H. Webster, the current CIA director, 
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, however, "we see no indication that Saddam is concerned at this 
point that domestic discontent is growing to levels that may threaten his 
regime, or that problems resulting from the sanctions are causing him to 
rethink his policy on Kuwait," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although sanctions are hurting Iraq's civilian economy, they are affecting 
Iraq's military only at the margins," Webster added. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials argue that "waiting is not without cost as an option," 
as Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified. They 
have mounted a major effort to convince Americans that a long pause would be 
bad policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we really prepared to let our hostages in Iraq sit there for the next 18 
months?" Vice President Dan Quayle demanded in a weekend CBS-TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
". . . That is not going to be the policy of this Administration -- to say 
we're prepared to wait for another 18 months."
