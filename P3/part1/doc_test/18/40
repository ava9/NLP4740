MR CASPAR WEINBERGER, US secretary of defence during the Reagan
administration, was last night indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal
charges stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal.
He becomes the highest-level US official and the first former cabinet member
to be charged in relation to the scandal, which centred on the clandestine
sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of millions of dollars in profits
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The diversions, in 1985 and 1986, occurred
in spite of a congressional ban on US military aid to the Contras.
In a brief television appearance last night, Mr Weinberger declined to take
questions but described the indictment as 'a grotesque distortion of
prosecutorial powers and a moral and legal outrage'. He said it was a matter
of record that he fought the Iran-Contra policies 'at every turn' inside the
administration.
He implied the special prosecutor had offered him a plea bargain - a lesser
charge in return for assistance in naming other government officials - which
he had rejected. He insisted he had co-operated fully with the special
prosecutor's investigations, including handing over private papers.
The 31-page charge sheet identifies five alleged offences; two of perjury,
two of making false statements and one of obstruction. Among them, Mr
Weinberger is accused of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the arms
sales and of Saudi Arabian contributions to the Contras.
The indictment of Mr Weinberger - defence secretary between 1981 and 1987
and now the publisher of Forbes magazine in New York - follows an intensive
effort by prosecutors to investigate allegations that top aides to President
Ronald Reagan engaged in a cover-up and withheld information from Congress.
Yesterday Mr Craig Gillen, the deputy independent prosecutor, denied that Mr
Reagan himself was a target of the investigations. 'I don't want to leave
any inference about other people,' he said in a reference apparently
intended to include Mr Reagan and Mr George Shultz, the former secretary of
state who has also been questioned.
It remains uncertain whether the indictment could have an impact on
President George Bush or lead to attempts by Mr Bush's opponents in the
presidential election campaign to revive the scandal as an issue.
In recent months the Iran-Contra prosecutors have also questioned General
Colin Powell, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former aide to
Mr Weinberger. Mr Powell is believed to have defended his former boss and to
have described him as someone frustrated in his efforts to stop the sale of
arms to Iran.
The indictment focuses on Mr Weinberger's statements in June 1987 to the
House committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair and on his personal
diaries, recently obtained from the Library of Congress, which apparently
contain several references to arms shipments to Iran in 1985.
He told the committee he did not know about the shipment of US Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles from Israel to Iran in November 1985 - and only
learned about the shipment when the scandal became public a year later.
