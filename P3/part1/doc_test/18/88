President Bill Clinton yesterday sent a top-level mission headed by former
president Jimmy Carter to Haiti for one final attempt to talk the military
junta into leaving before the US launches an invasion.
Mr Carter, who recently served as an intermediary to persuade North Korea to
enter talks with the US on dismantling its nuclear programme, will be joined
by General Colin Powell, the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of
staff, and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services
committee.
The envoys are expected to meet General Raoul Cedras and other Haitian
military leaders, and try to persuade them to leave.
White House officials said the administration was 'making every conceivable
effort for them to leave peacefully', but insisted that only the manner of
their departure was negotiable.
Earlier Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said a US-led invasion of
Haiti was 'a matter of days away'.
Mr Clinton, who on Thursday night laid out his justifications for
intervention in a television address to the nation, yesterday cancelled a
political trip to California scheduled for tomorrow.
Mr Perry said US forces would be ready by the weekend and could maintain
that state of readiness for several days.
Washington was alive with rumours that one or more of the Haitian military
junta was pre paring to leave the island. But Gen Cedras, who was
interviewed live on US television after the president had finished speaking,
said he was prepared to die for his country.
Yesterday President Ernesto Perez Balladares of Panama said he would grant
asylum to Gen Cedras if that would avoid an invasion.
Mr Clinton held a White House meeting yesterday with Fr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the Haitian president ousted by Gen Cedras in the 1991 coup, and
representatives of more than 20 nations which are contributing to an
international peacekeeping force that will take over after the US invasion.
Fr Aristide, in a signif-icant concession to conservative critics of his
leftwing politics and character, promised to step down when his term of
office ends late next year.
Although the Haitian constitution prevents him from seeking re-election, Fr
Aristide had maintained that the clock should be stopped on his term at the
1991 coup. This would have given him more than four years after he is
restored to power.
