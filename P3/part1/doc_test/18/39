CHENEY SEEKING $10 BILLION IN PENTAGON CUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, heralding what he called "a fundamental shift in 
direction" for the American military, presented Congress Tuesday with a plan 
for cutting $10 billion from the Pentagon budget proposed by former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In only his 40th day in office, Cheney called for billion-dollar reductions for 
the high-technology B-2 stealth bomber and the "Star Wars" missile shield. He 
proposed canceling the $26-billion V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft program and killing 
or significantly delaying 17 other major weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney termed the proposed cuts "very, very painful" but said that there is no 
way to balance the budget "without offending somebody, without breaking some 
china, without stepping on some toes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fifth Straight Year 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's budget -- $305 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 
-- contains a 1% reduction after inflation from the current year's spending 
plan. It marks the fifth consecutive year of real declines in defense spending, 
which has fallen 12% short of keeping pace with inflation since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the $10 billion in reductions for 1990 represents only a down payment on a 
total of $64 billion that Cheney must pare from Reagan's military spending 
goals over the next five years to meet the Bush Administration's 
deficit-reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
The truly tough decisions lie ahead in a strategic review that the 
Administration plans to complete this year. Cheney and President Bush must 
confront what America expects from its military, how many men and women in 
uniform the country needs, what weapons they should be given -- and how the 
nation plans to pay for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not easy decisions," the former Wyoming congressman told the House 
Armed Services Committee. "If anyone thinks it's pleasant, with my record of 
unqualified support for the Defense Department and the (military) services and 
the various systems that we've voted for over the years, it's tough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But we do have to make some of these calls. I hope we'll do it in an 
intelligent fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the Cheney proposals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Place the existing 50 silo-based MX intercontinental ballistic missiles on 
rail cars and continue developing the truck-borne single-warhead Midgetman 
missile. Cheney, who had urged killing the Midgetman, followed President Bush's 
orders and recommended spending $100 million on the small missile in 1990, 
rising to $350 million in 1994. The mobile MX would be deployed in 1992; the 
first of 500 Midgetmen would hit the roads in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut Reagan's proposed spending level for "Star Wars," the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, by $991 million to $4.6 billion, with increased emphasis on the 
so-called "Brilliant Pebbles" concept of swarms of thousands of "smart" rocket 
interceptors roaming in space to spot and destroy incoming Soviet missiles. 
Cheney proposed reducing spending on SDI to $33 billion from Reagan's $40 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slash spending on the stealth bomber, being built by Northrop Corp. in 
Palmdale, by $855 million in 1990 and $3.2 billion in 1991, while delaying 
production of the super-secret high-tech plane by at least a year. Referring to 
unspecified technical problems with the flying-wing jet, Cheney said that he 
has ordered a full-scale review of the $69-billion program. (Related story in 
Business, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Continue development and early production of the Air Force's C-17 transport 
plane, to be built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. at Long Beach. The Air Force had 
proposed stretching out production of the plane, but Cheney rejected the 
recommendation. The Army's M1-A1 Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle 
were also saved from proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce active-duty military manpower by 16,800 men and women, to 2,121,000 
troops. An additional 14,000 troops would be cut in 1991. Of the 1990 cuts, 
8,000 would come from the Army, 5,600 from the Navy and 3,200 from the Air 
Force. Cheney left intact a proposed 3.6% pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancel further purchases of the Army's AH-64 Apache helicopter and the 
Advanced Helicopter Improvement Program or AHIP. That would save $3.2 billion 
and reduce planned helicopter inventories by 324 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kill the Army's M-88 recovery vehicle, a glorified tow truck for tanks, 
saving about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancel purchases of the Navy's new F-14D fighter jets. The Navy would 
continue to refurbish older models of the F-14. The Phoenix missile that would 
arm the new F-14s would also be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy only one more Los Angeles-class SSN-688 submarine, rather than two, for 
a savings of $714 million. Cheney also denied the Navy's request to go from 14 
to 15 aircraft carrier battle groups; the old carrier Coral Sea will be retired 
in 1991 and not replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kill the Air Force F-15E fighter program, eliminating 89 new jets and 
saving about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scale back development of the National Aerospace Plane, cutting its 1990 
budget to $100 million from $300 million. The hyperspeed plane, half aircraft 
and half spaceship, is designed to circle the globe in hours and land on 
conventional airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stretch out purchases of a variety of weapons including the Army's ADATS 
and ATACMS missiles and UH-60 helicopter, the Navy's SH-60F helicopter and 
F/A-18 fighter-bomber and the Air Force's Tacit Rainbow radar-seeking missile. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also proposed eliminating two mine-hunting ships and 48 T-45 trainer 
jets. The secretary's recommendations probably will be reworked radically by 
Congress in coming months. Supporters of terminated weapons will labor to save 
them -- and the jobs they provide. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to shuffle money around within the $305-billion spending 
limit decreed by the congressional budget committees. Lawmakers predicted that 
opponents of SDI, for example, will attempt to raid its fat budget to fund pet 
projects, such as the Midgetman missile. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), dismayed at the low 
initial funding levels for Midgetman, asked for Cheney's promise that the 
Administration would build the small missile after it completed work on the MX 
rail program. "As far as the President is concerned . . . this is a firm 
commitment," Cheney responded. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
issued the usual dire warnings about the continuing menance posed by the 
Soviets and other unfriendly nations. 
</P>
<P>
"For several years, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been testifying that the 
military risk is in their judgment too high," said Crowe, the nation's senior 
uniformed officer. "Yet for another year, defense spending will continue 
downward in real terms; force structure will decrease and military risks will 
rise by even another increment." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers attempted to elevate parochial concerns into issues of global 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the V-22 -- whether former members of the Marine Corps, the chief 
user of the plane, or representatives from Texas, where it is being built -- 
argued that the aircraft is essential to protecting American lives and 
interests in the remotest corners of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the panel, 
summarized lawmakers' reaction this way: 
</P>
<P>
"Some think you've cut too much. Some think you've cut too little. Everybody 
thinks you cut the wrong thing."
