<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush, accompanied by only a tiny handful of senior advisers, broke away 
from a small pre-Christmas brunch at the White House on Sunday to make the 
loneliest decision of his presidency: to order a massive military assault on 
the regime of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush and his aides huddled, U.S. intelligence showed that the likelihood of 
capturing Noriega himself was chancy at best and that the loss of American and 
Panamanian lives was almost certain. But senior aides said the President did 
not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which aides said was highly personal, reflected Bush's 
determination not to allow the Noriega regime -- tainted by charges of drug 
dealing and increasingly violent acts against Americans -- to remain in power, 
regardless of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset of the highly secret 30-minute meeting, Bush made it clear that 
what he wanted was not a "surgical strike" against Noriega personally but a 
full-scale attack on the entire Noriega regime and the Panama Defense Forces, 
which had kept him in power despite two years of U.S. pressure and plotting. 
</P>
<P>
"The President was saying, 'We don't want to do it piecemeal,' " one official 
said. "He didn't have thefull battle plan, but he knew its code name, and he 
was ready to go with it, accepting casualties" and nothing less than the full 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the small group attending Sunday's meeting were Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin L. Powell and Vice 
President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting came just at the end of a holiday brunch that Bush and his wife, 
Barbara, had hosted for a group of Administration officials and their wives, 
including Quayle and Baker. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department official said that Bush "had to make a fundamental 
decision: Did we want to have enough people needed for such an operation in 
place and risk Noriega finding out? Or did we want to risk an operation that 
failed because of insufficient troops and equipment? That, too, might have 
failed to get Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
There was never any question about which option the President wanted, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had made up our mind that if there was going to be a military solution, it 
had to be one that would succeed -- and we developed one that would," said a 
senior official. 
</P>
<P>
One factor in Bush's decision to opt for maximum force instead of a surgical 
strike, according to members of Congress who were briefed on the military 
operation by Administration officials, was intelligence reports that Noriega 
had a 250-member paramilitary unit poised to attack what Sen. John Warner 
(R-Va.) described as "a designated segment of Americans in their housing 
units." 
</P>
<P>
Such intelligence reports were unconfirmed but had to be taken seriously, Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, capturing Noriega would have been difficult under the best of 
circumstances, a U.S. intelligence official said, because "he has been jumping 
around like a Mexican jumping bean. We were aware of several places where he 
was yesterday (Tuesday) and made considerable effort to find him. But there 
never was any absolute certainty he would be in any particular place." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was described by one top official as "deeply disturbed" by recent events 
in Panama, including the killing of a U.S. Marine officer and the abuse of a 
U.S. naval officer and his wife last weekend and Noriega's increasingly 
bellicose statements, including his declaration of "a state of war" with the 
United States last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The scuttlebutt I hear is that the sexual abuse of the Navy officer's wife 
sent Bush up the wall," former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Panama Defense Forces soldiers had fired on a car carrying 
four U.S. military officers, killing one and wounding another. After the 
shooting, PDF soldiers also repeatedly beat and kicked a Navy officer and 
abused his wife. The Defense Department reported that she was sexually 
threatened, slammed against a wall with such force that her head was cut and 
was made to stand at the wall with her arms above her head until she collapsed 
onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Although concern was expressed within the Administration about the possible 
loss of life and the potential for Americans to be taken hostage, once Bush 
made his decision, officials moved quickly to execute a detailed contingency 
plan that had been developed weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The official code name for the operation still has not been disclosed, but 
Administration officials have informally dubbed it Operation Just Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Although the basic plan already existed when Cheney took over as defense 
secretary earlier this year, it was extensively refined after the failure of a 
coup attempt by some PDF rebels last October. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks ago, members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees were told 
that a new invasion plan had been adopted and that the Administration was 
simply waiting for an opportunity to put it into effect. In fact, some key 
members of Congress were surprised last Friday when the Administration failed 
to move after the Panamanian legislature declared the country to be in a state 
of war with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision, a tightly guarded secret in Washington, was kept from 
Republican congressional leaders until about 10 p.m. Tuesday -- about three 
hours before the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that he had surmised a military 
operation might be in the works two days ago, when Bush told him "things were 
getting pretty bad down there and that something might have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Even some senior officials involved in the operation did not learn of the 
decision until Monday morning, when they were told but instructed to keep the 
matter in utmost secrecy. John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff, learned 
of the decision at his regular meeting at 8:15 a.m. Monday with Bush, Quayle 
and Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
That meeting usually lasts only 30 minutes. On Monday, it lasted about 1 hour 
and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was Monday morning that Bush and his aides fleshed out decisions on the 
details of implementing the contingency plan -- when and where the invasion 
would take place. 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, Bush and other officials who knew of the plan took pains to go about 
most of their business as usual so that an atmosphere of crisis would not be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
The President called a meeting for 2 p.m. Tuesday, which he billed as a session 
to discuss "the use of the military in the war on drugs," said one source, and 
it was at that meeting that several senior officials learned for the first time 
that the military assault would be launched. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending Tuesday's meeting were Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, Deputy 
National Security Adviser Robert M. Gates and Richard Darman, director of the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody realized it was extremely important that the decision be closely 
held," said an official, who added that Quayle did not tell his own chief of 
staff, Bill Crystal, until 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife hosted a Christmas party at the White House for staff members 
Tuesday night, and the President stayed until 9 p.m., about four hours before 
the assault began. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Cheney attended a round of holiday parties and social events 
Tuesday night and did not return to the Pentagon until about 10 p.m. Just 
before midnight, Cheney joined Gen. Powell in the Pentagon's Current Situation 
Room, a windowless chamber filled with electronics communications and 
computer-generated maps that is used for monitoring military crises. 
</P>
<P>
There, the two remained in contact with the operation through the night, using 
an open line to Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the Southern Command's senior officer, 
and his operational planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
One senior officer said Powell helped shape some operational decisions by 
asking pointed questions of military commanders on the scene but that he left 
the Pentagon's original plan largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
"He let Gen. Thurman run the operation," said the officer. "It was a very 
controlled, deliberate, calm atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 p.m. Tuesday, Bush and Quayle began telephoning congressional leaders 
and informing them of the impending attack. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told the President he would support the 
operation, but he expressed some "concerns." Foley later emphasized that he was 
"informed" and not "consulted" on the invasion plan. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) assured the President that 
there would be no criticism from Congress. "There have been any number of your 
critics out there advocating just this step," Michel told Bush. "So I don't 
think you are going to have any criticism, at least not as far as Congress is 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
About 11 p.m., Bush and Quayle began telephoning leaders of other countries. 
The President reportedly called Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle telephoned Latin American leaders he has met on recent overseas trips, 
according to an official, who said that one Latin American head of state, whom 
he declined to identify, told the vice president that Noriega "was asking for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
A Quayle aide said that while the vice president found most of the leaders he 
telephoned "gratifyingly supportive," several Latin American leaders suggested 
that both sides were to blame for problems in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the Administration also had sent a detailed cable Monday to 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, Japan and other allied countries, 
outlining the "facts" of the U.S. case against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The cable cited Noriega's declaration of a state of war with the United States, 
the killing of the Marine and the abuse of the naval officer and his wife, 
Baker said, and characterized those actions as "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Although the cable did not suggest that there would be a U.S. invasion, it did 
outline the rationale that has been used by the Administration to justify the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings of Administration officials, including a special "deputies' committee" 
established to handle international crises, continued into Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
That committee, made up of officials directly below the principals, is headed 
by Gates, the deputy national security adviser, and includes Undersecretary of 
State Robert M. Kimmitt, Undersecretary of Defense Paul G. Wolfowitz and Asst. 
Atty. Gen. William P. Barr. 
</P>
<P>
After the 2 p.m. Tuesday meeting at the White House, where the rationale for 
the Panama action was spelled out in detail, lawyers reviewed the statements 
and prepared additional documents in support of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Because Noriega has used military force to remain in power and is not 
considered popular among Panamanians, some senior officials suggested that by 
neutralizing the Panama Defense Forces, the United States was putting pressure 
on Noriega to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether he's going to dig down in a hole or try to get out of 
there," one official involved in planning the operation said. "He's been 
through a couple of coup attempts, and the Panama Defense Forces consider him a 
liability. The danger to him can come from a number of places besides the 
United States, so he has a lot of incentives to get away and stay away."

PANAMA AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Area: 29,208 square miles with 2.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Government: The military, always a powerful force, has dominated political life 
since an October, 1968, coup. Gen. Omar Torrijos, a populist, ruled the country 
almost single-handedly until his death in 1981. His intelligence chief, Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega, won a power struggle and became commander in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Economy: With a foreign debt of about $4 billion, Panama is one of the most 
heavily indebted nations per capita in the world. The United States severed 
economic and military aid to Panama in July, 1987.
