President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the visiting chairman of the U.S. Joint 
Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday that his tour of the Soviet Union shows that the 
two superpowers are starting to see one another more as partners than 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. had sailed on a Soviet guided missile cruiser for a 
day, gone aboard a nuclear submarine in the Arctic port of Murmansk, visited a 
nuclear missile silo outside Moscow, sat in the cockpit of the newest 
long-range bomber, code-named Blackjack by NATO, and watched the Red Army try 
out new tactics in exercises in Byelorussia during a 10-day visit that he said 
had helped sweep aside misunderstandings between the two military 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
And when Crowe met Gorbachev in the Kremlin on Wednesday at the conclusion of 
the trip, the Soviet leader told him that his extensive tour of super-secret 
military and naval facilities was itself "the weightiest argument that our 
relations with the United States have risen to a new level of maturity." 
</P>
<P>
"The very fact that you have visited the Soviet Union and visited military 
facilities and units demonstrates that we are moving from the notion of enemies 
to the notion of partners," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the plans made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we are still 
considered to be adversaries. But the process is going along new lines, and 
that is extremely significant." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, warmed by his cordial reception and impressed by the openness of the 
people he had met, told Gorbachev, "I now see that Soviet people are very much 
like Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"They put great emphasis on their families and homes," Crowe continued. "They 
want a better future for their children and decent security. They are very 
dedicated to their country. 
</P>
<P>
"These are all traits that Americans respect. Perhaps I had to visit the Soviet 
Union to understand this." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, speaking later at a press conference, said that he agrees that 
Soviet-American relations are improving, but he added that there are "still 
differences in our points of view . . . namely on the arms control issue." 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere for discussing the differences has improved markedly," Crowe 
said. "I believe that we now have an environment in which we can talk candidly, 
that we can ask the kinds of questions that are important, that we can talk 
without rancor or emotion." 
</P>
<P>
His visit came as Soviet and American negotiators resumed talks in Geneva on 
reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals after a seven-month suspension to 
give the Bush Administration a chance to reassess the U.S. position. The two 
countries are also discussing reductions in conventional forces in Europe, the 
elimination of chemical weapons and restrictions on nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said that recent proposals by the United States and the Soviet Union for 
reducing nuclear and conventional arms made him optimistic about new 
agreements, but he cautioned that the pace should not be forced if flawed 
treaties would result. 
</P>
<P>
While he had discussed the negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, Gen. 
Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the chief of the Soviet general staff, and with Marshal 
Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's military adviser, Crowe emphasized that he 
had come to get a better understanding of the Soviet Union and its military, 
not to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"The most constructive thing that I did on this trip was to have personal 
conversations with the Soviet leadership," Crowe said, "and with those, we have 
been able to sweep aside some of the misunderstandings between us and clarify 
some of our differences." 
</P>
<P>
He had discussed at length what Gorbachev calls the Soviet Union's new defense 
strategy of "reasonable sufficiency," which would mean cutting the Soviet armed 
forces back to only what it needs to defend itself and releasing the other 
resources to develop the country and expand its economy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is change afoot in this country, politically and militarily," Crowe 
said, adding that he is willing to wait and watch for the implementation of the 
new policies. "As soon as a policy is announced, some people look out of their 
window and say, 'I don't see it.' These things take time, but I hope we will 
see the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe had signed an agreement aimed at preventing the accidental outbreak of 
hostilities between the two countries. Moiseyev described the pact as "a 
momentous occasion in the history of our relations." 
</P>
<P>
Its broad outlines had been discussed when Akhromeyev, then chief of the 
general staff, went to the United States last year as Crowe's guest and when 
Frank C. Carlucci, who was then secretary of defense, visited Moscow as the 
guest of Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
With Moiseyev sitting beside him, Crowe described the Soviet armed forces as 
"competent, skilled, well-trained, durable, determined, very patriotic, with a 
good sense of humor and personable, and I return home with great admiration for 
them." To his mind, he said, the Soviet servicemen he met were very much like 
their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said that he has also come to understand how the Soviet Union's 
experience in World War II, in which an estimated 20 million of its people were 
killed, has helped shape the modern Soviet psyche, particularly the 
leadership's determination that never again will the country be invaded and 
never again will a foreign adversary put socialism at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw what a searing experience the war was," Crowe said.
