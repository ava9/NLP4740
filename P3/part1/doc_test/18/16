Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the first black to serve as White House national 
security adviser, was promoted to full general Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who is scheduled to assume command of the Forces Command at Ft. 
McPherson, Ga., on Tuesday, was surrounded by family and friends as Gen. Carl 
E. Vuono Jr., the chief of staff, presided at the Pentagon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
In his new post, Powell will command all Army troops in the continental United 
States, including the reserves, and play a key role in determining the manner 
in which they are trained and equipped. His promotion makes him only the fourth 
black officer to attain four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces.
