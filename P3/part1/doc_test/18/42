COLLECTIVE security rather than the preservation of sole military superpower
status should be the principal goal of US defence policy for the remaining
years of this century, according to the Pentagon.
A revised draft of a controversial internal policy paper leaked in February
no longer states that the overriding US national security goal should be to
prevent the emergence of a rival to American military hegemony.
Instead, according to leaks to the New York Times and other publications of
the 1994-99 Defence Planning Guidance, a prime goal should be to 'strengthen
and extend the system of defence arrangements that binds democratic and like
minded nations together'.
While it does not preclude the formation of ad hoc coalitions, as in the
Gulf war last year, it places great emphasis on the value of United Nations
peacekeeping operations and regional security agreements such as Nato. The
first draft had warned against 'the emergence of European-only security
arrangements' among US allies.
The careful leaking of the revised document appears to mark the end of a
curious passage in the US defence policy debate this year and a victory of
sorts for the internationalist wing of the defence establishment over its
more unilateralist counterpart. It now awaits formal approval by President
Bush.
The original draft had drawn intense criticism at home and abroad. It had
been attacked domestically as an attempt by the Pentagon to justify
sustaining high levels of defence spending at a time when a a post-Cold War
diversion of resources to home use was widely considered politically and
socially necessary.
Overseas, the first draft was interpreted as a warning to allies such as
Japan and Germany not to challenge US military supremacy and to nations as
different as Russia and India to hold back on any plans to develop regional
military hegemony. Given the absence of any recent elaboration of Mr Bush's
concept of a 'new world order', its muscular tone appeared to imply little
fundamental change in US thinking in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
threat.
The changes in the document were freely ascribed to the recent inputs of
Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, and General Colin Powell, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff. Both drafts were written by Paul Wolfowitz, who
is close to both Mr Cheney and General Powell.
The shift in geopolitical emphasis and the adoption of more moderate
language in the second draft did not bring about any change in what the
Pentagon considers its minimum needs.
