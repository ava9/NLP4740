BRITAIN and the US voiced alarm yesterday that the Baghdad regime had moved
anti-aircraft missiles into a northern Iraqi exclusion zone, posing a threat
to western military aircraft patrolling the area.
The US said Iraqi ground forces had also moved closer to Kurdish settlements
in the area, raising fears of military action against the Kurds.
The rising tension in northern Iraq has revived the possibility of a strike
by the US and its allies against Iraqi forces. General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, refused to rule out this option in
London yesterday after talks with Mr John Major, UK prime minister.
Allied aircraft in the region are understood to be on a state of alert. The
Iraqi missiles' radars have been tracking US, British and French aircraft,
based in Turkey, and the US has informally warned Iraqi commanders that any
attempt to lock missiles on to allied flights would be viewed as a hostile
act. The US state department was last night preparing a formal warning.
Allied officials said the Soviet-made SAM-2 and SAM-3 missile batteries were
moved within the last 10 days to Mosul, 32km north of the 36th parallel.
After the Gulf war, Britain and the US ordered Iraq not to stage military
operations against the Kurds north of this parallel on pain of possible
allied counter-attack.
Admiral David Jeremiah, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
in Washington the allied powers were concerned about Iraq's motives in
deploying the anti-aircraft missiles in the protected area.
'We view the presence of these systems with considerable concern because
surface-to-air missiles have no purpose other than to be used against
aircraft, and the only aircraft flying in that area are allied,' he said.
The movement of missiles follows reports of renewed attacks by Iraqi forces
on the southern fringe of Kurdish held areas in the north and signs of a
build-up of Iraqi armour in the region.
Iraqi opposition groups in London also claim an Iraqi force last week
launched a three-day offensive against Shias in the country's southern
marshes.
These skirmishes and the missile deployment have intensified Anglo-US
consultations on a possible punitive raid to deter Iraq from threatening the
Kurds - or from testing too far the resolve of the Gulf war allies in their
undertaking to protect them.
