</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviets pull out of Afghanistan and allow all their "satellites" to freely 
choose their own form of government, be it communist or not. The United States 
stages a massive military invasion of Panama, a tiny sovereign country, and 
installs its chosen candidate as the new head of state. Now which is the "evil 
empire?" 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Panamanian Defense Forces resist the United States invasion of 
their country, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell calls them 
"thugs" and terrorists. United States armed forces invade Panama City at night, 
helicopter gun ships blazing, blow up the Panamanian army headquarters, in the 
process killing dozens of men, women and children living nearby, and untold 
others in streets. Now who are the terrorists?

<P>

Administration has done the same.
