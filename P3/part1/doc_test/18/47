Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Thursday that the Soviet Union will 
withdraw all of its troops from Europe by 1995, a forecast that prompted key 
Senate Democrats to question whether President Bush's new proposal for cutting 
U.S. forces should be faster and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate Armed Services Committee opened congressional debate on reshaping 
the nation's military structure, Cheney and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, were repeatedly challenged on the Administration's 
troop-reduction plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
195,000 Force Level 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, disclosing the Pentagon's rough timetable for cuts in Europe, testified 
that it may take a year or two to carry out any U.S.-Soviet agreement on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced Wednesday night that he was recommending that each side cut its 
combat forces in Central Europe to 195,000, with the United States allowed to 
have an additional 30,000 elsewhere in Europe. Currently, the United States has 
305,000 troops on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), sharply criticizing the pace of negotiations, 
declared that he would push the subcommittee he heads to legislate an immediate 
reduction of 50,000 American troops in Europe and 10,000 in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said events are overtaking negotiations, with NATO allies West Germany 
and Belgium already planning their own deep cuts and Soviet forces certain to 
be kicked out by new governments in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we should strip until we're naked," Dixon said. "There are 
reasonable, moderate, fair reductions we can make." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) applauded Bush for going beyond his 
proposal of last May and advocating the withdrawal of 80,000 U.S. troops, not 
just the 30,000 he called for then. He called it "much more relevant to the 
changes in Europe and to the budget realities here at home." 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn voiced strong concern when Cheney seemed to advocate keeping 225,000 
U.S. troops in Europe indefinitely, despite his prediction that the Soviets 
would pull all of its forces out of Eastern Europe and the two Germanys would 
be reunited. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn warned that unless the United States had plans to make substantial 
withdrawals in such a case, it could wind up supplying most of the ground 
forces for NATO as other allies disbanded their units. 
</P>
<P>
The influential senator got Cheney to concede that the Administration would 
"take another look" at U.S. troop levels in the event of a sweeping Soviet 
pullback and German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cheney's expression of flexibility, the defense secretary firmly 
defended Bush's new plan. He asserted that any effort by Congress to make 
unilateral troop cuts before the conclusion of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks 
would undermine the NATO alliance and encourage greater instability in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of winning one of the greatest victories in the history of 
the world without a shot being fired," Cheney said. "We should not unilaterally 
bring them (U.S. troops) home before we get an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Republicans Cautious 
</P>
<P>
Several Republicans on the committee strongly backed that position. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot let the euphoria sweeping this nation drive us to unilateral and 
hasty reductions in these forces," Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S. C.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Although members of both parties warmly pledged to work cooperatively with 
Cheney and Powell in the battles ahead, several Democrats served notice that 
they would press for deep cuts in the Administration's proposals for increased 
spending on strategic weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) proposed a "Democratic alternative" that he 
said would carve a $169-billion "peace dividend" out of the defense budget over 
the next five years, more than quadrupling the savings proposed by Bush for the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy singled out the B-2 Stealth bomber, the "Star Wars" anti-missile 
program and other major programs for deep slashes. He argued that Bush's budget 
fails to reflect a dramatically diminished Soviet military threat and a massive 
upgrading of U.S. strategic weapons in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a modernization program," he said, "but does it have to be at 
the madcap pace of the 1980s?" 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, while acknowledging major changes in the world, said that the Soviets 
continue to modernize their own strategic arsenal. "The Soviet Union remains 
the only nation on earth capable of destroying the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell likewise contended that this was no time for the nation to let down its 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to return to that leisurely, comfortable 'From Here to Eternity' 
attitude of the 1930s that helped invite global conflict to an unsuspecting 
world," he said.
