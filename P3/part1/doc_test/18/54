on what a 'stronger' Balkans policy should mean

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton can choose his words with great care. One adjective
he has used more than once when publicly discussing his options in Bosnia is
'humble', both in contemplating the enormity of any form of US intervention
and the intractability of the Balkan problem.
This sense of humility extends beyond the Oval Office to many of those
contributing to the public debate on Bosnia. For though there is a vocal US
lobby for a maximalist US role, there are also plenty of voices advising
caution. Both camps accept that there are no easy options.
Caught squarely in the confused middle is the American public,
intermittently bombarded with graphic media coverage but not consistently
so. Last week, for example, the bloody end of the siege in Waco pushed
Bosnia down the newslists.
The latest Newsweek poll split evenly - 47 per cent to 47 per cent - in
response to the question of whether Bosnia was America's problem. A
CNN/Gallup survey found a 62-30 per cent opposition to air strikes. It is
worth noting that Mr Clinton pays very careful attention to public opinion.
Divisions on the Bosnian options apply to Capitol Hill, where two Democrats
influential in foreign affairs take diametrically opposed views. Congressman
Lee Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee,
argues that Bosnia is not a vital US interest, believes in continuing with
sanctions and diplomatic pressure.
But Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the European sub-committee
of the foreign relations committee and just back from Bosnia, has put out an
eight-point plan including immediate western air strikes and the lifting of
the UN arms embargo against Bosnia itself.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, has also come out guardedly in
favour of air strikes.
Inside the administration, similar divisions apply. Mrs Madeleine Albright,
the UN ambassador, has advocated air strikes, allowable, she says, without
further UN approval. The 12 regional desk officers at the State Department
endorse this approach. Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, and Mr
Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, are thought to favour limited
offensive action. But Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is
thought to favour caution, as does General Colin Powell, chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff.
Mr Clinton, who has problems with his own military on several fronts,
acknowledged at his press conference last week the legitimacy of Gen
Powell's view that 'we must have a clearly defined objective that must be
met'.
In the media, the heavyweight pundits of the New York Times - Les Gelb,
Anthony Lewis and A M Rosenthal - have thundered behind the cause of US
action.
But the Boston Globe at the weekend advised against unilateral bombing.
Richard Cohen, the Washington Post columnist, wrote yesterday that the
public debate was still mostly among 'engaged Op Ed writers' and that no
popular mandate existed behind intervention.
Also weighing in behind intervention have been Mr Elie Wiesel, addressing Mr
Clinton directly at last week's opening in Washington of the Holocaust
museum, and, yesterday, Mr George Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan
administration, who called for 'very large, sustained air and sea based
attack' on positions inside Serbia itself.
Amid this confusing welter of external and internal advice, with western
Europe, after its latest foreign ministerial meeting, incapable of doing
other than wait on the US initiative, and with still some uncertainty about
the Russian reaction even after Sunday's referendum victory for President
Boris Yeltsin, Mr Clinton has promised 'a stronger policy' by the US and its
allies 'within a few days'.
The New York Times, quoting an unidentified senior official, reported
yesterday that the most likely US action would involve a programme of
limited bombing of Bosnian Serb installations, designed to produce a
ceasefire and a new round of negotiations. But it said that lifting the arms
embargo was still under active consideration as an alternative to air
strikes.
This would be preceded by further consultation with US allies and at the UN,
perhaps including a European trip by Mr Christopher or another senior
official, more White House meetings, and extensive consultation with
Congress. The task of preparing America for what comes next has barely
begun.
