  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- The government on 
Saturday carried out a regular reshuffle of senior Army and Air 
Force officers featuring the appointment of Lt. Gen. Chang Song, 
superintendent of the military academy, as commander of the 
Korea-U.S. Combined Forces [CFC]. 
  Chang, who will get his fourth star upon assuming his new 
post, succeeds Gen. Kim Chae-chang as CFC commander. 
  Kim and five lt. and maj. generals were relieved of their 
duties apparently for their past affiliation with Hana-hoe, a 
private Army organization whose members monopolized key military 
posts under the regimes of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. 
  The five sacked Hana-hoe generals included Pyo Sun-pae and 
Kim Kil-pu, both corps commanders. 
  The shake-up also resulted in Maj. Gen. Yu Chong-kap, head 
of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collection and security department, 
being named as director of the Defense Ministry Intelligence 
Agency and Lt. Gen. Choe Tong-hwan, vice Air Force chief of 
staff, as director of strategy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
  Those named to take over the duties of the dismissed corps 
commanders were Maj. Gen. Kwak Tong-to, Army deputy chief of 
staff for personnel, and Maj. Gen. Kim sok-won, Army deputy 
chief of staff for operations. 
  In another step, Maj. Gens. Kim Hyon-su and Kil Yong-chol, 
both division commanders who were former Hana-hoe members, were 
relieved of their duties while another Hana-hoe general, Brig. 
Gen. Min Pyong-kuk, a deputy corps commander, was somehow 
promoted to maj. general and named as a division commander. 
  It has been learned that Gen. Kim Chae-chang and seven 
Hana-hoe lieutenant generals relieved of their duties Saturday 
will be placed on reserve status soon.
