In a new move to expand the military's role in fighting drug traffic, the 
Marines on Friday agreed to join the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 
conducting training and surveillance operations along the southwest border of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the agreement, which would put Marines on the front lines 
of the drug war for the first time, comes as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
ponders a U.S. Army proposal to establish a special military task force at Ft. 
Bliss, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new military organization, to be called "Joint Task Force 6," 
would help inspect cargo, conduct reconnaissance operations and ferry drug 
enforcement agents on raids along the border between the United States and 
Mexico, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not yet approved by Cheney, the Army proposal is the work of Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has pushed for 
a rethinking of the military's role in the fight against drugs. Powell devised 
the plan while he was commander of the U.S. Forces Command, which is 
responsible for arming and training U.S.-based Army forces for the defense of 
the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
In unveiling the Army's blueprint for the coming decade Thursday, Army Chief of 
Staff Carl E. Vuono emphasized the importance of the new drug-fighting mission, 
saying that it "is not just going to be a 1990 issue." 
</P>
<P>
National Guard and Reserve forces have been used to watch border areas in the 
past but the INS-Marine Corps agreement marks the first assignment of full-time 
military personnel to such activity. 
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts will be conducted primarily along the southern borders of 
Arizona and California, a Justice Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The two agencies acknowledged the risk of an armed clash between the training 
units and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some areas designated for joint training are heavily trafficked by drug 
smugglers," the memorandum said. "Planners will endeavor to select training 
areas and observation points which minimize the opportunity of a chance armed 
engagement." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that no more than 50 Marine officers will serve on temporary 
assignment with the INS at any one time and that Marines will be barred from 
pursuing and arresting drug smugglers. The military's role is tightly 
circumscribed by the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of 
military forces for domestic law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said that under both initiatives the military's experience 
with night-vision equipment would bring a major new capability to the drug 
interdiction effort in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership between 
the INS and the Marines, the troops' primary focus will be the "training and 
advising of civilian law enforcement officials" in the detection and monitoring 
of drug trade routes in the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"During night joint training operations, emphasis will be on ground 
reconnaissance, selection and manning of observation posts and the employment 
of night observation devices," the memorandum said.
