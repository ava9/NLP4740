THE RISE and rise of UK government bonds continued yesterday, tightening the
yield differential over German bunds to below 100 basis points from around
110 according to some models. The narrower yield spread highlights the
tendency of overseas investors to see the UK as offering consistent value
and potential.
There were gains along the whole length of the yield curve, with the
strengthening belief that inflation is not going to move higher - which
helps longer dated maturities - competing with hopes for a cut in UK
interest rates.
The enthusiasm of overseas investors, who have poured an estimated Pounds
5.5bn into the UK government bond market since the start of the year, was
reflected in the sprightly performance of 10-year gilts. Ten-year issues are
the preferred overseas investment vehicle because most countries, apart from
the US, have 10-year maturities as their long-dated benchmark bond.
US investment house JP Morgan calculates that the yield spread between UK
and German 10-year benchmarks has fallen to 102 basis points but Mr Ian
Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets, comparing the UK 8 per cent stock
dated 2003 with Germany's 6.5 per cent 2003 stock, said the spread had
reached 94.
'Our forecast is for the spread to hit 50 basis points by the end of the
year. That compares with forecasts of around 300 basis points after
devaluation last year when inflationary prospects were much worse,' he said.
Yesterday's gains came despite mixed economic data. The consumer credit bill
for May was only Pounds 118m, well below a market forecast of around Pounds
150m. It pointed to a continuing slide in consumer spending and added to
concerns that the much vaunted green shoots are withering on the vine.
The trend bolsters the need for an interest rate cut and consequently helps
short-dated issues.
However, it does not offer a great deal of encouragement to sterling, the
strength of which has been one of the big incentives for the overseas
investor.
ITALIAN government bonds leapt forward yesterday as the market anticipated a
one-point cut in the discount rate following news of a successful labour
agreement.
The government, the Confederation of Italian Industry and unions agreed a
four-year national contract on Saturday which cut away some of the country's
high wage pressure and consequent inflationary implications.
The September BTP futures contract opened half a point higher yesterday and
then shot forward to break through 104. There was some profit-taking in
mid-afternoon but the contract recovered on the announcement that the Bank
of Italy had cut its discount rate by one point to 9 per cent, its lowest
level since 1976. By the close, the BTP future was some 60 basis points
higher at 104.10
FRENCH government bonds drifted back, having already taken on board the
intervention rate cut which became effective yesterday.
The 25 basis points cut to 6.75 per cent was widely flagged after Germany's
half-point discount rate cut on Thursday and brings the two key floor rates
back to parity. On the Matif, September futures fell back 18 basis points to
119.10 by the official close and recovered slightly in after-hours trading.
The yield spread between French and German 10-year issues remained in single
figures.
DUTCH bonds fell after an idle, consistently weak session, with the market
stuck in post rate-cut doldrums and drifting further as hopes faded for any
further rate falls.
The benchmark 6.50 per cent 10-year guilder bond fell 0.35 to 99.45 with the
yield up 5 basis points at 6.57 per cent. Dutch paper fell further than its
easier German counterpart, narrowing the Dutch yield discount to Germany by
3 basis points to 14.
PORTUGUESE debt prices rose after the Bank of Portugal cut its regular money
market intervention rate by 0.25 points to 10.25 per cent and its short-term
lending rate by the same amount to 11.25 per cent.
The move follows the introduction of a new 10-year bond which puts the
Portuguese debt market on a par with its EC counterparts. Last week, the
central bank issued Es10bn of 11.5 per cent stock dated July 2003. The issue
was aggressively bid with Es82.7bn of offers and an accepted yield of 10.67
per cent against expectations of 11 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied sharply, receiving a boost from weak US
employment data and a low bank lending figure. The low corporate demand for
loans raised hopes that banks might be looking to shift funds into bonds.
The yield on the JGB No 145 fell 5 basis points to 4.31 per cent in Tokyo
trading and continued lower in London to 4.30 per cent by the close.
THE US Treasury market was closed for Independence Day but Canadian bonds
climbed across the board in trade kept quiet by the US holiday.
