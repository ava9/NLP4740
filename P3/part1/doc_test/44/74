gilts auction - Market report

Strong selling of stock index futures at the close of trading yesterday hit
a UK stock market where early gains had already been almost eliminated
following a very poor response to the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of five-year
British government bonds. The FT-SE 100 Index slipped below the 3,000 mark
again in the final minutes and traders expressed pessimism ahead of this
morning's opening.
Equities were helped at first by a brightening of the currency scene after
the French Economic Minister professed readiness to join in any dollar
support plans and the governor of the Bank of Japan rejected suggestions
that the US was acquiescing in a weak dollar.
With long-dated UK bonds firmer in line with other bond markets on the
improved dollar sentiment, the Footsie had gained 28.8 points by
mid-morning. But 3,029.7 proved to be the day's high point as first reports
from the gilts auction reached the stock market.
The market's advance was quickly routed. A brief rally as Federal bonds
responded to a gain of only 0.1 per cent in US durable goods orders for
September proved a false dawn and markets turned off again in London and New
York as interest rate worries resurfaced in nervous equity markets.
By the close, when losses in UK gilts were half a point down on the day, the
FT-SE 100 Share Index was a net 1 point off at 2,999.9. The sudden rush of
selling in the futures market drove the December futures contract on the
FT-SE Index down to 2,993. Some traders perceived a turn for the worse in
futures trading over the past few sessions.
London dealers warned that the UK market could face a difficult opening this
morning after the auction of five year Federal notes overnight; the
Bundesbank policy council meets today and tomorrow brings the gross domestic
product statistics in the US. The Dow Industrial Average was 9 points down
when London closed for the day.
The withdrawal of buying support across the full range of the market brought
a further fall of 7.4 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which closed
3,467.2. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the
day's total of 517.4m shares through the Seaq electronic network, itself a
dip of just over 9 per cent from the previous session.
The UK market faces important trading statements today from several blue
chip companies likely to provide a lead for the market. The insurance sector
performed well for most of yesterday's session, with dealers taking the view
that the generally negative report on pension fund sales from the Securities
Investment Board largely taken into share prices already.
Oil shares also performed well as good results from the US oil firms
outweighed any worries over the US currency. Recommendations from
stockbroking analysts brought a number of firm spots across the range.
Consumer and retail issues stood up well in spite of the warning on
inflationary pressures this week from the Confederation of British Industry.
The London securities arm of UBS warned clients that while the CBI survey
took place against a background of continued strong growth in the UK
economy, the recent gross domestic product statistics had suggested that the
pace of growth was slowing. Moreover, said UBS, the survey's references to
capacity shortages and unit cost pressures suggested that the medium term
outlook for inflation could be 'distinctly gloomy.'
However, Paribas Capital Markets, forecasting Footsie at 3,300 at the end of
the year, believes that base rates will remain at current levels until then.
It claims that market perceptions that that significant increases in
inflation and interest rates are threatened is 'right in principle but
likely .. to be hopelessly wrong in degree.'
