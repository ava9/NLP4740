THE GERMAN government bond market climbed to new highs again, spurred on by
heavy futures buying by traders, hedge funds and short-term accounts.
The market took cheer from a newspaper interview with Mr Hans Tietmeyer in
which the Bundesbank president said he could not rule out further cuts in
short-term interest rates, as money supply growth was slowing and inflation
was likely to ease.
With the Russian crisis abating, dealers said the market is focusing on
economic data, in particular the money supply and inflation figures which
are due out in the third week of October.
The Bundesbank yesterday raised the lowest accepted rate for its
variable-rate 35-day repo by one basis point to 6.71 per cent, but the
announcement failed to ruffle the bund market.
'It was a tight repo, but it's basically a sign the Bundesbank is pressing
the pause button,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, economist at Midland Global
Markets.
'The long end has had its run, but the short end of the European markets
haven't discounted the likelihood of rate cuts in Germany and France yet,'
she added.
The bund futures contract opened at 99.45 and reached a high of 99.79,
before slipping back to 99.62 by late afternoon.
FRENCH government bonds came off their highs, but closed up on the day. The
futures contract settled 14 basis points higher at 124.16, against a high of
124.28. One dealer pointed out: 'Both 10-year German and French government
bonds are yielding around 6 per cent and there is strong resistance at those
levels.'
UK government bonds took their cue from Germany, gaining about a quarter of
a point. 'The gilt market continues to look firm, taking the view that
interest rates are pointing downwards,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at
Baring Sterling Bonds.
The Liffe gilt futures contract traded in a range of 113.24 to 114.05, and
ended at 114.00, a gain of 0.09 on the day. Dealers noted some unofficial
supply of gilts by the Bank of England as the market reached the higher
levels.
RUMOURS of unexpected new supply dealt a blow to the Japanese government
bond market, pushing cash and futures prices sharply lower in the afternoon
trading session.
Dealers said rumours swept the market that the Ministry of Finance had
contacted a Japanese banks about the question of additional financing
through the bond market.
The December futures contract, which had traded in a range of 113.38 to
113.51 in the morning session, fell to a low of 113.02 after lunch on the
rumours, before closing at 113.07 in Tokyo.
According to Toyo Trust International, 'a scenario of tax cuts of about
Y7,000bn to be met with about Y5,000bn in deficit financing, with spending
cuts and a small rise in consumption tax looks likely. The market . . .
should be preparing to receive an extra Y300-Y400bn in bond issuance per
month'.
US Treasury prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as market
participants continued to trade cautiously before tomorrow's important jobs
data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent.
Prices edged higher at the opening, but failed to hold on to their gains,
and for the second consecutive day trading activity on the bond market was
restrained by an unwillingness among dealers and investors to commit funds
ahead of the September employment report, which is due to be published by
the Labor department tomorrow.
Analysts are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 150,000,
but concern that the data could include a surprising number, as happened
last month when the August figures were released showing an unexpected
decline in payrolls, kept many players on the sidelines.
