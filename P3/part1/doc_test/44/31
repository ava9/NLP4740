Leading industrialised nations are running restrictive economic policies
which are suppressing global demand and contributing to high unemployment
and international trade frictions, according to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.
The organisation's latest Trade and Development Report also unabashedly
favours demand management and the efficacy, at least in some circumstances,
of government intervention to hasten economic development.
The report forecasts world economic growth of only 2.5 per cent this year,
far slower than normal in a recovery and below the sustainable long-term
growth rate.
The current policy consensus among western governments and the main
multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
neglects the importance of effective demand and invariably treats inflation
as a more serious threat than unemployment, the report says.
The result has been a persistent deficiency of global demand which has
promoted 'the mistaken - and mercantilist - notion that countries should
seek growth by improving their overall competitiveness vis-a-vis other
countries'.
The report points out it is impossible for all countries to improve their
relative competitiveness.
If demand is insufficient, higher productivity will raise unemployment
rather than output, it says. 'Global demand deficiency is a recipe for
wasting the world's productive potential and an invitation to conflict among
nations.'
It says financial deregulation has increased the need for demand management.
Deregulation has encouraged 'waves of private debt and credit creation and
contraction which have spawned disturbing speculation' and produced large
current account imbalances, which have put strains on foreign exchange
markets and the trading system.
The report, deliberately released before the forthcoming annual IMF-World
Bank meeting, urges the world's three leading economic powers, and
particularly their monetary authorities, to act to boost growth:
The US 'needs to be cautious in applying monetary brakes', so as not to
stifle the recovery of investment and employment;
Western Europe needs to cut interest rates 'substantially for a prolonged
period' and to postpone tackling inflated budget deficits until recovery is
well under way. The European Union should delay plans for monetary union in
1996 or relax restrictive conditions agreed at Maastricht;
Japan should loosen monetary policy and expand domestic demand and
consumption. Otherwise, the report warns, it could soon have unemployment
levels matching those in the US.
Unctad extends its thesis to the developing world where, it says, the
pendulum has swung too far in favour of leaving private enterprise to get on
with the job. The report points to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as cases
where government intervention proved highly effective in forcing the pace of
development. The 'economic miracle' in these countries 'was not entirely a
miracle of the market', the report says.
While admitting that these examples cannot necessarily be replicated, Unctad
argues policymakers need to accept there may be different models of
development that work.
The report also points out that the Uruguay Round global trade agreements
will in time prevent many developing countries from using some measures
employed successfully in east Asia such as export incentives, import
controls and restrictions on foreign investment.
Developing countries' growth should average about 4 per cent this year,
Unctad says, though there is a widening gap between rapid growth in east and
south-east Asia and Africa's dismal performance. It argues that many of
Africa's problems reflect weak prices and lack of external finance, the
report argues.
It also has doubts about recent improvement in Latin American growth rates,
which it sees as excessively dependent on consumption and inflow of foreign
funds, mainly in the form of high risk 'junk' bonds and one-off investments
related to privatisation.
