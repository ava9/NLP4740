The UK chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, would have had a whiff of the worse than
expected UK Retail Prices Index and the faster than expected drop in
unemployment by the time he accepted the Bank of England's advice to raise
base rates. This was last Friday, 48 hours after his monthly meeting with
the governor, Eddie George, at which he had asked for a couple of days to
consider.
Nevertheless, these two indicators on their own would not have been
decisive. The 0.1 percentage point rise in the underlying RPI could well
have been a blip due to the end of the summer sales. Moreover, the fall in
unemployment is not yet being accompanied by a rise in the total number of
jobs, let alone full-time ones.
The main reasons for the base rate move were listed in a Treasury statement.
Some of the elements could have been cited a few months ago, such as the
growth of M0 (cash balances) persisting above the monitoring range. Other
trends, such as rising output expectations and higher sterling commodity
prices, and more vigorous recovery abroad have intensified.
The two most important elements were, however, the upward revisions in the
GDP estimates and detailed analysis suggesting rising prices of intermediate
products.
Vigilance is required in reacting to the GDP estimates. For instance, the
headline figure of 3.7 per cent real growth in the year up to the second
quarter of 1994 includes North Sea oil, which is both highly volatile and
exerts little direct pressure on the UK activity. The Treasury invented a
measure called 'non-oil GDP' with which it made great play when it suited
its purpose. This is still the most relevant measure today. Non-oil GDP has
on the latest estimate risen by 3 per cent, which is hardly breathtakingly
high.
Simply to look at this growth rate and contrast it with a guesstimate of
underlying growth of capacity of 2 to 2 1/4 per cent per annum is a howler.
The degree of spare capacity and unemployment are crucial. A 3 per cent
growth rate means something very different when the country is emerging from
a severe recession from what it does if the economy is running along its
trend line or bumping against the limits of capacity.
In fact the best domestic reason for raising UK short-term interest rates
was given in a reader's letter to the FT by Dr J. Popham (September 13). It
was simply that the risk in raising rates at this stage of the cycle, when
world output is recovering strongly, would be much smaller than the risk in
not raising them - which could reinforce the sceptical view that the UK has
not kicked its inflationary habits.
I doubt if the Bank of England would quarrel with the view of the former
chancellor, Norman Lamont, that short-term UK interest rates are likely to
rise to 7 per cent. The governor's speeches, while avoiding crystal gazing,
have assumed that UK short-term rates have been abnormally low in the
aftermath of recession, and that normal growth would require something
higher. If the appropriate real rate of interest is about 4 per cent, then 2
1/2 percentage points have to be added for inflation, even on an optimistic
estimate, and perhaps  1/2 per cent as a risk premium.
These considerations apply to other European countries where short-term
interest rates have not yet risen. In the main this is because recovery has
come later on the Continent. But there are other differences which are
revealed by looking at long-term rather than short-term rates.
Since the beginning of the year, average bond yields have risen in the Group
of Seven countries by nearly 2 percentage points. The rise in yields on UK
indexed gilts would suggest that about 1 percentage point of this increase
represents higher real interest rates and the rest a deterioration in
inflationary expectations.
The European Monetary Institute has apparently carried out a study of the
behaviour of bond rates. It did not explain the worldwide rise, but fell
back on the next best thing, which was to investigate the differential
increases from one country to another.
The charts are a rough attempt to replicate it. They show that Japan has
both the lowest level of bond yields and has experienced the smallest
increase in them - by a very wide margin. (In August, the Japanese yearly
inflation rate became for the first time negative at minus 0.2 per cent.)
The US and Germany cluster close together with bond yields of about 7 1/2
per cent, although Germany has a slightly faster rise of nearly 2 percentage
points. Only slightly behind comes France.
The UK on the other hand heads the also-rans. Before the base rate rise, it
had experienced both a larger increase in bond yields than the countries so
far mentioned and had seen them rise to a higher level. Ten-year bonds rose
in the UK in 1994 by some 2.7 percentage points. The yield was standing
before the base rate rise at 8.8 per cent - a higher level than in these
other countries. The only G7 country it clearly beat was Italy, whose
well-known problems have been reflected in bond yields of well over 12 per
cent.
It is anyone's guess why the UK, which has achieved a near-record underlying
inflation low (superior to any other G7 country except Japan and France),
has not done better in the bond stakes. Sterling has been weak against the
D-Mark and European currencies, but strong against the dollar. Its
trade-weighted index has been above the low point reached after the forced
withdrawal from the ERM, but it has been sagging for most of this year. It
was indeed an element in the government's base rate decision. The hope was
that a sterling crisis would be pre-empted well before the markets started
talking about one. Obviously the chancellor plays down this element in view
of the peculiar emotions which any idea of looking at the sterling rate
arouses in some Tory MPs.
The Treasury and Bank claim that what market developments mainly show is the
need to reinforce the credibility of the new anti-inflationary machinery in
Britain, the high point of which is the regular monthly meeting between the
chancellor and governor. They hope that such confidence will be reinforced
by a pre-emptive strike such as this week's base rate move.
But I fear that there may be more to it than that. Another development is
that European monetary union has recovered some credibility, as the European
economy has recovered and hard core countries have remained within hailing
distance of their old ERM parities. But the idea has also become entrenched
that the UK and Italy will not be among the initial members. And is not the
anti-inflationary credibility of a likely Emu member still higher than that
of an outsider?
In fact Britain stands as good a chance of fulfilling the Maastricht
criteria for Emu membership as most of the probable members. The present
British government looks likely to exercise its opt-out mainly because
anything else would split the Tory party from top to bottom. Meanwhile,
financial markets are not yet completely convinced (a) that Labour will win
the next election, (b) that, if it does, it will have the courage to follow
the instincts of its present leadership and join Emu (although my own view
is that it would) and (c) that, even if a Labour government did join Emu,
this would outweigh its pro-trade union instincts.
The important point is that opting out of Emu does have an economic price
which the UK may already be paying in long-term interest rates higher than
those of partner countries, and in the need to reinforce confidence by base
rate increases earlier than it otherwise might. This is not an element of
policy which either the Treasury or Bank would at present emphasise: which
is all the more reason for others to do so.
