UK government bonds dipped yesterday on the release of higher-than-expected
producer price data for December, but quickly bounced back when it became
clear the underlying trend was lower year-on-year. They ended the day about
a  1/4 point higher, with an equal performance along the yield curve.
'The market was reassured by the numbers since they showed that price
inflation is still falling,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at S. G. Warburg. He said
the figures provided a favourable background for the retail prices index,
which will be published tomorrow.
The Bank of England is due to announce details of its gilts auction this
afternoon. The market widely expects the Bank to opt for a 2010 maturity, in
the middle of its 2008-2012 range, thereby establishing a new 15-year
benchmark. Analysts expect the auction to raise between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 3.5bn, with a yield on the stock of around 6 1/2 per cent.
German government bonds eased in quiet trading as investors retreated to the
sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting on Thursday.
The holiday in the US also dampened activity. The March bund future on Liffe
fell 0.12 point to 100.53 in moderate volume.
Analysts said the recent fall in the D-Mark against the dollar had reduced
the chances of a cut in German interest rates this week. There was also
little evidence of a slowing in M3 growth. 'The Bundesbank has to have
something on which to hang the rate cut,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief
economist at UBS in Frankfurt.
However, the release of preliminary cost of living data for January later
this week could provide the market with a fresh direction, he added.
Italian government bonds gained  1/4 point, bucking the downward trend
elsewhere in continental Europe, as the market took comfort from the fact
that Mr Carlo Ciampi will stay on as caretaker prime minister in the run-up
to elections, called for March 27.
Without this, there could have been a 'political vacuum which would have
prompted a big sell-off', said Mr Andrew Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS in
London.
However, he warned the market was likely to become more volatile in the
run-up to the elections, particularly if some of Italy's more marginal
political parties start to make a strong showing in opinion polls. Although
the market currently takes the view that crucial economic reforms are
already in place, the economic policies of some of the smaller parties
remain unclear.
Mr Roberts is recommending that clients switch from Italy to Spain, although
he says the outlook for Italy remains favourable in the longer term.
Japanese government bonds and futures remained weak due to supply concerns
in the market following the Trust Fund Bureau's announcement that it intends
to sell Y900bn of its 10-year bond holdings over the next three months.
Fears that the government's fiscal package might be larger than expected,
and that there will be no early easing in the discount rate, also depressed
the market, said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi
International in London.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 bond rose to 3.27 per cent yesterday from
3.16 per cent on Friday. Bond analysts noted the yield was below 3 per cent
only one week ago. The March contract closed at 116.20 in Tokyo, down from
116.90 on Friday, and slipped further to 115.67 in London trading.
Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe, said there was not a great deal of
selling in the cash market, since investors were opting to hedge their
positions rather than sell their cash holdings.
US bond markets were closed yesterday.
