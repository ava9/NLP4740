FT  31 JAN 92 / History's vanquished return to favour: Why some UK fund
managers are looking at bonds

There is a growing debate between UK fund managers content to pursue proven
equity-led investment strategies and those arguing for increased investment
in bonds.
The case for equities is overwhelming: in the 1970s and 1980s equities
offered an average annual real return of 8.1 per cent, against 0.8 per cent
from bonds. Over longer periods a similar pattern emerges.
This encouraged institutions to switch funds out of bonds and into shares.
UK pension funds held about 45 per cent of assets in bonds in the mid-1960s,
falling to just 8 per cent by September last year.
However, in December Norwich Union, the mutual insurance group, announced
that its main fund had built up a 16 per cent holding of bonds, from zero at
the start of last year. GT, the fund management group which has about Pounds
6bn under management, now holds some 23 per cent of its balanced funds in
bonds. It held nothing during the 1980s.
'There is an excess of funds in the UK equity market which has been built up
over the past decade,' said Mr Nick Train, investment director at GT Unit
Managers. 'It is difficult to see where the next marginal buyers of equities
are going to come from. This imbalance could take another decade to put
right.'
This argument is backed up by the observation that, if you believe pegging
sterling to the D-Mark within the exchange rate mechanism will result in
lower UK inflation, bonds at current yields offer exceptional value.
For example, long-dated gilts offer a yield of about 9.5 per cent. If future
governments can maintain inflation at about 3.5 per cent, the German average
over the past 25 years, this implies 6 per cent real return.
Bonds have been a poor investment ever since the UK economy started to run
with a high level of inflation in the mid-1950s. In countries with a better
inflation performance, the bond market has been of at least equal importance
to the equity market as a magnet for institutional funds.
In 1988, Japanese pension funds held 55 per cent of assets in bonds, against
47 per cent in Canada, 38 per cent in the US and 28 per cent in Germany.
However, even in these low-inflation countries, bonds have substantially
under-performed equities.
The average annual real return to a Japanese holder of Japanese bonds was
just 0.2 per cent in the years 1967-90, against 10.9 per cent from Japanese
equities. German bonds averaged a real return of 2.7 per cent over the
period, against 9.5 per cent from equities. US bonds returned an average
loss of 0.6 per cent, against an annual return of 4.7 per cent on equities.
These figures suggest that factors other than investment performance are as
important in deciding how much money is devoted to the bond and equity
markets. For example, continental European countries are only now developing
competing funded pension schemes which set aside assets over a long period
to meet future liabilities.
Under these circumstances, foreign fund managers have preferred low-risk,
low-return government bond investments and the certainty of a fixed income
from bonds.
Another factor relevant to the UK is the maturity of pension funds. When a
fund is new, outgoings in the form of pension payments are low and income
from contributions is high.
Fund managers' chief concern is to protect the capital value of investments.
Equities have been historically the best way of achieving this. Yet when a
fund is mature, outgoings will increase and the fund manager becomes more
concerned with achieving a guaranteed stream of income.
'Techniques of asset-liability modelling are leading more funds to look at
their cash flows and question whether they should move more into bonds,'
said Mr Martin Shaw, chief executive of Baring Investment Management, which
manages Pounds 6bn for more than 100 separate pension funds.
The ageing of the population means that many UK pension funds are reaching
maturity: outgoings relative to inflows are increasing. For example, in 1980
the net inflow of cash into UK pension funds amounted to 19 per cent of
assets; by 1990 this had fallen to 4 per cent. However, the argument in
favour of bonds only becomes compelling if sterling's membership of the ERM
squeezes down corporate earnings and dividend payments along with inflation.
During the 1970s and 1980s equities provided capital growth and real growth
in investment income. Even mature pension funds which needed to finance
current pension payments had no reason to buy bonds.
Most pension fund managers believe they need at least to match wage
inflation - usually about 2 percentage points higher than retail price
inflation - if future commitments are to be covered.
Real dividend growth ran at an average rate of 5.7 per cent cent during the
1980s, easily in excess of the target. But can real growth in dividends be
maintained if the economy remains depressed over a number of years rather
than just months?
There is an argument that institutions pressed companies to deliver
abnormally high dividend growth during the 1980s to meet their growing
pension commitments. Some fund managers say the strain of maintaining
dividends is starting to show. Last year dividends paid by companies were
more than half earnings for the first time in 10 years.
But only a few institutions have allocated more funds into bonds. UK pension
funds sold a net Pounds 3bn gilts in the nine months to the end of
September, suggesting that most fund managers still see equities delivering
both real income growth and capital growth.
