WHAT A difference currency changes can make]
Sterling-based investors had a field day in the last quarter of 1992. The 24
markets making up the FT-Actuaries World Indices produced a combined total
return of almost 18 per cent; profits for the US dollar investor were zero.
Total return for the UK itself was some 14 per cent, but the market was also
a lossmaker for American funds investing in Britain.
For UK fund managers and internationally-minded retail investors, the great
escape came with Black Wednesday, when sterling quit the ERM, interest rates
and the value of the pound dropped sharply and equities powered ahead. The
total return on the UK subset of the World Index was a negative 2.3 per cent
in the year to September 16; in the three-and-a-half months to year-end, the
outcome was some 23 per cent and a very happy new year indeed for most fund
managers.
The story, but again only for sterling holders, was much the same across the
investment world. Total return on the 2,200-plus components of the World
Index to the middle of September was a negative 3 per cent; over the
remaining 15 trading weeks of the year the return was over 20 per cent
positive. Europe excluding the UK was 15.5 per cent; the Pacific region
excluding Japan saw almost 20 per cent. Towards the end of December, London,
New York and Tokyo all hit their high point of a turbulent investment year
on most exchanges, although the US stock market was uncharacteristically
rock steady throughout 1992.
Dollar investors across the 520-odd US stocks in the index had a
last-quarter return of 5.3 per cent, against a virtual standstill outcome
for the narrow Dow, but they had a poor time in Europe, excluding Finland
and Italy, and had hefty losses in Austria, Denmark, Germany and France.
However, the global dollar portfolio got a huge 35 per cent return in
Mexico.
The Japanese market, still a major headache for many UK fund managers who
bought it expensively at the start of 1992 (or late the previous year), went
nowhere in the final quarter in local terms, but sterling investors who got
their timing right had an almost 14 per cent total return. The small Irish
market showed a higher than 7 per cent local return in the October-December
period, despite a strong currency and high interest rates.
But if timing was of the essence in some markets, sector (as against
all-important stock) selection was less vital in the last quarter. No sector
in the World Index produced a negative return, and many showed impressive
gains: banks, utilities, media, electronics, retail and forestry/paper
produced returns better than 20 per cent, with automobiles and chemicals at
16 and 14 respectively. Precious metals just managed it into positive
territory.
And the immediate future? Uncertain. Money market rates are headed
downwards, at least for the moment, and the retail investor needs to take
some calculated chances elsewhere.
Pension funds have their long-term liabilities to match, so they have little
option other than a sizeable holding in equities, although the balance in
favour of international bonds may be changing, European economic conversion
or not.
The Clinton White House should see some enhanced US economic activity - the
year-end signs were already encouraging - but immediate equity prospects in
continental Europe and Japan may not be great. UK companies with heavy US
exposure (and there are many in the big league) will benefit from growth in
the American economy, but more competitive export prices may run up against
recessions in many traditional British markets.
France could be a buy in the medium term, subject to a small currency risk,
and also some of the Pacific Basin markets. Smaller companies in economies
coming out of recession, notably the US, were showing healthy signs early on
this year. Stock-picking could be a short term imperative.
