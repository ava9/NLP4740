Will 1994 be a good year for private investors? The Weekend FT asked four
leading fund managers for their views on prospects for the major stock
markets - the UK, US, Japan and Europe. All were fairly optimistic, with the
main themes being declining interest rates and an increased pace of economic
growth.
MICHAEL HART, of Foreign &amp; Colonial
'I am hopeful that the major markets can again make progress in 1994, even
after the good rises of 1993. The big question for investors at present is
to what extent declining interest rates in Germany will be offset by higher
interest rates in the US. The depressed state of the German economy means
that interest rates there have further to fall.
'Recently, the US economy has been recovering strongly. If this were to
continue, higher rates would be inevitable - and markets are already
discounting a 1 per cent increase. However, there are good reasons to
believe that US economic growth could moderate soon. Higher taxes are in the
pipeline and consumer savings are low, while debt is high. These factors,
coupled with a low inflation outlook, may stop interest rates rising much
further.
'It is possible that with a favourable interest rate background and
improving profits, and dividend prospects based on rationalisation and lower
financing costs, the FT-SE 100 index could climb further despite present
high valuations.
'For Wall Street, I am concerned that the market has been rising without a
10 per cent setback for the longest period in its history. Inevitably, some
bolt from the blue will upset the applecart, if only temporarily. But low
interest rates, low inflation and rising profits could see the Dow 5 per
cent above present levels at 3,900 by the end of 1994.
'Although share price valuations are high, falling interest rates, good
prospects of profits' recovery and the greater enthusiasm of local investors
for equities could take the major European markets higher - possibly 15 per
cent above present levels.
'At present, confidence is completely lacking in Japan and the market is low
 -it could be a good time to buy . . . Japan may be one of the better
markets in 1994, with a possible gain of at least 20 per cent.
'In the emerging markets, Mexico and India are probably the best bets, with
gains in excess of anything achieveable in the major markets.'
TIM THOMAS, of Guinness Flight
'In 1992 and 1993, it was easy to advise what to do with spare cash. Take it
out of the building society and put it into any financial asset - bonds or
equities - in the UK or overseas. But does that advice still hold true as we
enter 1994?
'In my opinion, as regards main-line markets, the answer is yes. But it is
possible that markets will reach levels this year which would make them
vulnerable to significant setbacks (more like the fall of October 1989 than
the crash of 1987). Markets are high but interest rates are low; and with
the exception of the US, where we expect rates to start to rise in the first
quarter of 1994, are likely to go lower on a world-wide basis. This will
keep equity and non-US bond markets rising as investors shift portfolios
away from cash.
'Following the sharp rise since the Budget, the UK equity market should put
in a steadier performance in 1994, possibly reaching 3,750 on the FT-SE 100,
while interest rates fall to 5 per cent. Europe, where the economies have
not yet started recovering, should rise 15-20 per cent over the year, with
Italy possibly being the best performer.
'Japan should see some hopeful economic signs and this could lift the market
substantially; but the currency should slip against the US dollar, although
it will enjoy a small rise versus sterling. The Far Eastern markets are
likely to continue to attract money as the 'hot' growth area of the world
and price/earnings multiples may expand several points, providing 25 per
cent-plus returns in local currency and more in sterling terms.
'The US market, with the economy strong and rates starting to rise, may be a
relatively poor performer (offering returns of, say, 10 per cent) but should
benefit from a resurgent dollar, which could reach Dollars 1.25/Pounds . So,
1994 should be another good year for investors; but, by 1995, the easy money
will have been made.'
DAVID ROSIER, of Mercury Asset Management
'In 1994, we believe that, for the fourth year in a row, there will be
modest overall world economic growth. We expect inflation to remain low and,
consequently, believe there is more scope for falls in interest rates. We,
therefore, expect further progress in both equity and bond markets.
Nevertheless, there will be periodic worries that either growth will abort
or that inflationary pressures are emerging. Volatile stock markets are
likely.
'There remains further up-side in the UK stock market. In the context of
moderate but sustained economic growth and low inflation, the market is
attractively valued relative to continental Europe.
'Clearly, the forecast of a lower than anticipated public sector borrowing
requirement in the recent Budget benefited gilts. With gilt yields
declining, the attraction of equities also increased. However, after its
recent progress, it is likely that the UK market will consolidate in the
short term until further evidence emerges of a recovery in corporate
earnings.
'We would recommend an under-weighting in the United States, where the
market will no longer be assisted by interest rate falls. Indeed, interest
rates there may edge upwards as the Federal Reserve Board seeks to control
the rate of US economic growth, so allowing the dollar to strengthen.
'In Japan, it is probable that corporate profits will show little recovery
in 1994, even before major corporate restructuring. We believe the
authorities there may not respond sufficiently quickly to avert a further
deterioration in the economy. In this situation, yen bonds remain a
preferred asset class and there could be some delay in the anticipated
weakness of the yen.
'Continental European markets should benefit from further interest rate
declines. However, valuations are high and there is scope for disappointment
with both economic growth and corporate earnings.
'Finally, we believe that the outstanding growth prospects assisted over the
medium term by the recent Gatt agreement will continue to justify investment
in the Pacific basin and emerging markets areas. Evidence suggests that
investors will want to increase their exposure to them, providing further
support.'
COLIN McLEAN, of Scottish Value Management
'I think 1994 will confound the pessimists, since growth in the global
economy is accelerating and there is little sign of inflationary pressures.
Most of the surprises should be favourable - with Japan eventually
responding to a massive economic stimulus, and interest rates continuing to
fall in continental Europe. The weak oil price gives a further boost to
global growth prospects, while underlining the deflationary pressures.
'Lax US monetary policy is feeding dollars into financial assets rather than
the real economy. This has been the right policy to pull the US out of
recession, but it has also boosted other dollar-based markets, such as south
east Asia.
'Even so, liquidity-driven stock markets are not yet a recipe for a repeat
of 1987. Indeed, one of 1994's surprises could be that US growth will pick
up further - but without the inflationary signals that would require the Fed
to tighten. In this environment, US share valuations do not yet seem
over-stretched.
'The search for growth should see investors continuing to pile into Far
Eastern markets. Not only should the tiger economies perform well, but Japan
also has the potential for a rebound.
'It took some time to kick-start the US economy, and so Japan's sluggishness
is not surprising. Japan's restructuring will be a long haul, but the
present level of the Nikkei under-values the economy's inherent strengths
and the likely turnaround in the coming year.
'With unemployment still the major issue in Europe, further interest rate
cuts are likely. This prospect should underpin most European markets, such
as Germany and Italy. And US money will flow into Europe - attracted by
privatisations and the region's potential as a late cycle investment.
'I also believe that UK shares will have a good year, although many more
profits warnings will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall
outlook of slow growth and optimistic company forecasts.
'The risks are in sectors that seem bargains - such as food retailing -
where profits estimates are still too optimistic. 1994 could remind us what
an earnings-driven market is like. After easy gains from widespread
re-ratings, investment performance is now likely to be driven by earnings
surprise.'
