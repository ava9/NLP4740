equity returns - Adrian FitzGerald compares a spectacular decade with the
results of a five-year fight against inflation

Major equity markets around the world tend to produce their best returns
during the month of January, and things were no different in 1994. The FT-A
World Index rose by over 5 per cent on the month in local currency terms;
the Japanese market rose by almost 13 per cent.
Then the US Federal Reserve spoiled the party in February by raising
short-term interest rates. Long bond yields in the US and elsewhere were
already being pushed up by fears that inflationary pressures would follow
hard on the heels of economic recovery. And the US domestic economy was
beginning to show signs of overheating.
Six interest rate rises later, those fears have not been laid to rest.
Medium and long-term bond yields in the US are 2 percentage points higher
than in February reflecting, in the main, the inflation risks that investors
still perceive. Long bond yields in other major markets have also risen,
though by a lesser degree in most cases.
It is not surprising, against this background, that global equity markets
failed to extend an excellent start to the year. In fact, the FT-A World
Index in local currency, which hit its peak on February 2, is closing the
year some 7 per cent below that peak level.
What is surprising is that, given the extent of the weakness in bonds, some
equity markets did not suffer even greater falls during the year. US
equities, for example, have held up remarkably well, falling only 4 per cent
from their February peak. Optimistic investors (and stockbrokers) would
argue that this resilience is proof that the bull market in equities is
still intact and that a strong rally is assured once inflation fears
subside. However, realists should take special note of the fact that US
equities still appear very overvalued relative to bonds. Indeed, the ratio
of bond yield to equity yield - a crude, inverse measure of relative
attractiveness - is, worryingly, at its highest levels since just before the
October 1987 crash]
Equity markets need a bond market recovery, therefore, if progress is to be
resumed in 1995. But this does imply, of course, that investors willing to
commit new money to financial markets should not ignore the potential
returns from bonds. Good returns from equities will only be forthcoming on
the back of good returns from fixed interest securities.
And here lies one of the more important lessons to be learned from the first
half of the decade, a period in which authorities around the world have
fought to squeeze inflation out of the economic system. Contrary to the
experience of the 1980s, it should no longer be assumed that equity markets
will churn out high double digit returns year after year. Moreover, it would
also be wrong to assume that equity returns will always better bond returns
by a wide margin.
Equity returns were spectacular during the 1980s. UK-based investors were
particularly well served by international diversification, because of the
depreciation in sterling against some of the major currencies. The 21.0 per
cent annualised return in Japan, for example, translated into an annualised
sterling return of 31.5 per cent.
Performances look very different over the first half of the 1990s. Japan has
been the worst performing of the major markets and now sells in local
currency terms at 54 per cent of its value at the start of the decade. The
yen has continued to appreciate, however, which has eased the pain for
foreign investors. The biggest losers have been the Japanese themselves who
will have struggled to eke out satisfactory returns from most of the major
equity markets.
Equities will continue to deliver superior, long-term returns to investors
prepared to take on additional risks. But long-term means long-term. And the
experience of the last five years should serve as a reminder that equity
returns may disappoint in the short to medium term.
UK-based investors, who tend to have a relatively extreme exposure to
equities, will no doubt wish to do some hard strategic thinking in the light
of this experience. Despite a poor performance in 1994, UK long bonds have
outperformed UK equities during the decade so far. The outperformance
averages just 2 percentage points per annum, but it is the first time since
1978 that long bonds have come out on top in a rolling five year analysis.
A similar analysis for the US market shows equities and bonds running neck
and neck as the New Year approaches. It certainly seems highly likely that
the current controversy over the scale of the equity risk premium - the
excess return to be expected from equities over bonds - will become even
more frenzied on both sides of the Atlantic in 1995.
