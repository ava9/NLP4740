Last Friday, UK equity and bond markets soared as investors scrambled to
take advantage of the Tories' surprise election victory. This morning,
overseas investors in particular will be taking a more considered look at
the attractions of the UK under Mr John Major.
Their conclusions could have profound consequences. International investors
bought well over Pounds 15bn worth of gilts and equities last year, against
Pounds 5bn in 1990. Also, their confidence in sterling will determine the
new government's ability to cut interest rates.
Convincing overseas investors that sterling will not be devalued within the
European exchange rate mechanism is vital if buying is to continue. Losses
from holding equities and bonds denominated in a depreciating currency can
easily wipe out any gains from the investments themselves.
'It's a very good result,' said Mr Rudolf Enz, economist with Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich. 'My impression is that interest rates could come down
without endangering the value of the pound. There was a risk premium on UK
rates because of fears a Labour victory would lead to a falling currency.
Now the uncertainty has gone, the risk premium should be reduced.'
Mr Anthony Pearce of Vontobel Asset Management commented there could be
scope for half a percentage point cut in interest rates as early as this
week, with another half a point cut possible if a strengthened currency
permitted Britain to enter the narrow band of the European Monetary System.
But while restoring confidence in sterling is vital to attracting overseas
investment in UK stocks and bonds, international investors remain split
about the wider economic outlook. Many remain sceptical that the new
government can stimulate either the economy or the stock market in the near
term.
'With the Conservatives back in power it is difficult to foresee any major
changes,' said Mr Philippe Ithurbite, a capital markets economist at Societe
Generale in Paris. 'There is still no sign of economic recovery in the UK
and, until this comes, the markets will stay depressed.'
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Frankfurt,
said that it was too early to base investment decisions on the poll result,
despite Friday's rises in the stock and gilts markets and by sterling.
'This is only an advance instalment of confidence. It provides a basis for
Mr Major to work out policies to benefit the economy and develop more
clarity over the party's attitude to Europe,' he said.
Equally, Japanese businessmen recognise that the election alone will not
change the condition of the UK economy. As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
business daily, said this weekend, Mr Major has very little room for
manoeuvre in trying to stimulate the economy by managing the country's
monetary and fiscal policies.
But others are less circumspect and are predicting a wider upturn in
economic activity. Mr Harald Schmidlin, European stock market analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: 'The Conservative victory is like a small
economic package. For me, the recession is over.'
Mr John Hickling, who runs a European fund for Fidelity, the US fund
manager, believes
the London market is still inexpensive by international and historical
standards. The first glimmers of an economic recovery are apparent, and he
thinks UK companies are geared for growth because they have taken the right
action to cut costs and improve balance sheets.
Mr Pelle Danielsen, UK equity analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich, has been
backing defensive quality stocks with a high American exposure. But he
thinks the time is right to consider cyclical stocks, including capital
goods companies and banks.
Vontobel's Mr Pearce expects the equity market to continue moving up over
the next month or so, but says further impetus will come only from real
signs of economic recovery.
Overseas buying of sterling bonds could be more important to Mr Major's
government than overseas buying of equities.
On Friday alone, the Bank of England showed its eagerness to fund as much as
possible while sentiment is good by selling up to Pounds 4bn bonds.
However, this pace of issuance will not be maintained. One negative factor
is that Japanese investors, some of the biggest buyers of gilts last year,
are now preoccupied with the weakness of domestic markets.
Japanese investors invested Dollars 74bn in foreign securities last year,
with the UK attracting 20 per cent of the total. Much of this cash went into
government bonds, which were seen as attractive because of the high yields
available compared with other leading markets.
But last year's level of Japanese investment in UK securities was
exceptionally high and is unlikely to be maintained.
Mr Haruaki Deguchi, managing director of the London affiliate of Nippon
Life, the life insurer, says: 'The flow of Japanese investments in
securities does not depend on whether Mr Major or Mr Kinnock is in power but
on the state of the Tokyo markets.'
It remains to be seen whether overseas money from elsewhere can plug the
gap. International investors remain nervous about the state of the
government's finances and the amount which needs to be borrowed.
