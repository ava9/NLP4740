FT  25 APR 94 / The Markets: Puncturing the equity bubble - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER

<TEXT>
US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan did a splendid job in puncturing the global
bond bubble. Yet he failed to do quite the same for equities, which on any
long term assessment still look on the high side despite their recent
volatile behaviour. To take a rather old-fashioned yardstick, the yield on
US equities as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices has risen by less
than a quarter of a point to around 2.9 per cent since February 4, while the
UK is up by about half a point at 3.9 per cent. Is there a risk that British
pension fund managers, whose near-80 per cent commitment to equities sticks
out like a sore thumb in all international comparisons, could still come
unstuck?
I have asked this question before and been rewarded with a mailbag that the
politicians would call full and frank. Yet instinct - mine, that is, and
clearly not widely shared - suggests that the 18.8 per cent total return on
UK equities over the past 10 years cannot be repeated over the next 10 if
nominal GDP growth is going to be in the disinflationary 6 or 7 per cent
area. That would require the kind of levitation that markets rarely sustain
over more than brief periods: a bubble, in short.
My conviction that there will not be an early return to immoderate
inflation, incidentally, is reinforced by the extraordinary twitchiness of
bond markets at the merest hint of an upturn in earnings, or of drift in
fiscal policy. We may be past the bottom of the inflation cycle in the
English-speaking economies, but much trouble is already discounted.
A more weighty case for returning to the question is provided by the
publication of the invaluable Pension Fund Indicators, produced annually by
PDFM, the London-based fund management arm of UBS. It is not difficult to
use PDFM's data to make the case that equities are a dangerous long term
investment at today's levels.
The first and simplest of the arguments is merely that the returns on UK
equities have been so exceptional for so long. Since 1975 they have
outperformed the US, Germany and even Japan in sterling terms. Measured in
local currency, UK equities still outperformed except in the period of
extreme overvaluation in Tokyo in the bubble of the second half of the
1980s.
British pension fund managers clearly derived great benefit from their
aggressive stance in UK equities in a period when the market value of
pension fund assets was rising from Pounds 46.5m (at 1993 prices) in 1963 to
an estimated Pounds 491m at end-1993. There was a huge windfall to equities
at the expense of gilts on the basis of unanticipated inflation. Yet such
success over such a long period may be a handicap in assessing the future,
especially if bond market thinking is still over-influenced by past
inflation, in which case gilts could have a windfall at the expense of
equities.
In the long run equity earnings will tend to grow in line with national
income. Equities are also expected to generate a higher total return than
gilts because markets are said to price equities to allow for their greater
volatility - though the risk premium argument is not entirely persuasive in
a world where inflation has seriously upset gilt valuations; nor again in an
institutionalised market where portfolios are widely spread and UK actuaries
value funds by reference to income rather than stock market values.
The more important point made by Jim McCaughan of PDFM is that over the past
10 years UK equities have had the benefit of a big favourable valuation
adjustment; and that the penalty over the long run for getting the initial
value of the investment wrong is lethal, regardless of underlying corporate
performance. On a set of perfectly plausible assumptions about a reversion
to long run trends in price/earnings ratios, dividend yields, dilution (as a
result of capital raising), growth and inflation, he arrives at a projected
global real return on bonds over the next 10 years of 2.6 per cent, compared
with real equity returns of 2.1 per cent for the US, 2.4 per cent for Europe
and minus 3.6 per cent for Japan.
That is not what the average UK pension fund manager is expecting, with
exposure to real assets (equity and property) of 84 per cent. Still less
what the average Japanese manager is preparing for. Yet the vulnerability of
Japan to downward valuation adjustments is precisely what should be expected
from a market that went from a p/e ratio of 25 in 1983 to 68 at the end of
last year - the only mature economy with an emerging market p/e. The message
is not reassuring for those buying equities for the long haul.
Buy high, sell low
In his days as chief investment strategist for James Capel, Alastair Ross
Goobey used to do a provocative conference turn in which he demonstrated
statistically that pension fund managers almost always concentrate their
cash flow on last year's investment story, not on assets that are out of
fashion and due for a comeback. PDFM makes much the same point: the peak
allocation by pension funds to UK equities - up to three quarters of cash
flow - took place after big market rises in 1987 and in 1990-91.
Another way of emphasising the importance of timing the initial purchase -
see charts - is to look at the number of occasions on which a given level of
p/e ratio has been followed by good or bad investment returns. Today's
historic p/e on the FT-SE 100 index is over 19. The charts tell us that the
number of occasions on which an investor would have earned a positive annual
return when the average quarterly p/e has been between 17 and 20 has been a
mere three out of 15 times.
This is not unlike the exercise carried out by Daniel O'Shea for M&amp;G on the
basis of BZW's figures of annual returns between 1918 and 1990, using
dividend yields. Taking his figures, you find that in those years when the
market has yielded 4 per cent or less, the subsequent five-year real return
was negative in 10 out of 12 cases during that period. If fund managers are
bad at short run judgments, as Mr Ross Goobey believes, and if the
historical evidence suggests that longer run returns will be poor from
today's valuation levels, the exposure to equities in the UK needs
rethinking.
Before reaching for your poisoned pen, do not forget that when George Ross
Goobey, Alastair's father, promoted the cult of the equity after the war,
portfolios were as choc-a-bloc with gilts as they are today with equities.
And with Ross Goobey fils now in charge of PosTel Investment Management,
Britain's biggest pot of pension money, we need someone else, please, to do
his conference turn. Is he really resisting the temptation to buy high and
sell low?
Lloyds etc
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society's readiness to accept a less than
generous offer from Lloyds Bank has prompted speculation about a stampede to
snap up other societies. The financial logic is certainly compelling. In
effect, Lloyds is exploiting an arbitrage opportunity between two different
forms of ownership. Operating outside capital market discipline in a
framework of only modest accountability, the managers of mutually owned
building societies may be prepared to accept smaller acquisition premiums to
obtain the buyer of their choice. Few customers will quibble about exit p/e
ratios.
But Lloyds still faces formidable legal obstacles to completion. And as
Patrick Frazer of banking consultants DIBC suggests, it may turn out to have
scooped the pool much as it did in life assurance with its acquisition of
Abbey Life. As with insurance there are many building societies not worth
having and some good ones that may not want to be had. A stampede? That's
going it a bit.
