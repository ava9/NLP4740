THE RISE in the equity market this week has had stock market commentators
rushing to change their forecasts for the year-end. While many were
predicting that the Footsie would reach 3,100 by then, they are now looking
at 3,200 by next weekend.
The rise in the index this week, of 47.5 points to a close of 3057.6, was
concentrated entirely in a 48.6 point jump on Wednesday, the largest one-day
increase since January 26.
It is easy to see the gain as driven by the good news that the market has
been using to justify rising thus far: falling interest rates; the prospect
of another base rate cut this autumn; and low inflation which should
continue for some time, combining to drive down gilt yields and push
equities higher.
That is backed by the economic recovery which is becoming more evident with
each week's crop of economic statistics - such as higher retail sales; a
lower public sector borrowing requirement than expected in July; strong
growth in borrowing; and a rise in corporate profit margins as wage growth
lags profit growth. But market strategists have begun to latch on to a
significant new element.
While people have been pre-occupied by the break-up of the exchange rate
mechanism and what that means for the UK, the yen has been rising. It almost
broke through the Y100-Dollars 1 level this week, but turned back abruptly
after heavy intervention from the US authorities. The Japanese, anxious to
reflate their economy, want the yen to come down from this peak. Thus, there
is now strong pressure inside and outside the country to reverse the
currency's rise.
Nick Knight, equity strategist at the Japanese-owned Nomura Research
Institute - who should know - says that, within Japan, the large
institutional investors will be encouraged to sell the yen and shift their
money overseas.
Which important currency has been one of the worst performers against the
yen and might, therefore, be the first to which Japanese investors turn
their attention? Sterling. The beginning of the yen's latest surge coincided
with sterling's devaluation last September, and the yen has risen from
Y245-Pounds 1 to Y150.
Which large and liquid stock market is on the rise anticipating, yet not
fully discounting, economic recovery? The UK.
Put the two together and Knight's theory of a Japanese 'wall of money'
buying the UK stock market is not so fanciful. He has long predicted the
Footsie would rise to 3,500 by the end of this year, and is looking for a
smaller increase - to 3,700 - by the end of 1994. If you miss this move in
the market, you might as well forget UK equities for the next five years, he
says.
Buying from overseas investors was much in evidence this week in heavy
turnover, and retail investors have been buying, too. Fears earlier this
year that hefty gilt sales, rights issues and flotations would put too much
of a strain on cash flows, and keep the market down, have proved groundless.
Even the generally more cautious Michael Hughes, at BZW, is pointing to the
yen story. He notes that someone could borrow in yen, switch the money into
sterling and buy UK equities yielding enough to cover the yen interest cost,
giving a free play on the currency and the UK market.
Like nature abhorring a vacuum, markets abhor this kind of discrepancy. And
stock markets (to quote Knight again) do move in straight lines every so
often.
Once it becomes obvious to all that a market should be higher, it will move
there fast. In January 1989, for instance, the Footsie rose 250 points with
barely a down day. It went on to gain nearly 300 more points by the
year-end.
Since July 21 this year, when the Footsie hit its recent low of 2814.1, the
index has risen 243.5 points, again with hardly a pause. Any market that
rises that far that fast might need a couple of days' consolidation, though,
as it did on Thursday and Friday this week.
Hughes can find another reason why the equity market is undervalued. He
draws a parallel with the 1930s, a period when companies reduced the
proportion of earnings paid out in dividends, preferring to retain profits
internally as the economy recovered.
This is happening again now, so the market can rise without dividends
increasing as fast as earnings - meaning yields on equities can go lower. A
3.5 per cent yield implies the Footsie at around 3,250. The market is not
expensive at present levels, he says.
So, what of the concern from some companies this week about the fragility of
the economic recovery in the UK and Europe? Argos, the catalogue retailer,
which reported a 39 per cent profit rise to Pounds 13.2m pre-tax for its
first half on Monday, warned that a tough budget could kill the 'fragile
recovery.'
First, the recovery might be more fragile in retailing than elsewhere, given
the competitive state of that sector. Then, the hints about November's
Budget indicate it will not be such a tax-raising exercise as first thought.
The better news on the PSBR helps. The National Institute of Economic and
Social Research predicted taxes would rise by Pounds 2.5bn in the Budget -
but with interest rate cuts, too, that would be neutral for demand.
The other fear is that the continued recession in continental Europe will
hold back UK profits. BICC, the cables company, made this point on Tuesday
when recording a 12 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m.
The figures were depressed by a reduction in profits from its European
business. Similarly, a fall in exports to Europe was blamed for the first
drop in UK car production for 18 months.
But that is yesterday's story. The collapse of the ERM - which has so far
happened in theory, but should happen in practice after the summer holidays
 -will sort that out.
