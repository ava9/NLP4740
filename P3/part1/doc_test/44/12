  [Text] Washington, March 1 KYODO -- The U.S. microchips 
industry accused Japan on Tuesday [1 March] of violating a 1991 
accord on semiconductor trade and sought an "immediate" remedy 
from the U.S. and Japanese Governments. 
  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Japan has 
violated the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, because 
the foreign share of the Japanese microchips market suffered a 
"steady decline" last year. 
  "Consequently, the U.S. Government and the Government of 
Japan must immediately consider all actions needed to ensure 
compliance," the trade group said in a review of the trade pact. 
  The report said the 1991 accord calls for a "gradual, 
steady" 
growth of foreign sales in Japan over a five-year period but the 
foreign share dropped 2.1 percentage points in the first three 
quarters of last year after hitting 20.2 percent of the Japanese 
market in the last quarter of 1992. 
  "The steady decline in the foreign share of the Japanese 
semiconductor market in 1993 violates the 1991 U.S.-Japan 
semiconductor and the 1993 U.S.-Japan framework agreement, which 
requires full implementation of all existing bilateral trade 
agreements," it said. 
  The association, which represents all U.S. semiconductor 
makers, did not say what remedy it seeks from the U.S. 
Government. 
  U.S. charges that Japan violated an earlier version of the 
semiconductor pact concluded in 1986 prompted the U.S. 
Government to levy trade sanctions against Japan in April 1987. 
  The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market 
should 
reach at least 25 to 28 percent by 1996 if the trend of growth 
in the foreign share that has taken place since 1986 is 
maintained over the next four years, the association said. 
  Despite the 2.1 percentage point fall in the foreign share 
of 
the Japanese market last year, the association nevertheless 
acknowledged that the foreign share showed "significant 
progress" in 1993 as a whole over the previous year. 
  If the foreign share for the fourth quarter of 
1993--expected 
to be known in mid-March--maintains the average level of the 
first three quarters, the foreign share will have averaged about 
2.3 percentage points higher in 1993 than in 1992, the report 
said.
