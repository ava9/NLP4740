EXPECTATIONS that the European government bond rally might be losing
momentum proved premature yesterday as prices rose again on thin summer
buying, sending yields to new lows.
Spanish benchmark bond returns broke through 9 per cent while UK gilt yields
approached 7 per cent and French 10-year returns hovered above 6 per cent,
some 4 basis points below their German equivalent.
It was among high yielding markets that the strength was most surprising. A
week ago, Spanish yields were around 9.4 per cent. The 10.3 per cent coupon
maturing in June 2002 rose two points yesterday, sending the yield down to
8.89 per cent.
The Italian market was slightly overshadowed by a L3,500bn seven-year CCT
auction on Monday which failed to fulfil market forecasts. There are more
auctions this week, with offers of three-year, five-year and 10-year paper
adding a further L9,500bn of supply.
Nevertheless, yesterday saw 10-year futures traded in London open 1.25
points higher than Friday's close, catching up with continental Europe's
gains after the UK's Monday bank holiday. The September contract traded
closed at 114.55, a net gain of 80 basis points.
Portugal, the third member of the so-called olive belt markets, saw 10-year
yields fall to 9.5 per cent as Spanish investors bought in the neighbouring
market for the advantage of the nominal yields.
LONG-DATED UK gilts rose sharply, confounding many economists who argue that
the fundamental economic factors that have driven the market are more than
discounted.
The ultra-long end of the yield curve was squeezed  3/4 points higher as
overseas investors sought to buy while domestic institutions remained
sceptical of further gains but were not prepared to sell.
RENEWED strength in French government bonds provided an opportunity for two
sizeable Eurobond issues. Economists said the government and corporate
sectors would take advantage of the low cost of borrowing until investors
began to suffer from indigestion. Tomorrow, the French Treasury will auction
FFr18bn - 20bn of tap stocks.
BELGIAN bonds retreated from earlier highs as the central bank continued its
efforts to shore up the Belgian franc against the D-Mark and left short-term
rates unchanged.
LOW GROWTH, a low inflation outlook and a buoyant US bond market helped
Australian paper to a record close. Ten-year Commonwealth bonds ended 1.5
points firmer.
AFTER dipping on news of stronger than expected revised second-quarter
economic growth, longer-dated US Treasury prices firmed following the
Federal Reserve's coupon pass and the release of a weak Johnson Redbook
store sales report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102
1/8 , yielding 6.092 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 1/16 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent.
In early trading, prices fell after the Commerce Department revised upward
its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 1.8 per
cent, from an initially reported 1.6 per cent. News of a rise in the
National Association of Purchasing Management's August index of
manufacturing activity and in Conference Board's August consumer confidence
index also depressed prices.
The early declines did not last long, however, and by mid-morning
longer-dated securities were ahead. One factor in the rebound was the
realisation that an upward revision in the inventories component of the GDP
data suggests third-quarter growth may be slow as companies choose to run
down stocks to meet demand rather than boost production.
Prices were also aided by the Fed conducting a coupon pass, buying
securities to meet a reserve need tied to the upcoming Labor Day holiday.
Johnson Redbook reporting a drop in August department store sales also
supported prices later in the day.
