FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: A less than stabilising exercise - Global
Investor

In the second half of the 1980s, Japanese investors, encouraged by
government officials, played a remarkable stabilising role in the US
currency and capital markets. Their reward was a domestic equity market
bubble and a crash that rivalled Wall Street's in 1929. Small wonder that
they have been reluctant to repeat the trick in this year's troubled
markets.
Yet with the dollar perking up and the US bond market looking
uncharacteristically cheerful, speculation is mounting that Japanese private
capital outflows are accelerating. Are dollar assets coming back into
fashion? And will UK gilts enjoy some of the leftovers?
The case now being made by many analysts is straightforward enough. With the
three-month interest rate differential between New York and Tokyo at around
four percentage points, there is a powerful incentive to recycle Japanese
capital. Historically, the dollar has always risen when interest rate
spreads have been at this level. Once short-term private flows underpin the
dollar, portfolio capital might be expected to follow into US assets.
Up to a point this has already happened. In the first half of this year
Japanese purchases of foreign bonds, in which the US usually accounts for a
disproportionate share, were running at an annualised rate of Dollars
46.5bn, usefully higher than in 1992 and 1993. Yet in practice the issues
are more complicated than these arguments imply, because of profound
structural upheavals taking place in the capital markets of both the US and
Japan.
If the case for an accelerating outflow from Japan currently looks
plausible, it relates as much to the behaviour of US investors as the
Japanese. In the first half of the year American fund managers led the
foreign stampede into Japanese equities. The inflow, at an annualised rate
of Dollars 95bn, dwarfed long-term Japanese portfolio outflows. This
reflected US investors' new-found enthusiasm for international
diversification.
The Tokyo market, which accounts for a big chunk of the global equity market
capitalisation, did not share in the upturn experienced elsewhere in 1993.
Fund managers were underweight in Tokyo and worried that a rise there would
cause them to underperform badly. They promptly became bigger buyers of
Japanese equities than the Japanese.
Much of this flow seems likely to reverse, because the foreign investors
have allowed themselves to be suckered. For the structure of the Tokyo
market is perfectly designed to make a nonsense of the theory of portfolio
diversification - not least because the market is currently being used, in
true Japanese style, as an instrument of government policy.
Confronted with a banking crisis similar to the one in the US, the Japanese
authorities felt constrained by their experience of the bubble economy from
following the Federal Reserve's approach to restoring bank profits and
capital. Instead of reducing interest rates and encouraging the banks to
invest low-yielding deposits in higher-yielding government bonds, they
rigged the equity market in what is jocularly known in Tokyo as the Price
Keeping Operation. This encouraged overstretched financial institutions to
sell low-yielding equities to invest in higher yielding bonds.
The logic of this operation, perceptively analysed in a recent circular by
Andrew Smithers*, rests on the banking and insurance systems' excessive
exposure to an equity market overvalued on fundamental grounds. The banks
hold equity investments whose value is greater than their own capital. By
selling shares to invest in less risky, higher-yielding assets, they can
usefully reduce exposure to an inflated stock market as they struggle to
overcome their bad debts in property.
So, too, with the Japanese life companies, which are insolvent in the sense
that they have promised policyholders a higher return than than they are
able to earn currently on their investments. They are thus diversifying out
of equities that yield less than 1 per cent into bonds that yield more than
4.5 per cent.
Like the banks, they are able to do so largely thanks to the buying activity
of the state-run postal savings and insurance institutions and the state
pension funds, which have allocated an annual Dollars 57bn for the task. By
a happy accident, foreigners started buying in bulk late last year, just
when these funds were running low. The result is that the market is largely
independent of the economy; and any attempt at a significant equity rally
always runs into heavy selling. To buy Tokyo on the expectation of economic
recovery is thus pointless.
It is doubly pointless, as Andrew Smithers argues, if people allocate
foreign assets on the basis of the standard global market indices, which do
not allow for the overweighting of Japan that arises from the high incidence
of cross-shareholdings.
As foreigners realise they are stabilising Japanese markets for no
satisfactory return, they are bound to repatriate funds - just as the
Japanese did after their experience stabilising US markets. They are almost
certainly doing so already. For their part, the biggest Japanese
institutional investors, the life companies, face new regulatory constraints
in the aftermath of the bubble.
Both equities and foreign bond holdings now carry a capital penalty relative
to domestic bonds. This reduces the attraction of the healthy yield premium
on US Treasuries and UK gilts in a more stable currency environment, which
might otherwise be helpful in addressing the insurance companies' mismatch
of assets and liabilities. In effect, the penalty on foreign holdings gives
life companies a powerful incentive towards short-term trading rather than
long-term investing. It follows that Japanese capital outflows may prove
less stabilising than many hope.
