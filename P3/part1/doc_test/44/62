MR BILL Clinton's landslide victory in the US presidential election failed
to spark a response from investors, and share prices rose on futures-related
arbitrage buying and light bargain hunting, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 211.84 up at the day's high of 17,065.20,
surpassing the psychologically important 17,000 level for the first time in
four trading days. Share prices sagged in the morning on small-lot selling
by foreign investors, and the Nikkei set a low for the day of 16,771.72.
However, shares found support on public funds buying, and index-linked
purchases in last-minute trading boosted the index.
Volume remained flat, at 140m shares after Monday's 144m, as uncertainty
over the domestic economy and corporate earnings still loomed over the stock
market.
Advances led declines by 537 to 327, with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 13.41 at 1,293.85, but in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.58 to 1,040.43.
Traders said Japanese investors were not clear about the implications of the
Democrat victory in the US presidential election. 'Investors will have to
wait for the reaction on Wall Street,' remarked Mr Shin Tokoi at Kidder
Peabody Securities. 'The Japanese do not quite understand what the effects
will be,' said Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Large-capital blue chips were firmer on small-lot bargain hunting by public
pension funds. Nippon Steel put on Y8 to Y293. High-technology issues were
higher in spite of a volatile currency market. Hitachi rose Y18 to Y738 and
Toshiba Y6 to Y598.
Dealers concentrated on speculative theme stocks. Denki Kogyo, the day's
most active issue, advanced Y33 to Y966 on the nuclear fusion theme.
Aids-related Green Cross gained Y20 to Y1,420 and Sumitomo Chemical
appreciated Y8 to Y483.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 130.06 firmer at 18,479.85 in volume of
8.6m shares.
The OSE said trading volume plunged 32.8 per cent in October from the
previous year's level to 315m shares, the lowest since May 1958. Trading of
Nikkei 225 futures contracts fell 12.1 per cent to 760,948 lots.
Roundup
THE majority of the region's equity markets rose after the US presidential
election, mainly on the removal of uncertainty.
HONG KONG was spurred from an early decline to a 2.1 per cent gain, the Hang
Seng index closing a net 127.93 ahead at 6,325.37 after an 84-point decline.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.58bn to HKDollars 3.53bn.
Banks led the rally, HSBC climbing HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 65.50 and
topping the active list, followed by Bank of East Asia, up 75 cents at
HKDollars 36.50.
AUSTRALIA saw a 5.6 per cent gain in News Corp as the All Ordinaries index
ended 18.3 points higher at 1,431.9.
News Corp will announce its quarterly profits at the close of trading today.
The media group rose ADollars 1.50 to ADollars 27.90 as smaller investors
entered the market in the afternoon, on speculation about a pick-up on Wall
Street later in the day.
MANILA moved from weakness to strength and the composite index closed 10.05
higher at 1,362.57. Once again a projected spill-over from Wall Street
accounted for the change of mood.
BANGKOK bought banks heavily, and their gains boosted the SET index by 1.6
per cent, or 14.79, to 956.87 in heavy turnover of Bt18.64bn.
Krung Thai Bank was the most active stock, in turnover of Bt2.38bn,
finishing at Bt310, up Bt28, after hitting its 10 per cent upper daily
limit.
NEW ZEALAND's mood was neutral, although the NZSE-40 index edged further
above its 13-month low to end 5.2 firmer at 1,372.01.
SEOUL rose on active late institutional support, the composite index adding
13.48 at 619.00 in turnover of Won601.5bn (Won483.4bn).

improved 15.59 to 1,421.46 in volume of 183.2m shares, against 156.7m.
TAIWAN fell 1.5 per cent in very sluggish trade, the weighted index ending
53.61 off at 3,506.05 in TDollars 6.92bn turnover.
