Economic Department] 
  [Text] With the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit close at 
hand, Japan and the United States continue to have 
confrontations over the issue of setting "quantitative objective 
criteria" at Japan-U.S. economic framework talks for insurance 
services. That is because Japan is exercising strong 
precautions against the possibility that the United States may 
use the criteria as a numeric target in one sidedly forcing 
Japan to accept foreign-affiliated companies, which want to make 
inroads into the Japanese market. 
  With the summit just around the corner, the United States is 
strengthening its offense. Jeffrey Garten, under secretary of 
commerce, showed his hard-line stance, saying: "We have no 
intention to accept a bad agreement." Richard Gephardt, 
Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, said: 
"Numeric targets are needed (to liberate the Japanese market). 
The targets will become pressure as we seek changes in Japan." 
He is preparing to submit to Congress a bill designed to impose 
sanctions against Japan by onesidedly setting a target and 
thereby forcing Japan to liberate its markets, in case the 
comprehensive talks fail. 
  Together with automobiles and auto parts and government 
procurement, the insurance issue is one of the "three priority 
areas" which the United States is trying to settle in the 
summit, slated for 11 February. However, establishment of the 
"quantitative objective criteria" is the largest cause of the 
deadlock in negotiations for insurance services. Giving 
considerations to Japan's strong resistance, the United States 
is showing its flexible stance, saying that the "criteria is not 
accompanied by retaliation against Japan or a deadline for 
achieving goals." 
  However, when it comes to details of negotiations, the 
United States is trying to force Japan to increase the share of 
foreign- affiliated companies in the Japanese market to the 
level of their market share in other industrialized countries. 
In addition, it is rather obvious that the U.S. aim is to use 
the "quantitative objective criteria" as a lever to open up the 
Japanese markets. 
  Saying that an introduction of the numeric targets, 
including 
market share, runs counter to market liberalization and is 
linked to controlled trade, Japan is maintaining its stance that 
"establishment of the objective criteria, which is linked to an 
introduction of numeric targets, is absolutely unacceptable." 
  Some Finance Ministry officials are criticizing the United 
States, saying: "It will harm consumers' interests if the 
government issues an administrative guidance and recommends the 
consumer buy insurance from foreign-affiliated companies." 
"Establishment of the numeric targets is a lazy man's idea which 
takes no account of corporate efforts." 
  Japan is taking precautions against and showing its almost 
allergic reaction to the idea of setting numeric targets because 
it has gone through bitter experiences, such as the Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor accord. 
  Japan agreed that it would exert efforts to increase the 
share of foreign-made semiconductors to 20 percent in Japanese 
market. However, the U.S. Government and Congress, thinking that 
it was an "international pledge," were obsessed with this figure 
and forced Japan to buy more U.S.-made semiconductors while 
hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan 
if it fails to reach the target. 
  Moreover, Japan is opposing the U.S. negotiations stance, 
which onesidedly concludes that "Japan is a closed market." 
  Certain improvement has been made for individual items of 
the 
insurance services. Among other things, Japan explained its 
plan to study various issues -- including the possibilities of 
securing transparency in issuing government approvals or 
licenses for new products and in setting insurance rates, and 
introducing the broker system, in which brokers can represent 
consumers to sign contracts with insurance companies -- from 
the viewpoint of reforming the overall system. 
  The Finance Ministry will stop its administrative practice 
of 
convoying Japanese industries and try to liberate the insurance 
market through easing government regulations. 
  However, the United States is asking Japan to delay 
liberalization of the so-called "third field" -- market for 
treatment of injuries and diseases, such as "cancer" and 
"Alzheimer's disease" insurance -- because American companies 
have an advantage over Japanese companies in this field in the 
Japanese market. Japan is strongly opposing this U.S. demand, 
saying: "It is obviously contradictory to call for a delay in 
liberalization of the only area where it has vested interests." 
  Opinions of both countries over Japan's "business 
practices only among affiliated companies" are still divided 
with no sign of finding a meeting point. 
  As a U.S. problem, Japan points out the licensing system 
issue, which varies from state to state. In addition, Japan 
also pointed out the following problems: discriminatory measures 
against other countries in the fields of government procurement 
and reinsurance practices, a clause which requires corporate 
executives to be U.S. citizens, and other discriminatory 
measures against foreign- affiliated companies. It seems that 
much more time is needed before both countries can find 
substantial solutions to these problems. 
  As was the case in setting objective criteria, mutual 
distrust underlies the rough going in the negotiations. 
However, the keywords of reaching an agreement are "transparent 
market that is open to domestic and foreign companies," 
"conditions of fair competition," and "expansion of consumers' 
choice." The Governments of Japan and the United States are 
required to iron out the differences.
