HOW SAFE is it for private investors to risk their money in the world's
stock markets? There was some cheer this week when the FT-SE 100 rose nearly
50 points on Wednesday. But the UK market has fallen substantially over the
summer, the Japanese market has been in retreat and the US market, although
strong, is trading on valuations that would deter many British private
investors.
Some think that the world economy is facing one of its deep periodical
crises. Economist Andrew Tylecote spells out the arguments in another
article on this page.
The bears claim the excesses of the 1980s are having their repercussions
now. Companies and consumers are struggling to pay off debt; as a result,
economic growth is sluggish. The problems are widespread.
Japan: The Tokyo market is now 60 per cent below its peak at the end of
1989. Each time foreign investors have proclaimed that the bottom has been
reached, the market has proved them wrong. Successive interest rate cuts,
including one this week, have failed to produce a revival.
Late in the 1980s, many Japanese stocks commanded stratospheric
price-earnings ratios with the market p/e reaching 62 at the end of 1989,
according to Datastream. Even after the recent collapse, the ratio is still
over 30, well above the level prevailing in the UK.
There have been repeated worries that the fall in share prices would cause
problems for Japanese banks, which have large equity holdings. Given the
role that Japanese investors play in the international financial markets, a
banking collapse in Japan could have major repercussions on the world
economy. 'You would have to observe that the risk of a major financial
dislocation rooted in Tokyo is higher today than ever before,' says Nick
Train of GT Management.
Even the Japanese economic miracle is looking tarnished, with only 2 per
cent GDP growth expected for the year - low by historical standards.
Britain: Despite this week's mini-rally, the post-election euphoria has
definitely worn off. Traders assumed that the return of John Major to
Downing Street would restore consumer confidence and spark recovery.
Instead, the chances are that 1992 will see a further decline in GDP.
Meanwhile, the government's options are limited severely. Chancellor Norman
Lamont has stated again and again his commitment to membership of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the present central rate of DM2.95/Pounds . With
the Bundesbank determined to eliminate the inflationary effects of German
reunification, that gives him no scope to cut British interest rates.
The other classic mechanism for reviving an economy, fiscal policy, is
constrained by a budget deficit already close to Pounds 30bn for the present
year.
United States: Although Wall Street has flirted repeatedly with its all-time
high, the economy has struggled to live up to the stock market's optimism.
Successive reductions in interest rates have produced only weak economic
growth, as shown by the 1.4 per cent second-quarter rise in GDP. But with
short-term interest rates not much over 3 per cent, equities still look
attractive vis-a-vis cash. 'US stock prices reflect the most favourable
monetary conditions that have existed for 30 years,' says Bill Smith, equity
strategist at BZW.
With the p/e ratio above 20, some feel that the US market is vulnerable to
bad news, such as a defeat for George Bush in November's election. In view
of all these risks, many cautious investors may feel safer sticking with the
generous real returns available from the building society, gilts or national
savings.
Hardened contrarians may feel that, with all this gloomy news around, this
must be a good time to buy shares. Certainly, the FT All-Share is yielding
more than 5 per cent at the moment, a traditional sign of value in the
equity market. BZW's Smith is looking for lower interest rates and earnings
growth in the UK over the next year. But with the risks so high, only brave
investors would plunge into the equity market. Cautious contrarians might
try the safety-first method of investing via a monthly savings scheme.
