LONG-DATED UK government bonds ended about a quarter of a point higher,
continuing the rally seen on Friday after the release of
better-than-expected inflation figures.
The drop in the headline inflation rate to 1.7 per cent in January, from 2.6
per cent in December, prompted a surge in gilt prices on Friday. Long-dated
issues continued to climb yesterday, and outperformed short-dated gilts,
resulting in a further flattening of the yield curve. Four gilt taps
amounting to Pounds 800m, which were announced by the Bank of England on
Friday afternoon, were sold out yesterday.
The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose  5/16 to 101 1/16 , to yield 8.645 per
cent against 8.676 per cent. Short-dated gilts ended lower or unchanged,
while the Liffe gilt futures contract ended the day unchanged at 102.23,
having been as high as 102.28.
ITALIAN government bonds picked up as political tensions eased and dealers
covered their short positions. Bond prices closed off the highs of the day
on profit-taking.
Hopes that yesterday's auction of three- and five-year bonds would be
well-supported also helped to buoy the market, dealers said, although they
pointed out that most of the demand for the L6,000bn of paper was expected
to come from domestic rather than overseas investors.
On Liffe, the March BTP contract overcame resistance at 96.50 to end the day
at 96.64, compared with Friday's close of 96.35.
THE 30-year Dutch government bond outperformed other issues as public
trading in the stripped bond began yesterday.
The agency for the ministry of finance announced a new market in stripped
30-year bonds - where interest and principal are separated to create zero
coupon bonds - earlier this month. The 30-year bond ended 35 basis points
higher at 104.95 on its first day's trade to yield 7.10 per cent.
The ministry of finance agency said it had allotted Fl 1.8bn of its 7.5 per
cent bond due 2023 for stripping, out of a total of Fl 4.5 bn.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, trading was lacklustre. German government bond prices
moved in a narrow range, as market participants awaited the release of the
January M3 data, as well as this week's repo and the Bundesbank council
meeting on Thursday. With the US markets closed for a national holiday,
dealers said volumes in the European markets were relatively low.
JAPANESE government bonds closed weaker, as investors took profits after
last week's strong rally in the cash and futures markets.
The June futures contract opened at 109.61 and traded down to a low of
109.48 before closing at 109.50. The benchmark No 145 JGB opened with a
yield of 4.205 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day, and
closed at 4.22 per cent. Dealers noted some bond-buying by the Bank of
Japan, but said the market had edged lower on profit-taking.
WITH effect from today, the government bond table will include the Treasury
7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998, instead of the Conversion 10 per cent bond due
1996.
