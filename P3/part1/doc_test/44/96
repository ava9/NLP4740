FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Regions will
diverge as the rally slows - Bonds / The US is out of recession, but Germany
hasn't bottomed. And European markets should be assessed on an individual
basis

SO FAR, it has been a bumper year for international bond investors, and
while the three-year global bond rally appears to be slowing, most observers
say it is still far from over.
Bond yields worldwide have slid sharply, and, amid sluggish growth and high
unemployment, continued disinflationary policies in most countries are
expected to pressure real and nominal yields further, keeping bond prices
firmly supported.
Moreover, given the high valuation of most equity markets, the
attractiveness of fixed-income investments remains intact. 'If you don't buy
bonds, what are you going to buy?' asks Philip Saunders, fixed interest
investment director at Guinness Flight Global Asset Management.
However, increasing regional divergences  - with the US economy well out of
recession, while Germany still hasn't bottomed  - will affect global bonds
and currencies very differently in coming months.
While the the end of the easing cycles in the US and Japan is in sight,
European bonds are likely to benefit from further easing. However, Europe's
markets should be assessed on a more individual basis since August 2, when
the fluctuation bands for most currencies in Europe's exchange-rate
mechanism were widened to 15 per cent.
In many countries, the effective suspension of the ERM brought to light the
fundamentals that the old-style system had masked. A case in point is
Belgium, which was considered a hard-core currency thanks to its peg to the
D-Mark, but whose bond market has come under increasing pressure as its
underlying problems  - spiralling debt and political uncertainty  - have
become more apparent.
Nevertheless, 'Europe still has considerable mileage, partly because real
interest rates are still quite high by historical comparison,' says Mr
Saunders.
For unhedged sterling-based investors, currency considerations indicate that
'they couldn't do much better than by staying in the UK,' says Julian
Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. For one, gilts
offer attractive yields compared with most European core markets. In early
October, the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 yielded some 97 basis points over
Germany's 6.5 per cent Bunds due 2003.
Moreover, Mr Jessop says that, despite higher-than-expected August RPI,
underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued. Lastly, he notes that the
currency is undervalued.
'With economic recovery under way in the UK and most continental economies
in recession, sterling has scope to appreciate against most European
currencies on a three- to six-month view,' agrees Nick Henderson, head of
fixed interest at Gartmore Investment, which manages about Pounds 1.4bn in
its bond funds.
Gartmore's Henderson favours gilts with maturities between seven and 10
years, which, he says, stand to benefit most from further interest-rate
cuts. Although the bulk of issuance is being done at the intermediate part
of the yield curve, the fact that roughly two-thirds of this year's
estimated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is already funded
indicates that the market will absorb further supply with relative ease.
For those investing in currency-hedged funds, other European bond markets
may offer even better returns, however.
Many fund managers are still keen on high-yielding Italian bonds, which have
been Europe's star performer in the past two quarters. The combination of a
weak economy, improving inflation prospects and fiscal tightening is
expected to lead to substantial interest-rate cuts, further boosting bond
prices and narrowing Italian bonds' yield gap over other markets. At the
beginning of the month, Italian 10-year bonds currently yielded some 310
basis points over German bunds and 215 over 10-year gilts.
The only cloud on the Italian horizon is political uncertainty amid the
current budget debate and ahead of national elections, expected next spring.
However, the market is widely expected to recover from any sell-off,
supported in the long term by its solid fundamentals.
Some 25 per cent of Guinness Flight's Dollars 25m European bond fund is
invested in Italy, says Mr Saunders. Another quarter is invested in Ecu
bonds, which 'trade in a similar fashion to French bonds but offer a
reasonable yield pick-up.' Some 40 per cent of the fund's currency exposure
is in sterling, 40 per cent is in Italian lire and 20 per cent in Swedish
kronor.
TO INVESTORS shying away from Europe's higher-risk high-yielders, French
bonds still offer an attractive alternative among the hard-core markets.
Bond strategists at UBS expect French bonds to outperform Germany, with the
yield on French 10-year bonds seen falling as much as 30 basis points below
its German counterpart as the Bund rally stalls.
In many markets, the absence of inflationary pressures, prospects for a
sustained period of low short-term rates andinvestors' desire to boost their
returns will act as powerful incentives for moving along the yield curves,
note economists at SG Warburg Securities.
Meanwhile, many investors are reducing their bond exposure to the US and
Japan. The two markets make up only 20 per cent of Guinness Flight's global
bond fund, with European bond markets accounting for the remaining 80 per
cent, though the fund's currency exposure is dollar-oriented, with 65 per
cent exposed to the dollar bloc, 10 per cent in yen and the rest in a mix of
European currencies.
