  [Text] A stronger yen and a probable rise in US interest 
rates could solve some of Thailand's economic problems, says 
Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham. 
  The weakness of the U.S. dollar, stemming from a lack of 
coordinated efforts among central banks and heavy selling by 
foreign-exchange traders anticipating intervention, is creating 
pressure for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. 
  "The economy needs cooling," said Mr Phisit. 
  He said inflationary pressure in Thailand is manageable. The 
Bank of Thailand is expected to meet next month, however, to 
re-evaluate the situation based on higher crude oil prices and 
stronger than expected export performance. 
  Several Thai bankers estimate the Thai inflation rate to be 
close to 5 percent, a percentage point higher than the central 
bank's target of 4 percent. 
  Mr Phisit said a Bank of Thailand study found that interest 
costs amount to a small portion of Thai corporations' total 
business costs, and the effect of higher interest rates, 
approximately a quarter-points above the current rate, may not 
be severe. 
  A rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve would affect the 
Thai 
financial system and naturally push rates here higher, said Mr 
Phisit. "The increases are in the range expected by Thai 
businesses." 
  Higher inflation bought on by higher oil prices would be 
partially offset by higher foreign currency earnings, gained 
from exports that have outperformed the central bank's target, 
he said. 
  The baht has also strengthened against the dollar, standing 
yesterday at 25.05, the strongest in 18 months. Oil prices are 
quoted in dollars and Thailand tends to source lower-cost crude 
oil. Local refining capacity increases have also lessened the 
impact, said Mr Phisit. 
  On the trade picture, Mr Phisit said in the long run, a 
strong yen could force Thai importers to turn to other 
countries, while exports to Japan could benefit. Since Thailand 
is currently a net importer from Japan, however, increased 
import costs could add to the inflationary pressure in the 
medium term. 
  The net impact is the question, said Mr Phisit. 
  "Consumption of imports could decrease and locally 
manufactured products increase," he said. Thais' propensity to 
consume imported goods from Japan, has shown little sign of 
change in the past, however. 
  A recent Bangkok Bank economic forecasting model predicted 
that since the U.S. economy is primarily driving the world's 
economic growth, a U.S. slowdown could translate to a drop in 
Thailand's GNP growth, below the central bank's estimate of 
8-8.2 percent. 
  Japan's economy is showing signs of strength, however, and 
could supplement the U.S. as a market for Thai goods. Japan's 
economy, surprising most economist with a 3.9 percent annualized 
growth rate in the first quarter of 1994, saw its growth 
prospects increase even in a strong yen environment. 
  And with an economy that depends on exports to the U.S., the 
Japanese central bank had been supporting the dollar in an 
effort to reduce the pressure on Washington to increase interest 
rates. 
  Meanwhile, Thai Farmers Bank's executive vice-president 
Sombun Chinsawanon said the volatility in the international 
foreign-exchange market, where the yen is appreciating against 
the dollar and the Deutsche mark, is unlikely to make a strong 
impact on the Thai economy as a whole. 
  He said the sector that will be affected directly is 
external 
trade, particularly exports to the U.S. where exporters have to 
hedge themselves against foreign-exchange risks, making export 
prices higher. 
  But Thailand will benefit from exporting to Europe and Japan 
if they quote their prices in marks and yen respectively. 
Overall, the positive impact from exporting to Europe and Japan 
will outweigh the negative impact on exports to the US. 
  "Overall, Thailand will not be losing from the situation," 
he 
said. 
  The yen yesterday rose as high as 99 to the dollar. 
  During the past two weeks, the baht has appreciated 12 
satang 
against the dollar from 25.16 to 25.04. 
  Mr Sombun said the sudden weakening of the U.S. dollar 
stemmed from the recent series of rate increases by the Fed.
