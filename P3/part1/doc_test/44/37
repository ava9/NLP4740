JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. SHOULD FOLLOW EC'S TURNAROUND LEAD

<P>
If we could see ourselves as others see us, as the poet Robert Burns put it, we 
might make sense of the contradictions swirling around the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush and Congressional leaders began emergency talks 
on the federal budget deficit Tuesday, even as the stock market hit yet another 
historic high. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the stock market is rising because U.S. interest rates are headed 
lower, but the budget summit is occurring because interest rates have stayed 
high this year, when budget planners had counted on them being a full 
percentage point lower. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the government's interest payments on the national debt may 
rise by $30 billion to more than $200 billion. That's right, $200 billion in 
interest. The understandable fear in Washington is that the deficit may be out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
What does it all mean? You won't find out by looking at the U.S. economy in 
isolation but only by seeing it as part of the mosaic of the world economy. And 
there the news is challenging, yet hopeful -- the U.S. faces a crisis of 
confidence related to the government's handling of the budget deficit but could 
turn the situation around the way Europe did in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The old continent is now the chief attraction for global business investment -- 
with $10 billion a year flowing from Japan alone -- just as the United States 
attracted such investment in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, investment is being diverted from Latin America and the U.S.," 
says Peter Rogge, senior vice president of Swiss Bank Corp. And investment in 
Europe is only increased by the opening of Eastern Europe. The result, says the 
Swiss Banker, is that global demand for investment capital has made interest 
rates 1.5 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. 
</P>
<P>
So the U.S. deficit has been hit by a double whammy -- the foreign investment 
that made it easier to finance the deficit in the '80s is no longer flowing 
this way, and Europe's demand for investment capital is keeping interest rates 
relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, says Rogge, that pattern may continue for at least five years -- with 
the West German economy growing 6% a year and many of the other European 
countries growing 4% -- compared to slower growth, perhaps 2% a year, for the 
U.S. economy, in the estimate of Swiss bankers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a picture of a changing world. At those rates, the combined economies of 
the 10-nation European Community will be as large as the U.S. economy in five 
years -- with Japan third, at roughly 60% the size of the United States or 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than worrying about waning influence, the United States would do 
better to look where Europe came from. Half a dozen years ago, Europe's 
economies were moribund and lagging in investment -- which was then flowing to 
America. "The world thought Europe's only future would be as a theme park for 
visiting Japanese business people," says Peter Sutherland, a former member of 
the European Commission, the EC's ruling body, and now chairman of Allied Irish 
Bank in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
But the Europeans woke up. In 1984, at a conference outside Paris, the EC 
nations set a goal of true economic union by 1992 and have been working toward 
that vision ever since. Yet investment capital started flowing immediately 
after they set the goal, says Sutherland. "Capital is an incident of 
confidence, really," he says. "If there is confidence, investment follows." 
</P>
<P>
Which is just the point. Capital seems very scarce in America these days. Both 
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Sen. James 
Sasser (D-Tenn), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, talk of a "capital 
shortage." 
</P>
<P>
But confidence also seems in short supply. Swiss banker Rogge, who has visited 
America for years, says he misses the old dynamism. "I find American business 
people skeptical these days -- skeptical that prosperity will continue 
indefinitely, skeptical that U.S. industry is really competitive . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for that? Observers foreign and domestic trace the problem to the 
budget deficit, which they see in terms of national will more than economics. 
</P>
<P>
The Economist magazine calls the U.S. deficit "an unmistakable symptom of a 
dishonest political culture." Its strong words refer to all the tricks of 
off-budget financing, use of Social Security funds and borrowing from abroad 
that U.S. administrations have used to mask the true size and impact of the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And Herbert Stein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says 
the budget deficit -- by limiting funds for private industry -- curbs growth in 
U.S. investment, productivity and incomes. Stein, 73, says the idea that the 
United States lacks capital is nonsense. "In an economy with a gross national 
product of $5.5 trillion, it is not credible that we do not have the money to 
deal with our national and social needs," he says. But Stein blames cowardly 
politicians, afraid to raise taxes or cut programs for people who are not poor 
-- including many elderly -- for sapping of the nation's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the diverted flow of foreign money and the deficit's frightening 
rise may force a change. The aftermath of the budget summit will likely see 
some higher taxes -- possibly a gasoline tax, although not the 50 cents a 
gallon that Easterners call for and Westerners oppose. Alcohol and tobacco will 
be taxed. Changes in Social Security taxes and capital gains will be closely 
argued, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Will taxes be bad for the economy? Not if they represent an honest attempt to 
narrow the budget deficit. The very action itself could restore confidence, 
bring down interest rates and spur investment. The rising stock market may be a 
hopeful sign -- but then it had better be. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. Six years ago, as EC commissioners gathered near Paris, 
the rest of the world thought Europe was finished -- but it is disproving that 
judgment. Now many people and nations think the United States is in decline. 
Whether they can be disproved may depend on Americans asking why they think 
that way.
