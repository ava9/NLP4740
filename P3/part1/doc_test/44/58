FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan's chip makers get down to brass
tacks - The American industry sees changing attitudes

THE US semiconductor industry could not have hoped for a more positive
outcome from last week's semiconductor talks in Japan. After more than 10
years' efforts to beat down the door to the Japanese semiconductor market,
the US industry has now obtained a public pledge from its Japanese
counterparts on measures to speed purchase of foreign semiconductors.
The new pledges could be a turning point. Before the talks, the Japanese had
said they were already doing everything possible to boost purchases of
foreign-made chips. Yet now the 10 biggest buyers have agreed to release to
US companies for the first time detailed semiconductor purchase plans
normally protected as commercial secrets. The change is not simply a result
of the Japanese side opening its eyes after seeing the stagnation of foreign
chip sales in Japan for the past two years. Rather, the Japanese now face a
US industry with strong political backing in Washington and the
all-important support of the US computer industry, raising the real
possibility that trade sanctions may be imposed if the market share of
foreign companies does not rise significantly from the 14.4 per cent
recorded at the end of 1991.
The US and Japan agreed last year that this share should rise to 20 per cent
by the end of this year. The Japanese say the 20 per cent was not a promise
or pledge, but anger is growing in Washington that no progress has been made
toward reaching the target. An inter-agency study of the agreement's
implementation, under Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, is due for
publication in August, when the US election campaign will be moving into
high gear. The Japanese need to show quickly that the agreement was more
than an empty pledge.
'I believe Japanese companies are concerned that sanctions are right behind
(if nothing happens),' said Mr James Norling, president of Motorola's
semiconductor group and vice-chairman of the US Semiconductor Industry
Association. Beyond the threat of government action, big Japanese groups
have more reason than ever to co-operate and boost US chip sales in Japan,
since the balance of commercial power between the Japanese and US
semiconductor industries has shifted. Mr Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI
Logic, said: 'The big guys who can pull this off are the ones to benefit if
trade relations improve, and lose most if trade friction heats up.'
In past years, Mr Corrigan and Mr Norling say, the Japanese industry was in
a stronger position. Japanese companies gave a terrible thrashing to the US
industry as they strove to achieve complete domination over the market for
dynamic random access memory chips, a key memory device used in all personal
computers and a whole range of electronic devices. But after driving several
US companies out of the field, Japan's victory has proved pyrrhic. A rapid
rise in output of high-capacity memory chips in Korea and Taiwan has helped
to drive down world prices to a point where Japanese companies are unable to
make returns on their investment. In recent weeks, Japan's big chip
producers have reported steep declines in profits as a result.
Also, the US hold on the products such as microprocessors has grown tighter.
Mr Corrigan says: 'The good parts of the business are extremely intellectual
property intensive.' This where the US companies excel. But growing US
industry confidence is tempered by a degree of scepticism toward the latest
Japanese pledge to increase chip imports. A huge surge would have to occur
in Japanese orders for foreign semiconductors over the next two months to
have an effect on trade data before the US inter-agency review is completed.
No guarantee can be made that US chip sales in Japan will rise, but clearly,
the big Japanese purchasers are determined to break the deadlock. The
Electronic Industries Association of Japan is to tell its 62 members to
increase purchases of US chips faster than for Japanese chips as the market
enters its expected recovery phase later this year. Under the industry
agreement forged in Tokyo, the Semiconductor Industry Association of the US
will publish a monthly index of Japanese orders, providing a more timely
indicator of the market share trend than the quarterly market share figure
put out by the US and Japan.
This will enhance the ability of the US industry and government to respond.
The Japanese industry efforts are being welcomed as a positive development
by US industry executives. But concern still exists that the 'emergency
measures' may be short-lived and serve only to delay a US government
decision on retaliatory sanctions until after the November election. Another
flaw is that the new measures do not involve smaller Japanese chip
purchasers. The US side is now counting on the biggest 10 companies, who
account for 50 per cent of the market, to do more than their share. Most of
these companies already buy over 20 per cent of their chips from foreign
companies; they may now have to push this higher to stop the trade row
growing.
Mr Shinichi Itoh, vice-president at NEC, the Japanese electronics company,
said access to the market would also be improved for European makers, but
nothing specific was on offer. Mr Corrigan poured scorn on European
complaints that the US was getting preferential access. 'Enthusiasm of the
European companies to penetrate the Japanese market does not seem high.'
European companies could not complain while protected by a 14 per cent
tariff barrier.
