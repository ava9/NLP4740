FT  24 SEP 94 / Season of risk and fearfulness: Why financial markets are
nervous

Summer is over and so, it seems, is the rally in world equity markets. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was close to its all-time high on
September 15, suffered its biggest one-day fall for six months on Tuesday.
With the arrival of autumn, traditionally the season for equity market
upsets, fears have revived that share prices may be heading for a sharp
decline.
As has often been the case this year, bond markets have led the way. The
yield on the 30-year US Treasury bond rose to 7.79 per cent this week,
compared with 7.49 per cent a month ago and 5.78 per cent at the trough in
October 1993. In the UK, 10-year gilt yields are approaching 9 per cent.
Viewed from the perverse standpoint of financial markets, economic growth is
the prime culprit for recent weakness. The continued recovery in the US and
the UK, the growing signs of a pick-up in continental Europe and the hopes
for an improvement in Japan are good news for the populations of the
countries concerned. But bond markets dislike strong economic growth, as it
usually leads to inflation, which erodes the real value of fixed-income
investments. They thus demand a higher yield to compensate them for the
additional inflation risk.
Thus the recent rise in bond yields (and fall in bond prices) was sparked by
signs of continued US economic vigour. 'It had looked as if third-quarter
GDP in the US would be quite soft, but a number of recent statistics have
shown strength,' says Mr Peter Lyon, chief strategist at London securities
house Smith New Court. US factories operated at 84.7 per cent of capacity in
August, the highest level since April 1989, while August retail sales
recorded a month-on-month gain that was larger than expected at 0.8 per
cent.
Bond markets have fallen faster than equity markets this year. The result is
that, in yield terms, equities look expensive relative to bonds compared
with historical averages.
This could simply reflect the possibility that bond markets are
overestimating future inflation. If so, bond yields ought to fall to reduce
the yield differential. If not, equity yields need to rise substantially -
and share prices to fall - to restore ratios to more reasonable levels.
Meanwhile, the view has been gaining ground that the world interest rate
cycle has turned - reinforced by the increase in UK short-term rates last
week, from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent.
At the start of the year, there was a belief that, while US rates might
rise, there was still scope for short-term rates in other countries,
particularly in Europe, to fall. But as the graph from James Capel shows, a
weighted average of short-term interest rates across the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations has been steadily rising since the start of the
year. A rise in interest rates is often bad news for equities, because it
increases corporate costs and makes holding cash more attractive relative to
owning shares.
But is the recent weakness in bond and equity markets a blip, or part of a
long-term bear market which effectively began when the US Federal Reserve
first raised interest rates in February?
It is possible to construct a bearish argument from two radically different
analyses of the economic outlook. The first, and more conventional, view is
that inflation will return with a vengeance as the world's economies start
to recover. Recent increases in commodity prices, which have caused the
Economist commodity price index to rise by 41.8 per cent over the past year,
are an early warning sign.
The dividend yield offered by the big equity markets is quite low in
historical terms. The Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index yields just 2.41
per cent, compared with an average of 3.6 per cent since 1979; meanwhile the
FT-A All-Share yields 3.96 per cent, against its post-1979 average of 4.7
per cent.
While both might be reasonable in terms of current levels of inflation, any
inflationary rebound would prompt investors to demand higher yields, forcing
share prices down.
The alternative analysis is that the authorities are underestimating the
deflationary forces present in the economy, resulting largely from the heavy
debt incurred by the corporate and personal sectors in the 1980s. According
to this view, the authorities are increasing interest rates too soon, and by
too much, which will cause economic growth to slow and corporate earnings to
disappoint.
According to Mr Robin Aspinall of broker Panmure Gordon, the sharp fall in
interest rates in the early 1990s released a temporary flow of liquidity,
boosting narrow measures of money supply and causing money to flow into
bonds and equities from cash.
'Businesses, forecasters, politicians and markets have been deluded into
believing this wave could last forever,' says Mr Aspinall. 'It is headed for
a wipe out as it eventually crashes against the greater inertia of slow
growth and low inflation dictated by the debt background.'
Mr Michael Hughes, global strategist at BZW, argues: 'There is a great
danger that monetary policy is getting too tight. The authorities aren't
injecting enough liquidity, and markets are the casualty.'
Shares may be trading on price-earnings ratios (the yardstick analysts use
to compare share prices to corporate profits) that do not take account of
the growth slowdown expected by this school. Only this week, London merchant
bank Kleinwort Benson cut its forecast for UK earnings growth in 1995 to 8
per cent. If that kind of forecast is right, a price-earnings ratio of 17.7
on the FT-A All-Share Index makes UK equities look rather expensive.
But most believe any significant downturn in world equity markets would have
to start on Wall Street. Mr Hughes thinks there is a strong risk of a crash
in the US and 'the idea of 3,000 on the Dow Jones (compared with Thursday's
close of 3,837) isn't out of the question'. He cites the high involvement of
US banks in securities lending as a main source of risk.
Others point to the political problems likely to be faced by President Bill
Clinton if, as some expect, the Democrats lose control of the Senate after
the mid-term elections in November. Although financial markets are no lovers
of Mr Clinton, gridlock in Washington would cause uncertainty about the
direction of US economic policy.
Some dismiss these fears, arguing that they simply represent the 'wall of
worry' that all bull markets have to climb. Such optimists see the decline
in financial markets as a panic response to inflationary indicators. Despite
all the talk of inflationary pressures, the annual rate across the European
Union in August was just 3.1 per cent. In the US, the annual rate of
inflation in August was 2.9 per cent. Real bond yields (nominal yields minus
inflation) are thus extremely high in historical terms.
These yields have risen so sharply, according to Mr Keith Skeoch, James
Capel's chief economist, because the peak in short-term interest rates and
inflation in this cycle is not yet visible. This has caused investors to
demand a higher 'risk premium' in return for holding bonds.
'At some point, this premium gets overdone and you get a return to
sensibility,' Mr Skeoch says. Once bond yields have stabilised, he argues,
equities can resume an upward path.
But the bulls may face an early test of their optimism on Tuesday, when the
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets in Washington. Former Fed
governor Mr Wayne Angell says the committee is likely to push up interest
rates by a further half a percentage point. The meeting's outcome will set
the tone for what could be a nervous autumn in the markets.
