The last quarter has been a subdued one for the investment trust industry,
after the frenzied activity of the last few months of 1993 and the first
month or two of this year.
Investment trust share prices have taken a tumble, along with most world
stock markets, since the shock of the rise in US interest rates in February.
The FT-SE investment trust index has fallen by about 17 per cent since the
February peak, but is still up on the year.
Similarly, the average investment trust discount, which hit a 20-year low of
around 4 per cent in January, has widened to fluctuate in the band of
roughly 7 to 9 per cent over the past few months. At the beginning of July,
it was at the lower end of this range, and showed signs of possibly widening
further. However, to put this in perspective, in July last year the average
discount was more than 10 per cent.
'The second quarter has been relatively unexciting,' says Philip Middleton,
of brokers Smith New Court. 'The febrile conditions of the three months
before it have evaporated. But it was far stronger than most quarters I can
remember in terms of new-issue activity.'
New trust launches consisted mostly of highly-specialised single-country
funds - the last three months have seen the launch of the first ever
UK-listed investment trusts concentrating on India, South Africa and Italy,
for example.
The response to Fleming's India fund showed that there was still money out
there looking for a home, but investors have become far more selective. The
Pounds 84m the trust pulled in through a placing and public offer was short
of its original Pounds 100m target, but still a respectable total by any
standards other than those of the overheated market in the first couple of
months of this year.
Japan has been another bright spot in the past few months. Existing trusts
have been trading at premiums, and there have been a number of successful
new fund launches this year. Schroders raised Pounds 125m for its Japan
Growth Fund, which was modestly oversubscribed. Schroders' existing
expertise in the area - it runs several Japanese unit trusts - helped boost
investors' confidence, in addition to the widely-held view that Tokyo was
one of the few stock markets likely to see much growth this year.
The most heavily marketed new issue of the quarter has to be 3i, the venture
capital fund - something of an oddity in the investment trust sector.
It is the largest investment trust ever launched, with a total market
capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn at the offer price, although only Pounds
711m-worth of shares were offered to institutions and the public. Unlike
most new investment trusts, it has been operating for decades and came to
market merely to float its existing portfolio, rather than raise new money.
The quarter also featured a few disappointments. Murray Johnstone was forced
to abandon its planned launch of a smaller-company and venture capital
trust, after it had become clear during the initial launch period that there
was insufficient demand. Analysts blamed the problem on a combination of
factors, largely the generally unsettled market conditions and also a recent
flurry of smaller company fund launches. The imminent arrival of 3i on the
market may also have overshadowed Murray Johnstone's much smaller offering.
Johnson Fry had hoped to repeat the success of its two split-capital
utilities trusts with a third split-capital trust specialising in European
utilities. But rather than the Pounds 100m it hoped to raise, it attracted
only Pounds 15m, some of which was generated internally. One factor in this
disappointing result may have been that it sounded too similar to the two
European privatisation trusts, which have not been as much of an immediate
success as people had expected.
As usual, among existing trusts, some sectors did better than others in the
poor market conditions. Those which fell more than expected may now offer
good value, while those which held up better than average could look
overpriced for new investors.
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst with SG Warburg, warns in particular
that the share prices of many split-capital trusts are artificially inflated
at the moment. They have not fallen as far or as fast as the rest of the
market, and this has led to anomalies such as the gross redemption yields on
some income shares being less than those of gilts; whereas normally they
would be at least two percentage points higher, to reflect their greater
risk.
Aaron says this may be because people are buying solely for the immediate
yield, and not taking into account total returns. Philip Middleton agrees.
'It is a very inefficiently priced market. Most people don't understand
split-capital shares.'
Other high-income or income growth trusts have also held up relatively well
in the falling market, for similar reasons: the headline yield figure
attracts investors who do not look at all the relevant factors.
Market anomalies can work both ways, however. Middleton points out that some
general Far Eastern trusts could be worth a look at the moment, as they can
offer a substantial amount of Japanese exposure while trading at a fairly
wide discount, but specialist Japanese trusts are often at a premium.

trusts, based on performance over the past five years, are on pages 30 and
