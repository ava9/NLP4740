FT  21 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate optimism lifts equities

THE PROSPECT of an imminent easing in German monetary policy, leading to a
round of interest rate reductions across Europe, provided the impetus for
another major upward move by UK equities.
The Footsie 100 index burst through the 2,600 level, closing 54.8 up at
2,617.0, its best closing point since September 24 when the equity market
peaked after the Government took sterling out of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism.
Adding to a generally bullish mood in the markets was a feeling that the
Conservative government may have ridden out the political storm caused by
its pit closure plan, now much watered down by Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the Board of Trade.
The hint of cuts in German interest rates were quickly picked up by the
foreign exchange markets where sterling rose sharply against the dollar and
the D-Mark and short sterling was indicating a downward shift to 7 per cent
interest rates.
Many observers are now forecasting an acceleration of interest rate cuts in
the UK after the latest set of economic data pointed to a deepening of the
recession. The smaller than expected rise in the money supply figures for
September, plus the weakest set of building society lending figures since
the recession began, were interpreted as a sign that there is no recovery.
One senior trader expected a re-run in the UK of the Wall Street phenomenon
of the past year; a weak economy to which the Federal Reserve responded with
a series of interest rate cuts, which in turn boosted the US stock market.
The market was on the move from the outset, responding to a good performance
by Wall Street and sterling's strength. The main thrust for the equity
market came from the derivatives markets, where the Footsie future powered
ahead to reach a 60-point premium over the cash market very early in the
day. The future maintained a 40-point premium throughout a very active
session in which heavy index arbitrage activity was a big feature.
Dealers said a growing expectation that the government will emerge intact
from the debate over pit closures was another bull point for the market.
Institutional buying was thin during the morning but picked up sharply
during the afternoon, with dealers reporting considerable interest from
overseas investors.
The Footsie 100 opened over 12 points higher and never looked back, bursting
through 2,600 in mid-session and reaching the day's peak of 2,617.5 before
dipping just before the close. A firm opening by Wall Street after the final
Presidential debate between the three candidates, gave a further fillip to
the market.
After yesterday's rise, even the most aggressive bulls expect the market to
attract profit-taking. More cautious strategists continue to point to the
fundamental weakness of the UK economy, the prospect of disappointing
earnings numbers and more downgrades.
Turnover picked up yesterday, reaching 631.1m shares, but the fragility of
the London market was underlined by news of more job losses in the
securities business; the London arm of Nomura, the Japanese stockbroking
firm, cut around 50 jobs yesterday.
