A strong two-way pull developed in London with a sharp downgrading of market
forecasts offset by a surprise half-percentage point reduction in German
interest rates and good economic news from the US.
The upshot of was that the FT-SE 100 index reversed a fairly harsh
mid-morning slide, made rapid progress on the German interest rate reduction
and good economic news from the US, then eased off to close a net 7.6 higher
at 3,425.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 ended the day 3.7 higher at 4,054.3.
Mr Nick Knight, market strategist at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker,
put paid to an early rise in the London equity market. Opening around six
points higher in the wake of Wall Street's overnight rise and a better
showing by the Hong Kong market, the FT-SE 100 index began to falter as news
filtered into the market that the Nomura strategist had cut his 1994 FT-SE
100 year-end forecast by 500 points to 3,500.
Mr Knight caused flurries of uncertainty across most markets at the end of
last week after forecasting a bout of short-term turbulence across global
markets.
The Nomura stockbroker said yesterday that he felt investors in UK equities
should sell into strength, forecasting deterioration in UK inflation, the
trade deficit, sterling and both short- and long-term interest rates.
As the Nomura story spread throughout the market, the FT-SE 100 retreated to
a session low of 3,404.5, a fall of 13.2 in mid-morning.
However, the market embarked on a good rally and staged a strong upwards
move during lunchtime after the Bundesbank wrong-footed many market
observers and cut its discount rate by half a percentage point to 5.25 per
cent, the first cut since last October.
The German move encouraged London dealers who said the decision could hasten
another reduction in UK rates. Shortly afterwards there was good economic
news from the US where inflation was unchanged in January, heading off fears
that US interest rates may have needed to rise again in the short term.
At its best the FT-SE 100 was almost 20 points higher, at 3,437.6, but it
later subsided in the face of some determined profit-taking to close well
off the day's best levels.
Mr Edmond Warner, equity market strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the
integrated securities house, said he viewed the German rate cut and the US
economic news as providing a good short-term buying opportunity in the UK
market.
The key, Mr Warner said, was to buy the market after a correction. He said
the corporate results season so far has provided plenty of good news.
Mr Ian Harnett, market strategist at Strauss Turnbull, said the German cut
was a pleasant surprise for the market and there was now scope for further
UK cuts later in the year. He cautioned, however, that the market was still
waiting for news of a sustained earnings revival and was tending to move
sideways.
The German news was seen as encouraging for the likes of Redland and RMC,
building groups with a big exposure to Germany. There were also hints that
big activity in options and via the inter-dealer broker screens could herald
strategic stake-building or even full-scale takeover activity in Blue
Circle.
Turnover in equities was a disappointing 701m shares, while customer
business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 1.62bn.
