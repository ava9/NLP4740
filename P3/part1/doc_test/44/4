CHASTENED by the failures of its economic forecasting team over the past few
years, the OECD has decided to offer alternative scenarios for economic
growth in its latest economic outlook.
Its baseline forecast suggests a modest world recovery over the coming year,
although most of the rise in growth rates is expected to occur outside
Europe. But the organisation has also provided gloomier alternatives for the
pessimists.
The OECD's baseline forecast is hardly optimistic. The US economy is
expected to grow by 2.4 per cent in 1993, a mere 0.6 percentage points
higher than this year. Japanese economic growth is also expected to pick up
to 2.3 per cent in the year. But Europe is the laggard with growth of just
1.4 per cent.
The main downside risk, according to the OECD, is that the effects of debt
deflation, which have undermined the organisation's forecasts over the past
year, may persist and even intensify in the short term. The OECD's baseline
projections assume that the recent caution of US and Japanese consumers will
taper off during 1993. But this could well prove too optimistic,
particularly in Japan where the adjustment process started later. In the
OECD's alternative scenario, Japanese domestic demand weakens by 1 per cent
of gross domestic product while US private consumption also falls by 1 per
cent of GDP, equivalent to a half percentage point rise in the US household
savings rate.
The effect on overall growth is assumed to be mitigated by a larger than
expected fall in short-term interest rates as inflationary pressures remain
subdued. The OECD currently expects US short-term interest rates to fall to
3.1 per cent in 1993, from an average 3.4 per cent his year, before rising
to 4 per cent in 1994. But its pessimistic scenario assumes a fall to 2.9
per cent in both 1993 and 1994.
The result is to reduce next year's US growth rate by 1.1 percentage points
relative to the baseline forecast for 1993, and Japanese growth by 0.9
percentage points. The spillover effects from this sluggish growth are
assumed to reduce the German growth rate by 0.2 percentage points and growth
in OECD Europe, excluding Germany, by 0.1 percentage points.
Yet too fast a US recovery could bring problems of a different sort. The
International Bank Credit Analyst, in its latest annual outlook, worries
that the combination of the US fiscal deficit and the low level of private
savings could mean that anything more than a sluggish recovery will be
choked off by higher interest rates.
The mechanism by which this rise in interest rates could occur is a loss of
confidence in the US dollar among foreign investors. The IBCA highlights how
dependent the US is on foreign investors - the cumulative US current account
deficit since 1970 amounts to Dollars 925bn, more than 15 per cent of
current US GDP. The improvement in the US current account deficit recently
has made only a small dent in that debt, as the chart shows.
Too fast a US recovery is the most likely way to frighten foreign investors,
the IBCA says. 'The already deteriorating current account would widen
sharply if the economy accelerates and the US would have to rely on foreign
savings to a much greater extent. This may not be possible unless US
interest rates rise sharply and that would probably abort the recovery.'
The UK, currently lumbered with a proportionately larger current account
deficit than the US as a percentage of GDP, faces a similar balance of
payments problems. But for the rest of Europe the most serious risk is that
German wage inflation will prove more stubborn than expected and German
interest rates will remain high.
The OECD's baseline forecast assumes that German short-term rates will fall
to 7.8 per cent next year from 9.4 per cent this year, and then decline to
6.5 per cent in 1994. But what if German wage inflation is 1 percentage
point higher than expected? The OECD guesses that German interest rates will
remain above 8 1/2 per cent next year, in which case its growth rate will
fall by a full percentage point, dragging the rest of Europe down with it.
