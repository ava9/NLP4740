THE D-MARK continued to show signs of weakness against most currencies
yesterday, allowing sterling to break through the DM2.52 barrier at one
point, and falling to new lows against the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's trading brought little in the way of fresh news to the market.
However, the D-Mark continued to trend downwards at the end of a week which
has brought Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty and new
confidence in European Monetary Union. Inside the European exchange rate
mechanism, the French franc again broke below the FFr3.37 level against the
German currency and closed at FFr3.365, despite the fact that most of the
French market remained on holiday.
The Dutch guilder also broke through to a new 5-year high against the German
currency, moving from NFl 1.1230 to a London close of NFl 1.120.
By the close of trading, the guilder was some 59 basis points higher than
the D-Mark in the ERM grid.
Another indication of the D-Mark's softness was the fall in its ERM
divergence indicator from minus 17 percentage points to minus 23 percentage
points. It was 38 basis points above the weakest currency, the French franc.
However, the D-Mark could recover next week if provisional data for consumer
price inflation in Germany indicate lower annual inflation.
The dollar benefited from the D-Mark's general softness to close 1.4
pfennigs up on the day at DM1.6275. But sterling and the yen moved higher
against the D-Mark as a result of special factors.
Sterling broke through the DM2.52 level, peaking at DM2.5215 following
retail price inflation figures that were a little better than the market had
expected. However, it later succumbed to profit-taking to close at DM
2.5075, down  1/4 pfennig on the day.
A good inflation figure would normally raise speculation of another base
rate cut, weakening the currency. But Mr Mark Austin, an economist at
Midland Global Markets in London, said the figure underlined that the
government's inflation target was intact - and that this compounded the
general confidence in the UK authorities following the Maastricht
ratification vote in the House of Commons.
The Japanese currency also moved strongly against the D-Mark, closing at
Y67.90. from a previous Y68.53. The yen is likely to remain on the firm side
in the run-up to next week's trade talks between the US and Japanese
government. In the wake of this week's very poor US trade figures, there are
expectations that the US authorities will again push Tokyo into a strong yen
policy.
