NEVER SELL the stock market when interest rates are going down
significantly, however awful the prospects for individual companies might
appear to be.
A year ago, therefore, I thought it right to be modestly bullish about the
UK stock market, even though I did not believe that there would be any
economic recovery in 1992. I thought we were heading for a serious currency
crisis and, indeed, I suggested that after a quiet 1991 for the European
exchange rate mechanism, the ensuing year would present immense challenges
to the whole system.
So much for the broad picture, but the details were not so easy to foresee.
For instance, German short-term interest rates proved even slower to come
down than I expected, and DM money market rates have dropped only half a
percentage point during the 12 months. That put disastrous pressure on the
ERM. In the end, therefore, UK share prices enjoyed two substantial bonuses,
not just from the unexpectedly clear Conservative victory in the April
election but also from the complete exit of sterling from the ERM in
September.
The big 'what if . . .' question for 1992 must be about the possibility that
Labour might have won the election and then tried to hold a devalued pound
within the ERM, at still-high interest rates. That combination easily could
have pushed the FT-SE 100 index below 2,000. As it is, short-term sterling
rates have dropped by 3 1/2 points over the year, although the drop in
long-dated gilt-edged yields has been only 0.7 of a point. In any case, the
summer crisis sent Footsie down to a low of 2,281 on August 25, having hit a
post-election peak of 2,737 on May 11. But, thanks to the departure from the
ERM and the subsequent tumble in money rates, all that ground was recovered:
the year's high (almost regained last night) was 2,792 on December 1.
The overall rate of return on UK equities so far this year to date has been
about 17 per cent and, interestingly, you could have done as well in
index-linked gilts, which enjoyed a strong surge after Black Wednesday,
September 16. Fixed-interest gilts have, curiously enough, given very much
the same return, too; domestic portfolio strategists will note that, for the
second year running, there has been little to choose between bonds and
equities. The big relative losers have been those still holding liquid
assets, with the return down from 12.3 per cent the year before to something
under 10 per cent for 1992 - with worse to come, although the decline is
broadly justified by the fall in the rate of inflation.
But the game in 1992 was, of course, all about currencies. You could have
earned 23 or 24 per cent gross on Deutsche mark or dollar deposits. D-mark
and dollar bonds have performed a few points better than that. For
sterling-based investors, it has been very much the year of international
fixed income (the year's top unit trust sector). Apart from the currency
effect, though, most of the equity markets around the world have been
disappointing. You had to dabble in politically-risky south east Asian
markets like Hong Kong and Thailand to make decent profits.
Wall Street is only slightly higher in dollar terms, having moved
relentlessly sideways in what has been the least volatile year for US
equities since 1912. Japan is well down on the year, although also usefully
up on its own August low point. Continental European markets have generally
been dull.
A sluggish world economy has provided the backdrop for the general
disappointment in the financial markets. Economic growth is likely to have
been only 1.5 per cent on average in 1992 for the 24 member states of the
OECD. There are serious debt problems in the US, Japan, the UK and
elsewhere, and part of the burden of this debt is in the process of being
transferred from the private sector to the public finances; according to
broker James Capel, the total net government borrowing by the top seven
countries next year is likely to be Dollars 750bn, so it is scarcely
surprising that the markets are under a cloud.
All the same, British investors have escaped yet again from the consequences
of economic failure. Pension funds could well see a return of more than 15
per cent against a growth of under 6 per cent in their pay-linked
liabilities. In August, of course, things did not seem at all so rosy. But
now, institutional fund managers, who often have an 85 per cent exposure to
the equity markets at home and abroad, are rubbing their hands with
satisfaction over the UK's return to old devaluationary and inflationary
ways.
In one area, however, true calamity has struck. The residential housing
market is stuck in its worst-ever slump and the long-term economic
consequences could be dire. More than 1m families have been wiped out
financially and millions more have had their confidence destroyed.
House prices have fallen by about 8 per cent in 1992, slicing perhaps Pounds
80bn off the notional wealth of British citizens. On the other side of the
balance sheet, the debt mountain heaped upon home-owners has begun to erode
only slowly in proportion to incomes, although the sharp interest rate drop
has at least eased the burden of monthly instalments. This stupendous policy
error of the 1980s will take many years to correct. Sterling devaluations
are old hat, but such a house market meltdown is unprecedented.
Goodbye 1992, the year in which, with one September shuffle, chancellor
Norman Lamont was free - but millions of home-buyers stayed trapped.
