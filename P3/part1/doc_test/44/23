Five of the largest US local telephone companies have announced in the past
few months plans to cut more than 55,000 jobs, so as to improve their
efficiency as new rivals enter what was a monopolistic business. A
combination of technological change, government deregulation and the fierce
US competitive spirit is slimming the US telecommunications industry
greatly. It is leading the world in the introduction of advanced,
inter-active, multi-media communications systems.
The upheaval provides a strong piece of circumstantial evidence to support
the contention that the US has a significant competitive edge over most
other nations in many service industries, telecommunications among them, and
that in some sectors the gap may be widening.
Claims of US superiority are open to dispute, since all international
comparisons of competitiveness are fraught with statistical pitfalls -
nowhere more than in the services sector, where output and productivity are
much harder to measure than in manufacturing industries.
Even so, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence, ranging from the
increasing threat that US airlines present to European national carriers, to
the popularity of McDonald's hamburgers and Walt Disney films around the
globe. A report published 18 months ago by the McKinsey Global Institute, an
arm of the McKinsey management consultancy, has given statistical backing to
the theory.
McKinsey conducted detailed case studies of five industries around the world
 -airlines, retail banking, restaurants, retailing and telecommunications -
and concluded: 'The US service industry has been fairly dynamic, and has led
the way to improved US productivity overall, compared with Europe and
Japan.'
Most studies of global competitiveness focus on manufacturing industry,
partly because it is much easier to measure its productivity, partly because
goods are more internationally traded than services, and partly because
highly visible sectors such as cars and computers tend to be regarded,
rightly or wrongly, as yardsticks of a nation's industrial health and
thrust.
Yet service industries account for more than 60 per cent of US employment
and roughly a quarter of US exports. Furthermore, the sector's productivity
has an important effect on the competitiveness of manufacturing industry,
whose production costs include a significant services element.
Among the McKinsey study's findings are:
Labour productivity in the US retail banking system, in 1989, was 32
percentage points higher than that of Germany and 36 points higher than that
of the UK. This was due partly to greater US deployment of information
technology, such as automated teller machines.
The US general merchandise retailing industry had higher productivity than
other leading economies, in terms of labour productivity, capital
productivity and total factor productivity. In labour productivity, the gap
ranged from just 4 per cent in the case of Germany to 50 per cent in the
case of Japan.
The US restaurant industry had productivity levels slightly lower than that
of France and somewhat higher than that of Germany, while the airline
industry has significantly higher productivity than that of Europe.
In telecommunications, the US has a higher capital productivity than Japan
and the main European countries, though its labour productivity is no better
than that of Japan and France. However, the report was compiled before the
current upheaval in US telecommunications - and that may be giving the US an
edge in labour productivity in a sector which will be particularly important
as the world enters an age of multi-media, inter-active communications.
Mr Alex Mandl, head of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's communications
services business, points out: 'In the next three to five years, the (US)
consumer will have the ability to access, through a computer or TV screen,
video services, conference services, entertainment services . . . . There's
no other country moving as quickly in that direction.'
What accounts for the apparent US lead in services? The main reason cited by
McKinsey is simply that 'competitive pressures on companies operating in the
US are greater than in other countries.'
First, the US has a more entrepreneurial spirit than many other nations. Its
businessmen seem unusually willing to take risks and financial markets to
back them.
Take MCI Communications, the long-distance communications group which played
the key role in breaking AT&amp;T's monopoly of the long-distance phone market.
It began in the late 1960s as a tiny upstart serving the St Louis-Chicago
market.
Second, the US began to deregulate its service industries earlier than other
nations. Airlines were de-regulated in 1978, when new entrants were allowed
and carriers were freed to choose the routes to fly and the fares to charge.
In 1984, an anti-trust court settlement forced AT&amp;T to spin off its local
operations and face full competition in the long-distance market.
Mr John Young, former chief executive of computer group Hewlett Packard,
says: 'With hindsight, the break-up of AT&amp;T was a huge benefit for this
country. The only way you learn to compete is by competing.'
Third, the US services sector faces the threat of foreign entrants,
attracted by the size and relative openness of the market, while it is
increasingly looking overseas for growth as its domestic market matures.
Mr Stephen Roach, an economist at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, cites
increasing global competition as a main reason why the US services sector at
last seems to be getting a productivity benefit from its investment in
information technology, which he estimates to have totalled Dollars 862bn
(Pounds 588m) over the past decade.
'The long-awaited payback in information technology is finally happening,'
he says. 'Back-office consolidation is breaking out with a vengeance in
banking, airlines and elsewhere . . . . Paper-pushing middle managers are
getting replaced by machines. Sales workers, empowered by point-of-sale
computing, are taking on a lot of additional functions, such as inventory
control.'
However, the US has no grounds for complacency. Other countries are also
stepping up their investments in information technology, while a wave of
service industry de-regulation and/or privatisation is under way in
continental Europe and Japan.
The opening of those markets will give US industries new fields to conquer.
But competition, leading to greater European and Japanese productivity,
could narrow the apparent US lead in services.
