FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie future leads equities higher

AFTER struggling gamely all week to remain above the Footsie 2,700 level
London's equity market moved into overdrive as the session drew to a close,
finishing a net 13 points higher at 2,715.
The late rise was triggered by a strong run in the Footsie future during the
late afternoon, ahead of an encouraging survey by the Confederation of
British Industry, and a firm showing by Wall Street which showed a
double-figure rise as London closed. Adding to a generally positive feeling
around the market was some good economic news from Germany, which
specialists said finally put paid to any fears that German interest rates
may have to rise in the short term.
The trading session began in subdued fashion, with many traders expecting a
very quiet day ahead of the long bank holiday weekend.
The Footsie kicked off marginally higher at 2.402.2, but quickly dipped
below 2,700, reaching the day's low point of 2,697.5, down 4.5, as the
Footsie future dropped sharply. The early slide was arrested within minutes,
however, as initial pressure on the future was reversed, driving the cash
market higher with it.
By 10 am the Footsie was 11 points higher at 2,713, looking set fair for a
strong run, before it dipped dipping off in the wake of the 0.6 per cent
fall in gross domestic product figure during the first quarter. Towards the
close, however, a sudden burst of buying activity, said to have originated
in the futures market, saw the Footsie future's premium re-established and
prompted a flurry of buying interest across the board in the cash market,
which left the Footsie index at the day's best level as the market closed.
The oil sector was one of the few areas of the market to perform well from
start to finish, stimulated by expectations of higher oil prices after the
current Opec meeting. But the Kuwait Investment Office killed off one of the
market's wilder rumours but by firmly rejecting suggestions that it was
about to sell its near-10 per cent stake in BP.
Salomon Brothers was responsible for the exceptional performance of
Vodafone, taking the view that any PCN threat to the cellular industry would
be confined to the M-25 area and, at best, extremely limited for at least
three years. Turnover in equities came out at 522.9m shares.
Gilts maintained their recent good showing with long-dated stocks up around
a half-point.
The level of customer, or retail, business on the London market fell away
this week but remains ahead of levels reached at this stage last year.
