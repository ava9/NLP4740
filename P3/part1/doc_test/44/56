  [Text] Washington, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
business leaders exchanged words of complaint about U.S. access 
to Japan's markets as they met Monday [14 February] in 
preparation for a conference slated for this summer in Tokyo. 
  Japanese participants said U.S. businesspeople taking part 
in 
the closed-door session complained about slow progress in 
opening the Japanese markets for auto parts, insurance and 
electronics products. 
  On the other hand, the Japanese insisted that progress has 
been made in bilateral business cooperation to help U.S. firms 
do business in Japan, they said. 
  As for trade in autos, representatives from Japanese and 
U.S. 
automakers pointed accusing fingers at each other over why the 
U.S. share in Japan's auto market is so small. 
  Delegates from the "Big Three" U.S. Automakers said this is 
evidence of the closed nature of the Japanese market, but the 
Japanese pointed to the fact that the European share in Japan's 
auto market is the same as European makers have in the U.S. 
market. 
  Some 30 business leaders from the two countries are 
attending 
the two-day meeting, arranged by the Japan-U.S. Economic Council 
and the U.S.-Japan Economic Council and slated to end on Tuesday.
