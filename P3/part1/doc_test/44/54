Long-dated UK government bonds rose about  1/4 point in quiet trading
yesterday in anticipation that tomorrow's Pounds 2.75bn auction of 15-year
stock by the Bank of England would proceed smoothly. By contrast, gains at
the shorter end were limited to about  1/8 point.
The March long gilt future on Liffe traded at 119 13/32 in late trading,
just below the day's best level of 119 27/32 but up  3/16 on the day.
Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said he expected the new stock to yield
around 6.35 per cent, in line with current market levels. He expected the
cover - the amount by which demand exceeds supply - would be around 1 1/2
times, below the record 2.2 times recorded at the last auction.
He said that the cover was likely to be more modest this time round because
market conditions were stable and because traders had already adjusted their
positions ahead of the fresh supply of gilts. He also expected a very small
'tail' - the difference between the average accepted price and the lowest
accepted price.
There was little obvious reaction in the market to the latest survey of
industrial opinion by the Confederation of British Industry despite its
encouraging conclusions on the state of the UK economy.
Better-than-expected January data for January from the German state of
North-Rhein Westphalia sparked an intra-day recovery in German government
bond futures yesterday. The March bund future on Liffe had dropped as low as
99.77 before the data were released but rose as high as 100.18 by
mid-afternoon in good volume. By contrast the cash market was mostly
unchanged in quiet trading, traders said.
Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, German economist at UBS in Frankfurt, said while the
NRW data were encouraging, fears of a poor money supply number for December,
which could be published at the end of this week or early next week, were
dampening market sentiment. The market expects a figure of 7 per cent.
Italian bond futures rallied more than a half-point on news yesterday that
Italy's finance minister, Mr Franco Gallo, had signed a decree to speed up
the refund of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on bond coupon payments to
eligible foreigners.
The March Italian government bond future on Liffe was trading near the day's
high of 118.96 in late trading, well up on the day's low of 117.93. Some
traders believed that the market would test its previous record high of
119.12 today.
Japanese government bonds showed unexpected resilience in the face of the
current political uncertainty in Tokyo and the slide in the Japanese stock
market yesterday. The March future went as high as 116.29 before closing at
115.95, the day's low, but 0.27 points higher than Friday's close. The
future then drifted to just below 116 in London trading.
Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe in London, said the future was
likely to trade between 115.50 and 116.40 in the short term, in the light of
the support shown at 114.50 last week. He added that some investors were
switching out of the benchmark No 157 10-year government bond into other
10-year bonds, following No 157's outperformance of 10 basis points last
week.
US bond prices showed little change yesterday morning in a quiet session
ahead of today's Treasury auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/32 at 99
19/32, yielding 6.292 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
unchanged at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.045 per cent.
The market opened on a weak note after overnight selling by Japanese traders
rattled by the failure of a political reform package to win parliamentary
approval. But prices soon found support in light technical trading, despite
underlying concern over today's influx of supply. The auction is to be
followed by the sale of Dollars 12bn in five-year securities tomorrow.
As the afternoon progresses, the long bond slumped, with uneasiness over
Friday's report on fourth-quarter domestic product beginning to surface.
Traders are concerned that a robust growth rate could carry over into the
first quarter and trigger an early tightening of monetary policy.
