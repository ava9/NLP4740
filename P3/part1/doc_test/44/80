Trends in international bond markets set the agenda for a London stock
market still undecided after a topsy-turvey beginning to the week.
An early sharp fall in sterling was seen as the main cause of a sell-off in
gilts, and was accompanied by fresh losses in German bunds. These produced
sharp declines across the board in London share prices, although downside
pressure in the market was much reduced later in the session when Wall
Street opened on a firm note. US investors adopted a more positive view on
the outcome of the two big auctions of US Treasury bonds, involving Dollars
12bn worth of 10-year bonds late yesterday and Dollars 11bn worth of 30-year
bonds today.
At their worst levels yesterday, long-dated gilts were down 1 1/4 before
stabilising and rallying to finish the session some 13 ticks off on balance.
Although closing 11.1 down at 3,429.1, the FT-SE 100 Index was well above
the day's lowest point, reached just before midday, while the Mid Cap 250
Index settled 30.5 off at 4,101.1, also above the day's low point.
The equities market was under pressure from the outset, with weak gilt
futures unsettling the equity market amid stories that the trend in US bonds
could have signalled a withdrawal from UK gilts of the big US hedge funds
and institutions.
The FT-SE 100 Index opened around 17 points lower, affected by gilts and
pressure in the Footsie future, and managed a modest recovery which saw the
index down only 5 points. However, the rally soon came to grief as renewed
selling across the board in gilts and equity futures drove the FT-SE 100
future below 3,400 and to a discount to the cash market around midday. At
the day's low-point the 100-share index was down 36.5 at 3,403.7.
A good rally developed thereafter, with London picking up the scent of a
steadier than expected opening by US bonds and Wall Street. German bunds
moved up, taking gilts with them, and equities responded accordingly. Wall
Street was around 25 points higher as London closed, although it moved
significantly lower afterwards.
Some UK strategists remained unconvinced by the rally in bond markets
yesterday afternoon and the impact on equities. Mr Edmond Warner at
Kleinwort Benson said the markets had 'woken up today to worries that
support for gilts has evaporated'. The gilts/equity ratio has fallen to 2.1,
and for the ratio to return to 2.0 would need a strong rally in gilts or a
big correction in equities. A ratio of two would entail a 170-point drop in
the FT-SE 100 to 3,250, or smaller moves in both gilts and equities.'
Turnover in equities was well down from Tuesday's 1.02bn shares, reaching
912m. Non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 64 per cent of the overall total.
The value of customer business transacted in the market on Tuesday was
Pounds 2.08bn, continuing the high levels of recent weeks.
Kleinwort European Privatisation Trust, one of the day's two new issues,
accounted for a heavy 61m shares, with the stock coming under pressure all
day and closing at 43 1/2 p, compared with an opening level of 49p. Coda,
the other market debut stock, ended at a good premium to its placing price.
Oil shares attracted keen interest, with the majors strongly supported after
a buy recommendation from one of the London market's top broking firms and
in spite of a steep decline in crude oil prices.
