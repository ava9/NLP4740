THE OUTBREAK of violence in Russia sent European government bonds tumbling
at the start of trading, but while the markets remained volatile for much of
the morning, prices closed higher across the board as investors bought on
weakness and relief at President Boris Yeltsin's apparent success in
crushing the rebellion.
Bond dealers were glued to their television screens for much of the day,
closely following the events in Russia. But after the initial marking down
of European bond prices, many felt that the reaction had been too dramatic.
'This is a classic case of over-reaction by the European government bond
markets,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg
Securities.
He pointed out that the turmoil in Russia was obscuring the generally
favourable economic background to the European bond markets which are
expected to benefit from falling inflation and cuts in interest rates.
THE GERMAN government bond market, usually one of the most sensitive to
turmoil in Russia, recouped its early losses and closed higher.
The bund future contract, which closed at 98.86 on Friday, opened at 98.35
yesterday and reached a high of 99.05 before trading at 98.97 in late
afternoon.
UK GILTS ended higher on the day, as dealers pointed out that many investors
regard sterling assets as a safe haven in times of turmoil.
Furthermore, the economic background still looks favourable in the UK and
supply worries have disappeared temporarily.
The market's immediate domestic concerns remain the Conservative Party
conference this week, and the release of the September inflation figures
next week. Gilts closed between  1/8 and  1/4 point higher on the day with
10-year issues seeing the biggest rise.
JAPANESE government bonds opened on a weak note, as dealers marked down
prices on the back of the weekend's events in Russia while news of further
supply at the long end depressed prices even further.
However, late short-covering revived the market and government bond prices
ended higher on the day.
Japanese bond prices weakened in overseas trading on Friday, following the
announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it will no longer buy bonds
outright through its trust fund bureau.
The bureau has bought about Y100bn of bonds a month over the last nine
months, dealers said.
News that the Ministry of Finance plans to auction about Y300bn of 20-year
bonds today pushed down prices at the long end, an area of the market which
has performed well in recent weeks as investors looked for capital gains.
Furthermore, since the cut in the official discount rate last week, some
investors have shifted into the longer maturities for the yield, as they can
obtain a higher return than on bank deposits and other Japanese investments,
dealers said.
US Treasury prices were little changed in late trading yesterday, leaving
analysts surprised that the flight-to-quality that was expected to accompany
news of political unrest in Russia failed to materialise.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
3/32 at 103 15/32 , yielding 5.994 per cent. At the short end the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent.
The news overnight of intense fighting in Moscow, set the scene for early
gains in Treasuries.
Yet any benefits for the Treasury market yesterday were short-lived. Prices
firmed at the opening, but by early afternoon were flat and soon after
slipped into negative territory.
On the domestic front, news of an unexpected 1.1 per cent decline in August
construction spending helped the long end of the market in early trading.
Investors' attention, however, soon shifted to Friday's September employment
report, and longer-dated prices eventually drifted lower. Analysts expect
the jobs report to show an increase in payrolls of about 150,000.
