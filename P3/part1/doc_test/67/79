FT  14 FEB 94 / Traffic-linked bonds may fund EU roads
</HEADLINE>

The European Commission is considering launching bonds tied to the volume of
road traffic as a way of raising money for its ambitious trans-European
networks initiative.
This would involve the Commission raising funds on international markets and
channelling finance to governments or private companies building roads
throughout the European Union. Investors would be paid interest linked to
the amount of traffic travelling along a particular road, said Mr Enrico
Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, in an interview.
The traffic-linked bond is one of several options being looked at by the
Commission as it tries to inject momentum into its trans-European networks
programme. This aims to develop transport, telecommunications and energy
networks linking different parts of the Union. The cost of priority projects
alone has been put at Ecu160bn (Pounds 121bn) by 1999.
The initiative received a qualified go-ahead from member states at last
December's summit in Brussels. While some countries were keen on the idea,
others such as Germany and the UK were hostile to the Commission proposals.
The Commission's ideas will be discussed in a group chaired by Mr Henning
Christophersen, the economics commissioner. They will then be put to June's
summit of European leaders in Corfu.
In an interview, Mr Christophersen said the problem was 'not so much a lack
of finance as a lack of appropriate financial instruments'.
Mr Cioffi said the aim of new instruments would be to 'reduce costs and add
value'. Alternatives being considered by the Commission included:
Bonds indexed to air, rail and maritime traffic. Interest payments could be
tied to traffic on a particular piece of infrastructure or to traffic
throughout the Union.
Bonds indexed to the interest rate of a particular central bank or a basket
of central bank interests rates.
Loan guarantees by the Commission. These would only be used for those parts
of a network located outside the Union and where the absence of a guarantee
would prevent the project going ahead. Examples could include
telecommunications or motorway networks extending from the Union into
eastern Europe.
Mr Cioffi said the Commission could use its AAA credit-rating to lower the
costs of infrastructure finance by between a half to one percentage point
for countries such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark, which do not have
AAA status. It could also reduce costs for private builders of
infrastructure.
