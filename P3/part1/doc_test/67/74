FT  17 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Watchdog barks but the MMC
moves on - Disarray in UK competition policy after a pro-industry shift by
Michael Heseltine

Recent inquiry reports from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission point to a
significant shift in UK competition policy. The MMC has adopted a
pro-industry approach which threatens a rift with the Office of Fair
Trading, the competition watchdog.
The change in policy was inspired by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary. Competition officials and other advocates of a stricter
policy believe the Department of Trade and Industry and the MMC have relaxed
policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing in global
markets.
The growing frustration of competition officials and consumer organisations
is echoed at Westminster, where influential backbenchers led by Mr John
Watts MP, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, have set up a lobby
group, the Competitive Forum, to press for tougher consumer-oriented
competition policy and reform of the MMC.
When he took over at the DTI, Mr Heseltine signalled his preference for
industrial over competition policy. His long-awaited competitiveness white
paper, due next week, should confirm that preference.
Mr Graeme Odgers, the businessman who took over as chairman of the MMC a
year ago, appears to share his views. Last week he said he was 'four-square'
with Mr Heseltine on privatisation, competitiveness and deregulation.
Since his arrival at the MMC, Mr Odgers has also tried to instill a
consistency of approach by encouraging a collegiate atmosphere among the
Commission's 35 members. The result, say critics, is an increasingly
doctrinaire style which places the interests of firms under investigation
ahead of those of the public and consumers.
This shift appears to be causing alarm at the OFT. Under Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director general of fair trading, the OFT has taken a strongly consumerist
approach to competition policy.
Sir Bryan gives the impression that he believes markets should be free of
any anti-competitive restraints unless they can be shown to benefit the
consumer. He has made a number of referrals to the MMC recently, among
others on fine fragrances and ice cream, which demonstrate his particular
concern with vertical restraints (those affecting the chain of supply to the
marketplace), such as measures tying in retailers to suppliers.
But the MMC under Mr Odgers appears to take the view that that vertical
restraints and anti-competitive practices must clearly damage the consumer
interest before it will interfere in an industry.
Companies that have built up competitive advantage should be allowed to
profit from their investment, innovation and enterprise, he said last week.
This increasingly laisser faire approach by the commission puts it on a
direct collision course with the OFT.
The clearest evidence of the shift in competition policy comes from recent
monopoly inquiry reports. Some competition lawyers and economists trace the
change back to the report in March 1989 on the supply of beer, when robust
recommendations made by the MMC aimed at weakening the control of the
brewers over pubs were rejected by the government following intense lobbying
by the industry.
Since then, critics say, the MMC has taken a much less interventionist
approach and shown far too much respect for the views of the firms under
investigation, an approach reinforced by the arrival of Mr Heseltine at the
DTI and Mr Odgers at the MMC.
The pattern began with the 1992 report on the supply of new motor cars,
criticised by consumer groups for relying too heavily on manufacturers' own
survey data and consumer satisfaction indices to establish that there was
little wrong with the present system of car dealerships and after-sales
service.
The MMC again found itself under attack in November last year over its
report on fine fragrances which concluded 'snob value' - high prices and
exclusivity - were more important to consumers than value for money, so
allowing leading perfume houses to continue refusing supplies to cut-price
retailers.
That was followed in March by the ice cream report which found that,
although the three leading manufacturers had more than 90 per cent of the
market for wrapped ice creams, the system of freezer exclusivity - providing
free freezer cabinets to shops on condition they are not used to stock rival
suppliers' ice cream - did not limit consumer choice by keeping rival
products out of smaller shops.
The unease at these reports should be underlined next month when the report
on recorded music is expected to clear the record industry of acting
together to keep the price of compact discs in Britain artificially high.
There have been additional reports on mortgage valuations, newspaper supply,
television broadcasting services and animal waste - all of which have drawn
criticism for producing either half-hearted or unworkable recommendations to
remedy adverse findings.
Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association director of policy, says that
at the heart of these reports seems to be a confusion between the interests
of industry in general and the interests of existing companies. But there is
no guarantee, he says, that what existing companies want will necessarily be
in the interests of the productive sector of the economy.
Mr Bill Bishop of Lexecon, the economic consultants, says you only have to
contrast the beer report with the recent ice cream report to see the change
of approach. On beer, the commission found the system of tied public houses
did damage the public interest. It rejected the industry's argument that, if
consumers did not like the choice of beer in one pub, they could go to
another. But on ice cream it reached the opposite conclusion.
Mr Derek Ridyard, associate director of National Economic Research
Associates, says the dispute is really about the extent to which one
supplier should be obliged to give competitors a leg-up in the market.
Even in the case of ice cream there were perfectly sound economic arguments
for saying that Unilever had taken the initiative and developed the market
and invested in freezer cabinets, and that all Mars had to do to compete was
take the same risks. There was a feeling that Mars was simply trying to use
the competition laws as a short cut, he says.
Mr Ridyard believes that, if there has been a change in approach, then it
has come from the OFT which has become more hawkish on vertical restraints
under Sir Bryan. He has referred areas such as recorded music and ice cream,
which had been looked at and rejected for referral by his predecessor, Sir
Gordon Borrie.
Mr Christopher Bright, a partner in City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines,
says it is easy to understand the frustration felt at the OFT at these
developments. But he believes the OFT's main problems lie with the DTI
rather than the MMC.
Twice in February last year Mr Heseltine rejected Sir Bryan's advice to
refer mergers to the MMC. The first case concerned the acquisition by GEC of
the Philips infra-red components business. The second concerned the hostile
bid by Airtours for Owners Abroad. Mr Heseltine considered the issues raised
did not justify referral.
These actions were not exceptional. Other trade secretaries have gone
against the advice of the director general - in all in 11 cases over 20
years, says Mr Bright. But these instances suggested a swing away from the
approach of former trade secretaries such as the late Mr Nicholas Ridley and
Mr Peter Lilley - one of 'if in doubt, refer'.
Further evidence of tension between the DTI and the OFT came in February
this year when Mr Heseltine ordered Sir Bryan to stop his investigation into
bus services on the Isle of Arran. It was the first time a trade secretary
had ever used his powers to overrule a director general in that way.
But the real problem for the OFT is that the DTI seems to have completely
lost interest in competition policy. Merger referrals are at an all-time
low. Only three mergers have been referred by Mr Heseltine to the MMC in the
past 12 months. When the MMC publishes its recorded music report next month
there will be only two monopoly inquiries on the go. The DTI is also
dragging its heels on reform of the law on restrictive practices and abuses
of market power.
These developments are not lost on UK companies, says Mr Bright. No wonder
OFT officials are said to be concerned at recent events.
