confirmed - The Battle for Midland

THE MAIN banking union, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, yesterday
pledged to fight a Lloyds takeover of Midland at the Mergers and Monopolies
Commission, in parliament and, if necessary, in Europe.
Bifu is hoping to scupper any bid by intensive lobbying  - there had been no
discussion at this stage of industrial action, it said.
Union fears that more than 20,000 jobs out of a total of 110,000 could be
lost through a merged Lloyds-Midland operation were later confirmed by
Lloyds. However, the bank stressed its intention to minimise compulsory
redundancies. The union was yesterday in talks with Lloyds personnel chiefs
in an attempt to strengthen existing agreements on job security.
Bifu, which represents nearly three quarters of Midland's staff at all
levels, has already expressed its preference for a bid by the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, from which it has had assurances on jobs.
The union said its argument to the MMC would be that Lloyds 'would be
eliminating one of its competitors with one hit and gaining an unfair
advantage by taking over Midland customers.' In contrast, a merger with
Hongkong Bank would 'bring new money into the country and increase
competition.'
Mr Ed Sweeney, Bifu deputy general secretary, said: 'No job at either bank
would be safe. We are totally opposed to a Lloyds bid which would be bad for
jobs and bad for customers. The disappearance of a familiar face from the
high street will not help competition one bit.'
More than 10,000 jobs have already gone in Lloyds over the past three years,
said Bifu. Overall, the union calculates that at least 27,000 jobs were lost
from financial services companies last year. Even before yesterday's
announcements, Bifu was predicting that at least 30,000 further jobs in the
sector would disappear this year out of a total of about 500,000.
It was too early to say which group of staff would come off worst, said the
union. Closures would depend on individual geographical considerations and
which bank had the best facilities in any particular area. Job casualties
would be among support functions, such as information technology centres, as
well as in high street branches, said Bifu.
