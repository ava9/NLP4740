FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax attacks bid recommendation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equifax, the US credit information group, has hit out at the UAPT-Infolink
board recommendation of a lower takeover bid from Trans Union.
In a letter to shareholders, Equifax said that if the board was concerned
that its 600p a share offer would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, then it should wait for a judgment before advising shareholders.
Trans Union has offered 50p less, but because it has no UK operations its
bid has no risk of a referral, whereas Equifax's offer is conditional upon
approval by the Office of Fair Trading.
