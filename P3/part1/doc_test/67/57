expected to be worth 'considerably' more than 400p a share

LLOYDS BANK will announce this morning that it plans to bid for its rival
Midland Bank, challenging Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which
already has a Pounds 3.3bn offer on the table for the UK clearing bank.
Bankers said last night that the announcement will be made this morning. It
will be the first time a UK clearing bank has made a hostile attempt to
acquire another UK clearer. Midland is likely to oppose the bid.
If the bid succeeds, it will mean huge job losses and the biggest upheaval
in UK banking since a wave of mergers in the 1960s.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, said his board would have to
read Lloyds' terms before deciding whether to oppose the offer. But he
reiterated that an offer from Lloyds was likely to be unwelcome.
Mr Pearse is worried that a bid could unsettle the morale of his staff, who
would be concerned about job losses should Lloyds succeed.
Lloyds, advised by the merchant bank Baring Brothers, is expected to say
that it will offer considerably more than 400p for each Midland share.
That compares with Hongkong Bank's offer of new shares and bonds which at
yesterday's market prices were worth 400p per Midland share. Midland shares
rose 6p to close at 381p last night.
Lloyds' offer will be one of the most politically controversial takeover
attempts since 1981, when Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered bank both
made abortive attempts to buy the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Bifu, the banking union, has already made plain its opposition to a Lloyds
bid. It is concerned because Lloyds plans to make about 20,000 employees
redundant from the banks' combined UK workforces of 100,000.
The other reason the bid will be sensitive is that Midland and Lloyds each
have shares of about 15 per cent of the market for small business loans.
Small and medium size companies fear the combination of Midland and Lloyds
would have an adverse effect on competition in this market.
Lloyds has delayed making its move on Midland because of its concern that
these competition concerns would lead the Office of Fair Trading to refer
its offer for lengthy scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the
UK competition authority.
To minimise this threat to competition, Lloyds has been trying to find a
bank without a big presence in the UK which would be prepared to take
control of more than 500 of its and Midland's branches should its bid
succeed.
OFT sources said that if Lloyds pulled off such a deal on the branches, that
might persuade the MMC to allow the takeover, but would probably not prevent
a reference of the deal to the MMC.
Mr Pearse is concerned that customers and staff would be so unsettled while
the MMC spent months investigating a Lloyds bid that the market value of
Midland might be damaged. The Bank of England has been kept closely informed
of Lloyds' intentions. It is expected to remain neutral in the bid battle.
The Bank has traditionally been unhappy about banks making hostile bids for
each other. However, it does not believe that a bid by Lloyds will damage
the interests of Midland's depositors, so it will not intervene.
Lloyds' decision to bid is a victory for Mr Brian Pitman, its chief
executive. He believes combining with Midland will generate additional
annual profits of more than Pounds 500m by making the 20,000 redundancies
over three years and closing about 1,000 branches.
