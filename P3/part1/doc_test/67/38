Trans-Natal Coal and Rand-coal, two of South Africa's biggest coal
companies, plan to merge, creating the third largest privately-owned coal
producer in the world.
The new company will have assets of R4.3bn (Dollars 615m) and a turnover of
R3.4bn on annual sales of 58m tonnes. The combined market capitalisation of
the two producers is R5.5bn.
The deal was announced yesterday with the annual results of Trans-Natal's
parent company, mining house Gencor. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor chairman,
said the new company, which will temporarily be known as Mergeco, would
benefit from synergies in management and marketing.
The announcement follows widespread speculation that Randcoal's controlling
shareholder, life assurer Old Mutual, was considering bids for the company.
Other interested parties were thought to include South African mining houses
Anglovaal and Gold Fields and oil and chemical producer Sasol, as well as
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian mining group.
The decision signals the demise of Randcoal parent Rand Mines, once one of
South Africa's premier mining houses, as an independent company. The group
was unbundled from conglomerate Barlow Rand last December and its former
gold-producing subsidiary, Randgold, was in effect taken over by a
consortium operating through rival mine First Wesgold only two weeks ago.
The merger involves no cash and will be financed through Randcoal, which
will acquire the operating business of Trans-Natal by issuing 108 shares for
every 100 Trans-Natal shares. Minorities will be offered Trans-Natal shares
in exchange for Randcoal shares. Rand Mines will not accept the offer and
will distribute the Randcoal shares to its shareholders.
Gencor will have shareholder and management control of the new company; Mr
John Hall, Randcoal chairman, will be its chairman.
In its first results since unbundling, Gencor reported profits for the 10
months ending in June, lifting attributable earnings by 2.1 per cent to
R625m. This was up from its pro-forma figures of R613m for the year to
August 1993.
Operating income rose 32.9 per cent to R630m from R474m on the strength of
improved gold, ferro-alloys and titanium earnings, but investment income
dropped 67.5 per cent to R77m from R237m on a combination of lower cash
balances and lower interest rates.
