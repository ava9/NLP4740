The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday increased its bid
for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday, in an effort to gain a majority stake in the company.
The bid was raised from 261.6p to 350p a share, matching the sum paid
earlier this month by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland,
for 24.99 per cent of the company. The increased bid values Newspaper
Publishing at Pounds 73.65m.
The consortium controls nearly 48 per cent of Newspaper Publishing and hopes
the new offer will enable it to secure more than 50 per cent. Apart from
MGN, the consortium includes Newspaper Publishing's two largest existing
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and a group which
founded the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor in chief.
Newspaper Publishing said yesterday a committee of the board made up of
independent directors would discuss the improved bid today and there would
be a full board meeting on Thursday.
The consortium hoped the offer would be recommended 'with a view to ending
as soon as possible the present damaging uncertainty about the company's
future'. It said the independent directors had indicated the price was
acceptable. However it said its offer would be formally rejected because it
would not undertake to maintain the offer, on the same terms, in the event
of the bid being referred to, and cleared by, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is considering a
request from the consortium that it should be allowed to acquire a
controlling interest without an MMC inquiry. He could agree to this if he is
satisfied the newspapers are not economic as a going concern; he has set a
deadline of March 3 for comment on the proposal.
Mr O'Reilly could now attempt to increase his stake beyond 24.99 per cent -
25 per cent is the trigger for an MMC referral - on the grounds that an
inquiry is now, in any case, under consideration.
It is understood Mr O'Reilly has been told by the independent directors the
consortium bid will ultimately succeed if he fails to make a full bid.
Merely raising his stake to 30 per cent would not solve the company's
problems long term, he has been told.
The National Union of Journalists' branch at the newspapers said it could
still not support the MGN consortium bid because of the 'likely loss of up
to 250 jobs and the destruction of editorial independence'.
