TWO OF the bids to take over British International Helicopters Ltd (BIHL),
Robert Maxwell's helicopter company now in administration, were yesterday
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Daniel Green writes.
Arthur Andersen, administrators of Maxwell's private companies, said the
decision would 'add to the uncertainty surrounding BIHL's future'. The MMC
has until September 9 to make its ruling.
Aberdeen-based BIHL went into administration in December 1991. It employs
500 people and has 26 operational helicopters, worth up to Pounds 5m each.
The referred bids, by Bond Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters, both UK
companies, would if successful reduce from three to two the number of
competitors in the Pounds 200m-a-year North Sea helicopter services
business. If Bristow won control of BIHL's assets, it would have about 75
per cent of the market, while if Bond won it would have nearly half.
It is understood that both the Office of Fair Trading and oil companies
operating in the North Sea objected to the bids.
