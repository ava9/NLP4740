FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Waste of an opportunity - The UK
stance on market dominance has come in for criticism

Last summer the UK government backed away from making radical changes to the
rules on abuses of market power by dominant companies. Its decision to do
little more than tinker with the present regime was a victory for the
Confederation of British Industry and the industry lobby which had opposed
the prospect of heavy fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods
too cheaply or refusing to supply certain outlets.
Not all companies were pleased, however - particularly those operating in a
market dominated by one organisation. They feared that the government's
decision would send the wrong messages.
In the UK's animal waste market, for instance, such fears are strong. Last
week three small independent companies went to the Office of Fair Trading to
protest at the lack of action on recommendations made last July by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to curb abuses of market power by Prosper
de Mulder (PDM), the UK's leading animal waste rendering company.
Last year's MMC inquiry marked the third time in a decade that the UK
competition authorities had probed the animal waste trade.
In 1985, the MMC found that PDM's strategy of growth by acquisition had been
harmful to abattoirs (the main source of red meat waste), and that PDM had
used its market power to respond aggressively to competitors seeking to
capture its raw material sources. It found PDM's pricing policy was designed
to exploit or maintain its monopoly. PDM gave undertakings that included an
agreement to notify the OFT before it bought any further animal waste
companies.
In 1991, PDM's purchase of the animal waste interests of Croda was referred
to the MMC. The commission found the merger would have an adverse effect on
competition, but cleared it on the grounds that Croda was a declining
competitive force and the deal would improve PDM's efficiency.
By autumn 1992, when the industry was again referred to the MMC, PDM had
bought several small animal waste collection businesses without notifying
the OFT, and mothballed the waste rendering plant at Market Harborough,
Leicestershire, bought from Croda.
Last year's MMC report found serious breaches by PDM of the 1986
undertakings and widespread discriminatory pricing. The MMC recommended that
PDM should be required to publish weekly a representative sample of prices
and charges from October, dispose of its Market Harborough plant within six
months, and be prohibited from making further acquisitions without OFT
approval, and that the 1986 undertakings be tightened.
Ten months later, PDM is not publishing weekly prices and has not disposed
of the Market Harborough plant. The three companies that complained to the
OFT last week say competition in the industry could be wiped out.
The OFT's official response is that consultations with PDM are continuing
and that 'there is no reason to suspect that consultation should not be
concluded satisfactorily'. PDM said yesterday it could not comment, as the
matter was under discussion with the OFT. But it denied it was in any way
responsible for the delay in implementing the MMC's recommendations.
Wherever the blame lies, competition lawyers say the failure of the
authorities to ensure effective competition in the animal waste industry
underlines the weakness of the UK system for tackling anti-competitive
behaviour by dominant companies. As one lawyer close to the case says: 'It's
a classic example of why the government was wrong in rejecting a tougher law
on abuse of market power.'
