FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Regulatory hurdles may prove a stumbling
block for Lloyds' bid - The Battle for Midland

THE PRIME condition attached to Lloyds' bid is that it should have to run
through no more regulatory hoops than its rival, the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank. Yet it was far from clear yesterday that this would be possible
because of the complexities of the two-tier UK and EC regulatory structure.
Lloyds' fear is that, without this condition, its bid could run foul of the
UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the large share of the UK
market which Lloyds/Midland bank would enjoy. On the other hand, the
competing bid could sail through because of Hongkong Bank's relatively small
share of the European banking market.
'This area is quite untested,' said Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman,
yesterday. 'This will be an early, big case.'
Under EC rules dating from September 1990, a bid must be scrutinised by
Brussels if the proposed merger exceeds a certain size, and a given
proportion of its business is located within the EC. The Hongkong bid is
already the subject of a four-week inquiry by Brussels to see whether it is
'compatible with the common market'.
It is unclear whether a Lloyds/Midland bid would also fall within Brussels'
ambit. Competition lawyers say the decisive factor will be whether the banks
have more than two-thirds of their business in the UK. In that case, the
deal would automatically fall under British jurisdiction. Commission
officials refused to be drawn on their calculations about the Lloyds/Midland
case.
The crucial questions, though, concern what happens at the UK end. These
are:
 -Will the UK authorities investigate the bid? This will depend on the
Office of Fair Trading, but the chances look high because of the two banks'
large combined UK business. Together, they would have about 30 per cent of
the market on many measures, compared with about 25 per cent each for
NatWest and Barclays.
 -If the OFT does recommend a referral to the MMC, would the UK also
investigate the Hongkong bid, as Lloyds is demanding it should? For this to
happen, Brussels would either have to decide that the case fell outside its
authority and hand it back to the UK, or the UK could ask for it back on
national interest grounds.
 -If there was a UK monopolies inquiry, would the MMC judge the proposed
mergers purely on the narrow grounds of competition? Or would it take into
account the wider national interest, given the huge size of the banks
involved, their key role in the economy, and the thousands of jobs at stake?
During the 1980s, Mr Norman Tebbit, when trade secretary, sought to confine
inquiries to competition issues. But the new trade secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, may have different ideas.
Mr Heseltine is thought to be more interventionist and may prefer to return
to a more widely based test of the public interest set out in the 1973 Fair
Trading Act. This might include having regard to 'the desirability of
maintaining and promoting the balanced distribution of industry and
employment in the UK'. Lloyds' plans to shed up to 20,000 jobs from the
merged bank might well fall foul of this test.
There are no useful precedents to make the picture clearer. The last big
wave of bank mergers took place more than 20 years ago, since when monopoly
policies have changed radically, not least with the arrival of Brussels on
the scene.
The Bank of England takes a studiously neutral view of bank mergers  - at
least in public. But regulators are generally thought to favour them because
they soften competition and should result in more strongly capitalised
banks.
There are many possibilities as to what could happen next. If the Commission
decides it has serious doubts about the effect on competition it can open a
four-month in-depth investigation. If those doubts are confirmed, Sir Leon
Brittan, the competition commissioner, can recommend that the deal should be
blocked, or amended. It could be another five to six months before Hongkong
Bank knows whether it can proceed with the deal.
The Lloyds bid will face an investigation by the OFT (which could take
anything up to a month) before the director general of fair trading can
decide whether to recommend to the trade secretary that it should be
referred to the MMC. An MMC investigation could take about three months,
after which its recommendations would go to Mr Heseltine for his final
decision. All in all the process could take six months.
Because of the pre-conditions Lloyds has attached to its bid, the Takeover
Code clock, which gives a bidder 28 days to post an offer document, will not
start running. But Lloyds will still be subject to rules on acquiring and
disclosing shares in Midland Bank. The bid would automatically lapse if it
was investigated either by Brussels or the UK. But it could be many months
before either bidder faces a clear road.
Lloyds' advisers said they would be seeking confirmation from the Takeover
Panel that in the event of a successful takeover for Midland it would not
have to make a bid for 3i, the venture capital group, or a number of trade
investments where its combined shareholding would be above the critical 30
per cent level.
