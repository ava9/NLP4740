Turmoil in the UK Gas Industry

BRITISH GAS'S announcement in August that it had decided to submit itself to
an investigation by the UK competition body, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, was greeted with astonishment and anger by the rest of the gas
industry.
Rival suppliers saw the UK's hard-won independent gas market plunged into a
year of turmoil. British Gas had itself been hoping to avoid a full-blown
MMC inquiry which, it acknowledges, casts a shadow of uncertainty across the
industry. But the company's decision to throw itself open to scrutiny is a
reflection of the level of frustration felt within British Gas at the hands
of its regulators.
The gas industry's problems date back to the privatisation of British Gas as
a single entity in 1986. The regulators have been eager to promote the
development of competition since then, but rival suppliers have been slow to
take root.
In a bid to break the hold of British Gas on the market, Sir James McKinnon,
director general of the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), the industry
regulator, has subjected the company to a growing number of measures aimed
at eroding its market share.
British Gas has complained of the rules constantly changing mid-game. In
October last year, Ofgas was joined by the Office of Fair Trading in calling
for a more rapid growth in competition in the UK gas market. The OFT called
on British Gas to give up half of its share of the industrial gas market by
1995 as well as to hive off its transportation and storage arm. British Gas
reluctantly agreed to these onerous demands but became embroiled in
discussion of their detail.
The flashpoint which caused the company to take the unprecedented step of
calling in the MMC came over the failure to agree with the regulator an
acceptable rate of return for the separate pipeline business. But by then,
British Gas's already strained relationship with Sir James had degenerated
into an acrimonious state of warfare.
British Gas has congratulated itself in the past on its willingness to cede
market share and encourage competitors, but rivals, which have often found a
champion in Sir James, have accused the company of exploiting its monopoly
grip on the market.
Nevertheless, independent suppliers have managed to capture 30 per cent of
the market for firm contract gas. The firm contract market represents half
of the overall industrial market and British Gas still retains a monopoly
over domestic customers.
Independent suppliers have been hampered by the long-term gas purchasing
patterns that exist in the North Sea. British Gas had contracted to buy up
so many North Sea fields that there was little left over for independents to
market. As a way round this dilemma, the OFT recommended that British Gas
sell off some of its supplies to rivals in a bid to encourage them into the
market.
The first of these gas auctions got underway in June with 32 rival suppliers
bidding for gas. The OFT argued that the gas auctions would allocate supply
to new companies until they are able to buy directly from the North Sea
later in the decade.
But many established gas marketing companies are critical of the way the
creation of competition in the gas market is being handled. They say the
regulators are encouraging independent companies with a short-term view of
the market and who could prove to be unreliable suppliers in the long run.
At least half of the independent companies to rival British Gas in the
market have been set up in the past year and some observers fear the
industry is attracting a flavour of the Wild West with short-term operators
rushing to make a quick buck.
British Gas is not allowed to discriminate between long-term players and
newcomers in its gas auctions. Rivals are, however, fearful that British Gas
is still exercising its clout in order to squeeze them out of long-term
supply when they try to buy into North Sea fields.
Enron, the large US gas company, was thwarted in a recent attempt to buy an
interest in a block of North Sea gas production from the US oil company,
Chevron, when other companies participating in the block - British Gas,
Phillips Petroleum and Agip - exercised their pre-emption rights. British
Gas said the move was not an attempt to block a competitor, and pointed out
that Enron was still negotiating to buy gas from the field.
Enron is also leading a consortium to build a 1,725 megawatt gas-fired power
staion at Imperial Chemical Industries' Wilton site in Teesside, north-east
England, to be supplied by the Amoco-operated Everest and Lomond fields in
the central North Sea. The Pounds 800m plant is due to come on stream in
April 1993. Enron plans to market surplus gas from the project.
As well as looking to gain a greater hold of the industrial market, rival
suppliers are also positioning themselves to enter domestic supply.
The government has said it will progressively raise the ceiling on the
amount of gas a user must take before it can source outside British Gas.
This should mean a choice of supplier for domestic households by 1996.
Several regional electricity companies have moved to set up gas marketing
arms so that by 1996 they will be in a position to provide a full-range of
energy services to householders.
However, it is still not clear how a free market in domestic energy will
work; the government has yet to decide how the market will be regulated or
how much responsibility British Gas will bear as the supplier of last
resort.
The government and regulators believe that this rush of competition will
bring down costs for users, cutting the price of domestic fuel bills. In a
recent survey of participants in the gas market, the consultants Ernst &amp;
Young found that the majority believed increased competition would reduce
prices. But they also pointed to concerns that industrial users of
interruptible gas could face higher costs.
Interruptible gas users currently pay the cheapest prices for supply from
British Gas as the company reserves the right to cut them off during periods
of peak demand. Since it is almost impossible to make a profit on these
supplies, rivals have not entered the market. British Gas has, however,
signalled that, as its market share is eroded, it may retreat from this
market sector, or be forced to raise prices.
As the UK moves to free its gas market, many issues remain unresolved, not
least the sort of shape British Gas will find itself in by this time next
year. The MMC could well call for the monolithic British Gas to break up
into a into a series of regional supply companies, like those in the
privatised electricity industry, as a way to encourage competition.
Many observers believe that if British Gas had been privatised as a series
of smaller regional companies in the first place, there would have been no
need for the machinations of the past six years.
The MMC is sure to consider a recommendation by the OFT that British Gas
sell off its pipeline business as a separate entity. The OFT only backed off
from this demand in return for British Gas's co-operation with the rest of
its recommendations. Mr Jonathan Stern, independent gas expert, thinks that
British Gas stands a 50 per cent chance of being broken up. One of the few
things that are certain is that the industry will remain in limbo throughout
the MMC inquiry which is likely to take this year and most of next to
complete.
