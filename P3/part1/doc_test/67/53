LLOYDS BANK said last night it would continue its fight to buy Midland Bank,
its UK rival, in spite of the decision yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, to refer the proposed bid to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Mr Heseltine also said there was no reason for UK authorities to review
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's agreed Pounds 3.4bn takeover of
Midland. This leaves Hongkong Bank with a clear field to pursue its bid.
Lloyds said it was confident it could persuade the MMC that its bid was not
against the public interest and that it would consider sympathetically
making any undertakings to ensure this was the case.
'It's disappointing but not exactly surprising,' said Mr Brian Pitman,
Lloyds chief executive. He would be writing to Midland shareholders telling
them that they lost nothing by ignoring Hongkong Bank's offer.
'I am advised that should the Hongkong Bank offer fail they (Hongkong Bank)
have the ability to make a new offer after the MMC inquiry even if Lloyds is
not cleared to bid (by the MMC),' Mr Pitman said.
As widely predicted, Mr Heseltine said Lloyds' proposed bid raised
competition issues in the UK market which deserved referral to the MMC.
The MMC has been asked to produce its ruling by August 25. Only if the bid
is cleared could Lloyds make a formal offer.
Midland's shareholders therefore have to accept or reject Hongkong Bank's
merger proposal before the MMC has ruled whether to allow Lloyds'
considerably higher proposed bid.
Some institutional investors yesterday expressed disappointment, saying they
would have preferred to see either both bids referred or neither.
One Scottish fund manager said: 'I'm going to be a holdout.' He said he
believed Hongkong Bank would be forced to improve its bid before the offer
expired on June 9.
Mr Heseltine's decision was widely welcomed at Westminster where many
Conservative MPs are afraid a successful Lloyds bid would cost jobs and
reduce competition in retail banking.
A Lloyds takeover could result in the loss of some 1,100 bank branches and
more than 30,000 staff according to the Banking, Insurance and Finance
Union. Under the Hongkong proposal, Midland would retain its management and
identity and its network would stay intact.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, said Mr Heseltine's ruling meant
his was the only firm offer for Midland.
'It is one which the Midland board has supported from the outset, which
fully recognises the value of Midland and its strong UK franchises,' he
said.
The decision was also welcomed by Bifu, which interpreted Mr Heseltine's
decision as support for its opposition to the Lloyds bid. Mr Heseltine said
his reference did not pre-judge the issue of whether the merger was against
the public interest.
His decision is the latest blow to Lloyds' proposed Pounds 3.7bn bid. On
Thursday. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner,
said there was no need for a lengthy investigation into Hongkong Bank's
merger proposal as the two banks competed in different sectors.
In spite of the apparent setback, some institutional shareholders said that
Lloyds, though bloodied by Mr Heseltine's decision, was not out of the
fight. Shareholders are also aware that the Lloyds bid, if allowed by the
MMC, would represent a rare opportunity to rationalise an industry where
there is overcapacity. Such a move could raise the financial returns from
the sector in the long term.
Some Tory MPs remained worried that the Hongkong bid had been given an
unfair advantage and that the two bidders were not on a level playing field.
Lloyds's shares fell 3p to 427p, while Midland's share price rose 6p to
405p.
