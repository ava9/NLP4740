FT  08 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Euro telecom alliances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Franco-German telecoms alliance announced yesterday provokes a certain
queasiness. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are Europe's two largest
telecommunications operators, are still state-owned and have wide-ranging
monopoly powers. There is a danger that, by joining forces, they will form a
cartel dominating the heart of Europe.
Yet it would be wrong to oppose the link-up on principle. The division of
Europe's telecommunications market on national lines is the result of a long
history of state-run monopoly. Now that markets are slowly being opened to
competition and carriers are being privatised, it is natural for the
industry to restructure on cross-border lines.
The Franco-German alliance is a milestone in this trend. Other examples
include British Telecom's alliance with MCI of the US, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's Worldsource consortium and a three-way link-up between the
Dutch, Swedish and Swiss operators, called Unisource.
The benefits for customers from an end to the industry's balkanisation could
be considerable. The main potential prizes are an end to the 'frontier
effect', under which cross-border calls typically cost three times as much
as national calls of the same distance, and a wider range of trans-European
business services.
This is not to say that Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are motivated by
a desire to deliver lower call charges. Their alliance seems largely
defensive, stemming from fear that their monopoly bases could be eroded by
competition from BT and AT&amp;T. The duo believe they will be more able to
withstand competition if they form a united front.
Retrograde step
Nor is it to say that the benefits of an end to balkanisation will flow
through to customers automatically. If the Franco-German link-up delays
competition, it will be a retrograde step.
The details of the deal are less alarming than feared when news of it first
leaked last month. Early reports suggested that the two groups wished to
merge all their international activities, including ordinary phone calls,
and also link up with AT&amp;T. Such a deal between the world's three biggest
international carriers might indeed, as BT said, have been 'grotesque' -
particularly since the duo still have monopoly rights to provide ordinary
voice services.
The actual deal is more limited. It focuses on data services and value-added
business services, which have theoretically been liberalised throughout the
European Union. But there are still concerns. In the short term, it remains
to be seen whether the markets for data services are genuinely open to
competition. In the longer term, plans for the duo to take equity stakes in
each other and expand their alliance may prove anti-competitive. The danger
is that they could exclude rivals from their markets and use their enlarged
home base to dominate other markets.
Public interest
Rather than blocking such link-ups and so losing the potential benefits of
cross-border restructuring, Europe's competition authorities must seek to
make alliances work in the public interest. This means adopting a more
vigorous approach to opening up markets.
So far, the European Commission has been rather timid. Under its latest
plans, not only will liberalisation of basic voice services be delayed until
1998. There is also no sign that competitors will be allowed to build their
own networks, meaning they will have to rely on infrastructure owned by the
national monopolies.
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom yesterday showed no sign of wanting more
radical action. Nor did the EU's telecom ministers, also meeting in
Brussels.
Things might be different if Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission's
president, realised the connection between liberalisation and his
much-cherished goal of trans-European networks. The end to Europe's
balkanisation, at least in telecommunications, will not best be achieved by
the Commission launching 'Brussels bonds' and channelling the funds to
monopolies. A better approach would be to open up the market and rely on
competitive private enterprise to build the infrastructure. Mr Delors should
devote his energies to securing this end.
