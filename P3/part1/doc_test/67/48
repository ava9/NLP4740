FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Trans World/Emap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Trans World Communications yesterday said that the offer of
181p per share from Emap - which now speaks for 51.7 per cent of Trans
World's equity - did not represent an adequate premium for control of the
company.
The board said it was also unable to satisfy itself that Emap's proposals
were above legal challenge.
The Guardian Media Group, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, has
signified its agreement with the Trans World board's conclusion and is
seeking leave to apply for judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision
not to object to it.
The Trans world board reiterated its rejection of the offer and advised
shareholders to take no action.
