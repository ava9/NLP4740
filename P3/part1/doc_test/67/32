bid

Emap, the media and exhibitions group, is expected to go ahead next week
with a bid for the Trans World Communications commercial radio group if
agreement cannot be reached by then.
Conversations continued yesterday between the two sides to clarify the
situation following the announcement that Emap had an agreement with Mr Owen
Oyston, the Lancashire millionaire, to buy his 22 per cent stake at 181p.
As Emap already holds 30 per cent of the company this would give the group
control although it is seeking a recommended bid. The deal would value Trans
World at about Pounds 70m.
The proposition is controversial because an Emap takeover of Trans World
would breach the number of radio licences that a single company could hold.
Trans World operates a total of eight local radio services in the UK in
Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds and Preston and has a market value of Pounds 65m.
In the event that an offer is made, the Radio Authority has agreed that an
'ownership structure' could be put in place to cover part of Emap's radio
interests to comply with the rules.
