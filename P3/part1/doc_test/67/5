FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT extends time frame for bids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink, the credit reference company caught in a bidding war, has
altered its articles of association so that offers for the company can
proceed.
The group is being fought over by Equifax, the US credit data group, which
is now offering 650p a share against its original offer of 500p, and Trans
Union, Equifax's main US rival, which is offering 550p.
UAPT's board had recommended Trans Union's lower offer, which was to have
closed on August 31, because Trans Union has no UK operations and so does
not risk a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Equifax
already owns a credit information business in the UK.
However, UAPT's board has now rescinded its recommendation, effectively
leaving the outcome of the bidding war to the OFT.
