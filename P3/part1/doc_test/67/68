TRANS World Airline, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday named Mr William
Howard as chairman when the company emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection later this summer.
As a result of the appointment, tomorrow's US bankruptcy court hearing to
confirm TWA's reorganisation plans has been postponed to August 11.
TWA has been operating under Chapter 11 since January 1992.
The company said yesterday that more than 90 per cent of each of its
unsecured creditor classes had voted in favour of reorganisation.
TWA's unions and creditors have been pressing for an experienced outsider to
help lead the company. Attempts to woo Mr Lee Iacocca, former head of
Chrysler, failed late last year.
Mr Howard, 71, is credited with the success of Piedmont Airlines which he
headed in the 1980s.
He is popular with labour groups - which is important since TWA's unions
will own 45 per cent of the re-organised common stock and have four seats on
the board.
Mr Howard left Piedmont in 1987, when it was acquired by USAir.
Mr Howard faces a daunting task. Competition remains fierce, and TWA has
lost some of its most valuable routes, such as New York-Heathrow which was
sold by Mr Carl Icahn, TWA's former owner, in 1991.
Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's two chief executives, will remain
with the company as vice-chairmen.
