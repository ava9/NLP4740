FT  21 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Airtours bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOSTILE bid by Airtours, Britain's third biggest package tour company,
for Owners Abroad, its larger rival, poses an interesting test for
competition policy. If the deal goes through, it will create a group with
almost a third of the UK package tour business, above the 25 per cent market
share which would normally prompt a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Airtours appears confident, nonetheless, that the Office of Fair Trading
will not recommend a reference. Whatever private reassurances it may have
received, the company can point to the MMC investigation into the 1988
takeover of Horizon by Thomson, the market leader. Though that deal also
breached the 25 per cent threshold, it was cleared by the MMC, which found
that vigorous competition would continue.
That view has been vindicated by subsequent price wars and by evidence that
Thomson's market share has fallen since the merger. However, circumstances
may have changed. While the Thomson takeover created one big group in an
otherwise highly fragmented market, the Airtours deal would create a duopoly
accounting for some two-thirds of package tour sales.
Such an outcome need not be against the public interest. Duopolists compete
fiercely in industries like soft drinks. In package tours, the emergence of
larger groups may even yield consumer benefits by bringing much-needed
stability. There may also be opportunities for larger operators to reap
scale economies, for example in hotel bookings.
The task for policy is to ensure that competitive pressures push these gains
on to consumers. The principal issue is less duopoly per se than the trend
to vertical integration. If the merger succeeds, the two biggest tour
operators will also control three of the UK's charter airlines and almost a
third of package tour sales.
There is a risk that dominant groups might discriminate against independent
competitors by, for example, denying them access to charter capacity in boom
times and refusing to sell their products when demand is weak. If the
Airtours merger is allowed to proceed, the OFT should make clear its
determination to prevent any such abuses. Better still, the MMC should be
asked to examine the package tour business in depth.
