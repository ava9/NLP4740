FT  17 NOV 93 / IMF lightens the gloom in Moldova: 'Impressive' economic
reforms by the republic have raised hopes of loans

THE street lights are few and the shops close early because of severe energy
shortages, but prospects have brightened in Moldova, one of the smallest
former Soviet republics.
Following strong backing for its reform programme by the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, this agricultural state, sandwiched between
Ukraine and Romania, could become one of the few ex-Soviet republics to
conclude a stand-by arrangement with the IMF this year.
If the government agrees to speed up privatisation, implement tighter
monetary policy and liberalise foreign trade and prices, it could unlock
Dollars 70m of badly needed external financing.
This would be in addition to a Dollars 32m loan under the IMF's new systemic
transformation facility  - designed to aid countries in transition to a
market economy  - agreed in September, and a Dollars 60m rehabilitation loan
from the World Bank agreed last month.
The reform programme of Mr Andrei Sanagheli's government sets targets for
1994 which include:
curbing inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of the year, down from a
monthly average of 31 per cent in the first nine months of this year;
reducing the budget deficit from this year's 6 per cent of GDP target to 3.5
per cent;
privatising one-third of state property.
Hopes of a deal are high, with the IMF and World Bank describing Moldova's
reforms as 'impressive' and pointing to a greater degree of consensus on
reform among Moldova's leadership than in other parts of the former Soviet
Union.
The government has already taken some bold and politically difficult steps.
In September, it raised bread and milk prices eightfold overnight, reducing
subsidies from 80 to 40 per cent. World Bank officials say it has also
stopped granting preferential credits to state companies, some of which were
receiving loans at 15-20 per cent, well below the 170 per cent re-financing
rate.
It also launched a mass privatisation programme last month, with its first
voucher-based auction. Under the scheme, Moldovans receive vouchers
according to the number of years they have worked for the state. They can
use the vouchers to buy their homes or to buy shares in the 1,580 state
commercial companies due to be auctioned off by the end of 1994.
A 50 per cent stake in companies in agro-processing  - an important sector
given that agriculture contributes around 40 per cent of Moldova's gross
national product  - is to be given to the farms that have supplied them for
the past 10 years, while the remainder will be auctioned.
The State Department for Privatisation hopes to interest foreign investors
once companies have been transferred to private ownership. According to Mr
Vissarion Cheshuev, the SDP's general director, foreign companies will have
access to a stock exchange, due to be set up next year, which will trade
shares in the privatised companies. They can also form joint ventures under
existing regulations.
By October, foreign investors from east and west Europe and the US, had
invested Dollars 52m in some 170 joint ventures, many of them in
agro-processing. But few expect foreign investment to accelerate until the
country resolves the conflict in its eastern Trans-Dnestr region.
Fearing that the country's ethnic Romanian majority would seek reunification
with Romania, Russian speakers on the left bank of the Dnestr river three
years ago declared themselves independent from the Moldovan government in
Chisinau and set up their own state.
A tense ceasefire has held since fighting claimed hundreds of lives last
year, but the conflict and the splitting of the country in two has
undermined the economy and complicated reform efforts.
It has also soured Moldova's relations with Russia, which has supported the
separatists both financially and through the former Soviet Union's 14th army
stationed in Tiraspol, Trans-Dnestr's 'capital'.
Russia's support of the Trans-Dnestrans is one reason why the Moldovan
parliament, which includes a sizeable lobby demanding unification with
Romania, voted against joining the Commonwealth of Independent States in
August.
However, President Mircea Snegur convinced the parliament and the country
that this decision would lead to economic disaster for Moldova, which
imports most of its raw materials and 90 per cent of its fuel from the CIS,
and he signed the economic union agreement with Russia and other former
Soviet republics in Moscow in September.
'We have to accept that our economy is nothing but part of a former huge
country's economy,' he says.
The president says the majority of Moldovans never favoured reunification
with Romania and that the country will pursue a 'strong policy of
co-operation with the east'.
But the government's attempts at rapprochement with Moscow appear to have
done little so far to resolve the situation in Trans-Dnestr.
President Boris Yeltsin declined to receive President Snegur on an official
visit to Moscow last month, in spite of Mr Snegur's strong support for Mr
Yeltsin in his battle against parliament.
