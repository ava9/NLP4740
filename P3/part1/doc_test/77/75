Oh, no! Not another feminist revue, Alice! Please say it isn't so! 
</P>
<P>
That might be one's first reaction to the nomenclature -- "feminist revue" -- 
but "A . . . My Name Is Alice," which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage, is more winning than its English primer title. 
</P>
<P>
It has class and a decidedly optimistic (if slightly diffused) point of view, 
delivered by a sum total of 28 savvy contributors (from Amanda McBroom to Steve 
Tesich) and a director who understands the value of restraint (Julianne Boyd). 
</P>
<P>
Boyd and film maker Joan Micklin Silver ("Crossing Delancey") originally 
conceived of "Alice" as a response to the more militant feminist outbursts of 
the angrier 1960s. They took their time to collect their material and pare the 
show down to size, assembling and disassembling this collage of songs and 
scenes, until they had it the way they wanted it. That was 1983. In its present 
form, "Alice" is about many aspects of being female -- good and bad -- in a 
world populated by men and other creatures, all given their due. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't gripe. 
</P>
<P>
Au contraire. Upbeat is the name of this game. If "Alice" can be chided for 
anything, it would be for managing to remain inoffensive. It has its occasional 
cliches (yet another sketch or two set in the confessional of the beauty 
parlor) and its sentimental indulgences (as in a daughter's song to the mother 
she feels she has failed, or the sisters who learn to appreciate one another 
rather late in life). But these are bracketed by enough bracing self-mockery, 
good humor, keen observation and plain fun to serve as appropriate and even 
welcome pace-changers. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the show's success rests with the five performers in charge: the 
quizzical Roo Brown, brash young Rozz Morehead, hip Susan Mosher, elegant 
Michele Pawk and big-voiced and big-hearted Avery Sommers. Each is distinct, 
talented and unstereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
At about two hours with an intermission, the performers riff through "Alice," 
moving with ease from the wistful ("At My Age," wherein an inexperienced 
18-year-old and a widow-of-a-certain-age share counterpoint tribulations about 
the trials of blind dates) to the sly ("I Like the Boys," says Morehead in a 
celebration of the gentler, kinder elements in the opposite sex), to the 
out-and-out parodies of a kindergarten teacher-parent conference (Brown and 
Pawk) and a macho all-female basketball team ("Good Sports"). 
</P>
<P>
The Act One finale, "Bluer Than You," is an artful lesson in how to top the 
other person at feeling sorry for yourself ("My man called me such terrible 
names . . ." -- "Your Man speaks to you?" or "When I get up in the morning . . 
. " -- "You can get up in the morning?"). 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like this, with the second half serving up more of the same and 
hitting such familiar locales as a male strip joint ("Pretty Young Men") and 
the inevitable psychiatric clinic ("Honeypot," raised a couple of notches by 
Sommers' joyously sexual performance). Along the way we go through the 
seemingly unrelated but amusing vamping of a German-born French chanteuse 
(Pawk) and Morehead's rousing declaration of independence when she tells her 
decamping boy-friend that parting as enemies beats the dickens out of parting 
as friends. 
</P>
<P>
A delectable leitmotif that repeats throughout the evening is the reading of 
poems by Brown "from my collection, 'For Women Only.' " The poems change, but 
their hilarious awfulness doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Faulkner has designed a simple platform set, simply lit by John B. 
Forbes. But "Alice" is not about settings or costumes (by Shigeru Yaji). It is 
about lampooning at its merriest and mildest. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice" lacks the outrage satire requires. And even though the show is only six 
years old, its targets are beginning to feel worn. They were predictable to 
start with and have since been hit by others. What this production has going 
for it chiefly is quality -- in the performers and in the distinction of the 
individual sketches. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Alice" is everything that the long-running "Six Women With 
Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know" aspires to be but isn't. You can't 
rise much above written material any more than you can sink too far below it. 
Saturday night's spontaneous ovation for "Alice" partially at least attests to 
that. A final word of commendation: Musicians James Raitt and Gary Scott are 
terrific.
