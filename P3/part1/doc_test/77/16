<P>
A British fighter pilot's log book recording the shooting down of "Red Baron" 
Manfred von Richthoven in World War I was sold today for $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
The auction house Christie's said a businessman in the northern English city of 
Manchester bought the log book in a telephone bid at the sale of aviation art 
and literature held at the Commonwealth Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer wanted to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The log book belonged to a friend of the late Lt. Lionel Lomas, a member of the 
flight led by Capt. Roy Brown, a Canadian, who is credited with shooting down 
the famous German ace behind British lines over the Somme battlefield on April 
21, 1918. 
</P>
<P>
The log records that on that day, 14 British Camel fighters attacked 24 enemy 
planes, shooting down three, and that Brown brought down Richthofen.
