  [Text] President Akayev on Tuesday [28 June] held a full 
government meeting to discuss what could be done to straighten 
out the country's fuel and energy complex and prepare the 
economy for next autumn and winter season. Heads of ministries 
and departments and regional administrators were also involved. 
  Akayev described as hard the situation emerging in the fuel 
and energy complex saying that nothing was being done to start 
preparations for the coming winter. He said the country "will 
find itself in a position worse than last year" unless drastic 
measures were taken soon. 
  Akayev called to step up coal production and work out a 
strategy for the development of the sector including marketing 
opportunities at home and in Central Asia. He backed up a 
proposal to allocate DM 10 million for a coal briquetting 
project expressing confidence about the development prospects of 
the coal industry. 
  However, many speakers called for a 40 million soms worth of 
fuel subsidies arguing that most of the ordinary consumers would 
not be able to buy fuel because of high coal prices and 
transport costs. The president instructed the government to 
allocate 14 million soms to this end, with the remainder to be 
raised by local administrators. IF Note: Kyrgyzstan is 
expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes of coal this year, one 
million tonnes less than it needs. Kazakhstan has now agreed to 
deliver the required amount and agreement was reached on imports 
of one billion cu meters of gas from neighboring Uzbekistan. 
  As a matter of urgency, Akayev called for the national 
economy to be transferred to electricity proposing that the 
government raise 27 million soms to complete two large 
hydro-electric stations at Shamaldy-Sai and Tash-Kumyr. The 
cabinet was also instructed to raise funds for imports of large 
capacity transformer equipment. Akayev approved a recent deal 
with Switzerland which will provide a $10 million credit to put 
up three high capacity transformer substations in the country. ( 
Kyrgyzstan whose annual electricity needs run at 10 billion kWh 
produces 12 billion kWh. Talks are in progress to export extra 
electricity to Kazakhstan -- IF). 
  Akayev said everything must be done to implement the 
energy-saving program which can help the republic save up to one 
third of the total electricity produced. He also called for a 
review of the country's energy development concept taking into 
account the energy situation in neighboring states. 
  Akayev proposed that an integrated research must be 
conducted 
into the sources of power generation with costly fossil fuels to 
be replaced by unconventional sources for electricity generation. 
  He warned that each official would be held responsible for 
the preparation of the country's economy for the coming winter.
