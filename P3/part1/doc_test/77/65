  [Text] ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh will visit 
Tehran in mid-April for talks with the Economic Cooperation 
Organization (ECO) secretariat on establishing economic, trade 
and tourism links between the two regional groupings. 
  Ajit Singh, who is attending the three-day closed-door 
Special Senior Asean Officials Meeting (SOM) in Bangkok, said 
the ECO had expressed an interest in closer ties. It was also 
in line with the decision of the third Asean summit in Singapore 
in 1992 to develop closer relations with other regional 
groupings. 
  "It will be a preliminary, exploratory visit to study the 
possible scope of relations between Asean and the ECO," he said. 
The 10-member ECO groups Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan 
and the former Soviet Muslim republics of Kazakhstan, 
Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
Ajit Singh will visit Pakistan on the return trip. 
  Last year he led a delegation to China that concluded with 
Beijing opening a new chapter in science and technology 
cooperation with Asean. He recently made an official visit to 
Vietnam and Laos, who became Asean observers in 1992. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suwit Simasakun said yesterday 
Burma must be brought into the mainstream of regional affairs. 
Asean members had agreed in principle that Burma should be 
invited to attend the Asean meeting in July, but there was still 
no agreement on what status Rangoon should have. 
  The SOM meeting, attended by senior Asean foreign affairs, 
security and intelligence officials, yesterday reviewed security 
in the region and made preparations for the first Asean Regional 
Forum (ARF) on July 25. An Asean official said the regional 
issues touched were on Burma, the South China Sea, the Korean 
peninsula and Cambodia, relations with major powers like China, 
the US, Japan and Russia. 
  The political cooperation issues covered included the Asean 
role in Zopfan -- the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality -- 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and confidence-building 
measures.
