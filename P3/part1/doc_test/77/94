Photo, "Like photography in the second half of the last century, the stories in 
'Sudden Fiction' have a way of working as a travelogue. These stories picture 
lives in distant lands in a way that makes it seem as if we know nothing of the 
people in these places." Photograph: Giorgio Sommer, "Spaghetti Eaters," 1875, 
courtesy of the Stephen White Collection, Beverly Hills. ; Photo, An 1862 
medical photo taken by Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne records 
research on the mechanics of human facial muscles. This picture and "The 
Spaghetti Eaters" (Page 1) appear in "Parallels and Contrasts," a catalogue of 
the traveling exhibit of early photographs owned by Los Angeles collector 
Stephen White. In his essay on the collection, Arthur Ollman writes of White's 
extraordinary images: "They offer more than new nuggets -- they relax the 
muscles and rattle the bones of the body of photographic history, a living 
organism far too young to ossify." The book is distributed by the University of 
New Mexico Press. Museum of Photogaraphic Arts, San Diego, May-June, 1990.
