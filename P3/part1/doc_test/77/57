Bread and flour prices were tripled yesterday in Uzbekistan, in an apparent
attempt to accommodate International Monetary Fund recommendations and
finally obtain currency support.
President Islam Karimov also issued a decree awarding direct payments to
'virtually every adult to compensate for the price rise'.
Taken with other recent policy changes in Uzbekistan, the announcement
implies Mr Karimov is more willing to risk shifting from the safer political
ground to which he has adhered since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
The price rises follow a halting of subsidies to state enterprises and a
move to a floating exchange rate. An IMF mission is due in Tashkent starting
Sept 16, to evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of Uzbekistan's
currency, the som, on July 1 last.
Until now, the IMF has refused to provide support for the Uzbekistan som,
which since its introduction has weakened from seven to 18 to the dollar.
The IMF has insisted the government adopt structural changes, chiefly
freeing interest and currency exchange rates.
Mr Karimov may have trouble persuading the IMF to reverse its position.
Economists say he has kept indirect subsidies to state banks, and retained
the ability of targeted enterprise to buy cheap dollars for imports or
equipment.
