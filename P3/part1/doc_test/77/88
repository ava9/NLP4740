IMPERIAL WARRIOR: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT ALLENBY
1861-1936
by Lawrence James
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 279 pages
VISCOUNT ALLENBY, the victor of Megiddo and pacifier of Egypt, is a hard
target for the biographer to get in range. Nicknamed 'the Bull', he
successively projected different personae. He was by turns a 'pattern'
general, product of the Arnoldian public school system and Sandhurst, and
the closest thing to George Patton among Britain's First World War generals.
Sometimes he commanded by numbers, sometimes he exhibited sustained bursts
of military genius.
He only joined the army because he failed the Indian Civil Service entrance.
He also failed the Staff College exam on the first sitting. Nevertheless TE
Lawrence, who knew him as well as any man, could write: 'Allenby was so
great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him.' If Allenby
was great, then he was a late developer.
The key to the character may well be the same as the key to the life:
Allenby took a while to find his own range, but once he had done so, he was
magnificent. His appetite for traditional soldiering - sweeping movements of
well-disciplined, well-equipped and well-provisioned armies in the service
of a cause - was singularly at odds with conditions on the Western Front,
but came into its own in Palestine, on the periphery of the war.
Yet the huge, polyglot triumph of Megiddo (under his command he had ANZAC,
Indian, French, Armenian and Nigerian as well as British battalions) was not
his finest hour: that came four years later, in 1922, when as High
Commissioner in Egypt he took on Lloyd-George and the Cabinet. The
government wanted the Wafd nationalist revolt crushed and British rule
re-imposed, if necessary by maximum force. Allenby saw that a reasonable
accommodation of Egypt's nationalist aspirations was the only course likely
to secure control of the Suez Canal. In a Downing Street showdown he got his
way.
Allenby had proved himself not only a capable administrator but an astute
politician to boot. He had spotted the great contradiction in British Middle
East policy. On the one hand, if only to keep the French out, London had
been prepared to grant Syrian Arabs independence; on the other, it sought to
keep Egypt and the Sudan within the colonial fold. Britain could not have it
both ways. The alternative would have been to argue in favour of France's
share of the post-Ottoman prize.
Whereas previous biographies have tended to gloss over Allenby's final
incarnation, Lawrence James gives it detailed attention, even at the cost of
an authorial contradiction. Imperial Warrior concedes that its subject,
sorting out the Egyptians, 'was a pragmatist first and an Imperialist
second'. 'Pragmatic Warrior' might have been the more accurate, if less
sellable, title.
Through the discontinuities of Allenby's career a unifying strand can be
found: a canny regard for his own advancement guided by a sober attachment
to duty. Allenby must have loathed serving under Haig in Flanders, but he
had too much nous to bad-mouth his superior. The spectacular spleen was
always reserved for subordinates; and it is indicative that the Field
Marshal did not write, let alone publish, his memoirs. This sets the
biographer at a disadvantage. Apart from some letters to his much-loved
wife, there is little or no window on the inner man.
But Lawrence James pulls a splendid rabbit from an unpromising hat. The
strength of Imperial Warrior is its author's grasp of the history. Quite
properly, the life is the campaigns fought. James makes fine sense of the
Boer War (which created the disciplinarian and tempered the cavalry
officer), the deadlock of the Western Front, the eastern Mediterranean and
Egypt itself.
Amid the flow of dispassionate judgments, there is room also for anecdote.
We are reminded how, at the turn of the century, one Major-General Brabazon
seriously suggested that the cavalry should be re-equipped with battle-axes,
since these were 'ideally suited to the Anglo-Saxon temperament'. Of Allenby
in Palestine we learn that he frequently drove to the front-line in a
Rolls-Royce, while the RFC dropped cartons of cigarettes laced with opium on
already demoralised Turkish troops. Best of all is an account of Allenby's
intelligence officer in August 1914: keen to discover the pace of the German
advance, Colonel George Barrow telephoned every station in Belgium from
Mons. 'A reply in French or Flemish indicated they were still in Belgian
hands. Silence or a German voice meant that they had been taken.'
