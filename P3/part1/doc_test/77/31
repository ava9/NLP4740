Laurie Shields, one of two California women who organized the national Older 
Women's League in 1981, died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She was 68 and died at her home in Oakland of breast cancer, said league 
spokeswoman Mary Gardner Jones in a statement issued in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Laurie Shields was an indomitable woman who was fired by concern for displaced 
homemakers and older women -- women confronted by widowhood, divorce and sex 
and age discrimination," said Lou Glasse, president of the Older Women's 
League. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Team Effort 
</P>
<P>
"Women all across the country have lost a powerful force," Glasse said. "She 
will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
With Tish Sommers, who died in 1985, Ms. Shields started a grass-roots movement 
for older women's rights which now is a Washington-based organization with 
17,000 members and 120 chapters nationwide. Earlier, in 1975, they had founded 
the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers Among the league's many targets are 
inequities facing older women in the job market, in pension plans, Social 
Security and insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Using the slogan "Don't Agonize -- Organize," the two women helped inspire 
federal legislation that set up job training and counseling centers for what 
they called "displaced homemakers" -- housewives whose lives changed 
drastically in middle-age because of a divorce or death of a husband. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Shields had painful personal knowledge of the problems of older women. 
After her husband died in 1970, "she found herself unable to get a job because 
of age discrimination," the league said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book Published 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Shields and Ms. Sommers wrote a book called, "Women Take Care," about the 
experience of care givers. It was published after Ms. Sommers' death. 
</P>
<P>
During a national book tour, Ms. Shields said that the care-giving movement 
should support those who choose not to be care givers as well as those who do. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I chose to be a care giver twice . . . it's not a role that is 
everyone's cup of tea," she said. "We must work together to prevent society 
from force-feeding it to the women simply because it is perceived to be a 
woman's role." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Ms. Shields worked in merchandise and advertising before 
marrying. She is survived by a daughter.
