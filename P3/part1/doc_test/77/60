declaration of victory - Industry and the economy

This summer, Luxembourg's Industry Federation, Fedil, somewhat grudgingly
declared victory in the battle against recession. Order books were filling
and margins improving, the federation conceded, although it cautioned that
the recovery would not be fully evident until 1995.
Why the reluctance? For Fedil, the downturn has been a useful stick with
which to beat the government for what the industrialists see as its failure
to tackle the structural problems of the Luxembourg economy, which they view
as a threat to the country's long-term competitiveness.
To drive home the point, the federation sent an elegantly-produced
'memorandum' to the 60 MPs elected in the June 12 general election, entitled
The Economic, Social and Environmental Policy Stakes.
The document called for a series of measures to assist economic development
in general and industry in particular, including a reduction in the overall
level of corporate taxation, greater state assistance in cash and kind for
the creation of new enterprises, the abolition - or at least modification -
of the automatic system of salary indexation, and greater flexibility in
employment regulations.
At the top of the hit-list of Fedil and other employers' groups is the
cost-of-living indexation of salaries, which they say fuels inflation and
keeps Luxembourg producers at a disadvantage vis a vis competitors abroad.
'We must stimulate the spirit of enterprise and entrepreneurship,' says Mr
Marc Assa, the federation's president. 'The enterprise is the basis of a
nation's prosperity and well-being, and we must not allow this reality out
of our sight.'
For years, Fedil has been arguing that unless the authorities take action,
Luxembourg risks the displacement of its industrial activity to countries
with lower costs. But the trend in industrial investment seems, if anything,
to belie that.
Certainly, Sommer Allibert, the French industrial group of which Mr Assa is
chief executive, does not seem worried about Luxembourg's future
competitiveness. In September, the group inaugurated two new factories at
Eselborn in northern Luxembourg to manufacture vehicle components and floor
coverIngs, an investment totalling nearly two billion francs.
Mr Assa used the occasion to announce that Sommer had decided to invest a
further billion francs in the Grand Duchy for the development and
introduction of new products geared to meeting tougher European
environmental standards, as well as the creation of a research and
development centre.
This decision, he noted, was due in part to the advantageous economic
environment.
Although no new large-scale, multi-billion-franc projects have been
announced in Luxembourg recently, several have come on line, such as
Guardian's automotive glass products facility near Grevenmacher in the east,
or are being implemented, such as a toy factory for the US Rubbermaid group
in Differdange and a wood products plant for Austrian company Kronospan in
Sanem.
The jobs created by the American and Austrian investments, in an area of
southern Luxembourg which 20 years ago was almost entirely dependent on the
steel industry, illustrates the success of the policy of industrial
diversification pursued by successive Luxembourg governments.
The policy, backed up by extensive construction of infrastructure and a
package of tax incentives, has been aimed at small projects as well as
large, and made the Grand Duchy an exporter of composite materials for
Formula 1 cars and of Japanese mushrooms as well as of glass, aluminium foil
and videotapes.
Meanwhile, Luxembourg's steel producer, Arbed, is resurfacing after a big
downturn which brought group losses of LFr5.7bn last year. The group now
says it hopes to be back in the black for 1994.
In the early 1970s, Arbed employed more than 27,000 people in the Grand
Duchy. By the end of 1996 this figure will be nearer 6,000. But the company
is in the middle of a LFr18bn modernisation programme which involves the
installation of electric arc furnaces and continuous casting facilities at
three Luxembourg sites and one in Thuringia, Germany.
The group's confidence was emphasised earlier this year by its decision to
acquire a controlling interest in the struggling Bremen-based Klockner Stahl
through its Belgian subsidiary, Sidmar of Ghent. The deal makes Arbed
Europe's third-largest steelmaker after France's Usinor-Sacilor and British
Steel.
Arbed's steady shedding of manpower has been achieved without any
significant increase in unemployment. The jobless total peaked in January at
some 4,800 and now seems to have stabilised at about 4,000, some 2.4 per
cent of the workforce. That figure is double the average unemployment figure
as recently as 1990, but it must be set against an increase in total
employment between 1990 and 1993 of some 19,000 jobs.
Of the total 187,000 employees in March 1993, more than 47,000 were
cross-border commuters from Belgium, France and Germany. Together with
resident non-Luxembourgers, foreigners have accounted for a majority of jobs
since 1992 and last year they occupied nearly 53 per cent of jobs.
The steady increase in employment (or at least of foreigners - the number of
Luxembourgers has been falling in absolute terms since 1991) has slowed in
the past couple of years, reflecting an economic downturn which bottomed out
at 0.3 per cent growth last year.
Only in the first quarter of 1993 did the economy actually contract - by 0.3
per cent.
The official forecasts of growth of 1.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent
next are already being overtaken. Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, finance minister,
presenting his draft 1995 budget to parliament in September, said he was
calculating on growth of 2.9 per cent.
The downturn has left its scars, however. The number of bankruptcies has
risen from 100 in 1991 to 233 last year and 125 in the first four months of
this year.
But there is at least one sector where recovery is already being celebrated.
Commercial property, which was the first to hit the doldrums, now seems well
set to grow, According to property brokers Jones Lang Wootton, the amount of
empty office space fell by about 35 per cent last year as demand picked up.
Office blocks which stood empty for months are filling up as firms,
particularly in the financial sector, take the plunge into new premises. New
developments are under way in the Luxembourg City suburbs of Kirchberg and
Gasperich, and a business park near the city's airport is now full,
practically to the last square metre.
