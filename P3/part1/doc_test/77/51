  [Text] Bishkek, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Voters in Kyrgyzstan 
responded massively Sunday [30 January] to a "vote of 
confidence" referendum to endorse the shock therapy mandate of 
reformist President Askar Akayev. 
  Around 88 per cent of voters in the small central Asian 
state 
had cast their ballot with four hours of polling remaining, a 
member of the central election commission told AFP. 
  Polling stations closed at 8.00 p.m. (1400 GMT) with 
preliminary results Sunday night. 
  Pre-vote opinion polls showed Akayev would win his gamble 
with between 60 percent and 70 percent backing for his reform 
programme. 
  The only head of state among the five former Soviet 
republics 
in central Asia not to have been a communist leader, Akayev 
announced the vote amid a social and economic crisis for his 
radical reform programme launched in July 1992. 
  The reforms, instigated in conjunction with the 
International 
Monetary Fund by a man with a reputation as a good democrat, 
have undermined Akayev's popularity. 
  Average monthly salaries now stand at 135 soms (around 15 
dollars), just 35 soms above the estimated absolute minimum 
necessary for survival. 
  When the reforms were launched, Akayev predicted that the 
economy would stabilise by the end of 1992. But by the end of 
last year annual inflation was still running at around 1,600 
percent, while national income had fallen by 17 percent during 
the year. 
  Observers said that Akayev's decision to call the referendum 
had also been influenced by criticism that his initial election, 
in October 1991 with 95 percent of the vote, lacked legitimacy. 
  Victory would mean the continuation of his bid to drag the 
country's 4.5 million inhabitants out of poverty. 
  It would also strengthen Akayev's hand in his three-way 
battle for political supremacy with the communist-dominated 
parliament and with opposition forces within the legislature 
calling for fresh elections. 
  Topchubek Tursunaliyev, who heads the opposition Free 
Kyrgyzstan party, accused Akayev of calling the plebiscite to 
"avoid the elections of which he is afraid." 
  "The president and parliament were elected under the Soviet 
constitution of 1977 and have no legitimacy since Kyrgyzstan 
adopted its own constitution last May," Tursunaliyev added. 
  Opposition forces including the Free Kyrgyzstan party also 
denounced "corruption and the mafia, which are rife here and are 
in the process of turning Kyrgyzstan into the Sicily of central 
Asia." 
  Akayev himself admitted last week that the country was 
wracked by widespread corruption, which he said had completely 
overrun the Interior Ministry. 
  A Western diplomat here added: "Akayev is a genuine democrat 
but he is not in complete control over what is happening in this 
country."
