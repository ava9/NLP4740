The Barbican's latest big concert series (February 25 - March 21) is a
celebration of Benjamin Britten by the London Symphony Orchestra and a whole
galaxy of singers, choirs, instrumentalists and composers, led by Mstislav
Rostropovich. He is its artistic director and guiding light; he is
conducting most of the concerts, playing the cello in two others, and
infusing everyone and everything with his overflowingly generous musical
personality.
This is, above all, his tribute to Britten, the last of the 'three composers
who have had the most influence in shaping my musical life': thus he writes
in a foreword to the LSO programme book, itself decked with photographs
documenting the association of Britten, Pears, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya
 -relatively short in clock-time (not quite two decades), infinitely
significant in creative terms.
But while the festival may focus on the artistic stimulus - of composer on
cellist (and soprano wife) and vice versa - that resulted from this
association, its programme is by no means narrowly single-minded. The LSO's
opening concert, last Thursday, had no Britten in it but much
Britten-by-reflection. The opening item was his little-known 1941
arrangement of the 'flowers' movement from the Mahler Third Symphony; the
finale was Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony, dedicated to him.
Mahler as Britten influence and Shostakovich as Britten's 20th-century
artistic companion-in-arms are potent, fascinating subjects that cropped up
again for examination in Sunday's two Barbican Hall concerts  - the
afternoon Borodin Quartet recital (which showed both Britten and
Shostakovich learning the metier of string-quartet composition) and the
evening LSO concert (which ended with Britten's 1939 Sinfonia da Requiem,
its anguish and consolatory calm deeply imbued with the spirit of Mahler's
Ninth Symphony). This intelligent artistic cross-referencing adds to the
excitement of the whole enterprise.
Another strand concerns Britten as enlightened patron of younger composers
such as Robert Saxton, Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews. All three are
featured during the series; for Thursday's concert the LSO had commissioned
Matthews's Memorial. This sombrely impressive single-movement threnody
attempts to capture in music a war-vision something like Lutyens's 'great
untriumphal arch' at Thiepval, commemorating the fallen of the Somme (where
Matthews's grandfather is buried).
A single pedal-note tolls in the bass throughout the 20-minute length. Above
it, reflections of two of Britten's most impassioned musical war-protests,
the Sinfonia da Requiem and the War Requiem, seem to play on Matthews's
harmonic language and the carefully graded evolution of his orchestral
writing from grim chordal stasis to hallucinatory fast flourishes. The
concentration on rhythmic variety-in-unity that has preoccuppied so much of
his recent orchestral composition - fast-moving, exuberantly punchy - here
works up a powerfully intense effect of slowly unfolding lamentation,
dignified yet forcefully disquieted.
On Sunday evening, alongside the Sinfonia da Requiem, there was another
Britten composition presaging war: the Piano Concerto, a bittersweet
cocktail of Shostakovich raucousness, Prokofiev-like virtuoso glitter and
wit, and Britten's own angular, quintessentially English lyricism. It was
expertly mixed and shaken by the pianist Barry Douglas and the vast
batteries of the LSO.
As a Britten conductor Rostropovich responds with an uninhibited fervour
that nevertheless proves apt only some of the time. He gave the Simple
Symphony so fiercely loving and drawn-out a bear-hug that its 'Sentimental
Saraband' all but collapsed under the strain; the slow sections of the
Sinfonia da Requiem were likewise distended. Even then, however, while
longing for a lighter touch and a sharper sense of half-lights and
expressively glancing orchestral effects, one tends to find oneself disarmed
by his all-embracing Britten enthusiasm.( The festival is supported by
Britten-Pears Foundation and Britten Estate.)
*****
Earlier on the opening evening of the festival there was real Britten to be
heard, though only for a select number of the audience. In the intimate
setting of St. Giles Cripplegate students of the Guildhall School of Music
presented Curlew River, the first of Britten's three Church Parables.
Even when they are encountered straight after work and at a church in the
very centre of a city, far from the hallowed rustic silence that the
composer had in mind, these remarkable pieces cast a unique spell. Curlew
River, a Japanese Noh play transferred to the misty fenland of East Anglia
and given a Christian slant, is probably the best of them. Its music is
spare, infinitely sensitive to the touch; its atmosphere is haunting.
Various student groups have tried their hands at the Church Parables over
the years, but the Guildhall's production, in the care of Jonathan Alver,
came closest to the exaggerated Noh-style gestures of the original. The
vocal parts, including Mark Milhofer's plangent Madwoman and Mark Evans's
sturdy Traveller, were without exception well taken. Every good festival has
its fringe activities and the success of this one reflected well on the main
programme.
