  [Text] An extended meeting of the Kyrgyz Government took 
place in Bishkek yesterday. It was chaired by Prime Minister 
Dzhumagulov, and was attended by leaders of ministries, 
departments, and enterprises. The meeting discussed how to 
raise industry out of crisis. 
  The situation is very serious. In March, 65 enterprises 
ground to a halt. The production capacities of the remaining 
ones are half used. Warehouses have a surplus of goods in 
stock. Light industry alone is overstocked with goods to the 
value of 63.6 million soms and the level of indebtedness exceeds 
700 million soms. 
  A resolution was adopted on this issue and steps have been 
specified aimed at lifting the country's industry out of crisis.
