CHEFS have two sources of job satisfaction in addition to their pay packet.
The first is cooking for a busy restaurant. The second comes from finding
the right raw materials to prepare, cook and serve.
These two pleasures are mutually supportive: without the raw ingredients you
will not attract the discerning customers. Often such pleasures leave time
for little else. Marjan Lesnik, executive chef at Claridge's, London, had
not been home for three nights last week because the hotel was so busy, but
at the weekend he was up early picking wild mushrooms in Epping Forest,
hoping that the rain had brought out the chanterelles.
Until this year, British chefs had seen much of the best produce whisked
from under their noses by wholesalers prepared to pay higher prices for
trailerloads of Scottish salmon, langoustines, Cornish seabass and Somerset
elvers. These were delivered, via Calais, to top French, Spanish and Italian
kitchens.
Today, the market is changing as the recession affects demand from the rest
of Europe. In Spain restaurants have been cutting prices to stimulate
demand. In France, two-star Michelin chef Andre Daguin led a demonstration
of more than 300 chefs, dressed in their whites, in an attempt to bring the
plight of the French restaurant industry to his Government's attention. The
'franc fort' policy has put off tourists, recession is cutting corporate
entertainment and the industry has little tax relief on its major
investment, the training of young chefs. (I took the opportunity of writing
to the head of the Federation National des Hoteliers et Restaurateurs in
Paris suggesting the French equivalent of 'Lunch for a Fiver', the Weekend
FT's scheme for eating out cheaply, only to receive a haughty non).
The same circumstances now prevail in Italy, according to Priscilla
Carluccio who, with her husband Antonio, has just put together an extensive
selection of the best Italian ingredients, available from their shop in Neal
Street, London (tel: 071-240-1487). This is the first time that small
producers of such delicacies as wild chestnut jam, eight-year-old balsamic
vinegar or panforte have welcomed orders from the UK. Perhaps this is
largely because restaurants in Italy are cutting costs and ordering less
expensive produce.
Joel Antunes, the talented chef of Les Saveurs, in Curzon Street, Mayfair,
London, (tel: 071-491-8919) is one French chef who has been extremely
impressed with the quality of British produce since he arrived here two
years ago.
However, because Les Saveurs is French, no-one had bothered to introduce him
to British cheeses.
Happily I was able to help bridge that gap. At a test meal organised by the
host, everyone was happy with the menu and wines but then came the cheese
course. Two mature clarets were being served. Which cheeses, I was asked,
would I suggest?
'British,' I replied, only too well aware that the chef, manager and
sommelier would never consider such an option. I waxed lyrical about mature
Cheddar, Cotherstone, Spenwood and Mendip. I even suggested, a cheese
tasting at Neal's Yard Dairy, Covent Garden (071- 379-7646). Within minutes
they replied: they would be delighted to taste British cheeses, something
they had never done before. We agreed to meet under the awning outside the
theatre in Cambridge Circus where Les Miserables is playing.
At 4pm, in between the lunch and dinner services, I met Joel Antunes,
Emmanuel Manjuzan, the restaurant manager and Yves Saubova, the sommelier.
As soon as they walked into Neal's Yard Dairy their jaws dropped. Truckles
of mature Cheddar; turrets of farmhouse Lancashire, Cheshire and Colston
Bassett Stilton; goats' cheeses in all shapes and sizes; buckets of creme
fraiche and large pats of bright, yellow butter. Just to make them feel at
home, was a shelf of organic jams and mustards from France.
They held out their hands in silence for the cheese tasting, only asking
whether the cheeses were 'sheep, cow or goat.' Twenty cheeses later they had
made their choice for dinner - Keen's Cheddar, Spenwood (a hard sheeps' milk
cheese from Berkshire) and Gubbeen, a soft cows' milk cheese from Cork, in
the Irish Republic) although the cheese they bought for themselves was
Harbourne Blue, a goat's milk cheese from Devon.
As they left, with samples for their staff to taste, I asked if British
cheese would soon be on their French-only trolley. Back came a very French
reply: 'As soon as we have our first Michelin star', which, if cooking is
the criterion, should be early next year.
