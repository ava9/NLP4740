  [Text] Teams of 40 to 50 soldiers have been stationed on 
the nation's trains to protect passengers from continued Khmer 
Rouge attacks, the commander of the Royal Army's train 
protection force said. 
  Service on the Phnom Penh-Battambang and Phnom 
Penh-Sihanoukville train lines was halted for most of May 
because of attacks and damage to the tracks but resumed on May 
21, said the commander, Sok Nearadei. 
  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry 
of Defense authorised the resumption of service in late May, he 
said. The number of soldiers on board was doubled after service 
resumed. 
  "But I don't know whether they can maintain security for the 
passengers or not," he said. 
  Sok Nearadei has also contacted the provincial commanders on 
the trains' routes to make sure there have been no recent 
incidents that might jeopardize the safety of the passengers. 
  Since January 1993 there have been 72 attacks on the 
nation's 
two trains and their tracks, Sok Nearadei said. 
  In those attacks 76 people were killed, and 207 wounded. In 
addition, 10 train engines, 26 wagons, 11 bridges and 1,008 
meters of railway line were destroyed. 
  Though he said he hopes the teams of soldiers hired to 
protect the train will help to improve security, "Soldiers are 
helpless when it comes to the mines laid on tracks by guerrilla 
forces." 
  While local authorities in Kampot and Kompong Som Province 
have said that security seems to have improved, the train to 
Battambang is still plagued by Khmer Rouge activities. 
  On June 6 the Battambang train was delayed after the Kouk 
Trom bridge in northwestern Cambodia was destroyed. Service on 
the line currently ends in Pursat, but another train is running 
from Banteay Meanchey to Battambang.
