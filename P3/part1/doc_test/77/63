Sir, I refer to Steve Levine's article 'Uzbekistan courts 'His Majesty the
som' ' (July 2).
The west may wonder by what right the 'newly emerged' states can doubt the
prescriptions offered by developed countries, but this is to ignore the fact
that Uzbekistan is pursuing a transformation by means of its own strategy of
market reforms.
A favourable legal framework for market development has been created in
Uzbekistan. More than 50,000 enterprises have been privatised and the
proportion of national output produced by non-state enterprises is now a
third. Three years ago the state sector accounted for 100 per cent. The
practice of privileged loans to the state sector of the economy has been
stopped and a hard monetary policy adopted.
More than 1,000 joint ventures have been established. On May 5 1994 a law
was adopted offering foreign investors very favourable conditions, including
foreign investment risk insurance, and guarantees on the transfer of profits
and other funds in hard currency outside the republic without limitations.
The availability of credit facilities from the US, Germany, Japan, the UK,
France, Switzerland, Turkey and China indicates the degree of trust in our
policies. Many large companies invest in Uzbekistan. We expect stable growth
of investments in the coming years. One more fact supporting this predicted
trend is the convertibility of the som that started on August 1.
In the earlier article 'Flank left to fester' (February 16), Levine referred
to the lack of democratic rights and freedom in the central Asian countries.
I would suggest that 'musical comedy' opposition is not the best proof of
the presence of democracy. True democracy is being built over many decades
on the basis of the development of a market economy. After three years of
sovereignty, Uzbekistan has maintained its financial potential and is
gradually paving the way for a market economy.
The National Bank of Uzbekistan has established correspondent relations with
120 of the world's largest banks, it has become a member of the Swift,
Reuters and Visa and is involved in the development of foreign investments
worth more than USDollars 1bn. This allowed it to enter the top 1,000 banks
of the world, according to The Banker ranking (July 1994), where countries
of the former Soviet Union are presented only with Russian and Uzbek banks.
Government policy has the backing of the people of Uzbekistan, who have seen
that President Islam Karimov has been implementing policies to stabilise the
economy and strengthen the country's independence and have shown their
support with votes on the only true competitive presidential elections in
Central Asia.
