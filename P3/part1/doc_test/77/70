  [Text] Bishkek, 16 Jun -- "The som has strengthened its 
position," said Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov in an interview 
with a KYRGYZKABAR correspondent. "Judge for yourself. The 
inflation rate in February this year was 16.9 percent and in 
June, 3.5 percent. The national currency has also stabilized. 
One dollar now costs not 12.35 soms as in February, but 11.4. 
In March-April, production became more brisk and the tendency 
could have been maintained had inflation slowed down, but [word 
indistinct] on all kinds of industrial goods over a month has 
decreased by 28 percent. All of the national economy's 
indicators have deteriorated. To improve the situation, we need 
investors from outside, and we are looking for them. I recently 
met Salem Ehasesom [name as received], the representative of the 
World Bank. The topic under discussion was attracting 
investments to the mining industry. We have been told that the 
World Bank is looking for the funds to carry out a tender so as 
to finance geological surveys in this area. The problems are 
expected to be settled during a meeting in June in the U.S. city 
of Houston. We know that the donor countries, such as Norway, 
will render us consultative services not only for surveying oil 
fields, but also in elaborating the law on the use of nature. 
  "The Government of Kyrgyzstan is eager to render any kind of 
support to foreign entrepreneurs in surveying and developing gas 
and oil fields. 
  "The issue of investments will be the main topic on the 
agenda of the second meeting of the Japan-Kyrgyzstan economic 
commission, which is due to take place in November. I have the 
honor of being the chairman of this commission. We have 
prepared a number of projects for joint ventures with Japan in 
the food industry, for example, in the production of rice, baby 
food, silk, leather, and also in the mining industry. We should 
invigorate prospecting for oil and gas. Kyrgyzstan will give an 
advantage to those companies who have experience in developing 
oil and gas fields. He also said [as received] that in the near 
future we intend to open a free economic zone centered in 
Tokmak, near the capital. 
  "We can only add here that over one month, the money income 
of the population has decreased by 3 percent and spendings and 
savings have increased by 12.9 percent. In reality, 
accumulations have been minimal. In January-May, the savings 
bank of the Republic has attracted 5-percent less in savings 
than during the same period last year. 
  "There has also been a slowdown in business activities. For 
example, a number of commodity and raw materials exchanges has 
decreased twofold. More than 60 percent of their turnover comes 
from the machine-building industry, diesel fuel, and timber. 
  "In a nutshell, inflation has been brought to a minimum, but 
we have not yet started the structural transformations in 
industry. The Republic is awaiting a large Western credit, but 
it has not created conditions for invigorating investment 
activity."
