Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War (Oxford University 
Press: $19.95; 330 pages, illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
As the networks keep reminding us, World War II began 50 years ago, and Paul 
Fussell has something to say about our cultural memories of that war: We still 
haven't got it right. We are celebrating the 50 years as if they constituted a 
jubilee. If ever there were a war that deserved to be fought, declaims one 
commentator after another, the war that began in the fall of 1939 was it. The 
Good War. The Just War. 
</P>
<P>
Fussell, professor of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, is 
the author of a seminal work about World War I. In "The Great War and Modern 
Memory," he argued that the "civilized" European nations had no effective 
traditions to fall back on when confronted with the mustard gas, the 
shellshock, the trench warfare and the deadly attrition of those five years, 
1914-18. The Great War became therefore a myth-historical watershed, at once 
the source and the center of what is modern about modern life: self-doubt, 
philosophical fragmentation, biographical discontinuity, perpetual irony, the 
loss of heroic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
What then of the next war, which demoted the Great to the First? Like many a 
second child hardly as confident, boastful or dashing as the elder, World War 
II assumed to itself not glory but goodness, not brilliance but technical 
skill, not moral suasion but high-mindedness. The Allies entered the war, as 
Fussell shows in his new book, with displays of light armor and daydreams of 
"finesse, accuracy, and subtlety." They began with the conviction, for example, 
that through precision sighting, bombs could tell enemy soldiers from 
civilians, munition depots from milk depots, the guilty from the pure of heart. 
</P>
<P>
But war is obscene, insists Fussell, who led infantry troops into combat at age 
20 in 1944, and World War II was as obscene as it was "long, bloody, brutal, 
total and stupid." More civilian men, women and children were killed between 
1939 and 1945 than were soldiers, sailors and airmen. If four-letter words, 
uncivil, indecent, remain unprintable, then, as Walt Whitman said of an earlier 
and equally obscene conflict, "The real war will never get in the books." Until 
we make our way past the fictions of its higher purpose to the facts of men 
befouling themselves, maiming, being maimed, we can have no grip on the 
experience of World War II, in and of itself a four-letter word. Until we 
attend to the carnage that scared soldiers witless and the explosions that 
shook them inside out, we cannot come to terms with the war. "America has not 
yet understood what World War II was like and thus has been unable to use such 
understanding to re-interpret and redefine the national reality and to arrive 
at something like public maturity." 
</P>
<P>
So Fussell takes us on something of a Devil's Dictionary tour of World War II, 
from light infantry blown to bits by massive German tanks to "precision 
bombing" that wreaked more havoc upon friends than foes; from constant military 
blunders to persistent stories of cannibalism and corruption, of enemy agents 
disguised as nuns and the unknowing rumor circulated by Allied 
counterintelligence of a "terrible catastrophe that would befall Japan during 
the first week of August," 1945. In battle, young men discovered that neither 
craft nor caution nor black humor nor counterintelligence could redeem them. 
Fitness, foresight, courage -- these too had nothing to do with survival. 
Living was merely a matter of luck. British soldiers upon waking made sure that 
their first spoken word was "rabbits." Servicemen everywhere carried St. 
Christopher medallions or talisman brassieres. Eisenhower rubbed a lucky set of 
seven coins before each campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For the "common man" whose fanfare Aaron Copland composed in 1943, wartime was 
less about winning than about getting through and making it back home 
recognizably human. Fussell chronicles the interminable waiting that drove men 
up walls, the emotional and psychic casualties of the war on the front lines 
and back on the "home fronts." With particular vehemence he describes "the 
petty harassment of the weak by the strong" that had nothing to do with 
winning, everything to do with humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
In the resilient obscenities of the fighting men, not in the bland fiction and 
poetry produced during the war, Fussell discerns that current of modernism that 
he explored in his book about World War I. Tracking the lives of those 
"utilitarian, unchivalric, unheroic" GI Joes whose only recourse was scurrility 
and scatology, Fussell locates the only truly "modernist impulse toward 
subversion and Making New." These modernists used their f-stops as every 
possible part of speech to express an inexpressible contempt or to explain the 
inexplicable hell into which they were sent time and again. 
</P>
<P>
Himself an inveterate word man, Fussell claims to be saying something 
meaningful about World War II that we have not already intuited from film of 
bulldozers shoving fleshless bodies into pits or from photos of the residue of 
the "Fat Man" dropped by the Enola Gay. Yet beyond this condemnation of vacuous 
high-mindedness and his foursquare approach to the "fresh idiom" of Army slang, 
Fussell contributes little to our understanding of behavior during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
He contradicts himself concerning the denial or exploitation of fear, the 
absence or presence of a sense of the ironic, the recourse to words or to 
silence in the midst of the horrors of the war. And his generalizations amount 
to cliches. Wartime rumors "illustrate the principle that a complex human 
motive is more interesting to contemplate than a simple cause"; in the 
widespread typecasting of Germans, Japanese, Italians, "each enemy has taken on 
the characteristics of his primary geography." 
</P>
<P>
Rather a demoniacally entertaining potpourri than a coherent, profound account 
of World War II experiences, "Wartime" is ultimately less moving than Studs 
Terkel's oral history of " 'The Good War,' " or Archie Sattefield's oral 
history of "The Home Front," neither of which slips so quickly past the Jewish 
experience of World War II as both the holiest and unholiest of conflicts, the 
bitter experiences of the million American blacks in uniform, the hard lives of 
women during the war. Fussell's book is primarily an excursus upon a white 
Christian male Anglo-American wartime, and despite his apparent exaltation of 
the creatively vile-mouthed "common man," the figures dominating the index are 
Winston Churchill, Evelyn Waugh, Adolf Hitler, British dandy Julian 
Maclaren-Ross, F.D.R., Eisenhower and T.S. Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
"Wartime" is a book that could have been written only in the aftermath of 
Vietnam, and it is not by chance that Fussell's best chapter concerns "The 
Ideological Vacuum" into which art and literature fell during World War II. Nor 
is it by chance that Fussell's most original point concerns the absence of 
images of dismemberment in all pictorials of World War II combat. "Wartime" is 
essentially an afterthought conditioned by the images we now have of a war 
without glory. Like good graffiti, the book will shock some people,will linger 
for a time on walls and shelves, then fade beneath other, bolder strokes.
