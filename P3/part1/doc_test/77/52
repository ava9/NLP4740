Shoal Creek, at the center of the racial controversary that led to a change in 
the way future tournament sites will be selected, has bid to be the host of the 
1996 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not the only club that's asked for that year," Robert T. Sommers, U.S. 
Golf Assn. official, said Sunday, but did not reveal the other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoal Creek controversy, before the PGA Championship, was ignited by Hall 
Thompson's statement that the club he founded would not be pressured into 
accepting black members. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek awarded an honorary membership to Louis Willie, a black Birmingham 
executive, and derailed plans of demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers said the controversy would not affect the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA Tour announced this week that clubs selected as future sites for 
tournaments must have open membership practices. U.S. Open sites have been 
selected through 1995.
