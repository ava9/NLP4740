THE MISSING OF THE SOMME
by Geoff Dyer
Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 15.99, 157 pages
The survivors are a tiny and a quickly dwindling band: even those who lied
about their age will now be tilting a century. Their experiences were
terrible, but the years have not failed to trump one horror with others. No
popular day of remembrance is demanded for Hiroshima, nor even for the
Holocaust. And although the church services and poppy campaigns extend their
appeals on the basis of the universal soldier, yet there is no doubt where
the focus of our pieties is trained: upon that war which we stubbornly
designate as 'the Great'.
Today marks the 89th anniversary of the end of the Battle of the Somme, the
bloodiest battle in world history, with more than a million casualties and,
in the wake of the annual rituals of Armistice observance, many - among the
young, at least - might ask themselves: why does this 'Great War' haunt us
still?
A new book and a new museum supply the answer. Geoff Dyer's The Missing of
the Somme is a curious book. It wants partly to be an extended scholarly
essay on the process of remembrance, partly a rather rollicking account of a
joint lads' outing to the Flanders battlefield sites, and partly a critique
of Great War literature (including modern successes such as Sebastian
Faulks' Birdsong). The author is not famous for his patriotic zeal. In fact,
he begins with an exercise in debunking - pointing out how Scott's fatal
expedition to the South Pole in 1910-12 was the project of an incompetent
and irresponsible amateur, and how the British are so ridiculously clever at
celebrating their military disasters (eg the Charge of the Light Brigade).
Elsewhere, he is censorious about the nationalistic sentiments recorded by
other visitors to the Flanders cemeteries, and like most modern young men
his appetite for militarism is weak.
His own connection with the war is perhaps average: a grandfather, drafted
from farm labour in the shires to tend horses behind the lines - but
thankfully, no need to join the hunt for names on a headstone. The text is
illustrated by some not very distinguished monotone shots of memorials in
both France and at home. On the face of it, Dyer's little book does not look
a promising work of enlightenment.
And yet The Missing of the Somme is a genuinely important means of
understanding our own relationship with the Great War. What Dyer has done is
articulate some very peculiar sentiments. Why should those so distant from
that war feel so touched and absorbed by its topography, images and
literature? Can it possibly - and perversely - be some sort of envy?
Undoubtedly there was a little patch of Europe which became a muddied
microcosm, and those within its limits felt a world apart: on either side,
feeling hardly any hatred towards each other, and reserving for themselves
the special bonds of slang, satire and pure solicitude. It seems
retrospectively that it was a mysticism of suffering that happened here, and
an emotional commonwealth from which one can still feel slightly excluded.
So gazing over a cemetery such as Railway Hollow, 'the Accrington Pals'
Valhalla' in the Somme, one stops short of describing this as futility. And
so even beneath the crazy six-figure statistics of daily casualties at the
Somme, one's attention is arrested by anecdotes: of Captain Nevill, who led
his platoon over the top by booting a football into No Man's Land and
challenging his men to be first to dribble it into a German trench. The ball
came back, but not Captain Nevill.
Whilst no one would ever want to actually join that deadly game, one can
nevertheless harbour something akin to admiration for those old
blood-brotherhoods - and understand why, when they had the opportunity to
sit out the war in convalescence, some soldiers (like Wilfred Owen) actually
chose to return. Dyer understands all this, and is accordingly more cheered
by the cemeteries than dismayed: for in the phrase of Camus, feelingly
quoted by Dyer at Beaumont-Hamel, 'there are more things to admire in men
than to despise'.
Edmund Blunden, marching down to the Somme in August 1916, recalled halcyon
days, passing 'through wooded uplands, under arcades of elms, past
millstreams and red and white farms . . . billets in clay-walled barns, and
'Cafe, monsieur' at any moment'. To meet up with shattered battalions in a
treeless mire of rain and rotting corpses was like the end of an age of
innocence, the fading of the pastoral mode; and Geoff Dyer's meditations
include, necessarily, the register (felt by many) that the 1914-18, in a
century of change, marked the greatest of changes.
Life, at least in Britain, forfeited certain provincial, rustic rhythms that
were irretrievable; and from the war seeped an elegaic tincture which we
would never lose. Both the dross of jingoism and the buttress of optimism
vanished: and not even the Battle of Britain would restore the old imperial
confidence.
'I don't think these shell-shocked war poems will move our grandchildren
greatly'. Sir Henry Newbolt, writing in 1924, got it badly wrong. Wilfred
Owen, Isaac Rosenberg and other Great War poets are now part of the school
curriculum, and fixed in the repertoire of English classics. That their work
created a poetics of scepticism about poetry's traditional beauty has had an
incalculable effect not only on modern literary consciousness, but also upon
the patriotic postures of us all. 'The old lie' that it is noble to die for
one's queen and country may still circulate in one or two high (or low)
places; but we know that it is the sort of nationalism which, if indulged,
would lead to the Balkanisation of all Europe. History is no longer on its
side.
Proof of that, if it were needed, comes from a new museum: the Historial de
la Grande Guerre, established at Peronne, in the centre of the Somme region,
by the local Conseil General. It is a much overdue enterprise: for although
the cemeteries of Flanders are kept immaculately, almost unnervingly
pristine, museums in the area have tended to be shabby and ad-hoc: as Geoff
Dyer says of one of them (Hill 60, near Ypres), 'it is as if Steptoe and Son
have opened up their own branch of the Imperial War Museum'.
The Historial at Peronne, by contrast, exudes professional touches at every
point: well-located (near the old chateau), landscaped and custom-designed
by Henri Ciriani, and impressively resourced, it describes itself as a
'musee des mentalities', offering 'a historiography of humanity at war'.
That is, it maintains a running comparison between the front line and
conditions at home; and not only is it studiously neutral in its trilingual
presentation of this material, but the wider involvement of colonial forces
is fully reflected (thus Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South
Africans, Indians, Egyptians and Chinese).
Though Peronne itself was under German occupation for most of the war, all
around are the visitable battlefields: Longueval, Martinpuich, Thiepval and
others. They have become part of an itinerary, like vineyards of the Cote
d'Or; except here graves supplant the well-tended vines, and ploughed-up
shrapnel fills the farmers' crates.
In the museum itself, the feeling that trench warfare belongs to prehistory
is heightened here by the fact that film footage is constantly whirring
away, yet none of it is truly documentary. Film crews were banned from the
Front: the films that survive are all staged actions. By contrast to the
surreal coverage of the Gulf War, or the absurd virtual reality of the
'invasion' of Haiti - Marines landing before a barrage of lenses - this was,
then, not only a Great War, but a Real War. And however much we might admit
to heroising those who took part in it, the lesson of the Historial is not
so much that 'this must never happen again', but simply: 'this will never
happen again'. As such, the Historial securely distances its visitors from
the war it preserves for them. It reinforces Francis Fukuyama's hypothesis
that history, understood as a chronicle of battles and national
aggrandisement, no longer happens; and, less momentously, the Historial
teaches Europe that the past dissonance of sovereignty is a wound which
should assist, not impede, a federal continent.
The Historial de la Grande Guerre is open throughout the year, at Place du
Chateau, 80200 Peronne. Tel. 22.83.14.18.
