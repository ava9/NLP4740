  [Text] Som Chatusiphithak, general manager of Siam City 
Bank and chairman of Thai Banking Association, disclosed that 
the association has selected its officials and representatives 
from four commercial banks -- Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, 
Siam Commercial Bank, and Thai Farmer Bank -- to be appointed as 
members of the committee of the "Thailand-Singapore Business 
Council," an organization to be active in boosting trade and 
business cooperation between the two countries. The name list 
was submitted to the council on 17 June. 
  Som said that the said organization was the result of the 
negotiations made during the latest official visit to Singapore 
of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. At the initial stage, the 
council will concentrate on working out its framework before it 
can realy start functioning in promoting free trade. 
  Som noted: "The Thailand-Singapore Business Council stresses 
on cooperation between the two countries in business and 
financial areas as well as industries concerned. More important 
is that the council will promote good understanding and 
cooperation between Thailand and Singapore as both countries are 
striving to become financial hubs in the region. It is believed 
that the council will help prevent conflict and competition."
