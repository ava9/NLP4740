John Keane's exhibition does nothing if not show that war sits uneasily with
the modern liberal conscience. Where once the concept of the just war might
have eased it a little - or at least accommodated some of the complexities
and contradictions of the lesser evil - we are today too cynical, or too
naive, to do other than respond to the immediate facts of death, destruction
and conspicuous waste. That such things should be brought to pass in the
name of political advantage can only make them worse.
The actuality of battle has become a commonplace on our television screens,
the analysis and recrimination under way before the last shot is fired. It
raises awkward questions: would Passchendael have been fought over as it
was, with Kate Adie in the trenches and the high command in the studio to
answer for gains and losses as they came in?
And what is the role of the artist in all this: the objective reporter of
events, or the no less objective monitor of his or her own subjective
experience and response? Or the polemicist, morally committed and
politically correct? The short answer is: any of these things and still the
artist, but a war-artist only in the first two respects. The trouble with
John Keane, on the evidence of these paintings made from the photographs he
took in the month he spent with the British Army in the Gulf, is that he
wants to be all three at once.
He may be a very good photographer, but he is not showing his photographs.
He was not, as I understand it, commissioned as a war-artist in the fashion
of the second world war, a supernumerary officer living and moving with the
army for the duration. Least of all was he a sometime combatant, as were so
many of the artists of the first world war. Keane, by contrast, was sent by
the Imperial War Museum and was evidently there on sufferance so far as the
Army was concerned, and was kept well behind the lines.
Even so, his experience of army life on active service was clearly
authentic, and, in the period before the battle especially, he produced
material that is objective enough. The best work is of this kind: a tank
under camouflage netting, for example, a soldier digging a trench, two
soldiers playing draughts to pass the time. But the larger portion of the
work has clear polemical intent, and this makes us ask whether Keane
approached his subject with an open, or at least a curious mind.
Once fighting began, Keane could only experience its awful aftermath. Only
once is his prejudice subverted, by the panic of a gas alert. The wry
portrait of himself struggling ham-fistedly into his protective suit, is the
best and most natural image of this phase. It is touching, funny in a
desperate way, and it rings true.
For the rest, we have the attitudinising of the cynical liberal mind,
convinced the whole wasteful, colossally expensive exercise was merely to
protect the oil interests of the West and of the US in particular, an
exercise in neo-colonial economic oppression.
How else can we gloss such titles as We are making a new world order, with
its sun-bespectacled soldier amid the debris of battle and blazing
oil-fields, or Mickey Mouse at the Front, with its supermarket trolley,
flaccid palm tree and implicit antagonism to all things American? And there
is the Death Squad, the body-bag detail with scarves wrapped tight against
the stench. Above all, there is the sequence Scenes on the Road to Hell, the
fleeing convoy caught and destroyed on the Basra Road.
There is nothing against an overt polemic, save only that it must escape its
limitations if it is to stand as art. We may think of Goya's Disasters of
War, but he kept his ironical distance, well knowing who the enemy was,
while making a more general and humane point. Again, we may make superficial
comparison between the desolation of Paul Nash's great canvas of The Menin
Road and Keane's New World Order: yet the one is distanced, impartial and
thus universal in its humanity, the other merely local, personal and
political.
As it happens, Sargent's once notorious painting, Gassed, of a string of
victims coming back from the front line, the blind leading the blind, hangs
in the neighbouring gallery. It too raises the question of when polemic
becomes propaganda, though avoiding the charge by its broader humanity. Also
next door, as part of the current Falklands display, is some of the work of
Linda Kitson, Keane's immediate predecessor in the commission, her brisk and
personal reportage, drawn on the spot, a direct contrast to his more
predetermined approach.
Keane is an interesting and able artist, though inclined to allow his
facility to run away with him. He would rather hurry and produce too much,
as here, it seems, than confirm and resolve too little. His greater problem,
perhaps, is philosophical: he hardly knows which side he is on.
