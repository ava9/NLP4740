  [Text] Foturan is hard to the touch. The silicate glass 
withstands temperatures up to 550 degrees Celsius as well as 
attacks by aggressive chemicals. "Also, Foturan can be optimally 
combined with other materials into hybrid structures," muses 
Burkhard Speit, head of product development for the optical 
business sector at Schott Glassworks in Mainz, in whose 
laboratories the special glass was developed. 
  Originally, Foturan was to be used by Siemens AG for the 
construction of flat screens. But the Munich electronics group 
halted the development of flat tubes--and Schott had to look for 
other users for his wonderglass. They were soon found: Sensors 
for high-temperature application, for example, are being made 
based on Foturan. The Schott strategists now hope also to 
establish their silicate glass as a material for microsystem 
technology. 
  Foturan can--partly irradiated with ultraviolet light and 
then etched--be made into tiny mold parts. It is also suitable 
for the manufacture of perforated boards. The people in Mainz 
have already managed up to 800 holes per square centimeter. "We 
see application possibilities for example in mountings for 
optical waveguide fibers." 
  In the development of new materials for microscopically 
small 
components, the experience from the world of macrosystems can 
only be conditionally applied. "Often the mechanical properties 
of materials for components in the microfield are totally 
different from construction with normal sizes," according to 
Professor Erwin Sommer, head of the Fraunhofer Institute for 
Material Mechanics (IWM) in Freiburg. 
  Right now, materials experts in industry and at research 
institutes are primarily occupied with optimization of already 
available materials, such as certain synthetics or ceramics, for 
their use in the microsystem field. By means of filmy-thin 
coatings, improvements in the process technology or--much 
simpler--the correct combination of various materials, 
"completely satisfactory solutions can be achieved" (Sommer) for 
the microsystems planned at this time. 
  The development of totally new, to some extent tailor-made 
materials, is still not pursued with any force, at least for the 
moment. The reason for this is simple. Schott researcher Speit 
says: "We want to push ahead with the use of microtechnology 
systems; we do not want to wait five years for the development 
of a totally new material." 
  At this time experts see the broadest application field in 
medicine--and at the same time the adjustment of the working 
material is the most difficult here. "We can only make use of a 
palette of 20 materials, whose biocompatibility has been 
attested to by the Federal Health Ministry," explains Bernd 
Amecke, a microsystem expert at the pharmacological group of 
Boehringer Ingelheim. When modifying them in order to optimize 
them for certain microsystems he must apply for a new permit in 
order to use them in human beings. And that takes time. 
  Obstacles of this kind can only briefly hold up the 
materials 
designers, however. That is because materials technology is 
likely to play a dominant role as early as with the second or 
third microtechnology generation, the concepts of which are 
already being drafted in the industrial research departments. 
  Here the researchers will penetrate down to the molecular 
structure of the materials. At the Max Planck Institute for 
Polymer Research in Mainz people are combining molecules which 
independently merge into new materials with the desired 
properties. The head of the institute, professor Gerhard Wegener 
says: "It is as if bricks were to combine to form a wall on 
command." 
  At the Institute for New Materials (INM) in Saarbruecken one 
has also specialized in molecular puzzles. Here, for example, 
glasses and ceramics for use in microsystems are being 
optimized, by deliberately contaminating them with tiny foreign 
particles. The particles are so small that a quadrillion of them 
can fit on a pinhead. 
  The result of this molecular material composition is 
so-called smart materials, intelligent materials, which under 
varying pressure conditions can change their stability. "The 
trend in microsystem technology in the next few years is 
unequivocally heading toward increasingly intelligent 
materials," confirms INM employee Herbert Krug and confidently 
promises: "Technically we have already mastered it."
