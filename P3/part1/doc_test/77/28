and judged five lunches

I KNOW that there are some people out there who, perhaps for commercial
reasons, eat lunch out every day of the week. But I have never done so. When
I was a restaurateur, lunch was one course at 3pm and now that I am a
reviewer, I try to space out my pleasures.
That is until last week when I judged a new culinary competition, Prix des
Deux Cartes, devised by wine importers Domaines, Drouhin &amp; Associates. This
challenges chefs and sommeliers to create a menu and choose four wines to
match and enhance the food. There was a substantial reward for all who
reached the necessary standard.
The five judges were: Michel Roux, of the Waterside Inn, Bray; Charles
Metcalfe, wine writer; Bill Baker, wine merchant; Victor Ceserani, whose
book Practical Cooking has sold 1.5m copies since 1962 and is the 'bible'
for any catering college student; and myself. We met in December to judge 70
written entries, without knowing their origins. Surprisingly, we eliminated
all the London entries at this stage, including The Dorchester, The Inn on
the Park and Les Saveurs.
The five finalists were: Burgh Island Hotel, South Devon (tel: 0548-810514);
the Waterside Inn, Bray (0628-20691), although Roux neither knew it was
being entered nor judged the meal; Lucknam Park, Wiltshire (0225-742777);
One Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow (041-339-2001) and The Old Swan Hotel,
Harrogate (0423-500055).
All five achieved high marks with various food and wine combinations. Burgh
Island overcame the problem of having to prepare John Dory on a Monday by
bringing the fish, landed on Sunday in Newlyn, Cornwall, to London by train.
The Scottish entrants drove eight hours in a hired van with their own
cutlery, crockery and tartan ribbons for the napkins. They also brought
their own ingredients; a 14lb wild salmon from Loch Lomond - delicious with
a Joseph Drouhin Rully Blanc 1990 - and a saddle of one-year-old roe deer
shot in Aberdeenshire and hung for 12 days.
The Waterside Inn executed a cassolette of scallops and langoustines
memorable for the quality of the fish and the flavours of the vegetable
nage. Lucknam Park dazzled with its amuses-gueules - chilled Helford oysters
and scallops with a pepper confit - as well as its first course, tortellini
of jerusalem artichokes with a truffle butter sauce.
The Old Swan's cooking was considerably enhanced by Mark Kirby, a young man
who had joined the hotel three weeks earlier and been rapidly promoted
because its sommelier had fallen ill.
But at the end of every meal, when the chef and sommelier joined us for
coffee, I and the other judges felt disappointed. This was partly because
only the team from Glasgow (its sommelier is called Johnnie Walker) had
approached the competition scientifically and sat down to test the food and
wines at one sitting.
The others tested haphazardly and made silly mistakes. The sommelier from
Lucknam Park tried to 'create a contrast' by matching a rich chocolate
pudding with a rare vin de paille 1982 from Chapoutier. He succeeded only in
creating what fellow judges Baker and Metcalfe described as 'a disaster'.
The Waterside Inn's team produced a savarin of pears and ginger that was
overwhelmingly sweet for the late harvest Gewurztraminer 1990 from New
Zealand. Only Burgh House found a good dessert and wine combination by
serving a simple apple pastry with a delicious 1986 Sauternes Chateau
Rieussec.
More seriously, although the first courses were excellent, in four out of
the five meals the main courses and the wines chosen were just not well
matched. Had I been a paying customer I might have felt more than
disappointment.
These feelings were articulated by Victor Ceserani. He began with a
compliment, then dished out the constructive criticism, based on 50 years in
professional kitchens. Do not put shallots and chives in your amuses-gueules
 -leave the customers' palate clean for the first course; do not get carried
away with the reduction of your stocks or they become too heavy; do not
overdo the ratio of stuffing to meat, it should be 50:50; and, for two of
the chefs, a warning against putting too much sauce underneath the main
course.
The competition left five British chefs and sommeliers more aware of the
potential and pitfalls of matching food and wine. Three teams, from the
Waterside Inn, One Devonshire Gardens and Lucknam Park will learn more on
the trips they have won to European vineyards. And, after a week, it has
left five judges just a little bit plumper.
