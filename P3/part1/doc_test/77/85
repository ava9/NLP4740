WILFRED Owen is one of my private heroes, but I was surprised at the
comprehensive marking of his centenary. On Sunday, Radio 2 gave a fine
two-hour biographical feature presented by Dominic Hibberd. It covered his
youth - a home with evangelistic leanings, a harmless affair with a
choirboy, a nervous breakdown, a job teaching English in France - in 1915
yet, oddly careless of the war. He was sorry for the French troops, but the
British were 'only Tommy Atkins', mere soldiers. Yet he enlisted in the
Artists Rifles, commissioned, and won an MC on the Somme. Shell-shocked, he
was sent to recover in Scotland.
From here on he was more intimately observed in Radio 4's Monday play, Not
about Heroes by Stephen MacDonald, virtually a duologue between Owen and
Siegfried Sassoon, another shell-shock victim (James Telfer and the author).
Sassoon coached him into trying something more concerned with reality and
his best work came when he went back to the front, where he was killed in
action a week before the Armistice. Some of it, together with his letters,
will be read by Kenneth Branagh on Radio 3 in the coming week.
Detectives are commoner on the BBC than poets, and two more turn up this
week. On Wednesday Radio 4 gave the first of four parts of PD James's Cover
Her Face. Detective Adam Dalgliesh did not appear in this part, but the
Radio Times told us that Robin Ellis, who is to play him, was jolly good in
Poldark. I have heard the whole story (dramatised by Neville Teller) on a
BBC Radio Collection cassette, available from April 5, and he is good, among
a splendid cast. His problem begins with a cheeky servant-girl found dead in
a locked room.
Thursday's new investigator, in The Blackburn Files on Radio 4, is firmly
working-class, a retired Yorkshire pitman. He only investigates who is
stealing flowers from an allotment, but Stephen J. Blackburn (Finetime
Fontayne) and his assistant Tracey (Judy Flynn) keep it fun. For addicts of
detection, the week also gave Detective-Superintendant Thorne on Monday,
solving another problem set him by John Penn; Sherlock Holmes on Wednesday
in The Solitary Cyclist; and on Friday Dr Keith Simpson, the detecting
pathologist, with a strangled hitch-hiker.
More serious was Radio 3's Sunday play, The Lovesong of Alfred J. Hitchcock,
by David Rudkin. We are in an imaginary film studio, where a human Camera
(Michael Fitzgerald) gives the studio instructions. Hitchcock, played with
great realism and sensitivity by Richard Griffiths, wants to reproduce the
love-scene he visualised as a boy, but he despises his own fat body and
associates women with death. Rudkin repeats similar attempts time and again
 -the dream is followed by a thoughtful Hitchcock at work with script-writer
and Camera. The play lasted 130 minutes, whichI thought too long. Philip
Martin directed.
Groucho Was My Father (Radio 4, Wednesdays) presents Miriam Marx Allen,
Groucho Marx's elder daughter by his first wife. Groucho's letters to her,
read by Frank Ferrante in a convincing imitation of his voice, are witty but
ordinary. It is fun to hear talk of 'Uncle Harpo' and 'Uncle Zeppo',
especially of 'Uncle Chico', who besought Groucho to make another film with
him to make him enough money to pay the gangsters threatening his life.
There are two more programmes, presented by Tony Staveacre.
