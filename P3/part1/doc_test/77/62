ABOUT WINE: ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY TASTE TESTING OF LATOUR, THE 'DALLAS COWBOYS OF 
WINE'

<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of Bordeaux, one property stands out as a beacon of the 
region, a chateau so well known that its very name prompts wine lovers to 
swoon. 
</P>
<P>
It is Chateau Latour and it is a property with a long, regal and in some ways 
mystifyingly low-key image. The wine of Latour is deep and brooding, intensely 
flavored and hard to evaluate when young because of the richness and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, almost no house in all of Bordeaux has such an amazing track record 
for producing fine wine even in the worst of vintages as has Latour. And thus 
when Riverside wine lover Bipin Desai recently sent out invitations to a 
once-in-a-century tasting of a range of Latours dating back into the 1800s, the 
response was quick. 
</P>
<P>
Held at three Los Angeles restaurants and spanning two dinners and a luncheon, 
Desai's amazing event attracted wine lovers from afar, and clearly this was due 
to the reputation of the chateau for making great wine, year in and out. 
</P>
<P>
At this point it is appropriate to point out that Latour, being one of the 
famed First Growth Bordeaux houses of France, gained its fame in part, 
ironically, by the greatness of the other First Growth wines, and from Latour's 
comparison with them. Were it not for the brilliance in Chateaux 
Mouton-Rothschild, Lafite-Rothschild, Margaux and Haut-Brion, Latour would have 
nothing to which it might be compared and for which it is renowned. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Latour is highly praised in part because it is among the 
darkest, deepest, most concentrated wines on the planet that still has the 
ability to charm the pants off you. Its First Growth cousins have their own 
attributes, and each has its champions, but Latour is sort of the Dallas 
Cowboys of the wine game: even in an off-year its fans love 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Latour is often compared with Lafite, its neighbor in Pauillac, in terms of 
quality. And comparing them is a sport unto itself. For my money, it was best 
stated by Hugh Johnson, the lyric author of dozens of wine books, who compared 
the properties in his Modern Encyclopedia of Wine. The text is poetry of a high 
level: 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of each is set in relief by the very different qualities of the 
other. Lafite is a tenor; Latour a bass . . . Lafite is a dance; Latour a 
parade." 
</P>
<P>
I was unable to attend Desai's Latour extravaganza, with wines dating back more 
than 120 years, though I did taste a few of the youngest wines. But I 
interviewed Alan Hare, president of Latour, and Christian Le Sommer, Latour's 
wine maker, before the event and their comments about Latour give a perspective 
on the property. 
</P>
<P>
And one key element is the relatively greater consistency in the wines of 
Latour over the last 20 years compared with wines made between the 1930s and 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a byword it is consistency," said Hare, acknowledging that that 
word was not always used to describe Latour during that earlier four-decade 
period. 
</P>
<P>
A British firm acquired Latour in 1963 after it had fallen into disrepair, and 
Hare said when the company, Pearson Group, took it over, "50% of the vines were 
dead," and the wine making facility hadn't been renovated in ages. 
</P>
<P>
There is a marvelous (perhaps apocryphal) tale that Harry Waugh, former 
director of Latour, likes to tell about the sale of Latour by the de Beaumont 
family, owners for nearly 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
Waugh says that British banker-financier Lord Cowdray was told by his staff 
that Latour was for sale and could be a good purchase. After investigating and 
seeing the investment potential, Cowdray, apparently a lover of spirits, is 
reported to have said, "I'll buy the place as long as I don't have to drink the 
bloody stuff." 
</P>
<P>
That sale benefited Latour, France and all wine lovers because the new owners 
began to modernize the place, and Hare pointed out, "We have made a big 
investment over the last 20 years." Le Sommer added that much of the 
improvement in Latour has come in the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the depth of this wine, in addition to the familiar arguments 
that quality and style are due mostly to soil and climate, is that the chateau 
uses two methods to limit the size of production (to no more than 25,000 cases 
a year, often less). 
</P>
<P>
One technique is simply not harvesting all the grapes that French law permits. 
Hare said, moreover, that Latour has reduced even the crop it was harvesting 
between 1970 and 1980, when the house produced some awfully good wine. 
</P>
<P>
The second technique came about as a result of the massive replanting job that 
faced Pearson in the 1960s. In an effort to maximize the land that has always 
been Latour, the managers located two parcels that are not in the center of the 
property, but which grow grapes that have essentially the same characteristics 
as the primary land. 
</P>
<P>
The two remote parcels produce some excellent lots of wine, said Le Sommer, but 
the quality is simply a tad low for inclusion most years into Latour. So in 
1966 a "second wine" was made for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Les Forts de Latour, with a label quite similar to Latour itself, is made from 
grapes off the remote plots as well as from vats of Latour wine deemed not to 
be of Grand Vin status, which generally is from vines that are less than 10 
years old. And, said Hare, Les Forts de Latour is not sold the same way most 
other chateaux second wines are sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to keep it in the bottle long enough, to make sure it is not drunk too 
young," he said. The 1966 wine wasn't released until 1970, about a year or two 
after most of the other second wines of the top chateaux, and the 1983 is the 
current release, with the '84 to be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hare admitted, "We haven't been doing a good enough job" of promoting Les Forts 
de Latour, though it usually represents excellent quality at a most reasonable 
price. I have a few bottles left of the 1970 Les Forts de Latour that is 
absolutely wonderful wine, and Desai noted recently that the 1966 Les Forts is 
one of the best wines of the vintage, rivaling Latour itself. 
</P>
<P>
Desai's three-meal tasting event was not the first time a so-called "vertical 
tasting" of Latour has been staged. English author Edmund Penning-Rowsell wrote 
in his book "Bordeaux" of many he has attended. But Hare praised the Desai 
event as "one of the most profound tastings of this sort we've ever done, 
because the best way to find out about a wine is to have it with food." 
</P>
<P>
Desai, a physicist at the University of California at Riverside, said the best 
wines of the tasting were, expectedly, from the greatest vintages, and he said 
the 1961 was "incredibly impressive, and the '64 was remarkable. But the thing 
that impressed us was the wines of the 1980s -- one vintage after the other 
they made excellent wines." 
</P>
<P>
(As a side note here, Desai said he and other attendees liked the '82, though 
when I ran through the first two decades of Latour at the first evening, I was 
very disappointed with the initial aroma of the wine. I found the '78 and '81 
to be superb.) 
</P>
<P>
The single best wine? Desai said it was a toss-up, with some tasters preferring 
the 1928, some the '45 and some the 1970, "and the 1900, tasted from a magnum, 
was superb." 
</P>
<P>
Desai said he had read so often of Latour's ability to make top wine even in 
off vintages that he arranged one flight of wines all of which were from off 
vintages, including bottles from 1940 and 1944, when the vines were poorly 
tended because of the war. "All the off-year wines were excellent in the sense 
that from some other producers, wines from these vintages would have been 
undrinkable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hare will next be in the United States in a few weeks conducting a tour of 
Bordeaux producers as they unveil the 1987 wines. I noted to Hare that 1987 was 
considered a rather poor vintage in Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that's why I asked to conduct this tour. We're quite proud of our '87." 
It is, after all, a Latour. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Kendall-Jackson Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50) -- Some purists 
may wince when they sip this wine and find there is a trace of residual sugar. 
But after they say that, watch them drink up two or three more glasses to prove 
it to themselves. This is about as yummy a wine as Sauvignon Blanc can produce, 
with pear, melon and apple scents and a trace of lime. Hang the dollop of 
sugar; it's delicious wine.
