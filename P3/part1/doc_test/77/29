MOST OF the former states of the Soviet Union are expected to introduce
their own currencies in the next year, as a result of the International
Monetary Fund's stance on linking its support to the control of inflation.
The IMF, now negotiating with Russia over a Pounds 1.5bn initial tranche of
support, changed its position of encouraging the former Soviet states to
remain in the rouble zone after it became clear that the Russian central
bank's generous credits to industry and the budget would continue, and with
it very high levels of inflation.
The reversal will place some pressure on the other states to leave the
rouble zone to benefit from Fund, World Bank and bilateral support for a
reform programme.
Its consequences have been highlighted this month by the introduction in
Kyrgyzia, one of the smallest and poorest of the newly independent states,
of its own currency, the som. The currency has Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m)
backing from the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese government - a
relatively large sum for a small and poor country - to support its pegged
rate of four som to the dollar.
Mr Tursunbek Chyngyshev, the Kyrgyz prime minister, said officials from
other states had told him before the som was introduced that they supported
his move and would all follow suit shortly. 'They all believe it is
inevitable and that Russia itself will soon make the decision to create its
own currency.'
Russia is still the banker for most of the 15 former Soviet states - though
it is increasingly limiting the credits paid out to them and in some cases,
as with Ukraine, has stopped issuing credits entirely. Mr Boris Fyodorov,
the Russian finance minister, this week welcomed Kyrgyzia's adoption of the
som as an example for others.
The rouble has been, since the beginning of this year, printed with 'Bank of
Russia' rather than 'USSR'. However, it is still available to all states, in
both cash notes and so-called 'cashless' credits through accounts between
the central banks of the republics and of Russia.
IMF officials are making it clear to the republics that a decision to remain
in the rouble zone is their own to make, but if they decided to remain they
would be treated as an economic extension of Russia. If an agreement was
reached between the Fund and Russia, these states could also hope to
conclude one; if none was, they would probably be unable to conclude their
own.
Besides the three Baltic states - which declared independence first and
introduced currencies or coupons last year - only Ukraine has yet to
conclude an agreement with the IMF, and its currency is closer to a coupon
than to a fully-fledged money issue.
Turkmenistan, another Central Asian state, has said it will create its own
currency in the autumn. Its economy, based on huge reserves of natural gas,
is much stronger than Kyrgyzia's.
Kazakhstan has only a few days to prevent crops in the south of the country
from being devastated by locusts, but a government official said yesterday
he was confident the threat would be eliminated. Reuter reports from Moscow.
Deputy agriculture minister Viktor Kosarev was quoted in the Kazakh capital
Alma-Ata as saying more than half of the 300,000 hectares of pasture land
infested with locust larvae had already been sprayed with chemicals in an
operation using 14 aircraft and 200 tractors. The locusts would be destroyed
this month.
