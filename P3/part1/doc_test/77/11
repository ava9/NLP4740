  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- Senior officials of the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have agreed to 
recommend improved cooperation on infrastructural development 
and on the nurturing of smaller-scale businesses. 
  At the close of the second three-day APEC senior officials 
meeting (SOM) on Friday, delegates expressed the need to deal 
with the region's growing infrastructure demands. 
  Saodah Syahruddin, director for economic relations among 
developing countries at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, said APEC's member economies have responded positively 
to Indonesia's proposal to focus on infrastructure as a central 
area for cooperation. 
  APEC groups the United States, Mexico, Japan Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Brunei 
Australia and New Zealand. 
  "The senior officials agreed to discuss cooperation on 
infrastructures at their next meeting," Saodah explained. 
  Indonesia, as chairman of APEC, has identified developing 
human resources small and medium-scale enterprises, private 
sector participation and improvement of infrastructures as key 
areas of concentration. 
  During lunch after the closing of the SOM, Saodah explained 
that the region, which represents 40 percent of the world's 
population, will require about US$1 trillion in infrastructure 
investment by the year 2010. 
  The Indonesian Government has also anticipated this need by 
assigning the Ministries of Transportation, Mines and Energy, 
Public Works and Tourism, Post and Telecommunications to deal 
with the challenges. 
  Speaking on small and medium enterprises, Saodah said the 
definitions of "small" and "medium" have yet to be made. 
  "Some would say that a small business is run by 10 people 
and 
others say 100 people," she said. "We are still trying to work 
it out." 
  During the SOM, delegates reviewed the results of last 
month's meeting in Jakarta of APEC's Expert Group on Small and 
Medium Enterprises and endorsed it as an initial program which 
will be further discussed at the group's next meeting in 
Yogyakarta in September. 
  Johan Syahperi Saleh, the chief of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' bureau for economic affairs of the ASEAN National 
Secretariat said the problems of small and medium enterprises 
are related to access to markets and financing facilities, 
limitations in management abilities and technology and limited 
access to information. 
  "We need policies that are conducive to overcoming these 
obstacles," he said. 
  The SOM also agreed that the expert group should begin to 
study strategies for promoting financing for small and medium 
enterprises. 
  The SOM also set tentative dates for the upcoming events. 
The third SOM will be held in Yogyakarta on September 10-14 and 
the fourth in Jakarta on November 6-10. 
  The APEC Ministerial Meeting will be held in Jakarta one day 
after the fourth SOM on November 11-12 and prior to the APEC 
Economic Leaders Meeting to be held at the Presidential Palace 
in Bogor, West Java, on November 15. 
  The senior officials also agreed to invite Chile, APEC's 
newest member, to take part in their next meeting. 
  The SOM, however, failed to reach a consensus on requests by 
non-member economies to participate in the meetings of APEC's 
working groups. Countries such as Vietnam have recently 
conveyed to President Suharto their wish to take part in these 
discussions.
