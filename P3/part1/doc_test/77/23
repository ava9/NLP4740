  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- The second Senior Official 
Meeting (SOM) of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
began here yesterday with a call to narrow the economic gap 
between the developed and developing member nations. 
  "It is crucial for the developing economies in APEC to 
achieve a rate of development that will allow them to reduce the 
gap between themselves and their high industrialized partners," 
Director General for Foreign Economic Relations Wisber Luis said 
at the opening the three-day meeting. 
  Wisber said that for this reason, it is important the four 
fields of cooperation in the APEC framework -- human resources 
development, promotion of small and medium scale industries, 
private sector participation an improvement of infrastructures 
-- should be prioritized. 
  The meeting is the second of four SOMs to held in 
preparation 
for the sixth APEC Ministerial Meeting due to be held in Jakarta 
in November. 
  Over 250 officials from the 17-member states are attending 
the meeting at the Bali International Convention Center at Nusa 
Dua's complex of luxury hotels. 
  APEC, currently presided over by Indonesia, is comprised of 
Canada, the United States, Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong 
Kong South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Singapore, lndonesia, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Australia and 
New Zealand. 
  Wisber explained that, as chairman, Indonesia hopes the 
current SOM will try to broaden and intensify the four fields of 
cooperation. He said the recently signed Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade negotiations in Marrakech, Morocco, will have 
a positive impact on APEC. 
  "The newly concluded Round may provide a fresh impetus for 
APEC member to work towards a more liberalized trade and 
investment regime in the region," he said. 
  Talking to reporters following the first session of 
yesterday's meeting, Wisber said many of the delegates were 
delighted that Bali was chosen as the venue of the SOM. 
  "They have commended Indonesia for the selection of the 
site," he said. "Of course I didn't tell them that it added 
costs," he added modestly. 
  Wisber would not reveal much about the contents of the 
first-day's meeting but said that the provisional agenda for the 
SOM had been approved. He added that participants were 
reviewing the reports of the various working groups and 
committees which had meetings a week In advance. 
  At the conclusion of yesterday's events, several delegates 
explained that much of the proceedings dealt with the works of 
the Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI). 
  Among the most important items discussed was the adoption of 
an APEC Investment Principal, which included such issues as 
non-discrimination and free movement of assets. 
  With the United States and Australia as the main initiators, 
it was agreed that the latter would be responsible for producing 
a draft of the Investment Principals. 
  Another topic on the agenda was the issue of promotion of 
small and medium scale enterprises. Apparently no concrete 
results have been yielded except for the fact that Taiwan will 
be responsible for drawing-up a draft proposal. 
  Among the issues to be discussed in today's meeting will be 
the creation of a Pacific Business Forum which will be an 
assembly of business persons throughout the Asia Pacific region. 
  The delegates have also proposed that two persons represent 
each country in the first meeting of the business forum 
scheduled to be held in Singapore from June 10 to June 11. 
  At this point, Indonesia and Japan have already announced 
their representatives. Indonesia will be represented by eminent 
businessman A.R. Ramli and a former minister of cooperatives, 
Bustanil Arifin. Japan has selected the president and vice 
president of Itochu their representatives -- Minoru Morohushi 
and Nobuo Tateishi, respectively.
