Jancis Robinson goes in search of that elusive animal, the prefect wine

IN THE old days the perfect wine waiter was just like the stereotype wine
waiter - francocentric, heavily accented, impenetrably aloof, his role to
reduce customers to Bateman cartoon fodder with the drop of an eyelid.
Except that the best did actually know something about wine.
But just as wines have been changing, so have restaurants and their
customers, and there is now an entirely new breed of wine waiter.
These guys, just for starters, may not even be guys. But whether male or
female, will almost invariably be young, enthusiastic, knowledgeable in a
truly international sense, and completely, almost unsettlingly, unfettered
by tradition. Fishcakes with Cabernet? You got it. Cloudy Bay with chilli?
You got it. Etcetera.
So what does make the perfect wine waiter nowadays? He, or she, has to
combine a pleasant modesty with flexibility. He has to satisfy the everyday,
non-wine-fanatic customer by reliably recommending good buys at the cheaper
end of the list. But he also has to be able to hold his own with the
increasing number of wine maniacs who now roam the world and enjoy torturing
sommeliers with tricky questions and absurd boasts.
He has to satisfy his employer by generating sufficient profit from the
declining number of bottles ordered, especially at lunchtime. Finally, so
that he can be fielded at any time for the role of wine waiter in a sitcom,
he should have a strong French accent and an Inspector Clouzot moustache.
I know the very chap. Gerard Basset, posing as a Frenchman working
(extremely hard) at Hampshire's famous country house hotel, Chewton Glen. So
perfect is he that he has just, very nearly, been voted the Best Sommelier
in the World.
At what are, effectively, the sommelier Olympics, held every three years,
Gerard Basset was beaten into second place by one point, by talented
Philippe Faure-Brac of Paris. Faure-Brac is very French, and is expected to
make as much of his new title as his countryman who won it back in 1983 and
has virtually built a business empire on it.
But Basset surely cannot be French. Quite apart from his natural modesty and
caricature French accent, there is what he says. For example: 'England is
fantastic - a far better place to learn about wine than France. The more I
learn, the more I realise I don't know. A lot of sommeliers forget to
respect the customer.
'The only customers I'm not overkeen on are the French. I used to try to
sell them wines from new regions such as California. Now I say, 'Unless
you're open-minded, don't bother'.'
Perhaps on the other hand, he really was born in St Etienne (fork left for
Cotes du Forez) in 1957 and fell in love with England via a football match
in Liverpool, unlikely as this may seem. Other talented French sommeliers
have deliberately chosen to make British hotels such as the Manoir, the Inn
on the Park, the London Intercontinental and the Lanesborough their base for
learning about wine, because the chances to learn about non-French wines are
so much greater (even if the matching of specific wines and foods is largely
ignored in the UK).
Certainly the World Sommelier Championship, held this year in Brazil,
requires truly non-chauvinist wine knowledge.
The questions Gerard can remember from the written exam on the Friday
included pairing the names of 10 of Italy's arcane Supertuscans with their
producers, and ranged from California wine nomenclature, through the
Luxembourg appellation system to the role of vitamins in grapes. The
practical part of this qualifying round involved serving a Brazilian
Cabernet Sauvignon correctly.
This reduced the 35 finalists to five who had to perform in public on the
Saturday, describing and recommending wines (and spirits) from an 800-bin
list they had only half an hour to study, and answering such nasty questions
as: 'What do you think of Michel Lynch 1986?' (Some contestants were so
nervous they managed to stumble out an appreciation of this wine, which did
not exist at that time.)
Basset is lucky. Both his employers at Chewton Glen and his fiancee Nina
Howe (an AA hotel inspector) actively support his dedication to a series of
vinous title fights. Priestlike, he studies theory religiously each morning
before furthering his practical mastery of wine waiting at work.
His next ambition is to pass the Master of Wine exams, the highest academic
qualification in the wine trade. Nina will continue to test him with mystery
glasses served during their two evenings a week together, since the MW also
involves practical as well as theoretical exams. And they have advertised in
the local paper for someone to coach him in the necessary essay writing.
He says, rather touchingly, that his aim is to motivate others to become
sommeliers by helping to change their arrogant image. 'But you know,' he
said conspiratorially, 'the worst are some of my young French staff.
'One of them, a 19-year-old, told me off the other day for decanting a Pinot
Noir. So I waited until after service and asked him to explain exactly why I
shouldn't. And do you know the only reason he could give me? 'Because, in
France we don't'.'
