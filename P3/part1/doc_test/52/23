Voyager 2 will pass by Neptune this month, providing the closest views yet of 
the giant gaseous planet nearly 3 billion miles from the sun. Many local 
organizations are planning events to coincide with the spacecraft's final 
planetary encounter before leaving the solar system, one of the biggest being 
"Planetfest '89," sponsored by the Planetary Society at the Pasadena Convention 
Center, Aug. 23-27. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the society's internationally coordinated "Voyager Watch" program, 
the five-day event will include lectures, films, exhibits and speakers such as 
astronomer Carl Sagan and Bruce Murray, former director of the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. One of the highlights of the program will be live images of Neptune 
as they are transmitted from the spacecraft to a specially designed video wall 
at the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The California Museum of Science and Industry in Exposition Park will also have 
live coverage of Voyager. Images will be provided to the museum as they are 
received by JPL from Aug. 21-29.
