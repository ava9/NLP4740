POOR STORAGE RUINING NASA DATA, REPORT SAYS;

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of magnetic tapes containing irreplaceable scientific 
data from American space missions are deteriorating -- and perhaps damaged 
beyond repair -- because of improper storage and management, the General 
Accounting Office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has stored at least 1.2 
million reels of information beeped back to Earth from orbiting satellites and 
lunar and planetary probes during the 32-year history of the American space 
program, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
Yet NASA "does not have an agency-wide inventory of its data" and "does not 
know what is being retained and where it is located," endangering critical 
information that could be vital to future scientific ventures, the GAO 
investigators charged. 
</P>
<P>
In a report prepared for the House Space, Science and Technology Committee, the 
federal auditing agency said eight of 10 storage and processing facilities it 
inspected failed to fully satisfy the accepted regulations for storing such 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the facilities were in compliance with fewer than half of the 
government and industry archival guidelines, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA sharply disputed the major findings contained in the 76-page document, 
challenging the GAO's assertion that it has failed to protect space-science 
data as a national resource for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
John E. O'Brien, NASA assistant deputy administrator, said in a letter printed 
along with the GAO findings that the report was "unnecessarily harsh, and 
contains sweeping generalizations and extrapolations which we believe to be 
unfounded and unsubstantiated." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, O'Brien said NASA could find no evidence that important data has 
been lost as a result of mismanagement. And he said that all of the 
recommendations offered by the GAO already were being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The report was issued as NASA prepares to go to Congress for the first major 
funding of new space programs, which will produce a flow of information 
dwarfing the output of satellites and deep-space payloads launched in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited as an example the planned Earth Observation System, which 
would gather data needed to accurately forecast the effects of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
If deployed as now recommended by the space agency, the system would generate a 
volume of data equivalent to all the books in the Library of Congress every six 
weeks, the GAO said. One of its orbiting platforms, loaded with a dozen 
scientific instruments, would transmit a trillion bits of data per day, enough 
to fill 700 high-density magnetic tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress who are seeking data needed for computer models of global 
climate behavior have taken new interest in finding out how much and what kind 
of information the space agency already has collected. 
</P>
<P>
"NASA's data management has been one of its weakest features," said Sen. Albert 
Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on science, technology 
and space. "We've been trying for months to complete an inventory of exactly 
what they have, where it is, and how it can be accessed. It has been an 
eye-opening experience." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO investigators reported finding space-research data in storage 
facilities that failed to meet criteria for temperature and humidity control, 
fire and water protection and tape maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the report said, some of the most significant tape-management 
deficiencies were found in the two largest facilities responsible for managing 
irreplaceable data: the National Space Science Data Center at NASA's Goddard 
Space Flight Center in Maryland and a U.S. Geological Survey facility in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report noted that officials at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
which controls the United States' planetary space missions, have determined 
that important data has been lost through faulty storage and management. 
</P>
<P>
JPL officials "with substantial experience and expertise" estimated that half 
of the 130,000 tapes the laboratory had stored at the Los Angeles Federal 
Records Center at Laguna Niguel "may be damaged beyond recovery or contain data 
of little or no value," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
"This evidence, combined with the serious physical storage conditions . . . 
substantiates our concern that NASA's space-science data stored on magnetic 
tapes are at serious risk of becoming partially or completely unusable," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about deterioration of data gathered by the Voyager, Viking and Mariner 
spacecraft led JPL officials to copy 12,500 reels of tape in 1983 to preserve 
priceless information gathered from the planets of Mercury, Mars, Venus, 
Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. The $495,000 project showed that efforts to 
restore 10-year-old tapes often led to their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is now experimenting with the use of optical disks as a replacement for 
magnetic tapes. 
</P>
<P>
At Goddard Space Flight Center, 10,000 tapes of satellite data have been stored 
on just 243 disks, but the GAO report said it is too early to tell whether 
improvements offered by that technology address the myriad problems of data 
storage, preservation and dissemination. 
</P>
<P>
While the report primarily blamed NASA for the "deplorable conditions" under 
which the scientific data is stored and maintained, it said the General 
Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration 
also share responsibility.
