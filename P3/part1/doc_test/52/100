  [Abstract] An approximate analytic method is given for 
computing the motion of a spacecraft in the neighborhood of the 
collinear libration points of an arbitrary system of bodies. In 
connection with trajectory problems with the "Relikt-2" project 
(halo orbit in the neighborhood of the L[.sub]2[/] point of 
the Sun-Earth system), analytic allowance also is made for 
perturbations from the Moon. A comparison with the motion of a 
spacecraft in a halo orbit, determined by numerical integration, 
gave an estimate of the magnitude of the systematic error of 
about 1% of the characteristic amplitude of the halo 
orbit. The 
problem of the Earth's screening of a spacecraft against solar 
radiation in a halo orbit of an arbitrary amplitude is 
formulated. The proposed analytic method was used in estimating 
the expenditures of characteristic velocity on the optimum 
correction of spacecraft motion in order to prevent screening 
(in the case of the limited control system in the "Relikt-2" 
project and a more general case). Section 2 gives results 
characterizing the accuracy in approximating an asymptotic 
trajectory in the proposed third-order theory; Section 3 gives a 
formalization of the problem of entry into the Earth's shadow 
(or penumbra). Section 4 examines the optimum problem of 
correction of the motion of a spacecraft, making possible 
avoidance of its entry into a deep shadow. The analytic theory 
developed in Section 5 rests on a similar method worked out 
earlier for describing motion in the neighborhood of the 
L[.sub]2[/] point in the Earth-Moon system. Figures 11;
