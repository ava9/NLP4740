"It's not like building a church," said the president of the La Canada 
Flintridge Educational Foundation. "This we have to do year after year after 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, one of dozens that emerged in California after property 
tax-cutting Proposition 13 shattered traditional school financing, raises 
private money for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the La Canada Flintridge group reached a milestone, its first 
decade. The tenacity of the group's volunteers and the strength of its method 
have apparently made the foundation a permanent facet of school financing in 
the affluent suburb of 22,800 residents. 
</P>
<P>
One of about 130 such organizations in the state, the La Canada Flintridge 
group has remained one of the most successful. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it plans to top its goal of $225,000, bringing the total funds that 
it has raised for education to about $2 million, said Meredith B. Reynolds, 
foundation president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Every-Day Effort 
</P>
<P>
"We are actively raising money almost every day," said Reynolds, who is about 
to step down from her one-year post. "But we'll be back on their doorsteps come 
September." 
</P>
<P>
Through its efforts, the foundation contributes about the same amount of money 
as the California Lottery to the La Canada Unified School District's annual 
$15-million budget, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many other educational foundations that rely on professionals to run 
their operations -- such as Beverly Hills and San Marino -- the La Canada group 
is supported by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no paid staff," Reynolds said. "We have some of the most important 
people in Los Angeles on our board, and most of them probably never stuffed 
envelopes before in their lives. But they do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
The professional and diversified expertise of directors is a key to the group's 
success, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about a third of the 30-member board steps down, to be replaced by 
new volunteers selected as a cross-representation of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's bylaws are designed "to keep the board fresh and truly 
representative of the community," said Reynolds, who describes herself as "an 
attorney turned housewife." The constant turnover brings "new ideas, new 
energy" to the team. 
</P>
<P>
The number of educational foundations in the state has doubled in the last 
seven years as more and more districts search for new ways to supplement their 
ever-tightening budgets. But those that succeed represent only a smattering of 
the more than 1,000 school districts in California -- usually in small 
communities "that are fairly affluent," said Terry McAlpine, a spokeswoman for 
the Los Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada group supports a close-knit district with only two elementary 
schools, one high school, a continuation school and a special education campus. 
Total enrollment is 3,100, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar group formed to support the neighboring Glendale Unified School 
District, with a growing enrollment of more than 22,000 on 27 campuses, 
disbanded in about 1982 after only four years in existence, district officials 
said. The giant Los Angeles Unified School District also has no private 
fund-raising arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Round Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds estimates that at least 100 volunteers actively participate in the La 
Canada organization year-round. Many of them offer professional services, such 
as specially designed fund-raising "pitches" that were written by promotional 
experts to "sell" the program to different classes of potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one of the better school districts in the state," Reynolds said, 
citing state test scores that consistently place district students in the 98th 
percentile or better in reading, writing and mathematics proficiency. "We know 
we have to look to our own community to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said fund-raisers rely on the district's record to generate support 
for public schools from all sectors of the community, including donors without 
children, professionals, businesses and parents whose children attend private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, about 700 to 1,000 donors contribute to the annual fund-raising in 
the community, which has about 6,000 families, 2,000 of them with children 
attending local schools, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund-Raising Events 
</P>
<P>
As many as 350 volunteers are recruited to work in the group's half a dozen 
fund-raising events each year, such as a back-to-school night program in which 
a spokesman for the foundation is placed in every classroom in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely is a labor-intense organization," said Reynolds, who pointed 
out that volunteers are common in the city, where the council and all of the 
commissioners hold unpaid positions. Parent volunteers account for more than 
10,000 hours of documented work in the schools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said other educational foundations have recently contacted La Canada, 
seeking the secret to its success. "The pressures are very great on educational 
foundations right now because the money is so tight from Sacramento," she said. 
"Organizations are sitting back and saying, 'How can we be more effective?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Education Foundation, one of the leading fund-raisers for 
lower public education, raises from $400,000 to $500,000 a year, but spends 
about $127,000 on its annual operating budget, according to Pat Berman, 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Donations 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada group, in contrast, spends less than $10,000 of the money that it 
raises each year on operations, largely for printing and mailing costs. Most 
other expenses, such as T-shirts for a jog-a-thon and food and wine for a 
fund-raising gourmet dinner, are donated by local businesses, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Telephones, manned by up to 100 volunteers for some fund-raising programs, are 
provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a strong supporter of the foundation. 
Many JPL employees live in the city and their children attend local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate support for local school districts is becoming increasingly important 
nationwide, according to the National School Boards Assn., which estimates that 
more than 1,000 educational foundations supplement public school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"There may not be a lot of individual money for schools, but there still is a 
lot of corporate money out there," said William Tanner, a researcher for the 
national association. "During the last few years, we've seen more and more 
support from corporate America for the local schools, especially in California 
with all of its high-tech business. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the children in the schools as their workers of the future."
