$15-MILLION SCIENCE CENTER FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS;

<P>
The much-heralded $15.4-million science center at Cal State Northridge faces so 
many problems that some professors have refused to move in when it opens later 
this year, and others are demanding changes before they give up the out-of-date 
facilities they now occupy. 
</P>
<P>
As described by disappointed faculty members, the problems range from 
laboratory benches that swell by 50% when they get wet, to vibrations from the 
climate control system that threaten to render useless the sensitive scientific 
equipment the center was built to house. 
</P>
<P>
Fingers are being pointed every which way, and even those administrators who 
remain optimistic that corrections can be made agree that the lingering 
problems highlight failures in the way the state university system manages 
construction. They say some of those same obstacles may have led to 
installation of an inadequate air conditioning system in CSUN faculty offices 
built in 1984 and to the cave-in of a music building roof at Cal State Long 
Beach last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, the process collapsed, and I suspect it was when 
dollars became important," said CSUN chemistry professor Ricardo Silva, who a 
year ago was appointed liaison between the science faculty and campus planners. 
"There should have been a lot more consultation with the people who were going 
to use the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Construction and outfitting of the three structures that make up the new 
science center -- two filled with laboratories and offices and a third 
containing a 105-seat planetarium -- have been financed largely by state 
higher-education bonds. The bonds were approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The largest outstanding -- and most disconcerting -- problem with the center 
appeared earlier this month, when one of the three ventilation fans was turned 
on. Faculty and administrators on hand for the test said they could feel mild 
vibrations in the building. When they told their colleagues, panic erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"There had been a general feeling of let's get in the building and we'll be 
able to fix the glitches," said chemistry professor Henry Abrash. "But when it 
came to the vibration, a whole wave of concern went through the faculty that 
this is just not something we could patch up." 
</P>
<P>
For microbiologist Edward Pollock, witnessing the vibrations made his run-down 
facilities in one of the 1950s-era science buildings suddenly more attractive. 
More than half of a floor in the new center was dedicated to his laboratories 
and classrooms, yet he is among a handful of faculty members who have already 
indicated they plan to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to get a good science building and we're getting a disaster," 
Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock and his students rely on the magnifying powers of the electron 
microscope, which enables them to view objects as small as the fibers on a 
tumor cell. Even now, in its location in a large closet down the hall from his 
office, there are days when the microscope is unusable because movement in the 
old building blurs its images, Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chatham, vice president in charge of facilities planning at CSUN, blamed 
problems in the new building on poor communication among the various parties 
involved in building at the state universities: the faculty, campus planners, 
state university system engineers and the site's architect and contractor. And 
Chatham said the state formula used to forecast building costs produces 
estimates that often are unrealistically low, forcing plans to be put out for 
bid numerous times with quality cutbacks made each time. 
</P>
<P>
The science building was put out for bid three times before a contractor made a 
bid within the $14.6-million budget, said Peter Ruppel, a representative of the 
project's architect, Leo A. Daly. Compromises were made at each stage, such as 
the quality of wood used in the cabinetry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a scenario of pointing fingers, because I don't have 
enough fingers to point," he said. "But there was not a lot of feedback to say, 
'We can't do what you want. Is this going to be satisfactory?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even an independent review, first required in 1985 to avoid structural flaws 
that could lead to disasters such as the music building collapse at Long Beach, 
never was intended to include review of ventilation systems and cabinet 
materials, said Richard Esgate, the consultant hired to critique most state 
university construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through CSUN's existing science buildings illustrates the need for the 
new center, faculty said. Insect storage cabinets line the hallways, safety 
showers drip on classroom floors, modern equipment is squeezed into supply 
closets, and some faculty offices are in portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) who fought for three years to obtain 
funding for the new science center, said he had not heard about the problems 
before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"After all we had to go through to get the money for that building, if they 
screwed it up by cutting corners or not supervising or hiring the wrong 
contractor, I'm going to be really mad," Katz said. "There are hundreds of 
bureaucrats in the state university system whose job it is to make sure 
taxpayers' money is not wasted, and if they're not doing their job, then it's 
time for them to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, construction costs are more than $600,000 over the original 
$14.6-million budget, according to statistics supplied by the CSU system and 
the Assembly subcommittee on higher education. Only about $100,000 remains in a 
contingency fund set up for last-minute changes. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the new center's shortcomings was gradual. Some faculty recall 
voicing concerns when architectural drawings first came to them for review five 
years ago. Others said they didn't realize there were glitches and gaffes until 
construction started in 1987. Still others said their first hint that things 
were not as they should be emerged last summer during tours of the partly 
completed center. 
</P>
<P>
All faculty interviewed said they trusted the Omaha-based architectural firm 
the campus has used for many of its construction projects to see that their 
often unusual needs were accommodated. Other projects done by the Leo A. Daly 
firm include the renovation and expansion of the UCLA School of Engineering and 
Applied Science and design of the Earth and Space Science Laboratory at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, astronomy professors found that seats in the new planetarium were 
installed at a permanent incline, making use of the building as a lecture hall 
uncomfortable if not impossible. Biology professors found their classrooms were 
equipped with lighting that automatically turns on when someone enters the 
room, which precludes darkening the room to project slides or films. Chemistry 
professors found ventilation hoods installed over student experiment stations 
lacked the necessary electrical outlets or sinks. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Skovlin, chairman of the chemistry department, took a piece of the 
pressed-wood material used for two-thirds of the science benches back to his 
laboratory and immersed it in a beaker of water. He said it expanded by half 
overnight, and even when dried out again it remained swollen by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine what's going to happen in a laboratory environment," Skovlin 
said. "We're going to have problems down the line and we'll be expected to 
replace those cabinets out of our department budgets." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the errors have been corrected and many more are slated to be, said Don 
Bianchi, dean of the School of Science and Mathematics. No complete tally has 
been made, but so far some of the costs have been borne by the contractor and 
subcontractors, some by the university, and others have yet to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of perpetual vibrations is the most serious of the remaining 
problems, Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
The electron microscope is not the only vibration-sensitive instrument 
scheduled to go into the new buildings, faculty said. Modern college science 
instruction and research relies on lasers, balances, tissue slicers and a 
myriad of other precise equipment. Even standard microscopes could be affected 
if the movement is violent enough. 
</P>
<P>
What perplexes Pollock is that he vividly recalls numerous conversations during 
the past two years concerning the need to avoid any vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said that at one point the architect's representative, Ruppel, assured 
him that a separate foundation would be poured for the sensitive equipment 
area. He said he didn't realize that the specification had been changed or 
overlooked until the day the foundation was poured. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi and other campus administrators hold out hope that the movement 
occurred primarily because the fans were not balanced properly. A second 
ventilation test is scheduled in early November .
