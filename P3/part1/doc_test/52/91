When a hostess at the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington, D.C., began lecturing 
and shouting at a group of young visitors, Karin Bartel of Monrovia was taken 
aback. 
</P>
<P>
"She was perturbed at Americans," said Bartel, 18. "I had to step back and try 
to understand their side of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bartel is among three San Gabriel Valley teen-agers who visited legislators, 
diplomats and lobbyists in Washington last week as scholars in the Postgraduate 
National Young Leaders Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Other San Gabriel Valley youths attending the weeklong conference were Kevin 
Eng of South Pasadena and Malcolm Murphy of Pasadena. Neil Mouneimne of 
neighboring La Canada Flintridge, was also one of 350 teen-agers attending 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, a 
4-year-old, nonprofit, educational organization designed to give young people a 
chance to learn more about the workings of government. Selection of the 
teen-agers was based on their academic achievement and leadership skills, a 
council spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
During their week in the nation's capital, the students met with California 
senators Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson. Bartel, Mouneimne and Eng also met 
their congressman, Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 18, was scheduled to spend time with his congressman, Edward Roybal 
(D-Los Angeles). A graduate of Don Bosco Technical High School in Rosemead, he 
plans to attend Pasadena City College in September. He is active in the youth 
group at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Bartel, who plans to study English at Cal Poly Pomona and become a high school 
teacher, said: "I think this is good experience for a teacher. This is 
something I can share with students." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Rio Hondo Preparatory School in Arcadia, Bartel was on the high 
school's varsity volleyball team and served as student government secretary her 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic Reaction 
</P>
<P>
For 17-year-old Mouneimne, a computer science buff and member of the Explorers' 
Post at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, the weeklong experience was 
an eye-opener. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "a once-in-a-lifetime chance," he said the experience was well 
worth the $800 for air fare, room and board -- which he paid for with savings 
and help from his parents 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I came here is so I can learn about things not directly related to 
computer science," Mouneimne said. "I feel I have an obligation as a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Mouneimne graduated from La Canada High School and plans to study computer 
science at USC this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Eng, 18, a graduate of South Pasadena High School, where he was the student 
body's commissioner for academics and a student representative to the school 
board, will attend Seton Hall University in New Jersey. He wants to be a 
lawyer. And he got some practice at the conference, where he was able to play 
the role of a defense attorney during a group debate over capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning hands-on stuff that you can't learn in a book," Eng said. 
</P>
<P>
After the conference, he was scheduled to begin a two-week internship with the 
Governmental National Mortgage Assn. office, which is under the jurisdiction of 
the department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real experience," Eng said of his week on Capitol Hill. "I'll 
remember it forever."
