<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  The history of Japan's space development began with the 
pencil rocket launching test conducted by the University of 
Tokyo in 1955. In 1969 National Space Development Agency of 
Japan (NASDA) was established. 
  Introducing U.S. technology, Japan developed the N-I rocket, 
followed by the N-II and H-I rockets. At present, an H-II rocket 
is under development designed solely with Japanese technology. 
The H-II rocket will deliver four times more power than its 
predecessor and will have a capability of launching a 2-ton 
class geostationary satellite. 
  When complete, the new rocket will move Japan to a 
world-class country in the field of space development. The 
following are the outline and future outlook of the H-II rocket. 
<H5>  Outline of H-II Rocket </H5>
<H5>  1) Purpose of Development </H5>
  The work on developing the H-II rocket (Fig. 1) started in 
1986 with the purpose of providing this country with her own 
world-level transport system and of promoting Japan's space 
activities. Based on Japanese technology acquired through rocket 
development and operation so far, the H-II rocket is designed to 
meet broad demands for the launching of 2-ton class 
geostationary satellites and other devices at an internationally 
acceptable launching cost. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-31A>           Fig. 1. Comparison of H-II Rocket With World's Major Rockets </FIG>




<H5>  2) Structure and Specifications </H5>
  The H-II rocket is a two-stage rocket with a high-power 
rocket engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as 
propulsion fuel and with an auxiliary engine in the form of a 
large-sized solid rocket booster. 
  The basic model of the H-II rocket is designed for launching 
a single geostationary triple-axis satellite. However, by 
changing its structure, the rocket is also capable of launching 
low- and medium-altitude satellites and multiple satellites. The 
H-II rocket is a transport system that will have the capacity, 
in the future, to meet a broad range of demands including the 
launching of moon and planet surveyors. 
  The H-II rocket is of a simple two-stage formation but has a 
vastly increased launching capability compared with Japan's past 
rockets by improving the propulsion and other systems. 
  The first-stage engine is LE-7 (Fig. 2), a two-stage 
combustion cycle type liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket 
engine now under development based on the technology of H-I 
rocket's second-stage engine, LE-5. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-32A>           Fig. 2. LE-7 Engine's System Chart </FIG>




  The development of a system using the two-stage combustion 
cycle method is difficult due to the high temperature and 
pressure of combustion gas which are higher than those of the 
gas generator method employed in the LE-5 engine. The new method 
has been adopted practically only in U.S. space shuttles and the 
former Soviet Union's Energia rocket. 
  The H-II rocket's second-stage engine is LE-5A, a liquid 
oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine of expander breed cycle 
type. The LE-5 adopted the gas generator method, but, for LE-5A, 
the method was changed into a structurally simple expander breed 
cycle system to gain improved functions and higher reliability. 
  Using LE-5A engine's re-ignition function, the H-II rocket 
is 
capable, in its second stage, of launching a satellite into a 
transfer orbit toward a geostationary orbit. 
  The solid rocket booster, SRB, is unlike the solid auxiliary 
rocket, SOB, adopted through the H-I rocket, a large-sized solid 
motor now being newly developed using solid propulsion fuel of 
composite type. The SRB has a movable nozzle for position 
control. 
  The H-II rocket will be fitted with large-sized satellite 
fairings of four and five meters in diameters, double the scale 
of those of the H-I rocket, to meet the future demand for 
large-sized satellites. 
  The guidance control of the H-II launcher will be of the 
inertia guidance control type, similar to the one employed in 
the H-II launcher, but the H-II attitude control method will 
change from the H-I platform method to the strap down method. 
<H5>  Development of H-II Rocket </H5>
  The H-II rocket is being developed solely with Japanese 
technology and the work of development has faced one 
technological difficulty after another. It was particularly 
difficult to develop the LE-7, the main first-stage engine. The 
following are the outlines of the LE-7 engine. 
<H5>  1) Current World Situation </H5>
  Rocket engines use oil fuel, liquid hydrogen fuel, solid 
fuel, etc.; among these, liquid hydrogen provides the highest 
performance. However, the use of liquid hydrogen fuel involves 
serious technological difficulties and only the United States, 
the former Soviet Union, Japan and the European Space Agency 
have successfully operated or developed engines with thrusts of 
more than 100 tons. 
<H5>  2) Technological Problems </H5>
  Liquid hydrogen has an extremely low temperature of minus 
253 
degrees centigrade and liquid oxygen minus 183 degrees. If air 
remains in the movable parts of the engine, lubricant oil 
freezes, and the engine fails to operate fully. 
  The combustion temperature of the gas rises to 3,200 to 
3,300 
degrees centigrade, melting or burning ordinary metals. 
  Rocket engines show high performance as combustion pressure 
is increased. To take advantage of this merit, the high-pressure 
combustion method is employed, requiring the development of 
high- pressure combustion technology and high-pressure turbo 
pumps of large power to send propellant into the combustion 
chambers under high pressure. 
  Thus, the development of a large-sized liquid oxygen or 
hydrogen engine contains technological difficulties in handling 
simultaneously the three factors of extremely low temperature, 
extremely high temperature and extremely high pressure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-33A>           Figure </FIG>



<H5>  3) Purposes of LE-7 Development </H5>
  One of the purposes of developing the LE-7 engine is to 
provide high-performance launch vehicles with large-sized liquid 
oxygen/hydrogen engines to utilize space environment and send 
explorers to nearby planets in the near future. 
  Another purpose is to establish liquid hydrogen technology 
as 
the fuel considered the best for the future scramjet, an air 
inducting ultra-sonic speed combustion engine, which is to power 
a single-stage rocket. Such a rocket is currently thought of as 
the best space transport system in the next generation. 
<H5>  4) Current Situation of LE-7 Development </H5>
  The work to develop the LE-7 engine started simultaneously 
with the development of the H-II rocket and is under way, 
overcoming various technological difficulties. In November 1992, 
the engine design was determined. Combustion tests, combining 
the LE-7 engine with the first-stage rocket body, were held from 
February through July 1993. 
  As a result, the development of the LE-7 engine is nearing 
completion and the H-II rocket took a giant stride toward the 
maiden flight in February 1, 1994. 
<H5>  Future of H-II Rocket </H5>
<H5>  1) H-II Rocket Launching Plans </H5>
  The H-II rocket's test flight No. 1, TF No. 1, is scheduled 
to be launched in February 1, 1994 and launching plans have 
already been decided through the sixth test flight (The 
launching schedule in Table 1 is as per the space development 
plans decided on 15 March 1993). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-34A>           Table 1. Satellite Launching Schedule by H-II </FIG>




   The TF No. 1 (scheduled for launch in 1 February 1994) is 
planned to carry payloads for confirmation of functions (VEP) 
and an Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX). The TF No. 2 
(scheduled for launch in August-September, 1994) is to launch 
the Engineering Test Satellite VI (ETS-VI), and the TF No. 3 
(scheduled for launch in January-February, 1995) will launch the 
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS-5) and the Space 
Flyer Unit (SFU). 
  The flight No. 4 (scheduled for launch in January-February, 
1996) is to launch the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite 
(ADEOS); the flight No. 5 (January-February 1997), the 
Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite 
(COMETS); the flight No. 6 (August-September 1997), the Tropical 
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Engineering Test 
Satellite VII (ETS-VII). 
<H5>  2) Future Plans </H5>
  Studies are being made on H-II-derived rockets to meet 
future 
launching demands on the basis of the H-II development 
technology, such as a plan to strengthen the capability of 
launching payloads into low orbits. 
  Japan needs to develop its own space transport system to 
supply and recollect commodities for the utilization of the 
space environment. The research and development of the unmanned 
winged shuttle HOPE (H-II Orbit Plane) has been conducted with 
the target of first flight by the early 2000s. There is a plan 
to use an H-II-derived rocket to launch HOPE. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The H-II rocket is thus Japan's mainstay launch vehicle in 
the future and has broad potentials to meet various needs. When 
this rocket is completed, Japan will be able to further 
contribute to international cooperation in the field of space 
development and make giant strides toward the construction of 
space infrastructure.
