<P>
For some workers these days, retirement age is 55, or even 50. 
</P>
<P>
Not for Alex Glattstein Stone, who, despite quadruple-bypass heart surgery 
several years ago, has no intention of turning in his working papers until his 
75th birthday, early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Officially a senior programmer/analyst at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena but a self-described "mathematician doing computer programming," Stone 
is developing a computerized telephone directory for JPL's 9,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an excellent worker and very sensitive to people," said Fernando Alvarez, 
Stone's supervisor at JPL. Stone has also written a computer software user's 
manual and a recent article for JPL's newsletter, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his age allows him to understand people much better," Alvarez said. "He 
gets along with people very well." 
</P>
<P>
"What he does is always done well," added Janet Zadeh, a former boss. "He's 
probably more thorough than a lot of the younger workers." 
</P>
<P>
Stone returned to work only three months after his heart surgery in 1981. 
"Actually, (my doctor) thinks working is good for the health," he said. "As 
long as you don't work under stress or duress or something like that, and I do 
not." 
</P>
<P>
But severe stress shaped his early life. Born in Hungary in 1916, Stone studied 
law instead of mathematics at the university because anti-Jewish laws made it 
extremely difficult for a Jewish student to enter the small math program. 
</P>
<P>
Once enrolled, he had to contend with anti-Semitic students. "A couple of times 
we were kicked out of school -- literally -- by the students," he said. "They 
took us to the top of the stairs and kicked us down because we were Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he graduated, Jewish lawyers were not being admitted to the bar in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Stone spent most of World War II in forced-labor camps run by the Hungarian 
army, a situation he describes as tolerable. "We still felt like human beings," 
he said. In 1944, however, he was sent to the Nazi concentration camp at 
Dachau, near Munich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, to say the least, subhuman and miserable," Stone said. "We felt like 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
He and his brother Michael survived. But after the war, he learned that his 
mother and another brother had been killed at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Stone immigrated to the United States in 1949. He became a U.S. citizen in 1955 
and changed his name to Stone, keeping his former surname, Glattstein, as his 
middle name. He received a master's degree in mathematics from George 
Washington University in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted a job with JPL in May, 1969, and has since helped supervise and 
implement software projects for satellite tracking systems and the Voyager 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Susan Tarjan Stone, owner of a skin-care salon, live in 
Encino. They have two sons: Peter, 41, and Victor, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, a precise, soft-spoken man with a quiet sense of humor, listed two 
reasons why he hasn't retired already. One is financial. The other "is that I 
like what I'm doing, and when you like what you're doing you don't feel like 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"But at 75, I think I'm ready to retire and work at home -- not for money but 
for enjoyment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He detailed plans to write a history of his family and said he'll also play 
with his two personal computers -- and with his 18-month-old grandson, Michael 
-- after retiring at the end of January.
