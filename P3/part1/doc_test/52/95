by 2000" 
  [Text] Bangalore, 25 Nov (UNI)--India could 
conceive an interplanetary mission to Mercury, by the turn of 
the century, using the Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). 
  Delivering the presidential address at the physical sciences 
section of the 63rd annual session of the National Academy of 
Sciences here on Wednesday, Dr K. Kasturirangan, Director of the 
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellite centre here, 
said studies exploring the possibility of such a mission carried 
out by ISRO were quite encouraging and the mission appeared 
feasible. 
  The study was carried out in the wake of the recent advances 
made in the realisation of a geosynchronous launch capability. 
  He, however, said a time schedule for such a mission had not 
been fixed as yet. 
  Dr Kasturirangan said the GSLV could be used for a mission 
to 
launch a spacecraft to Mercury, either as a fly-by or as an 
orbiter to the planet using the gravity-assist trajectories of 
the planetary probe due to Venus and Mercury itself. 
  He said ISRO has also framed the objectives and profile of 
an 
Indian planetary mission to Venus and Mercury. 
  The GSLV would launch the spacecraft first into a 300 km 
orbit and later boosted to a heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft 
would be designed to provide three axis stabilisation using the 
sun for pitch and yaw control and a star as a roll reference. 
  In situ particle detectors, plasma probes and 
magnetometer onboard the orbiter could provide vital information 
on solar wind and associated phenomena. 
  A fly-by mission of Venus and Mercury would provide some 
opportunity to have a short glimpse of these planets. The 
mercury orbiter could carry a number of instruments for imaging 
the surface and for remote measurements of the surface 
parameters and environment of the planet. 
  Dr Kasturirangan said the instruments in such an orbiter 
could include ultra violet spectrometer for determining 
elemental composition of rare and other gases and throw light on 
the sodium enigma of Mercury, plasma analyser to measure solar 
wind particles in the transitional atmosphere of the planet, 
imaging with television cameras at a high resolution of 50 to 
100 metres in different visible and infrared bands, gamma ray, 
x-ray and infrared spectroscopy to study the composition of the 
surface material of the planet. 
  He said India could also go in for a multi-wavelength space 
observatory that could be launched by the Polar Satellite Launch 
Vehicle (PSLV) to a low earth inclined orbit. A space astronomy 
mission capitalising on simultaneous multiple wavelength 
observations of celestial "flash" transient phenomena.
