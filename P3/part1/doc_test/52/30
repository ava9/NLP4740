<P>
LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the 
Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders 
for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to 
savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a 
morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more 
than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary 
exploration. If it didn't, it would be just another on a list of 
disappointments NASA has handed to Friedman in the past 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
He moved a few feet from his friends among the crowd of spectators at Cape 
Canaveral and positioned himself in clear view of the launch pad. Then he 
stared into the distance at the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled 
momentarily to take the spacecraft Magellan into Earth orbit and then send it 
on its way to Venus. 
</P>
<P>
As a 31-year-old engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1972, Friedman's 
first supervisory job was study leader and program manager for the then-unnamed 
Magellan project. Had anyone told him then that he would be a grandfather by 
the time Magellan flew, he wouldn't have believed them. But since the 
mid-1970s, he had gradually become disillusioned with the false starts and 
delays in the American space program. 
</P>
<P>
This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take 
part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space 
exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered 
its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things, 
he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of 
conventional rockets to launch spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected; 
the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help 
but immediately see the irony. 
</P>
<P>
"When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could 
also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch," 
he recalls a few weeks later. "Boy, did I wish we were using that." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then, 
Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff 
at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy 
any successful launch -- even one that comes years late. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century 
Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. ("Size is 
not power," he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a 
needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's 
likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch, 
the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to 
work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one 
wonders if the jogging isn't overkill. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal 
man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans -- 
the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind 
planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched 
Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman 
of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. "What I want to do," Friedman says, 
"is make space exploration happen." 
</P>
<P>
Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration 
what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to 
conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's 
space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single 
great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's 
leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace 
through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public 
interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that 
grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington 
policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on 
its old, optimistic track. 
</P>
<P>
As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and 
even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the 
exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his 
background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do. 
"I live, breathe and eat Mars," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of 
scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the 
NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown, 
a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a 
society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune 
in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted 
to the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him 
a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed 
to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. "Oh, I would love a 
downlink (in the dealerships)," he groans. "Anything we can do to get this 
stuff into peoples' hands across America." 
</P>
<P>
Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade 
magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the 
Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon 
Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only 
American quoted in the story. 
</P>
<P>
His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or 
the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed 
and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a 
colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal 
should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman, 
the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the 
moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising. 
Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a 
more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and 
his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something 
simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his 
charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This 
evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and 
indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his 
argument for a mission to Mars all over again. 
</P>
<P>
WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist, 
much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of 
planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War 
competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about 
the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies, 
explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets 
could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during 
those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the 
technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate 
in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner 
10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and 
Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge 
of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he 
sounds almost wistful. "Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration -- 
the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new 
President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in 
1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon, 
President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a 
quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. ("You don't go to space to be cheap," 
Friedman grouses today. "You stay home to be cheap.") Nixon rejected another of 
the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending 
humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after 
his White House tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began 
to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would 
be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's 
annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last 
year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8 
billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration 
changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According 
to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation, 
planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for 
planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years 
ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches 
stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to 
the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and 
a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman 
applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate 
committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance 
to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space 
policy-making in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the 
stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of 
JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab. 
Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager 
spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that 
this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President 
Carter told Sagan as much at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their 
gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would 
have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to 
start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in 
anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary 
Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to 
attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to 
influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research. 
And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space 
policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and 
Murray, too. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a 
sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members. 
Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and 
full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known 
space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million, 
supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations. 
</P>
<P>
During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly 
conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees 
and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA 
budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing 
campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986 
while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated 
10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later 
when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for 
signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing 
a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000 
to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that 
still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they 
believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when, 
in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the 
effects of space weapons on civilian use of space. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between 
the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to 
hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader 
of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested 
that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation 
displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier. 
What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of "electricity" 
through the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are interested in pumping the economy," Sagan told the audience, "there 
are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of 
the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological 
capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars 
technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to 
Mars." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later 
adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet 
scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country 
performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to 
Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The 
Planetary Society had found its goal. 
</P>
<P>
IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was 
entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an 
ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13 
years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space 
commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching 
satellites and spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had 
promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its 
critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The 
shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine 
failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was 
it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets. 
</P>
<P>
To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an 
effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams 
of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency 
-- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some 
of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles 
Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on "the timing of goals and 
funding." Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in 
the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and 
the society were tense at best. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive 
soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher 
commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could 
regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's 
goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon 
with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly: 
"America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to 
continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved 
Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that 
these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a 
precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened 
without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society. 
</P>
<P>
Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and 
Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance, 
it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon 
planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through 
legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer, 
an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it 
goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint 
U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat -- 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the 
Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the 
society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars 
goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first 
private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two 
tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make 
up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an 
experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon, 
which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an 
unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary 
Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a 
chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United 
States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal 
without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to 
design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact 
Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium 
guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface 
of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for 
analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the 
balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first 
prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost 
$450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency 
was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in 
donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest 
engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has 
volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on 
weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August 
in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to 
France in September. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint 
U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of 
it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador 
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its "Mars 
Declaration," an 800-word statement published last year calling for human 
exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the 
space agency, he says, thinks it would "be a great thing to do." Then come the 
caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the 
Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? "Making Mars (exploration) dependent on 
peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars," says John Logsdon, a 
Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute 
at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that 
it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission 
would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate. 
To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have 
to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the 
agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget 
demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have another question about the economics. "There's sort of a 
knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree," 
says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory 
board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth. 
However, he sees the Mars mission as a "vastly expensive undertaking" that 
would "seriously handicap" valuable unmanned projects. 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona, 
slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a 
chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped 
generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the 
Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he 
argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of 
linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is 
pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge 
price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national 
purpose, he says. 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually 
matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with 
presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars 
Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the 
first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman 
concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the 
Mars initiative, "the whole momentum will be lost" for at least the next four 
years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The 
challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in 
the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell 
the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a 
waste? 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant 
as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John 
Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key 
advice on how to set up a public-interest group. "Reform is never completed. 
You never succeed," Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. "It's a process. It 
goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We 
always keep hope alive."
