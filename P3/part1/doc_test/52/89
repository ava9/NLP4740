The Galileo spacecraft fired its thrusters today to start the first of about 30 
course corrections it will make during its six-year, 2.4-billion-mile journey 
to Jupiter.

"So far everything is going just fine," said Neal Ausman, Galileo mission 
director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. "Everything is looking just exactly like it ought to."

During the maneuver, which started at 8:31 a.m. and will end Saturday night, 
Galileo will fire four of its 12 thrusters in a series of pulses, he said.
