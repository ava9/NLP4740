The Voyager 2 probe discovered two more moons around Neptune, pushing the 
ringed planet's total to eight as the probe raced toward its long-awaited 
late-night flyby of the "puzzling" blue planet, scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it! This is the 24 hours we've been waiting for," Voyager project 
scientist Edward Stone said at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
With Neptune filling the field of view in Voyager 2's cameras, a spectacular 
photograph was radioed back to Earth showing intricate detail of the Great Dark 
Spot, a titanic storm system topped by brilliant white cirrus clouds, a storm 
so large it could swallow the entire planet Earth.

Astronomer Bradford Smith announced that two more moons were discovered, one 
measuring just 30 miles or so across and another with a diameter of about 55 
miles. The moons have been temporarily dubbed 1989 N5 and 1989 N6. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Voyager 2 will streak 3,000 miles above Neptune's north polar 
cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. -- the closest the probe has been to a planet since 
launch from Earth 12 years and four days ago.
