JUDGE RULES ASHTON-TATE'S DBASE SOFTWARE COPYRIGHTS ARE INVALID 
</P>

A federal judge shocked the software industry Thursday, ruling that Ashton-Tate 
Corp.'s copyrights on its top-selling dBase line of personal computer programs 
are invalid because the company repeatedly failed to disclose the product's 
intellectual origins. 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling is not overturned, it could cause chaos to Ashton-Tate's business 
by giving competitors full rights to copy the firm's primary product. But 
company executives and software industry analysts said they expect the ruling 
to be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling doesn't necessarily threaten other firms' software products, 
analysts said. However, it does put all software publishers on notice to pay 
strict attention to the origins of the work they claim as their own. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter in Los Angeles said 
Ashton-Tate "knowingly and with an intent to deceive," failed to disclose that 
its dBase programs stemmed from a publicly available software program created 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 1in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
This "inequitable conduct," Hatter ruled, invalidated all the copyrights issued 
for the dBase programs, a series of database management software whose sales 
account for more than 60% of the Torrance-based company's annual revenue and 
have made the firm the nation's fourth-largest PC software publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate executives, clearly surprised by the ruling, vowed to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the court ruling is in error and we are confident that our 
copyrights are valid," said William P. Lyons, Ashton-Tate's chief executive. 
"There was no intention to mislead." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the company did not disclose the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
connection because the attorney who filed the original copyright application in 
1983 was unaware of it. Subsequent copyright filings for new dBase programs, 
company officers said, were simply copied from the first. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons maintained that the ruling would have little immediate impact on sales by 
the company, which has been battling -- with some success -- in recent months 
to recover from a series of blunders two years ago that caused losses of more 
than $50 million and severe erosion of its market share to hard-charging 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Nycum, a Palo Alto attorney specializing in intellectual property issues, 
said that, although other copyright holders have been similarly punished in the 
past, Hatter's ruling is the first time a judge has stripped a software 
publisher of its copyrights for failing to disclose the intellectual origins of 
its work. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the ruling is sweeping," Nycum acknowledged. "But the lesson here is that 
people have to realize how serious it is to be incorrect in filing these 
copyright applications. Many times, software companies just don't research the 
origin of what they buy from outsiders and publish as their own." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is successfully appealed, Nycum said, the ruling will prompt 
software publishers to "make sure their own houses are in order." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling resulted from a copyright infringement lawsuit filed two years ago 
by Ashton-Tate against two competitors for selling database management software 
that allegedly copied the "form of expression" and "novel look and feel" of 
dBase. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants, Fox Software of Perrysburg, Ohio, asked that the suit be 
dismissed because Ashton-Tate had repeatedly failed to disclose on its 
copyright applications that dBase was derived from JPLDIS, a software program 
for managing huge databases on mainframe computers, developed at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate bought the rights to the original dBase program in 1981 from C. 
Wayne Ratliff, a former JPL engineer, and developed the top-selling program 
from it. According to company lore, Ratliff originally wrote the program on his 
own time to collect, sort and manage the office football pool. 
</P>
<P>
A JPL spokesman said Thursday that the original dBase program is "the same as 
JPLDIS, only modified for the personal computer." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agreed and said the fact was hardly a secret in the software industry. 
"Everyone knew that," said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry 
newsletter in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were trying to hide it, they did a damn poor job," added Richard 
Shaffer, an industry analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Ashton-Tate executives said they did not tell the U.S. Copyright Office 
about the JPL connection until last month, after Fox raised the issue in the 
lawsuit. The company said it disclosed the information then to show Fox that 
the JPL connection would not matter to the Copyright Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that JPLDIS is not an underlying work for dBase," said Stanley 
Witlow, Ashton-Tate's general counsel. "There was no intent to defraud." 
</P>
<P>
Witlow said dBase does not contain any lines of code similar to JPLDIS. 
Further, he said, the original program was written for a mainframe computer, 
but dBase is strictly meant to be used on a personal computer.
