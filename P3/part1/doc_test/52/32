I AM ON my way to Pasadena, to visit the good folk who run the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. I am not
hurrying directly there, but taking a scenic route - Los Angeles, Cabo San
Lucas, Mazatlan, Acapulco, Hollywood, Pasadena.
My mission: to learn something at the JPL about Nasa's Dollars 100m SETI
programme, or search for extraterrestial intelligence, to be formally
launched on October 12, Columbus Day. SETI is an attempt at interstellar
eavesdropping that may yield evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in our
own Milky Way.
However, before leaving London I had to give my executive assistant, Miss
Lee, a crash course in the background to the SETI programme, so that she
could appear reasonably intelligent when in telephonic contact with the
executive assistants at the JPL. I didn't want her letting the side down.
Miss Lee is in upmode at present: so svelte and groomed that she has dug out
all her miniskirts. But like most of my friends and colleagues, Miss Lee has
the faintest grasp possible of the importance of SETI, and confuses it with
the notion of green men with pointed ears buzzing about in UFOs.
'Look,' I said. 'SETI is nothing to do with UFOs or beings that look like
blancmanges, though they might. It is about listening for messages. Not
sending anything, listening. Quite possibly the number of civilisations in
the Milky Way is one - us. Perhaps civilisations take billions of years to
evolve and then immolate themselves soon after reaching the technological
stage.
'But perhaps not. Perhaps there are 1m civilisations distributed more or
less randomly through the galaxy. The average separation between them would
be 300 light years. And they might be sending messages. It is cheaper to
beam radio messages than to gallivant through space or colonise stars.
'It would be easy for extraterrestials to send unambiguous messages,' I
continued. 'For example, a modulated beacon-signal comprising the numbers 1,
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 and 31 - the first dozen prime numbers -
could only have a biological origin.
'And those messages could be inconceivably rich. Perhaps, when we tune in,
we will find ourselves listening to Volume 4,507 of Encyclopaedia Galactica.
As my good friend Carl Sagan has put it: 'We would discover the nature of
other civilisations. There would be many of them, each composed of organisms
astonishingly different from anything on this planet. They would view the
universe somewhat differently. They would have different arts and social
functions. They would be interested in things we never thought of. By
comparing our knowledge with theirs, we would grow immeasurably'.'
I smiled wisely, and concluded: 'If SETI hits the jackpot, stunning insights
are possible in the physical, biological and social sciences - all of them
filtered through the novel perspective of beings that may be profoundly
dissimilar - in the deepest sense different - to us. To quote Carl Sagan.'
Miss Lee patted her hair, checked her lipstick and studied the sueded tips
of her Pounds 200 shoes.
'I see, Michael,' she said. 'If I have grasped things correctly from your
interstellar musings, Nasa's SETI programme shows the hallmarks of an
imaginative and inquisitive civilisation - us - that is hoping,
cost-effectively, to browse through a few chapters of Encyclopaedia
Galactica. Right?
'And you are travelling to Pasadena to meet top Nasa scientists who are
hoping to stumble across radio-beamed advice columns from beings in the
Milky Way that may help us solve some of our local difficulties. Our wars
and nuclear arsenals. Growing populations. Pestilence and pollution. The
gulf between rich and poor. Our profligacy with resources and the way we are
hounding to extinction thousands of lesser species. Right?'
'Correct,' I said, suddenly on my guard.
'But what about small things?' Miss Lee continued. 'Has it occurred to you,
Michael, that the likeliest threats to civilisation are not the big things,
like nuclear war, to which this planet devotes endless man-hours of study
and contemplation, but little things. Irritants. Snicks. Puncture wounds
that we don't really feel but which could prove fatal.'
'Like?'
'Well . . . Virginia Bottomley. Or son-of-poll-tax. Or ITV. Diets. Pushing
in bus queues. The cost of dry cleaning. Neil Kinnock. Criticism of the
monarchy. Stuffiness. Diffidence. The Daily Telegraph. People who forget
birthdays. Red ties and green shirts. Music critics. All critics. Sales
talk. Treading on frogs. Pinchings and pattings. Airs and graces.
Condescension. Men.'
No wonder I am lying low in Hollywood.
