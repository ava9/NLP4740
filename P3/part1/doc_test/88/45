FT  11 NOV 93 / Lib Dems in fresh racism charge

THE LIBERAL Democrat party was embroiled in a racism row last night after
party officials condemned a leaflet issued by its activists in east London,
but said they had no power to discipline the authors.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, was said to be 'ballistic' about the
leaflet, in which an article about violence against old people is
illustrated with a picture of a black boxer.
The leaflet was distributed to residents of Tower Hamlets, a Liberal
Democrat-controlled borough where Mr Derek Beackon, of the far-right British
National Party, won a council by-election last month.
Leaflets issued by Liberal Democrat activists in Tower Hamlets have been
vetted by party headquarters since Mr Ashdown set up an inquiry into the
publication of another allegedly racist leaflet during the by-election
campaign.
Party officials said the latest leaflet was allowed to go ahead because a
copy sent to Mr Graham Elson, the party's general secretary, was blurred.
Mr Elson said the party was 'determined to stamp this out as soon as
possible'. However, he said officials had no power to ban the publication of
future leaflets, or to suspend or expel the authors until the inquiry
reports.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said he planned to refer
the latest leaflet to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, for a ruling
on a possible prosecution for incitement to racial hatred.
