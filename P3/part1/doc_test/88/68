The great, the good and the frankly pretentious from the theatrical
avant-garde have descended on Vienna in equal measure this year. As Europe's
showcase for radical drama, the Festwochen lays down no rigid themes, but
over the days connections emerge: this time an emphasis on classic
archetypes, from fairy tale to Shakespeare, controversially updated.
The hot news from week one is that the new English production Cinderella,
adapted by Tony Britten and Nick Broadhurst from Rossini's La Cenerentola,
is star of the show and one of the most dazzling examples of contemporary
revision which, through images drawn from our own social reality - the
Ferrari, Essex Man - revitalises the essential myths love and forgiveness,
power and control, survival - of the original.
Britten and Broadhurst are founders of Music Theatre London, the opera
ensemble which casts actors and singers, rather than opera singers, in witty
new translations of opera-drama. Their Cinderella opening out-shocks Opera
Factory's 1980s bikini Cos fan tutte: The ugly sisters, played i travesti by
Simon Butteriss in a butch pink swimsuit and by William Renton in a froth of
petticoats, lounge on the diving board of a pool and swap transvestite
fantasies about Prince Ramiro's ball. Cinders flames the plastic red
barbecue and fixes the sunshades on the Costa-del-Basildon villa guarded by
a life-size ceramic Rottweiler.
Dad, Don Magnifico, is Essex Man, floral braces, gold pyjamas, east London
accent intact ('who was that bimbo who turned up?' he asks at the ball),
boastful/deferential in his philistine sneering. In Tim Hardy's parody,
comic yet menacing, the violence to Cinderella clearly stems from his own
repression.
His opposite is philosopher Alidoro, Oxbridge charmer (Kevin Colson), who
offers himself as alternative father. Freudian implications, the girl's
longing for her unattainable father, are thus embodied: Alidoro the ideal,
Don Magnifico the monster.
Interwoven is class warfare. Social disguise is the key in both Perrault and
Rossini, where Ramiro swaps roles with his valet. Here Dandini (Harry
Burton) is the chauffeur rigged up as HRH in a kilt, attended by tartanned
royals. Ramiro (soprano Gaynor Miles), the 'choufleur d'amour' pondering
his/her sexuality completes a kinky pantomime trio: the i travesti roles
bring out sexual as well as social undercurrents.
It is romance within a post-Thatcherite parable of the rise and fall of the
self-made man. Flimsy as his Cindy-doll-by-the-pool home, Don Magnifico has
no chance once pitted against the royals (his 'get yer arses down ere'
evokes another classic English social satire, Eliza at the races in My Fair
Lady). Revealed as a bankrupt, he is saved from repossession by Old Money
when Cinderella, in a stream of quicksilver lyricism from Jan Hartley
Morris, marries her prince.
With an onstage orchestra of eight jazzing up Rossini, this is a vintage
1990s show, set in a broken golden arch it blazes with deconstructionist
wit; Alidoro, a Prospero-Zarusthro figure, fashions paper hearts during the
love duets and remote controls a toy Ferrari, driven by models of Ramiro and
Dandini, across the stage to precipitate the denouement. The
libretto/dialogue, sarcastic and slangy ('you watch your lips now/just get a
grip now'; 'Am I dreaming? am I hell?/It's a setback, not an ending') is
matched by yuppie slapstick - poolside dunkings, petticoats singed on the
barbecue - and high camp hi jinks, and acted to the hilt by this talented
young company.
If Cinderella has 'British class obsession' stamped all over it, Katharina
Thalbach's Macbeth is a quintessential Berlin export: a Brechtian
interpretation which turns Shakespearean tragedy on its head and makes of
the bloody male world of Macbeth a feminist triumph.
Malcolm Rutherford saluted this production when it briefly visited London
this winter, and I add my voice to his. With its grim illustration that
power corrupts, Macbeth has of course the perfect Brechtian plot. Thalbach
despatches the soldier-monarch in just over two shrill and breathless hours
during which Marcus Vollenklee triples in size from hen-pecked weakling to a
bloated, parody of kinghood. Gone are the long speeches, the philosophising:
this is a Macbeth action-packed as a cartoon strip, bright with caricature
and expressionist display. Thus when Guntbert Warns plays Duncan as a
pastiche of Bernard Minetti, the 86-year-old Berlin actor who had his debut
with Max Reinhardt in the 1920s, Thalbach is making a theatrical joke which
later turns into a neat political point: the same actor, as Macduff,
discovers Duncan's corpse - friend and foe, survivor or victim, are equally
ridiculous in the game of war and heroics.
'Fair is foul and foul is fair', the witches scrawl on a wall. They are
recast here as a cross between The Threepenny Opera's Tart-without-a-heart
Jenny and Brecht's streetwise pacifist Mother Courage. They dance, hang
above the stage on ropes like seductive spiders, then pamper Macbeth as in a
brothel. Their dance of death is at once a showpiece and the last word: 'We
don't need a new master, we don't need one at all', they chant in an almost
exact quotation from Brecht's die Rundkopfe und die Spitzkopfe.
Thalbach is an entertainer with the technical imagination to channel her
subversive message into a coherent masterpiece of staging. At the other
extreme of Shakespearean innovation, Vienna has Romeo Castellucci's Amleto,
which with a cast of one plus a chorus of stuffed toys offers a futuristic
Hamlet set in a man-size circuit board of tangled wires and flashing lights.
I cannot report on the language of the production because, between electric
shocks and toy pistol shots, Paolo Tonti stutters like an autistic
Christopher Robin through a text where not one word is fully uttered. His
father's ghost is a teddy bear, Gertrude is a kangaroo and Ophelia a wind-up
doll.
This is not a Spitting Image joke but a two-hour performance deadly serious,
mightily pleased with its own metaphors of non-communication, and achingly
dull. Heiner Muller's Hamlet Machine did this sort of thing properly at last
year's Berlin festival; can the Festwochen organisers really not distinguish
between copycat gibberish and original vital reworkings? Two further redrawn
classics are to come to Vienna in June: Bruno Moderna's composition
Hyperion, after Holderlin, and Needcompany's Antony and Cleopatra. On this
showing, they will be either brilliant or beastly.
'Cinderella' is sponsored by Mobil; the Festival continues until June 4
