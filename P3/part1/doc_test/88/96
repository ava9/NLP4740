Imagine only knowing George Best's footballing skills through his mid-1970s
comeback; many of Nicol Williamson's audience will be in an analogous
position. The pre-publicity for his return to the West End after a decade
and a half has familiarised us with his achievements in the 1960s -
startling performances in Inadmissible Evidence and Events During the
Guarding of the Bofors Gun and the definitive Hamlet of his generation - but
since his relocation to America our only sightings of him have been on the
screen, as Mountbatten the Last Viceroy or a gloriously idiosyncratic Merlin
in John Boorman's Excalibur.
Williamson now seems intent on proving that his control and precision are
unabated. Paradoxically, he has chosen to do so in a one-man show about the
erratic, alcoholic John Barrymore, whose career spanned vaudeville,
Shakespeare and matinee idoldom before declining into pathetic self-parody.
He has been at pains to deny any alleged parallels, but as with most solo
presentations it is impossible to watch Jack without a keen consciousness of
the performer.
This was heightened on the press night by Williamson's evident nervousness;
it is difficult to ascribe many of the fluffs and uncertainties to the
portrayal of a figure whose skills have been shot by booze - not even on the
stammered line, 'My m-uh, my memory's not a problem.' For much of the first
act he seemed simply to be hitting his spots and delivering lines in the
requisite moods, but a combination of restraint and timidity prevented him
from inhabiting his character. The first hints of a native ebullience came
with the unambiguously broad parody of the voice teacher to whom Barrymore
resorted to train for the parts of Richard III and Hamlet - culminating in
the sight of a theatrical legend (Williamson or Barrymore, take your pick)
in vest and tights singing 'The Laughing Policeman'.
Screen director Leslie Megahey (making his stage directorial debut) and
Williamson have devised a show which engages and endears, despite lapsing
into purple orotundity during the self-pitying passages about Barrymore's
terminal alcoholism. They are alive to the mileage in self-referential
chuckles without falling into solipsism: knowing the story of Williamson's
last New York appearance, we are allowed a snigger when Barrymore speaks of
only occasionally giving his Laertes a flesh-wound in the duelling scene of
Hamlet (and the line 'What kind of asshole does it take to write 'My Life In
the Theatre' at 28?' cannot have been lost on one of the trustees of
Criterion Productions, a Mr. Branagh).
The actor lives up to his description of his own talents - 'I can understand
people's pain, passion, fear, hurt, and I can mirror it and set it up for
them to look at'; he can work wonders with a moment of silent reflection or
(scripted) hesitation - but always seems to be reining himself in.
Crucially, he fails to convey possibly the most essential element of
Barrymore's charisma, his sexual magnetism. For all Barrymore's talk of his
four matrimonial 'bus accidents' and romantic excesses, Williamson simple
does not smoulder sufficiently.
Both he and Jack will be feted, and rightly so; for all these reservations,
it is damned good to have back an actor individual enough to divide his
programme biography into performances on stage, on screen and 'for the
American Presidency' and who uses his curtain speech to invite the audience
to listen to him perform a jazz set in the bar after the show. However,
those of us who missed his early glories will have to take up the Nicol
Williamson story, without preconceptions, from here.
At the Criterion Theatre until July 16 (071-839-4488)
