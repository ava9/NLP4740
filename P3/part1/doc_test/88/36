regeneration of the inner cities

Sir, Your article 'Decay eats away at inner cities' (July 14), which
analysed the Policy Studies Institute report on urban trends, addresses some
of the major issues facing inner cities today.
The letter from Peter Hughes (July 21), leader of the Tower Hamlets council,
identifies that in spite of its problems Tower Hamlets still has enormous
potential and is greatly improving.
As chairman of the East London Partnership covering the three boroughs of
Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney, I totally support Peter Hughes' comments.
The East London Partnership was set up two years ago, sponsored by the
private sector, to develop a strong working partnership with the local
community. We all had a common aim: to improve the quality of life in an
inner city area by fostering economic regeneration.
Today that partnership incorporates large and small private sector
organisations, the local authorities, the voluntary sector and
representatives from the local community. Progress hasn't been easy, but it
has been constant. We have built a track record in helping to tackle issues
affecting the long-term prospects for East London; issues such as transport,
tourism, healthcare, training, employment, education and housing.
A major example of this partnership has been the achievement of all three
boroughs in winning City Challenge bids - Tower Hamlets in 1991 and now
Hackney and Newham in 1992. The unique blend of private and public sector
skills and expertise, local knowledge and the joint will to win made this
happen.
Clearly government has recognised the problems of the East End and has
responded by heavy investment in London Docklands over the past decade, but
problems still do exist.
I am convinced that the mood is changing, even since the report was written.
I believe a combination of productive local partnerships together with
government funding can continue to spearhead the regeneration of inner
cities.
True partnership is not merely about working together on the ground but also
about vision and the management of long-term strategic change.
