Fresh objectives for the Liberal Democrats in the elections run-up

The Liberal Democrats came to Cardiff seeking reassurance. The 1,300
delegates left convinced that the party's much-forecast breakthrough is once
again just round the corner. This time they could be right.
The Liberal Democrats trail Labour by about 25 percentage points in most
national opinion polls. But the party could be the biggest gainer from the
triple round of local, European and parliamentary elections due by early
June.
The biggest boost could come in the Eastleigh by-election, expected on May
5, in which Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, is widely
expected to win the seat from the Conservatives.
The omens are good. The Liberal Democrats hold 19 of the 25 seats on
Eastleigh district council and last week won the last Conservative seat on
Hedge End town council, in the heart of the constituency. A victory would
return the party's national profile to heights not reached since last
summer's by-election successes in Newbury and Christchurch.
But the party is also well-placed for the local elections due on May 5 and
the European Parliament poll on June 9. In both contests the tide is running
in the Liberal Democrats' favour.
Party leaders say they have realistic hopes of two or three victories in the
European Parliament election. But an independent forecast by the Electoral
Reform Society says the Liberal Democrats could win up to a dozen seats.
Most of the local polls are in urban areas where Labour is defending seats
and the Liberal Democrats are more credible challengers than the unpopular
Conservatives.
The party, which has 4,250 council seats across the country, compared with
800 held by the former Liberal party 15 years ago, won a net 78 seats in
by-elections last year, mostly from the Conservatives. Labour failed to
record a single net gain.
Good results in all three rounds of polling would go a long way to
consolidate the party's gradual breakout from its traditional heartlands in
Scotland, Wales and south-west England.
But while the party's prospects are clearly improving, the Cardiff
conference showed that growing maturity is bringing fresh problems in its
wake.
The first is technical: how to switch from fighting the Conservatives in
largely rural seats to fighting Labour in the cities. The answer, drafted
largely by party leaders with big city credentials, such as Mr Simon Hughes,
MP for Bermondsey, is to sharpen the party's image on issues which are
important to urban voters.
The main vehicle for the urban campaign is the policy document Reclaiming
the City, approved by delegates on Saturday. It commits the party to
decentralisation, radical reform of planning law and tough action against
racism.
Mr Hughes, who admits that political progress is harder for the Liberal
Democrats in the towns than in the countryside, warned delegates that they
could not hope to take power at Westminster until they demonstrated their
ability to run the cities.
But divisions are emerging between the party's urban activists and some of
its leaders. They accuse the leadership of trying to stifle debate on
controversial inner-city issues such as prostitution and a row over alleged
racist campaigning by Liberal Democrat activists in the London borough of
Tower Hamlets, the only large inner-city local authority controlled by the
party.
Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors,
accused the leadership of 'hypocrisy' over its decision to expel three local
members. Ms Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of the Tower Hamlets party, announced
her decision to stand down in protest at the leadership's lack of
understanding of the problems faced by inner-city campaigners.
The second problem is more fundamental: what does the party stand for? The
dilemma was highlighted in a thoughtful speech to a fringe meeting by Mr
Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro, who pointed out that 'we have a higher profile
on Bosnia than on any bread-and-butter domestic policy issue that . . .
determines how people vote.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, sought to refocus the party
on domestic issues as he launched a 100-day campaign for the forthcoming
local council, Commons and European elections.
In his keynote speech to the conference Mr Ashdown highlighted education,
employment, taxation and the economy as core issues.
Among a list of 40 policy commitments were free nursery education for
children aged three and four, and a minimum of two days a week of training
for those aged 16 to 19.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats would turn welfare payments into
working benefits by giving subsidies to employers to take on the long-term
unemployed.
The difficulty of communicating core values worries other leaders. Mr
Charles Kennedy, party president, said that the claim that Liberal Democrats
were trying to be all things to all people 'hurts and does damage'. It is a
charge to which the party does not have a convincing answer.
