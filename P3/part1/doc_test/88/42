FT  20 SEP 93 / Leading Article: A shiver in east London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTREME right's victory in a local authority by-election last week has
sent a shiver through British political life. Concern has already been
rising over the level of racial attacks reported to the police in many UK
cities. Politicians, churchmen and community leaders have been quick to
deplore the success of a party that is openly racist in its programme.
It is much too soon, however, to see the election of a British National
party councillor in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets as evidence of
a far-right breakthrough. The BNP victory, on less than 34 per cent of the
vote, was achieved only because of a close three-way split in the voting. It
was the first electoral success for the party in the 12 years of its
existence. Its predecessor, the National Front, won only two council seats,
despite a backlash in some parts of the country over the arrival of east
African Asians.
The docklands to the east of London have offered fertile ground for the
BNP's brand of politics. Many white, working-class people in the area have
been economically marginalised by the docks' decline. The skyline is
dominated by prestige office developments such as Canary Wharf that provide
few jobs for the unskilled. Fortified apartments in luxury developments back
on to run-down rented housing built by the local council for low-income
families. The housing of homeless Bangladeshis in new homes by the council
has provided a convenient scapegoat, which the BNP has been quick to target.
Indeed, it might be thought surprising that in a recession the BNP has not
been able to win more support in this and similar communities throughout the
UK. Elsewhere in western Europe, extreme right parties have won as much as
15 per cent of the popular vote, control local authorities and are
represented in parliament.
Fringe parties
That the extreme right has been less successful in the UK is partly due to
the first-past-the-post electoral system. This makes it hard for fringe
parties to break through. But mostly it can be attributed to the ease with
which an island state is able to limit immigration. Britain has been able to
reduce the flow of immigrants to a level that makes it easier to absorb
newcomers without social conflict. It has also found it all too easy to shut
out the tide of refugees flooding into the rest of Europe from the east.
Only when ethnic minorities have become concentrated in particular locations
has the social fabric been seriously strained.
More integration
The counterpoint of stiff immigration controls, however, has been a concern
to integrate ethnic minorities into British life and offer equality of
opportunity. There is also a well-established legal framework to deter
racial discrimination and outlaw incitement to racial hatred. This approach
can claim some success, certainly in comparison with some other multi-ethnic
societies.
Yet reports of increasing racial attacks in Tower Hamlets and other urban
areas indicate a seamier side to this picture of an open and tolerant
multi-racial society. Many people from ethnic minorities live in fear of
abuse and violence, not always confident that the police are willing or able
to defend them. Their rights must be defended and their property protected
if they are not to be forced into defensive ghettos. The law may need to be
strengthened if it proves ineffective in dealing with racial violence
inspired by extreme right political activities.
Choking off the grievances that feed the growth of far-right politics may be
rather harder, however. A society where all can aspire to economic
opportunity is less likely to seek scapegoats among identifiable minorities.
Central and local government clearly has an important, if limited, role to
play in creating such a society. Much can also be done by the sort of
partnerships between the public sector and business that have already
contributed to regeneration in east London, albeit erratically on some
occasions.
But restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if extreme right
politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in elections. Cancers in
the body politic - even in the smallest community - disfigure and threaten
the whole.
