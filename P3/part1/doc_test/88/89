THE FILM: "Hamlet," directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by . . . well, 
you know. 
</P>
<P>
THE CLIFF NOTES REMINDER: Hamlet (Mel Gibson), the great and melancholy Dane, 
gets the word from the ghost of his father the king (Paul Scofield) that Uncle 
Claudius (Alan Bates) murdered Dad and married Mom (Glenn Close). Paralyzed by 
inaction -- this is not "Lethal Poignard II" -- his grip on love and self go 
down the drain, and just about everybody dies. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Nothing so trendy as to make you snatch up your credit card and head 
for Melrose yelling, "I've got to have that.' Understandably. Someone or 
other's been putting clothes on these people for almost 400 years. The costumes 
are unobtrusive -- this isn't MTV style over substance -- yet are not lost in 
the spaces they had to occupy. Italian designer Mauricio Millenotti has 
costumed films, including the Zeffirelli/Shakespeare "Otello," opera, 
television and ballets and has a command of the grand scale. Remember, "Hamlet" 
as a story was 12th-Century ancient history when Shakespeare did it in the 
17th, and he had some costuming anachronisms of his own, like a reference to 
"chopines," platform shoes unknown in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The Clorox factor is more than apparent. The principals' clothes tend to suffer 
by their incredible Hollywood tidiness, less suggestive of the 12th or even 
17th Century than a modern-day Maytag side-by-side. There is the antiseptic 
sheen of a '40s MGM spectacular where even the horses' teeth looked like they 
had been capped. Compare it to Kenneth Branagh's wonderfully grimy film version 
of "Henry V," released here last fall. The tons of coal dust spread over 
Hamlet's castle for authentic weathering never touched its big-name residents. 
At least Ophelia (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Hamlet get more disordered-looking 
as their minds do. (Look for Hamlet in the library, in a scruffy sweater and 
throwing his boot.) 
</P>
<P>
THE SUPERB: With the exception of one Gertrude (Close) headdress that looks 
like a brain-stem injury surgical restraint, the jewelry and adornments are 
marvelous, particularly the Celtic-looking wrought cloak clasps. The crowns, 
rough and heavy jeweled bands, are absolutely on-11th-Century target, evoking 
the oldest surviving crown in Europe, of the Empress Kunigunde of Luxembourg. 
Gertrude's shoulder-duster earrings are pure Visigoth. Now you might see these 
turn up on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
THE SILLY: Gertrude's blond Viking braids, which look like they were extruded 
from a butterscotch Dairy Queen machine. And one unfortunate aqua surcoat that 
looks exactly like my mother's chenille bedspread. 
</P>
<P>
THE CREDIBLE: The authentic reliance on knits, embroidery and worked adornment 
for ornamentation. Ophelia in simple, virginal cream-colored smocks is in 
deliberate, unsubtle contrast to the bright colors of Gertrude's ardent 
newlywed sexuality, turquoise and wine reds. And, of course, Hamlet's raiment 
is a fixed point of almost unrelieved black, a color in great vogue among 
Elizabethans. Gibson has a modern face, and there are moments when, in 
leggings, boots, a leather jerkin whose big, loose stitches cry out "olde," he 
could sit down front at a Madonna concert without turning too many heads. 
</P>
<P>
THE SOURCES: Less likely to catch on as street-style than, say, "Dick Tracy," 
even if there were such a boutique as "Thor's Threads" to handle this line. But 
it's like Mrs. Roten told us in 10th grade English -- you're supposed to listen 
to this. PATT MORRISON
