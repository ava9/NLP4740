THE far-right British National party last night won its first-ever local
authority seat after a campaign fought on a rights-for-whites platform.
Mr Derek Beackon, 47, the party's candidate, was elected by a majority of
seven over Labour after a re-count in the east London borough of Tower
Hamlets.
Police in riot gear and on horseback fought to control clashes between BNP
supporters and anti-racist campaigners as the result was announced.
The result was: BNP: 1,480; Labour: 1,473; Liberal Democrat: 1,284;
Conservative: 134.
After his election Mr Beackon described the result as a great victory for
the British people. 'The British people are no longer prepared to be treated
as second-rate citizens in their own country,' he said.
Mr Peter Hughes, Liberal Democrat leader of Tower Hamlets Council, said the
result brought shame to the area and was a 'blot on the history of Tower
Hamlets'. When Hitler bombed the area so heavily in the second world war he
could never have hoped that he would eventually be so successful, he said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'This is very, very bad
news for all those who are committed to democratic politics.'
He urged mainstream politicians to make clear their commitment to tolerance
and their opposition to 'racist-based parties'.
There has recently been a series of outbreaks of racially inspired violence
on the streets of Tower Hamlets and there are fears that increased BNP
activity as a result of the election victory will aggravate the problem.
Mr Hughes said the council would continue to treat all citizens equally and
was determined that there should not be disorder on the streets.
The by-election took place on the Isle of Dogs. Although parts of the area
have become occupied by affluent residents in riverside apartments, the
large majority of the population still live in council flats. Frustration
over housing policies, according to all the main political parties, played a
part in the election.
The turnout yesterday was 44 per cent compared with only 31 per cent in
another by-election contested by the BNP in the same area last year. Leaders
of the three main parties believed that the higher turnout indicated that
the electorate was registering a protest against the BNP, but the result
proved them wrong. The far-right party more than doubled its 657 votes in
last year's by-election.
Police continued to patrol the streets of east London in force early this
morning after the declaration of the result.
The BNP victory will add to pressure on the government to strengthen
Britain's race relations laws.
