Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet (1874), one of the finest products of the
19th-century operatic second rank, has a star role for a lyric baritone of
romantic presence, vocal magnetism and complete command of the French
singing style. In our day it has served as a notable vehicle for Sherrill
Milnes (who also recorded it) and Thomas Allen; the latest important
protagonist is Thomas Hampson, the tall, handsome, greatly gifted American
baritone mainly known up to now for his Mozart and Rossini roles (it is as
the latter's Figaro that next month he makes a belated Covent Garden debut).
His first approach to this operatic Shakespeare adaptation was wisely
planned. It took place, last week, not in one of the big international opera
houses where Mr Hampson has become a regular performer, but at Monte-Carlo.
Here - away from the limelight, in Garnier's small jewel-box of a theatre -
voices never have any need to press for audibility, contact between singers
and audience is close, and the productions are cast and mounted with care
and finesse.
This was, indeed, not a One Man Show but an intelligently devised staging -
by John Cox in the bold-coloured, strikingly modern-accented sets and
costumes of Paul Brown (designer of the much-admired Royal Opera Mitridate)
 -which increased even further my admiration for the whole work. In the
later part of his career Thomas's name became a byword for passe
traditionalism in French opera; Shaw's sallies against Hamlet - 'I really
never saw such a foolish opera' - were sharp-pointed.
At this date there is surely no longer any need to mind operatic Shakespeare
in this pared-down form, with its far-from-conventional Happy End. The
beauty of so much of the opera resides in the fastidiousness and precise
purpose with which Thomas treated Grand Opera conventions. Numbers familiar
out of context (Hamlet's monologues and Drinking Song, Ophelia's florid Mad
Scene) gain miraculously from their surroundings. The distinct tone and
colour of the orchestral writing show how much Thomas learned from Berlioz;
and while there are big public scenes in the Meyerbeer manner, it is the
combination of intimacy and seriousness that keeps them - and, indeed, the
opera - so fresh and so surprising.
Mr Hampson provided a noble centre point. His high baritone, near-tenorial
in clarity and lightness of timbre, is an instrument of the utmost
artistocratic elegance; so are his stage demeanour and his excellently
schooled delivery of French. He has a Lieder-singer's gift of close focus,
which lent a particular eloquence to Thomas's 'To be or not to be' and 'Get
thou to a monastery' (with its wonderful blossoming as a trio). In the
earlier acts he seemed self-absorbed, lacking a degree of emotional
intensity and, with it, a quickness of reaction to the others on stage.
But as the operatic momentum built up, so did the evidence of his
engagement. If Mr Hampson should choose to make Hamlet a mainstay of his
repertory, I predict for him an ever-growing success. I also predict a big
future for the Ophelia, the very young Bulgarian Alexandrina Pendachanska (a
recent WNO Gilda), whose highly individual soprano leggiero - needle-bright
yet full of 'bottom' - is complemented by a heart-breaking innocence of
stage personality.
Stefania Toczyska (Gertrude) and Philippe Duminy (Claudius) both made much
of their well-written roles. Lawrence Foster was the sound, secure, but
sometimes rather unimaginative Monte-Carlo conductor, a little too free with
the cutting shears.
