FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Tower Hamlets has problems, but potential too
</HEADLINE>

Sir, Your recent article relating to the report on urban trends and
inner-city decline made very interesting reading ('Decay eats away at inner
cities', July 14).
It is the case that Tower Hamlets ranks third from the top (or is it
bottom?) of the most deprived areas in Britain. However, to give the
impression that Tower Hamlets is an inner-city wasteland with no hope for
the future could not be further from the truth.
My borough is an area of immense potential, a mix of old and new. City
fringe developments in Bethnal Green and proposals involving the local
community in the City Challenge area of Spitalfields offer real
opportunities to tackle inner-city decay in an area most in need.
Docklands developments have many critics, but nobody can deny that a great
deal has happened in the area. Tower Hamlets Council has strongly voiced its
views on the over-development and design of many of the schemes. The council
takes the view that the mistakes of their past would be compounded now if
Docklands failed. Many, like the civil servants, view Tower Hamlets and the
East End as a backwater, devoid of community, law and modern technology. We
believe these views stem from ignorance and misinformation. My fear is your
readers, after reading your article, may also take this view.
I am not trying to pretend Tower Hamlets does not have more than its fair
share of problems. However, this is an area of enormous potential. It is
better than it was, still greatly improving and will be the place to be in
the future.
