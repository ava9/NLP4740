Sir, Your balanced leader on the Tower Hamlets British National party vote
is welcome ('A shiver in east London', September 20). It is vital that the
concern generated by this event does not shield the positive changes shaping
and improving Docklands and east London.
When the docks finally closed in 1980, the local community here faced no
investment opportunities and high unemployment but their strong sense of
identity remained. If that position had continued, the community would have
had just cause for feeling there was little hope as there were poor
communications, little suitable job training, and only modest educational
opportunities.
Now, with very substantial commercial investment, and much better job
opportunities, especially as the recession ends, there is indeed good reason
to be optimistic. Better communications and the new airport, better public
transport, housing improvement and more opportunities for home ownership,
are all helping to secure the long-term future for residents. There were
27,000 jobs in Docklands in 1981 and the number was falling. We have secured
55,000 now, and the number is rising. There were about 1,000 businesses and
there are nearly 2,500 now. Canary Wharf, for example, has made particular
efforts to target job opportunities on local residents with almost 800 local
people so far finding work at Canary Wharf during the course of the project.
Unfortunately, there are no data linking jobs to residents for the total
55,000 jobs.
Change inevitably brings some tension as we have to adjust to new
technologies, different job opportunities and new life styles, and
sensitively deal with the housing and educational priorities demanded by
demographic and ethnic change. All of us who are committed to improving this
area, including ourselves, Tower Hamlets Council, and many other
organisations, work closely together to try to deal positively with change
and growth. We are confident that we shall succeed both in making this area
an economic success and in promoting a harmonious community, but this
requires continuous effort, particularly to improve educational achievement.
