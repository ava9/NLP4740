fears and frustrations simmering on the Isle of Dogs

EVERY TWO seconds, day and night, the flashing of a beacon high on Canary
Wharf tower in London's Docklands can be seen up-river at Westminster.
The election late on Thursday night of a British National party councillor
on the Isle of Dogs in Docklands turned it into a warning light for the
mainstream political parties.
The initial reaction to the victory has been a focus on the unusual politics
of the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the Liberal Democrats control
the council, but Labour runs the Isle of Dogs. Relations between the two
parties are often sour, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,
yesterday set up an inquiry after Labour said that Liberal Democrat election
material had been racist.
But the fears and frustrations of a community that has faced unprecedented
change in recent years have also played an important role.
East London has long been home for groups of immigrants arriving in Britain,
but the ethnic minorities are not evenly spread. The Isle of Dogs remains a
predominantly white area of Tower Hamlets - 80 per cent of the population of
the Millwall ward, where the by-election took place, are white with
traditional working-class roots. Until the 1970s, the London docks continued
to provide well-paid mass employment; many families both lived and worked in
the area, with dock jobs passing from father to son.
In recent years, an increasing number of ethnic-minority families have
arrived on the council estates. Concerns over housing undoubtedly played a
big part in the by-election; some white residents complain that Asian
families receive preferential treatment in the allocation of accommodation.
Local authorities must give priority to homeless people, and Asian families
have moved in on this basis. The irony is that many Asians would much rather
not live there. They complain of feeling abandoned - away from the ethnic
shops, community associations and places of worship in other parts of the
borough. Since the BNP began concentrating its efforts on the area, they
feel intimidated as well.
But the isle's population has felt embittered for much longer than this.
When the docks closed, the Thatcher government responded by establishing the
London Docklands Development Corporation, with a mandate to turn the island
and surrounding area into the largest development site in Europe. Local
people were hostile, believing that there would be high-quality jobs for
skilled outsiders and a minimal number of low-grade ones for locals. Canary
Wharf came to symbolise feelings of anger and insecurity over the way
Docklands was being redeveloped, and the stalling of the entire project has
left a deep mood of cynicism.
Mr Ted Johns, a veteran Labour councillor and community leader, has lived on
the Isle of Dogs all his life. He thinks that local feelings about the LDDC
are crucial to understanding how the island's politics have developed.
'We are fond of the image of the East End as a racial melting pot,' he says,
'but minority groups have always had to struggle for acceptance against
racists. But I think there is a wider explanation for the result than that.'
Mr Johns' wider explanation draws together many strands of the old London
docks' recent history. When the government produced its vision for the new
Docklands, it took responsibility away from local authorities and gave it -
and funding - to the unelected development corporation.
People suffering from loss of jobs and the collapse of their community felt
deeply that they had no proper input to decision-making.
Mr Johns says: 'To a large extent being a councillor is like being a cypher
these days. All the important decisions are taken elsewhere.
'I think the election of the BNP is the worst day in the history of the Isle
of Dogs. But the ability of councillors to respond to people's problems is
now so constrained, it is not surprising if some voters start listening to
the promises of extremists.'
