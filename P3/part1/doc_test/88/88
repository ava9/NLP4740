AS the Edinburgh festival reaches the middle of the final week, its portrait
of Tchaikovsky is nearly complete. The composer has proved to be a rewarding
subject, mainly because his life's work spans such a variety of media -
opera and ballet, concertos and symphonies, vocal and choral, all had a
representative showing in this year's programme.
Less attention has been paid to setting his music in context, although the
Royal Scottish Orchestra's pair of concerts over the bank holiday weekend
each gave a nod in that direction. The first offered a triple novelty: three
Hamlet scores, one each by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich, the last
a melange of his film score and theatre music, arranged by the evening's
conductor, Gennady Rozhdestvensky.
This was a clever piece of programme-planning. It told us little about
Shakespeare's Hamlet, but a lot about the personalities of the three
composers. While Prokofiev and Shostakovich viewed the play from the
outside, commenting on the issues with irony and detachment, Tchaikovsky's
nature led him instead to try to enter the protagonist's soul. His music is
overtly emotional and in Hamlet's tortured, introspective character it is
easy to see the composer feeling some personal identification.
Given the interest of the programme, it did not matter greatly that the
orchestra's playing was less than brilliant. But when Neeme Jarvi arrived a
couple of days later to conduct it in some of the best-known Tchaikovsky
scores, the untidiness of the playing did make the music's technicolour
virtuosity pale rather.
This time it was chronology that provided an added dimension, as the concert
included both Tchaikovsky's first and last surviving orchestral works - The
Storm Overture and the Sixth Symphony. In between Peter Donohoe, the
festival's resident Tchaikovsky pianist, played the First Piano Concerto
with power and delicacy, if not enough insight always to make the music
spark into life under Jarvi's dampening direction. In the last five minutes,
though, Donohoe really did set the fireworks blazing.
* * * All of this was the public Tchaikovsky. The private man remains more
of an enigma and the festival's most important single gesture was to
familiarise us with one of the composer's rarely-heard private utterances,
the unaccompanied Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. Under the rigid conventions
imposed on composers of music for the Russian Orthodox Church, Tchaikovsky
was required to adopt a style far removed from that of his worldly self. The
result is music of heartfelt simplicity and no small expertise.
There could hardly have been a more inspired idea than to site this
performance at night in St Giles's Cathedral on the Royal Mile. Under Arthur
Oldham's direction, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus made the rafters ring with
singing of glorious concentration and power, the basses emulating the
imposing growl of a native Russian choir. Choral music in the silence of the
night here demands to become an annual festival event.
