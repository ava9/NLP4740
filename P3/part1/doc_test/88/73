On a glass pedestal a silver trunk of the sort used by music-hall magicians
revolves slowly to the sound of crashing surf. A magician indeed appears,
top-hatted and caped, with his assistant, a red-plumed showgirl. A bluesy
trumpet plays.
Out of the trunk a young man is winched in harness to dangle over the stage.
Another figure emerges, a child in topcoat and stove-pipe hat, the Artful
Dodger impression countered by his air of innocence and the white flower in
his buttonhole. This is Horatio.
The ghost is a ventriloquist's doll carried round the stage by the magician.
Hamlet (yes) is winched down. Lights, a blast of circus music, and in troops
the court of Elsinore. What does that jaunty minor-key strut evoke? Why is
that faintly sleazy glitter, that sinister invitation to fun, familiar? Of
course: Federico Fellini. If the late Italian movie director had filmed
Hamlet it would have come out as something like Julia Bardsley's adaptation
at the Young Vic.
Bardsley's short regime has had a rough ride. I suspect this Shakespearian
extravaganza will suffer from the downward roll. A shame, since the
production is brave, bizarre, imaginative, hallucinatory, sometimes
irritating, often poetic. As one who has appraised more great Danes than a
judge at Crufts, I was kept alert and intrigued throughout.
They give us variations on the theme, perhaps, rather than the play itself.
But what production has ever given us every aspect of Hamlet? The text has
been cut and shuffled (the most annoying detail being Hamlet's substitution
of 'prayers' for 'orisons' as if that would puzzle us more than the rest of
these goings-on), and characters are omitted, with much fascinating
double-casting.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are played by one man carrying a life-size
dummy, initially both sporting identical orange bowlers and Groucho Marx
spectacles. Natasha Pope plays Ophelia and Gertrude. She lacks the vocal
weight for the faintly floozy queen (red bouffant, vivid lipstick); but the
image of Ophelia's mad scene evokes a blend of punk and pre-war Berlin
cabaret, as she belts 'How should I your true love know?' into a mike. She
cuts a vaguely expressionistic figure, a frowsy version of Wedekind's Lulu
perhaps, in her clinging fur-hemmed frock and clown's blue and white banded
knee-socks.
Claudius' bottle-green suit, glasses and crown sustain the circus motif.
Boyd Clack's disconcerting facial mixture of David Mellor and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer adds conviction to this homme moyen sensuel's dabbling in
political waters too deep for him. And of course one actor plays Polonius
and Laertes, father (pink coat and fez) and son (purple coat).
The production's emphasis on the individual's duality, internal and external
character (which offers after all an explanation of Hamlet's anguished
dithering), prompts two set pieces: the play scene when lust and murder are
enacted by dolls, then taken over by their human counterparts as a rock
score pounds and a red-nosed Hamlet leaps around, ape-like, urging them on
and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, now pig-faced, fondle each other.
More moving is the prince's address to the players, here a pile of dolls,
and the actor he begs a speech from: the doll is a beautifully-made
miniature of Hamlet himself who obliges (with his master's voice) not with
Hecuba but 'To be or not to be'. This leads straight on to Hamlet in propria
persona bursting out with 'Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave'. Here the
levels of artifice blur: what or who is he reacting to? Come to that, who is
the master puppeteer-ringmaster magician-ventriloquist behind each
character? The old enigma of Hamlet's determinism is still unsolved.
Rory Edwards prowls, haggard, through the title role, a neurotic wreck from
the start (pullover with ape-length arms, bare feet), within an inch of
genuine madness. Unless, as in The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, the whole
court is an asylum. The final duel is almost perfunctory, slow motion
lunging over the central pedestal, the lines sounding flatter as if a
clockwork mechanism were running down.
The manipulative magician (shades of Lulu's Ringmaster) and his assistant
(in fact Bardsley and her designer Aldona Cunningham) pay the play the
compliment of refusing to treat it as a museum piece but something alive and
resilient to bounce ideas off. Nothing is taken for granted; surprises
continue to the very end when, in response to 'The rest is silence' as
Hamlet wanders off, the child Horatio delivers the last lines in deaf and
dumb language. Cheek.
