Tower Hamlets activities

THE ACTIVITIES of Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets, east London, once
again forced Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, on to the defensive
yesterday, as attention was focused on the national party's failure to act
effectively after warning local activists three years ago to clean up their
campaigning.
Mr Ashdown said that the inquiry he had set up into the local party's
tactics would look at the breakdown in the procedures set up after a court
action brought by Labour in 1990 to monitor the campaigning material which
the local party used.
One of the leaflets which he said had given him most concern for its racist
undertones had not even been cleared by the Liberal Democrat leader of the
council, let alone anyone from the party nationally.
But he sought to regain the offensive by demanding that Labour examine how
its activities had contributed to the victory for the far-right British
National party in last week's council by-election. 'Both of us made
mistakes,' he said, but where the Liberal Democrats had responded clearly
and decisively, Labour's problems appeared to have been overlooked.
Mr Ashdown's emphasis on the need for Labour to look at its own role in the
BNP's win contrasted with the comments of Baroness Williams, a senior party
member, who stressed the need for the party not to be deflected from
examining its own actions.
'I hope the committee of inquiry into Tower Hamlets will not be diverted by
trying to blame other parties, however bad their record may be, but ask what
we Liberal Democrats have done in difficult circumstances to try to provide
equal justice and fairness to all of our citizens,' she said.
As senior figures sought to draw a line under the embarrassment, Mr Charles
Kennedy, party president, gave a clear statement that racism would not be
tolerated in the party. He emphasised that Liberal Democrat members signed
up to the party's ideals and beliefs.
He was cheered as he told the English Liberal Democrat conference: '(We) . .
are at one in recognising racism for what it is, wherever it is found: a
disgusting moral stench in the nostrils of society.'
