FOR THOSE in government who thought Shakespeare had crept out of topicality,
The Tragedy of King Richard II (1597) offers this apposite observation: 'The
wavering commons; their love lies in their purses, and whoso empties them by
so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.' More broadly, the play asks
what a political community should do with a leader who presides over divided
followers and exiles dissent in this fine Richard II at the Royal Exchange
Manchester.
The director James Macdonald has focused on clear verse and sumptuous
costumes rather than the grand display, recognising that this theatre in the
round is no place for elaborate tableaux.
The result is a stern interpretation of Shakespeare's sprawling, brawling
pageant. Shakespeare's hindsight looks like the exact science it was when
the Elizabethan picture is imposed on the medieval world. Macdonald's
production keeps the tang of both, not only in the costumes (Kandis Cook)
but in the weight given to the prophecies and predictions the characters
make. The open sets rely on stark lighting and plain furniture, allowing the
action to speak.
The inward naggings of Richard's last scenes have to be earned by the
outward political manoeuvrings in the early part of the play. The production
achieves both: Richard's loss of control in the Mowbray-Bolingbroke debate,
his inequitable sentencing of both, and his fits of kingliness in public
contrast with the steadiness of John of Gaunt and the Duke of York, the
country's two wise men.
Linus Roache as Richard is all measured pauses and level quietness, although
he finds a 'kind of ease' at Pomfret Castle with the edgy lines 'I wasted
time and now doth time waste me.' Roache makes Richard a slight figure
opposite the tousled Bolingbroke (Neil Dudgeon), a model of purpose and
intent.
An intelligent production, as this is, often reworks overlooked or
traditionally seen characters. Ewan Hooper's strong Duke of York and James
Maxwell's febrile John of Gaunt are the voices of conscience. Their firmness
makes Richard and England into archetypes of political confusion, the
country sold off, 'leased out like to a tenement or pelting farm.' Plus ca
change.
The English Touring Theatre Hamlet, now at Oxford on its national tour, is a
surprising, breathless and unpredictable production built on simple and
clean lines. It avoids the theatrical cliches of Hamlet with skull, Hamlet
holding mirror up to nature not by passing them up, but by passing through
them rapidly en route to the conclusion.
The director Stephen Unwin has a lightly-cut text, a white set, a raked
floor and minimal clutter, so minimal that Polonius has to carry his own
curtains - a form of 'arrasment. The production's energies are focussed in
Hamlet (Alan Cumming), Claudius (Pip Donaghy), and Polonius (Trevor Baxter)
who carry the action forward with danger and suspense but keep each scene
plausible.
Cumming makes Hamlet angry with himself and disappointed in the world. He
stalks the stage, his mind fizzing like phosphorus on water, sparking and
smoking. His language is new-minted and his insights fresh. He makes 'To be
or not to be' come across as a man thinking things through rather than an
actor embarrassed to have reached that point in the play.
Baxter and Donaghy play quickfire politicians. They make Eleanor Bron's
Gertrude look flat-footed and unconvincing. She is a fine revue artist and
actor of Chekhov, most at home with intimacy. But Gertrude's character is
established in public, with other actors. She has yet to find the range. She
lacks the necessary rapport both with Claudius and with the audience;
without this rapport, Hamlet's appeals to her sound hollow.
The lighting by Ben Ormerod (who lit Three Hotels at the Tricycle Theatre so
well) lacks contrast, the kinds of shadowy effects in Olivier's murky film
version. The production should be pithier and even pacier by the time it
reaches London in November.
Richard II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester (061-833 9833) until October 9
Hamlet at the Oxford Playhouse (0865 798600) until September 25. Then
touring to Worthing, Whitley Bay, Buxton, Winchester, Dartford, and London
(Donmar Warehouse)
