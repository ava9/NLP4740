FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ethics code needed for politicians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With reference to your story 'Interest in ethics codes increases' (September
25), similar codes are likely to be introduced for National Health Service
board members in the next few months. A recent Gallup poll showed that
voters believe their political leaders to be dishonest, too predictable in
what they say, and lacking in all humility. The German election results show
far right parties recording the strongest election showing in years. The
Poles have voted for a return of communism. The British electorate is losing
faith in politicians. Voters are alienated from existing parties and are
relieving their frustrations by backing extremist organisations such as the
BNP. The Nazis came to power in Germany by a democratic vote of a similar
proportion to that of the BNP in Tower Hamlets.
The situation is serious, and urgent measures are required. I would propose
that an all-party commission should examine the adoption of a comprehensive
code of ethics for anyone who seeks election to office. The present
squabbling between Labour and the Liberal Democrats over the Tower Hamlets
election result might have been avoided, had there been such a code. It
would prevent a situation where the prime minister, drumming up business
abroad, is distracted by sniping at home.
