Photo, A Bard Who Turns Yon Young Yawns Into Yuks The lights dimmed. The kids 
hooted, hollered and whistled. And then 350 students from peninsula high 
schools settled down to a special performance of Shakespearean tragedies that 
draws as much from Saturday morning cartoons as from the Bard. In only an hour, 
the Reduced Shakespeare Company performed three versions of "Hamlet" -- one of 
them backward -- and a fast version of "Romeo and Juliet." Actors in period 
costumes and high-top sneakers, such as (from left, above) Daniel Singer, Jess 
Borgeson and Adam Long, sped through select scenes from the plays, spicing them 
with unexpected humorous twists. Juliet, played by a man, performed the balcony 
scene from atop the shoulders of another performer, and Romeo (right, Singer 
again) kissed a member of the audience instead of his beloved's very puckered 
lips. In "Hamlet," the play-within-a-play was performed by hand puppets. The 
Hollywood-based company has been performing fast, fanciful versions of the two 
tragedies since 1981 and also a two-hour performance called "The Complete Works 
of William Shakespeare (Abridged)." Last week's performance at the Norris 
Theatre drew a standing ovation from the teen-agers, who pronounced the 
tragedies "fun." ALAN HAGMAN / Los Angeles Times
