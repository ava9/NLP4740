FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taboos that need to be broken in
Docklands

<TEXT>
Sir, You say that 'restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if
extreme right-wing politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in
elections'. You note that 'many white, working-class people in the area have
been economically marginalised by the docks' decline'. But you fail to take
note of what is being done to restore hope and create work - modern work -
if not for died-in-the-wool-Jack-Dash-dockers, then their children, and
those of incomers ('A shiver in east London', September 20).
For example, last December a Pounds 1.2m training centre opened in Tower
Hamlets, aimed especially at women and people from ethnic minorities and
offering training in office skills, computing and new technology. One month
later, two new Access Centres were opened in Wapping and on the Isle of
Dogs. Run by Skillnet, the Access Centres are designed to act as the first
link in the chain between unemployment and a job for all young Tower Hamlets
people.
In neighbouring Newham, the Docklands Computer Aided Learning project is
giving more than 10,000 Newham children of all origins the benefit of the
highest concentration of computers anywhere in Europe.
If good is to come out of evil, it will be necessary for both working-class
and middle-class English taboos to be broken. For the former, this means
acknowledging the correlation between the introduction of the Dock Labour
Scheme in 1967 and the start of the closure of London's docks in 1968. It
also means acknowledging that father-to-son working-class employment is no
longer valid in the 1990s.
As for the middle class, perhaps it needs to rid itself once and for all of
post-colonial guilt - surely the driving force behind the housing policy of
Tower Hamlets Council. Osman Streater,
