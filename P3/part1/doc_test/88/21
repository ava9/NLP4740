A year that started with Tony Kushner's epic Angels in America at the
National and ended with Adrian Noble's production of Hamlet at the Barbican
can hardly have been a bad one for theatre in Britain. Angels had an
intellectual spread in the writing and an artistic depth in the performance
rarely to be found in tandem. The same can be said of Hamlet, though Noble
had a better text to start with.
There were at least 10 other productions that will remain indelibly in the
memory. I list them in the order in which they appeared.
Gregory Hersov's production of Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange,
Manchester, where there was a strikingly wild Romeo played by Michael Sheen,
probably the first to enter drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels.
Uncle Vanya at the National's Cottesloe Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias
with Sir Ian McKellen as Vanya and the entire cast playing to a perfection
you will seldom see again. The pity was that there were so few performances.
Dejavu by John Osborne at the Comedy Theatre where the Jimmy Porter of Look
Back in Anger reappeared in middle age and was as articulate as ever.
Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare at the Royal Court, which showed the
American talent for fast, witty and socially nuanced dialogue and had a
wonderful performance by Stockard Channing, a woman who acts as well as she
looks.
The Winter's Tale directed by Adrian Noble at the Royal Shakespeare
Company's home in Stratford. There, one now realises, was the foretaste of
the mastery of an entire text that was to come in this month's production of
Hamlet.
The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House, both by Harley Granville
Barker, at the Edinburgh Festival. Here was a reminder of how strong the
European theatre was in the early years of this century: educated plays for
an educated audience. The Madras House had a new twist: the daughters
doubled with the mannequins.
Le Baruffe Chiozzotte by Carlo Goldoni, which made a brief appearance at the
National in a production by Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro of Milan. The
dialect may have been hard to follow even for Italians, but it was a lesson
in staging from which even the National can learn.
Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, which also passed
through the National in a production by Franco Zeffirelli. I singled out the
playing of Benedetta Buccellato as the step-daughter, but it was a team
performance par excellence.
The Tempest, directed by Yukio Ninagawa on a visit to the Barbican. Once
again here was an indication that however good our home ensembles have
become, outsiders still have something to teach in the way of technical
perfection and elements that go beyond the words.
There were, of course, other incidental pleasures in the course of the year.
It was bold of the National to revive the original Pygmalion, and you would
have to be dull of soul not to enjoy Maria Aitken and her supporting cast in
Noel Coward's Hay Fever. Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a
Field had a new outing at the Royal Court and showed that it is still
possible to be both contemporary and witty. The fringe continued to please,
led by The Gate with its European season and The Bush with its performance
of Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy. Those two pub theatres, in Notting Hill
and Shepherds Bush respectively, have become an essential part of the
theatre scene, often heavily oversubscribed.
Yet if you look at the list above, several facts stand out. Most of the
plays are either foreign or classics or both. The two best modern plays were
American: Angels in America and Six Degrees of Separation. Shakespeare,
whether native or imported, accounts for four of the 12 entries. Two of the
Shakespeare productions - Hamlet and The Winter's Tale - are by the same
director: Adrian Noble. Much of the best work has taken place on the stages
of the two big subsidised theatres,the National and the RSC, especially if
one includes the imports. The Granville Barker plays do not fit into any
particular pattern; they are revived periodically.
That leaves only one new British play in the top 12 productions of 1992:
Dejavu. And while I admired it a great deal, I have to admit that it
flopped. Some people reminded us that they had never liked Look Back in
Anger in the first place and did not want to revisit it. A younger
generation knew little about the original excitement and therefore had no
interest in Jimmy Porter 35 years on. Osborne has suggested that he will not
write for the theatre again, but the conclusion is sadder than that: there
is now no school of British dramatists writing about the present in the way
of Osborne and his fellows in the 1950s and 1960s.
Perhaps we should not be too surprised. Great waves of new new theatrical
writing do not come very often. There was the Elizabethan/Jacobean explosion
matched, as the Gate has been showing us, by a similar golden age in Spain
with such playwrights as Tirso de Molina. Then there was the more
intellectual departure around the beginning of this century not only with
Granville Barker and Shaw in Britain, but Ibsen and Chekhov abroad.
The apparent new take-off in the mid-1950s does not look nearly so
revolutionary with hindsight. As the revival of Billy Liar at the National
demonstrated, what seemed like youthful, northern rebellion in 1960 now
appears old hat. In the end, the rebellion was tame. Fresh fields for
protest have not yet emerged. Indeed there is a preference for nostalgia, as
in Jim Cartwright's The Rise and Fall of Little Voice where the young
heroine specialises in singing the songs of Judy Garland and Gracie Fields.
Meanwhile we can take pleasure in re-exploring the old, and in imports - a
not uncommon British phenomenon. The theatre has been extremely good at it.
There is also the musical, which had an interesting year. The best of the
new was Stephen Sondheim's Assassins at the refurbished Donmar Warehouse. It
flopped in America possibly because its launch coincided with the opening of
the Gulf War. Here it showed that by choosing new themes, the musical still
has plenty of room for development. Cameron Mackintosh had a shot at new
frontiers in Moby Dick, which I enjoyed more than most of my colleagues.
Old musicals came back: notably Annie Get Your Gun with a dynamic Kim
Criswell as Annie at the Prince of Wales, and Carousel at the National where
one can admire the performance while bridling at the sentiment. I suspect
that there are many good musicals still to be written and look forward to
seeing them.
A final point: the theatre in Britain remains remarkably efficient compared
with many other institutions. There is a great deal of hard, professional
work, the curtain goes up roughly on time and you should compare the price
of a ticket to that of other products before complaining that theatre is too
expensive. What is needed most of all is a regular audience.
