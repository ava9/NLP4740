FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Problem of housing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM WINNIFRITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Osman Streater (Letters, September 27) alleges, from the sanctuary of
the Savile Club, that the driving force behind Liberal-run Tower Hamlets
council's housing policy is 'middle-class, post-colonial guilt'. Rubbish.
Tower Hamlets Liberals have as far as possible tried to put the housing
needs of local people ahead of recent arrivals in our borough. Three times
our councillors have been sent to court for trying to break the Homeless
Persons Act, which forces councils to put the homeless (ie, recent arrivals
in the area) ahead of locals. London's most densely populated borough needs
exempting from this act now.
That one, misguided, piece of legislation was undoubtedly the result of
middle-class guilt. Its effect has been to cause immense working-class anger
 -as we saw in Millwall two weeks ago. It continues to cause anger among
people of all ethnic groupings in the East End who suffer unjustifiable
overcrowding and misery as a result of it. Tower Hamlets Liberals have done
everything in our power to alleviate this problem, but we alone cannot solve
it. If the middle classes still feel guilty, then those of them sitting at
Westminster know what to do about it.
Tom Winnifrith.
