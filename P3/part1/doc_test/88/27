</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Shakespeare is alive and well and living in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Forget those nasty rumors about the Bard dying on April 23, 1616. The truth is 
written on the marquees of local theaters: "Twelfth Night" is at the La Jolla 
Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre, "Hamlet" just completed a big, extended hit 
run on the Old Globe Theatre's mainstage, and "Cymbeline" is due to open at the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Space Nov. 7, assuming the company can 
sufficiently resolve its present financial situation by that time. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes on the heels of a summer that included three well-attended 
outdoor Shakespeare productions: "As You Like It" at the Old Globe's Lowell 
Davies Festival Stage as well as two free low-budget productions by community 
theater groups, "Romeo and Juliet" by Octad-One outside the East County 
Performing Arts Center and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," by Christoper R and the 
Ruse Performance Gallery in Zorro Gardens in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Some might call the last few months in San Diego a Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
But you could just as easily call it theater as usual in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the city best known for fun and sun could just as easily be dubbed Chez 
Will. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit lies squarely with the Old Globe. It's not just coincidence 
that the Globe bears the same name as Shakespeare's original theater. The 
theater has been presenting Shakespeare each summer since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Which means two generations of San Diegans have been weaned on Shakespeare. And 
audiences have proven that they care about getting their annual fare. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1953, following a drop in audience enthusiasm and attendance 
at the Shakespeare festival, the Old Globe dropped the Bard in favor of "Mr. 
Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
There was a hue and cry in the community. One headline read: "Shakespeare Walks 
the Plank." The Old Globe never tried that again. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the Old Globe also shares some of Shakespeare's tragic theater 
history. Shakespeare's Globe burned to the ground in 1613 and was rebuilt in 
1614. In 1978 San Diego's Old Globe was burned to the ground at the hands of an 
arsonist who was never found. 
</P>
<P>
The new Old Globe reopened in 1982, appropriately with "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
As theater began to boom in San Diego in the 1980s, more theaters tackled 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
And, like many theaters nationwide, they began to put a contemporary spin on 
those productions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the very first year of the revived La Jolla Playhouse, artistic 
director Des McAnuff boldly directed "Romeo and Juliet" as a tale that moved 
from present-day Italy with Mafioso undertones to ancient Verona and back. The 
company went on to include five Shakespeare plays during the following eight 
seasons. Each one has been challenging; McAnuff won't elaborate on what we can 
expect from the upcoming production of "Twelfth Night," but he does say that he 
sees the Illyria in which the twins Viola and Sebastian lose and find each 
other and their future mates as "a state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the San Diego Repertory Theatre also got into the act with a production 
of the rarely produced "Titus Andronicus." The company put a new spin on "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" in 1987 by commissioning Max Roach to write an 
original jazz score and setting the fairy kingdom in a smoky dive that featured 
African American musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tiny Lamb's Players Theatre in National City has produced four 
Shakespeare plays in eight years and has played with the setting each time. The 
company produced "Two Gentlemen of Verona" in the leather-jacketed bobby-soxed 
'50s, and designed a suburban California backdrop for "The Taming of the 
Shrew," complete with redwood deck and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
There may have been a time at the beginning of San Diego's love affair with 
Shakespeare when audiences were attracted to Shakespeare because of the 
seriousness of his name. After all, even an untutored theater goer knows that 
in Shakespeare one sees the greatest theater the English language has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in the early days, some might have been attracted by the prospect of 
seeing some of the talented actors who ventured here to perform in Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Actors, too, want the challenge of playing the greatest parts in the English 
language. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s, the rules changed. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare, increasingly, has had to coexist with some of the best 
contemporary theater that San Diego has had to offer -- and some of that 
theater has been very fine indeed. 
</P>
<P>
So it has made sense to reexamine Shakespeare's work in light of contemporary 
realities. If Shakespeare is to compete with the likes of August Wilson, Lee 
Blessing, A.R. Gurney, David Mamet and Athol Fugard, some questions are 
inevitable. Can the playwright's work still mirror human life nearly four 
centuries after the work was written? Are the things he wrote about love, 
jealousy, ambition and philosophy still true for us, living in San Diego today? 
</P>
<P>
And would they seem as true set in a variety of eras as they do in traditional 
Elizabethan garb? 
</P>
<P>
The finest directors of our local stages as well as the renowned directors 
brought to our local stages have been telling us "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
And audiences are listening. More closely than ever, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
"Coriolanus," a triumph for the Old Globe, put a political spin on 
Shakespeare's ultimate warrior who ends by offending everyone. Director John 
Hirsch portrayed him as an Ollie North figure and completed the look with a 
jeep and modern arms and video-cameras. The Roman senators became American 
senators. Actor Dakin Matthews' honeyed Southern drawl as one of those senators 
fit Shakespeare's rhythms magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
Some productions are designed to pull audiences in. Robert Smyth, the artistic 
director at Lamb's, said that his reason for contemporizing Shakespeare was "to 
make it approachable for audiences that are afraid of Shakespeare. We want it 
to be accessible, to be enjoyed by an every day person." 
</P>
<P>
Still other productions push audiences further than they are willing to go. 
Robert Woodruff's direction of "The Tempest" at the La Jolla Playhouse 
overflowed with exciting parallels between the play's warring parties and 
American and Latin American interests. But there was an unfinished quality to 
the thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer Theatre's "Hamlet" was a bold and unabashedly sexual/political 
reading of the play that assaulted the senses, often without a clearly 
discernable reason. But, being Shakespeare in San Diego, it merited a look. In 
this city, you take your Shakespeare with your Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
What many modern directors have discovered in looking at the Bard are both the 
advantages and disadvantages of Shakespeare's distance in time from us. The 
disadvantage is that we couldn't recreate Shakespeare's plays exactly as they 
were done in his time even if we wanted to. There are no precise records as to 
how they were done. 
</P>
<P>
But the advantage is that we can process the plays through the prism of nearly 
400 years of experience. We can match the play to the era it best suggests to 
us. History moves in cycles. Trends repeat. A play might suggest the beginning 
of the decline of European aristocracy in World War I. Or the lessons of I 
Ching. Or the racist fights that might attend an interracial "Romeo and Juliet" 
in the Old South -- or Orange County, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
A director's own personal experience may inform the choice. When Des McAnuff 
directed "Macbeth" at the La Jolla Playhouse last year, he and his wife, 
actress Susan Berman, had not yet had a child. He said the subject was on his 
mind when he related the ambition of the Macbeths to their childlessness. This 
year, as Berman gave birth to Julia Violet McAnuff, his focus has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally I'm interested in the celebration of the play," McAnuff said with 
a smile. "This summer on a personal level is a nice time for love themes." 
</P>
<P>
Then, for others, Shakespeare becomes a yardstick by which one can measure 
one's own understanding of oneself and mastery of one's craft. 
</P>
<P>
For Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe Theatre, the distance 
between his direction of "Hamlet" in 1977 and in 1990 was a very personal 
journey in which he explored his own feelings both about Shakespeare as a 
playwright and about himself as a director. 
</P>
<P>
"My first production of 'Hamlet' was born out of fear, trepidation, total 
intimidation and the fear I was going to be found out as a non-classicist and a 
Broadway baby. I put the play on in a classical way, but I didn't have an 
opinion about a character, incident or event. I was highly praised and I 
thought I got away with it. Now I've been here 13 years and there's been a lot 
of verse under the bridge. The more I know, the more trust I have. The more 
trust, the more confidence. The more confidence, the more honest I am. Now I 
ask questions. Now I don't worry about what you think. I worry about what I 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's some of the best work I've ever done here," O'Brien said, 
referring to the currently running "Hamlet," "and I feel very fulfilled."
