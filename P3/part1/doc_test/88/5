Prospects of the far-right British National party strengthening its position
in May's London council elections have been increased by divisions among
Labour councillors in Tower Hamlets.
In September the BNP took its first local authority seat by winning a Tower
Hamlets council by-election.
It won one of the three seats in Millwall ward from Labour after fighting
its campaign on a platform of 'rights for whites'.
Mr Ted Johns, a Labour councillor in Millwall, last week resigned the Labour
whip and announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the newly
formed East London People's Alliance in the May elections.
The alliance, which has the support of Labour members unhappy about the
party's performance in the wake of the BNP by-election victory, plans to
field candidates elsewhere in Tower Hamlets.
Anti-racist organisations expect the BNP to contest about 12 of the 50 Tower
Hamlets council seats in May.
The party, which has been campaigning hard in the borough since its victory
in September, stands to benefit if the new alliance causes the Labour and
Liberal Democrat votes to be spread more thinly.
If a split in the Labour vote caused by Mr Johns's resignation enabled the
BNP to win all three Millwall seats it would, under Tower Hamlets' devolved
structure, control the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood, which provides the
council's services in the south of the borough.
Mr Johns said yesterday he had been warned by colleagues that the East
London People's Alliance risked splitting the vote and strengthening the
BNP.
However, he blamed in-fighting in both the Labour party and the council's
controlling Liberal Democrat group since the BNP victory for causing
disillusion among electors and assisting the BNP's cause.
Mr Johns said: 'I will support whatever group has the best chance of
defeating the BNP.
'I believe the new alliance has a good chance of top-slicing support across
the parties.'
An inquiry after the by-election by Lord Lester QC, a Liberal Democrat peer,
found that leaflets produced by some of the Liberal Democrat party's
activists had pandered to racist prejudice.
Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats accepted the findings of the inquiry earlier
this month only after being threatened with suspension from the national
party.
September's by-election took place against a background of severe racial
tension in Tower Hamlets, and community leaders say attacks on members of
the Asian community and other racially motivated incidents have increased
since then.
