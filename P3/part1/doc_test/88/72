The Liberal Democrats last night claimed to have received extensive leaked
information about alleged racism among Labour activists in east London,
Kevin Brown writes.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat campaigns organiser, said the leaked
Labour party documents revealed deep divisions among Labour workers about
the party's electoral tactics.
The claim follows disciplinary action by the Liberal Democrats against party
members accused of racism in Tower Hamlets, the only big city council
controlled by the party.
Unrest over the treatment of local activists threatens to boil over at a
meeting of Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors on Thursday.
However, Liberal Democrat officials believe that the damage being done to
the national party would be minimised by evidence of similar turmoil in the
local Labour party.
Mr Taylor said the leaked documents would expose a cover-up of Tower Hamlets
racism by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's frontbench local government spokesman.
