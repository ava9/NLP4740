IN 1600, theatre takings were put in piggy banks, until someone had time to
break the pottery moneyboxes and count the cash. The play cost a penny for
the groundlings in the yard, and seats in the galleries were two pence.
Broken piggy banks from the 1988-89 dig in the Rose Theatre in Southwark are
an evocative part of a newly opened permanent display of Tudor and Stuart
theatres in the Museum of London.
The Rose, over the road from the FT's building, was at the heart of
theatreland in the days of Marlowe and Shakespeare. Across Park Street was
the Globe. Nearby were the Swan and the Hope, and the Bear Garden for bear
baiting.
London's first theatre was The Theatre, built by James Burbage in 1576 in
Shoreditch, beyond the rule of the City fathers. Similarly, Philip Henslowe
put the Rose in Southwark in 1587. In 1599 Burbage demolished The Theatre
and came south to build the Globe and start a lively rivalry. The
Globe/Shakespeare players in Hamlet parody the Rose/Marlowe style of acting.
Centrepiece of the new display is a metre-high model of the Rose
incorporating the results of the dig, which confirm details Henslowe
recorded in his diaries.
The model includes the refreshment parlour that Henslowe's partner, the
grocer John Cholmley, ran beside the Rose. A sword hilt and scabbard from
the dig are rusty relics of many a swordplay. But missing from the display
are the hazelnuts, which were those days' chocolates and popcorn. Both Rose
and Globe digs produced masses of them.
At the Globe, the Museum of London has finished supplementary bore hole digs
beneath the cellars of Anchor Terrace, paid for by the site's owner, Hanson,
finding more of the theatre's perimeter. Now Hanson and the Museum are
preparing a proposal for the future of the site. What a chance for the new
French-style National Heritage Secretary to promote a French-style solution,
a total excavation of the Globe - even if it means removing the lower floors
of Anchor Terrace - to learn how Shakespeare was played in the theatre he
wrote for. Bore holes are not enough.
