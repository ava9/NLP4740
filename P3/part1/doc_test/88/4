FT  10 FEB 94 / Lib Dems may suspend council race row group

The Liberal Democrat group in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, the
only big urban council controlled by the party, has been threatened with
suspension unless it accepts the findings of an inquiry into alleged racism.
The threat follows a confidential intervention in the party's disciplinary
proceedings by Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president.
Mr Kennedy wrote to the party's London region in January protesting at a
decision to reprieve two Tower Hamlets members recommended for expulsion by
an inquiry into the publication of racist leaflets in the borough.
The inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat QC, concluded that
three Tower Hamlets activists produced racist leaflets during a council
by-election won by the British National Party.
One of the three members resigned voluntarily.
The London region's decision to accept apologies from the remaining two
members angered many of the party's MPs. It was described as a whitewash by
the Conservatives and Labour.
Mr Kennedy said yesterday that he told the London region executive that the
reprieve was 'damaging' the national party, and urged it to uphold Lord
Lester's recommendations.
After discussing Mr Kennedy's letter, the regional executive asked Ms
Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of Tower Hamlets local party, to sign a statement
accepting the Lester inquiry's conclusions, and withdrawing activists'
criticisms.
Ms Deakins was told that the Tower Hamlets group would be suspended unless
the signed statement was received by Sunday. She was not available for
comment last night.
The suspension of the Tower Hamlets group would be a victory for Liberal
Democrat anti-racism campaigners such as Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark
and Bermondsey.
The suspension would mean that Liberal Democrat councillors would remain
members of the party, but activities such as candidate selection would be
carried out by the London region.
