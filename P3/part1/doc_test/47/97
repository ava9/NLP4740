Congress' decision to cut the budget of space station Freedom isn't very 
popular in the aerospace community, judging from comments at a symposium 
Saturday that addressed aspects of the $37-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
Congress cut the space station budget from $2.45 billion to $1.9 billion for 
the current year and ordered NASA to submit a redesigned station by the end of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Charles (Pete) Conrad Jr., a former Gemini and Apollo astronaut who is now a 
staff vice president for new business at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in 
Huntington Beach, said the mandate to redesign the space station is "a bunch of 
junk." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to say the future is running a little late," Conrad said, noting that 
the NASA budget was cut sharply during the Johnson and Nixon administrations. 
"We're 25 years behind schedule and we're about to make it worse. I don't 
understand what Congress is up to." 
</P>
<P>
The symposium in Huntington Beach was sponsored by the Los Angeles chapter of 
the Human Factors Society, a group involved in efforts to design products and 
equipment that suit human needs. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad said the reduced budget could also affect decisions by international 
players, such as Japan and the European Space Agency, to continue their 
participation in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources at the symposium, which included a tour of McDonnell Douglas' 
mock-up of the space station, said a space station redesign would lack the 
years of research and billions of dollars already spent on the program. 
</P>
<P>
If NASA goes forward with plans to shorten the 508-foot truss assembly that 
serves as the main framework for the station, then McDonnell Douglas could see 
an impact on its work force, sources said. McDonnell Douglas is leading a team 
of contractors that are building a major portion of the station, including the 
truss assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Williams, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said speculation that the 
company could trim its work force is inaccurate. The company expects to 
maintain its current employment on the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is we can build a very good space station with $15.7 billion" in 
funding through 1996, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which employs 2,000 people on the space station in Huntington 
Beach and Houston, has frozen its hiring on the program.
