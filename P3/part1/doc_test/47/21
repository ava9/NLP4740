<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson: "Eternal `Soyuz' -- Today Marks </F>
the 25th Anniversary of the First Docking in Orbit"] 
  [Text] Strictly speaking, 1969 became the Year of the Moon 
because on the evening of 20 July Neil Armstrong strode across 
the basalt of the Mare Tranquillitatis and the Americans finally 
broke ahead in the space race. 
  In addition, January 1969 was the apotheosis of our 
country's 
lunar program. The unmanned Zonds were launched to the moon, one 
after another; it was necessary to overtake the Americans, the 
first to send an astronaut flying around the moon. And another 
modification of this same ship, designated the Soyuz, had to be 
tested in circumterrestrial orbit on an accelerated schedule. 
  The Korolev Design Bureau began to work on the Soyuz -- a 
lunar ship and the future universal "carrier" -- virtually 
simultaneously with the successful flights of the first 
cosmonauts. On 23 April 1967 -- 1 1/2 years prior to the first 
manned Apollo flight -- Vladimir Komarov piloted the first 
Soyuz. On the very next day the "solemn tribute" to the 
anniversary of Lenin's birth ended in a tragedy. The Soyuz was 
hastily prepared for launching and it was launched (an 
unprecedented act!) despite the categorical refusal of Vasiliy 
Mishin, replacing Korolev, and it literally "came apart at the 
seams." Engineer-colonel Vladimir Komarov perished. 
  For 1 1/2 years the Soyuz stuck in the mind. Yuriy Gagarin 
was forbidden to fly in the second vehicle. And in October 1968, 
this time without linking it to glorious anniversaries, Georgiy 
Beregovoy, an assault aircraft pilot during the Great Fatherland 
War, successfully landed the third Soyuz. To be sure, prior to 
this not being able to dock the ship with the automatic Soyuz 2. 
  It all boiled down to this; not being able to perform 
docking 
in orbit, it was better not to push on to the moon. Both Soviet 
and American lunar ships while "in flight" had to link up with 
the cabin with cosmonauts or astronauts "lifting off" from the 
moon. If a docking did not take place, only a miracle could save 
those who had trodden on the moon. Accordingly, on our country's 
lunar ship the docking system was simplified to the limit. The 
pilot of the lunar Soyuz in one way or another had to insert the 
docking unit shaft into one of several openings in the receiving 
unit, the "meat grinder," as the strange holey structure was 
called, of the lunar cabin. After linking of the ships the lunar 
cabin pilot returned "home" through open space. 
  This had to be done by Aleksey Yeliseyev and Yevgeniy 
Khrunov 
on 15 January. They put into orbit the Soyuz 5 under the command 
of Boris Volynov, and there Vladimir Shatalov already waited in 
the Soyuz 4. 
  Unfortunately, we can visualize the world's first docking of 
two manned ships only from drawings and models. It is easy to 
understand that there was no one to photograph the cosmonauts 
creeping along the handrails. It was decided to correct this 
during the next launchings. Three Soyuz ships -- 11, 12 and 13 
-- were launched in October 1969 with an interval of one day. 
Two of them were to make a docking, whereas the third was to 
approach them as close as possible and survey all the 
"acrobatics." Alas, the ships could not approach one another and 
the attainments of the "cosmic escadrille," in addition to a 
hitherto unprecedented "population density" in orbit, were 
limited to the world's first welding experiment in space, which 
was performed by Valeriy Kubasov. 
  The first docking was a happy event for its participants. 
None of them, other than Yevgeniy Khrunov (who, according to 
some information, headed a secret detachment of cosmonauts for 
flights in the Spiral spaceplane), never again headed into 
space. Boris Volynov became a strong commander of a detachment 
of a new group of cosmonauts. Vladimir Shatalov received the 
stars of a general and headed the training of Soviet cosmonauts. 
Aleksey Yeliseyev directed flights at the Flight Control Center, 
but later at Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman. 
  Although the Soyuz did not deliver cosmonauts to the moon, 
it 
remained virtually "eternal." Thereafter it was repeatedly 
modified -- it was designated the Soyuz T and the Soyuz TM; was 
launched in a cargo variant as the Progress; as a small module 
for orbital stations under the name Gamma. It remains on line 
even now, delivering cosmonauts to the Mir station. And the 
Americans, who have successfully developed and operated the 
heavy Space Shuttle, proceeding right up to construction of the 
Freedom orbital station, have begun to negotiate with the 
Russian NPO Energiya on use of the Soyuz as a rescue ship.
