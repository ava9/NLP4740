INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IS THE ROUTE INTO MANNED SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL G. HARR JR., Karl G. Harr Jr., former national security coordinator for 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and for many years president of the Aerospace 
Industries Assn., is now a senior fellow at the Eisenhower World Affairs 
Institute.

In time, and with considerable expense, we can land men and women on Mars. We 
can also establish a permanent manned base on the moon. We are building a 
manned space station. And there are numerous fascinating unmanned missions we 
can undertake. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the cost and time commitments involved in pursuing any of these 
options, we have important decisions to make about our nation's future in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who played a role in formulating original U.S. space policy 32 
years ago, considerations today about the future of space evoke strong feelings 
of deja vu. The situation now is vastly different from that of 1957 when 
Sputnik was launched, but the questions and the need to resolve them quickly 
are fundamentally the same. How big should our effort be? How should our 
programs be divided between military and civil? Manned and unmanned? National 
and international? And space exploration's huge cost remains unchanged, causing 
tough choices for any nation contemplating significant space ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the one great difference lies in changed U.S.-Soviet relations. 
In 1958 and 1959, when the National Security Council Planning Board developed 
from scratch the first national policy on space, we were at the peak of the 
Cold War. The atmosphere between the two nations was hostile, distrustful and 
fearful. We welcomed each other's failures and took great pleasure in "beating" 
the other in one space achievement or another. 
</P>
<P>
Only on the most cosmetic level was there talk of cooperation. Barely beneath 
the surface was a shared fear that the other's space capabilities portended 
important, perhaps, decisive, military capabilities. And in the struggle for 
world leadership, space achievements counted heavily as symbols of national 
advance or decline. 
</P>
<P>
Today, such national security and world leadership concerns remain important to 
both nations, but count for much less. As our sophistication is increasing, our 
mutual paranoia is subsiding considerably. And the rest of the world is no 
longer so closely interested in "who's ahead?" 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roald Sagdeyev, former director of the Soviet Space Research Institute and 
newly elected People's Deputy, has made it clear that the United States is not 
alone in facing tough decisions about its future in space; such decisions also 
confront the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
So why not cooperate, where we can, under whatever ground rules we are 
comfortable with? 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation can help alleviate the heavy financial pressure on both of our 
space programs. The United States, with its annual appropriations cycle and 
two-year congressional terms, has always felt downward pressure (sure to stay 
strong as long as the high deficit remains). The Soviet Union, more tightly 
controlled, has seemed better able to sustain long-term, high-cost programs. 
But now, with perestroika lagging, it, too, is feeling the pressure of public 
opinion on space expenditures. The Soviets are cutting back on existing 
programs, such as the Mir space station, and re-evaluating others, such as Mars 
exploration. They are also sensitive, Sagdeyev says, to the unnecessary costs 
incurred as a result of our respective programs duplicating one another. 
</P>
<P>
So we both face the choice between cooperating or turning our backs on the 
major challenges in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of current domestic attitudes toward cooperation on civil space 
exploration, both countries have much to draw on that we never had before. 
Whether or not we can overcome the obstacles to such cooperation is the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the widely held American view that cooperating with the 
Soviets on non-military space projects will afford them disproportionate gains 
from "technology transfer." While this concern is valid, it is manageable 
because so many measures have been developed to protect against undesirable 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
If we can overcome this and other roadblocks, we will have an enormous 
potential joint capability -- scientifically, technologically and economically. 
If we cannot, or choose not to do so, we might as well forget about major 
advancement in space for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we will have a worthwhile menu of unmanned space missions such as the 
recently launched Magellan probe to Venus, the on-going Project Earth missions 
and the forthcoming Hubble telescope mission. But we will have forgone any 
meaningful manned exploration of the universe, and perhaps even have seriously 
limited our opportunities for unmanned missions. That would be sad given the 
measure of our joint capabilities. And it would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to resuscitate such capabilities once abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is time we take a new giant leap in space and, with prudence at every step, 
go with it on an international basis. The exploration of space, to realize its 
full potential, must become an arena of international cooperation.
