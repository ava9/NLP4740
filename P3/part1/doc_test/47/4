Twenty years ago this week, the United States' Apollo 11 spacecraft landed the 
first humans on the surface of the moon, fulfilling a dream shared by poets and 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
That accomplishment stands as one of the great feats of modern science and is 
one whose legacy continues to be felt today. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than the pyramids, I don't know what other accomplishment by man even 
compares with it," said Christopher Kraft, former director of Apollo mission 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
When Astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, he did 
more than fulfill President John F. Kennedy's bold promise of 1961 to land a 
man on the moon before the end of the decade. Coming at a time of political and 
social turmoil, the landing unified a nation and provided some much-needed 
heroes -- most notably the Apollo 11 crew, Armstrong, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin 
Jr. and Michael Collins. 
</P>
<P>
But there were others among Apollo's 200,000 scientists, engineers and 
technicians who were the unknown, unseen heroes. They fought the lesser-known 
but critical battles of technology at a time when computerization was in its 
infancy, and they won. If they had not, the mission might have ended in 
disaster or there might have been no Apollo at all. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Elverum was one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Elverum was an engineer at TRW in Inglewood designing rocket engines 
that he hoped would someday be used in space. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had already decided to use 
the Gargantuan Saturn 5 engines to launch Apollo vehicles out of the Earth's 
atmosphere, but bringing a manned craft down to the moon's surface would 
require the development of an additional engine capable of controlled descent. 
</P>
<P>
Elverum thought he had that engine. 
</P>
<P>
Because it would serve as both a brake and booster for the descent vehicle, 
Elverum's design allowed the thrust and direction of the engine to be adjusted 
by the vehicle's occupants. Should the need to change landing locations arise 
midway through descent, the astronauts would be able to modify the speed and 
trajectory of the craft accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Although not involved in the original bidding process for the descent engine, 
Elverum and a team from TRW approached NASA contractors with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an idea for how that engine ought to really be made, and we want to 
talk to you about it," Elverum told the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors listened and, based on engine designs Elverum had made for much 
smaller vehicles and positive test results achieved with their scaled-up 
versions, eventually awarded TRW the contract for the only engines that have 
ever landed men on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very intense time period," recalled Elverum, now a senior 
propulsion engineer at TRW. "We were not a known name in propulsion at that 
time . . . but we submitted a proposal and, lo and behold, we won." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the Apollo 11 landing, Elverum and his crew were stationed at a 
test facility in Bethpage, N.Y., where they monitored a full-scale mock-up of 
the Apollo lander. Should anything go wrong with the engine during descent, 
they would be asked to give technical advice to the astronauts in space. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, if they were pushing buttons and the engines didn't start, we 
could in real time look at all the stuff and say, 'Here, try this, try that,' " 
Elverum explained. 
</P>
<P>
The engines performed flawlessly, however, responding on cue, even when 
Armstrong was forced seconds before touchdown to take manual control of the 
descent to avoid landing in a boulder field. Toggling the engine's control 
switch, a feature which Elverum had included in the design, Armstrong landed 
the craft safely, away from the lunar boulders. As Armstrong would later 
comment on the landing, the engine performed without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
In years to come, the engine would be used successfully for tasks it was never 
designed to perform, as witnessed in the aborted Apollo 13 moon mission in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
On that mission, an oxygen tank attached to the craft's service module exploded 
halfway to the moon, leaving the three astronauts drifting in space. Using the 
landing vehicle as a lifeboat, however, the astronauts were able to swing 
around the moon and direct the craft back to Earth, using Elverum's engine as 
their only propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was called on, the engine worked. You feel good about that," Elverum 
said. "When life gets tough, you can always look back and say there was 
something that worked and we accomplished it." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the split-second decision of another relatively unknown Apollo 11 
player, however, Elverum's engine might never have had the chance to perform so 
perfectly in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning its final descent to the moon's surface, the Apollo 11 lander, 
called Eagle, experienced a series of problems in its communication and 
navigational systems. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours in orbit around the moon while still attached to the Apollo 
command module and another period of orbit after separation, "everything looked 
fairly OK," said Steven Bales, who was the mission's 26-year-old guidance 
officer stationed back on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
As Eagle circled around from the dark side of the moon, preparing to begin the 
final descent process, "the communications were dropping in and out . . . and 
there were indications, ever so subtle, that possibly the down-range (landing) 
distance was a little off," Bales said. 
</P>
<P>
Ground control crews considered the problems manageable, however, and the 
lander was given permission to begin its descent. But within moments, Bales 
noticed that Eagle's navigational computer was registering a descent rate of 
about 20 feet per second slower than the module was actually traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Had the discrepancy grown to 35 feet per second, it would have disrupted 
navigation to the point where the descent would have to be aborted altogether, 
Bales said. But because it remained constant, he was able to give the go-ahead 
for the process to continue. 
</P>
<P>
But no sooner did that crisis pass than a systems alarm in Eagle began to 
sound, indicating more trouble with the vehicle's computer. The alarm, known as 
a "12 02" warning, showed that because of an informational overload, the 
computer was not completing some necessary calculations. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are in the middle of the descent, we had just had a navigational 
concern and . . . we hear this program alarm. It was really a shock," Bales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, a similar problem had arisen in a simulation of the landing a few 
weeks earlier, and it had been determined that if the alarms came infrequently 
enough, the landing would not necessarily have to be aborted. The definition of 
infrequent, however, was left to the flight controller's discretion and a 
go/no-go decision based on the alarms would essentially be a judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
"So in a period of about 20 seconds I made up my mind that it was OK to 
continue," Bales explained. 
</P>
<P>
Although six more computer alarms cropped up over the next several minutes, 
Bales stuck by his decision, and after about 15 minutes, he and others back on 
Earth heard the static-tinged voice of Armstrong announce: "Houston, 
Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
With the thousands of workers involved in the lunar program, it is not 
surprising that the majority have gone unrecognized. Aldrin himself, though 
known by millions of Americans as Armstrong's only companion in the Eagle 
lander, is destined to be remembered as the second man to set foot on the moon. 
People "want to say that (I) feel bad because he went out first, but I think 
it's small people who say that," Aldrin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is also the person who called out altitude and directional readings 
for Armstrong when problems in the Eagle's navigational computer forced a 
manual landing. Without that information, such a descent would probably have 
been impossible and could have ended in tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Although after touchdown Aldrin followed Armstrong out onto the surface of the 
moon by less than 20 minutes, it is Armstrong's name, not Aldrin's, which comes 
to mind when recalling the historic landing and subsequent moon walk. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after Apollo 11, Aldrin has acknowledged that he developed a 
substance abuse problem in coping with the impact of the moon landing on his 
life and underwent psychiatric treatment for depression related to it. Now 
recovered, Aldrin said he holds no bitterness about his involvement in the moon 
program or about the lesser position he held on that mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm very satisfied with my ability to project my talents to be very 
useful in the space program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But like many involved in the Apollo program, Aldrin questions whether future 
space accomplishments can match Apollo's intensity and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Project Apollo was the single most audacious endeavor in human history," he 
wrote several years after the landing. "When future generations remember 
Apollo, just as we now recall the voyages of Columbus . . . they will remember 
(that) in July, 1969, people like themselves first set foot on the moon."
