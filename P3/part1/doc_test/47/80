THE European Space Agency (ESA) is set to announce virtual cancellation of
its manned space programme, as part of a plan to cut spending 18 per cent
over the next three years. Trade and science ministers attending ESA's
ministerial council meeting in Granada, Spain, will be asked to approve a
restructuring marking the end of ESA's five-year-old plan for
self-sufficiency in manned space technology.
Mr Jean-Marie Luton, ESA's director-general, will instead propose a 110m
accounting units outlay to assess the possibilities of a joint
European/Russian shuttle and space station. An accounting unit (AU) used by
ESA is similar in value to an Ecu but related to a wider European currency
basket. ESA's total budget for 1993-1995 will be AU7.7bn under the Luton
plan.
His proposals vindicate UK space policy. Five years ago, the UK refused to
join the manned space programme, preferring to concentrate on Earth
observation satellites. 'Now these programmes are over-subscribed,' Mr
Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's strategy director, said.
Germany has been the driving force behind the cost-cutting effort. As well
as the abandoning of the Hermes manned programme, the German space Agency
Dara insisted on better cost controls. Internal costs account for 6 per cent
of ESA's budget. Cancellation of Hermes and of much of the Columbus manned
space laboratory is a blow to main contractors Aerospatiale and Dassault of
France and MBB-Erno of Germany.
Projects likely to be approved at the meeting:
Polar Orbiting Earth Mission (Poem): two satellites for environmental
monitoring and meteorology costing AU1.8bn and to be launched by the year
2000. Prime contractor: the Anglo-French joint venture Matra-Marconi.
Polar platform: Part of Poem, costing AU700m; prime contractor: British
Aerospace.
Pressurised Module: the only remaining manned project, to be attached to the
US space station Freedom. Cost: AU2.5bn; prime contractors, MBB-Erno and
Aeritalia.
Data Relay Satellite: costing AU950m; allowing information from Poem
satellites to be sent to Europe from the other side of Earth.
