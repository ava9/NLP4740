It was going to be the power ball of power balls, an Orange County gala so 
chock-full of political connections that it would be the envy of every charity 
committee outside the White House. Until very recently, there was reason to 
think that President Bush and his popular First Lady might be the guests of 
honor at Saturday night's Orangewood Ball. 
</P>
<P>
But the hopes of ball organizers were dashed when the call came from 
Washington: thank you very much, but no thank you. One insider chalks up the 
disappointment to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's recent visit: "President 
Bush is just too busy." 
</P>
<P>
Why would a local ball committee send an invitation to the President of the 
United States? Give yourself 200 Social I.Q. points if you know the answer: a 
few Orangewood activists -- William Lyon, Kathryn Thompson, George Argyros -- 
are members of Team 100, donors of $100,000 to Bush's presidential campaign. In 
fact, when Kathryn Thompson and her husband, Gus Owen, dined with the First 
Couple at the White House last year, Mrs. Bush remembered the tour of 
Orangewood that Thompson gave her in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the gala will raise more than $1 million, making it 
Orange County's biggest single fund-raiser ever. How does one little ole soiree 
rake in so many smackers? Simple. Forbes 400 developer William Lyon is at the 
helm (ably assisted by developer and good friend Kathryn Thompson). Not only 
have Lyon and his wife, Willa Dean, inspired commitment by tossing an 
underwriting bash that pulled in $300,000 (more than enough to pay for ball 
costs), they also plan to ante up $250,000 out of their own pockets. Ditto 
developer Peter Ochs, president of the Fieldstone Co. And something new has 
been added to everybody's favorite spring gala: a Gold Circle consisting of 
donors of $25,000 or more. So far, 13 Orangewood supporters -- Tommy Tucker, 
Glen Stillwell, Leo Cook and Marvin Weiss among them -- have joined those 
ranks. Add 750 guests who have paid $300 each and you've got a gala that's 
sitting on a powder keg of record-breaking dollars.

Festivities, themed "A New Beginning," begin at the Irvine Hilton with a 
pool-side reception followed by dinner in a room hung with silk butterflies. 
Dinner will include something tres nouvelle: caviar asparagus frappe served in 
a martini glass. Dessert will be to die for: a hazelnut ladyfinger charlotte 
topped with a chocolate filigree butterfly.

Speaking of Gorby: Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and wife Lois were in the 
Soviet Union 10 days ago as guests of H.R. Haldeman. Seems Haldeman is working 
with a couple of local businessmen to bring Moscow a thoroughly modern 
business-hotel complex. As such, he was invited to attend a meeting of the 
World Trade Council and he invited the Aldrins to come along. A few days into 
the trip, the Aldrins found themselves at a party with about 500 guests, 
including Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Mindful of his hero status, and 
always gracious, Aldrin thoughtfully handed Gorbachev a picture postcard of 
himself in his spacesuit. Gorbachev whipped out a pen, signed the card, and 
handed it back to Aldrin. "He thought Buzz wanted his autograph!" Lois said 
this week. "Isn't that a scream?"

Catching up with the Segerstrom salute: There are 50 seats still available for 
the tribute that will mark a decade of involvement in the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center by philanthropist Henry Segerstrom. Set for June 22 at 
the Center, the $500-per-person gala has received "oui-oui" replies from 250 
Center supporters. The elegant ivory invitations, which arrived two weeks ago, 
feature the Center's famed Firebird metal sculpture in embossed splashes of 
gold and bronze. 
</P>
<P>
The party -- which Center President Thomas Kendrick describes as "simple, 
elegant and classy, a party to embrace the Center family" -- will have a 
Firebird theme and begin with a reception in the Center's backstage area. 
Dinner will be served on stage in Segerstrom Hall, where guests will dine on 
fare whipped up by the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. On the tentative menu: a 
main course of lobster-stuffed veal chop. Decor? A huge screen will provide the 
backdrop. During the festivities, the screen will be used to present a video 
tribute to Segerstrom as well as project a blazing image of the Firebird. After 
dinner, pianist Michael Feinstein will play for guests. The Segerstrom family 
plans to attend, en masse, as does the entire Center board.

Chanel of New York in town: Who could miss the bevy of beauties dining at the 
Emperor's Fortune restaurant in Santa Ana on Wednesday? None of the elegant 
eatery's lunch crowd. Having a bite of gourmet Chinese while discussing plans 
for the Opera Pacific gala that will open South Coast Plaza's new Chanel 
boutique this fall were Barbara Cirkva and Arlette Thebault of Chanel, New 
York; Jeanette Segerstrom, a member of the Opera Pacific board, and gala 
co-chairwomen Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson.
