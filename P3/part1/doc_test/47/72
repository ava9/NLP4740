hardest - Space research

THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration has trimmed its
five-year spending plan by more than Dollars 15bn, to Dollars 80.4bn (Pounds
53.2bn), in a budget that shifts the focus from manned space flight towards
development of advanced technology for civilian use.
Nasa's Dollars 15.3bn 1994 budget request kills the National Launch System,
a controversial plan to create a new rocket that Mr Goldin said might cost
Dollars 10bn yet only permit the US to catch up with, and not leapfrog,
foreign competitors such as the European Ariane.
It also kills the Space Exploration Initiative, a long-term plan to send
humans back to the moon and to Mars.
The cancellations, along with changes in programmes such as the Cassini
probe to Saturn and the Earth Observation System, are expected to save more
than Dollars 6bn in 1994-98. Space shuttle funding will be cut by Dollars
3.4bn over the same period.
The biggest savings will come from the space station programme; exact cuts
will depend on the outcome of a fundamental redesign now under way, but
could halve the station's five-year cost to about Dollars 7.1bn.
Spending on aeronautics research, however, will be increased, with more
money going to development of a supersonic civilian aircraft. There will
also be increased funding of technology for subsonic long-haul aircraft and
for a hypersonic vehicle that could be ready to replace the shuttle by the
year 2005.
