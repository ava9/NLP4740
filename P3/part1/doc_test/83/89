FT  01 OCT 94 / History is not bunk: Washington's elite has beaten the hoi
polloi and Disney

Image is everything,' says Andre Agassi, batting tennis balls off mountains
and the Queen of England in a TV commercial for a Japanese camera. It is a
contemporary truism with which this week the Walt Disney Company, creator of
images beyond number and phenomenally conscious of its own, could only
ruefully agree - after pulling the plug on its latest grand project.
In Washington, where most business is politics, there has not been a local
story for years quite like Disney's aborted history theme park next to a
civil war battlefield 35 miles outside the nation's capital. In comparison,
the ups and downs of presidents, senators, governors and mayors have seemed
almost trivial.
The park has pitted the elite against the hoi polloi, the horsey set against
the bus rider, environmentalists against advocates of economic growth,
historians against historians, even government against government.
It began last November when Disney announced it had taken an option to buy
3,000 acres of land just outside the small town of Haymarket in Prince
William County, Virginia, close to the killing fields of Manassas, as the
site for a 'historic theme park'. In January, it fleshed out the project,
envisaging 2,300 houses, 1,300 hotel rooms, and nearly 2m square feet of
retail space, to cater for 5m-6m visitors a year when it opened in 1998. The
price tag would be about Dollars 650m for the park, and Dollars 1bn for
everything.
Disney wanted state and county financial help - and got it. George Allen,
the newly installed Republican governor of Virginia, saw the project as the
leitmotif of his pro-business administration. In March, he rammed through
the state legislature Dollars 163m in grants. A week ago, Dollars 130m in
new road spending was authorised by county and state officials.
The federal government, however, was looking increasingly askance at issues
under its jurisdiction, including air and water quality and the widening of
interstate roads. Benjamin Forgey, the Washington Post's influential
architectural critic, also kept chipping in with pungent articles on the
dangers of urban sprawl. But Disney still believed it would win the
bureaucratic wars.
It was the image war that felled it. Haymarket is a modest town, near
Highway 66. But it is a gateway to the rolling Virginia Piedmont valleys
that contain some of the finest horse country estates in the east - filled
with weekend retreats for Washington's powerful.
These include the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jack Kent Cooke, who owns
the Washington Redskins football team, Pamela Harriman, US ambassador to
France, Senator John Warner of Virginia, once married to Elizabeth Taylor,
Alice Marriott of the hotel family, the Graham family of the Washington
Post, and media glitterati by the dozen.
Their mood was exquisitely captured in a Washington Post article in April
headlined; ' Eeeeek] A Mouse] Step on it]' But these influential and
sophisticated people - some of whom listened to the populist talk shows
favouring the Disney plan - knew they needed better arguments than the
preservation of their comfortable lifestyles from hordes of Coke-swilling,
shorts-wearing tourists in buses and rental cars.
They got them from the guardians of America's heritage. A Who's Who of US
historians, many hardened by the bitter battles of academe, leapt into the
fray. The most prominent included David McCullough (Harry Truman and the
Panama Canal and president of the Society of American Historians), Arthur
Schlesinger Jr (THE authority on presidents), James McPherson, C Vann
Woodward and Shelby Foote (all doyens of the civil war and the south).
Disney mustered a couple of tame historians of its own, but they were
outnumbered and outclassed. They were also hampered by the fact that it was
never exactly clear how the company intended to depict 'history' in its
theme park, beyond the idea of a 'water ride' in the manner of Lewis and
Clark, the early American explorers.
The anti-Disney historians, calling themselves Project Historic America,
focused their fire on two fronts. For a start, they could not see the point
of locating the project within an hour's drive of 16 civil war battlesites,
13 historic towns and 17 historic districts, most of which have indeed been
lovingly preserved, including Manassas itself.
The second string to their bow might have been borrowed from the French,
always ranting on about American cultural imperialism. As David McCullough
put it: 'We have so little left that is authentic and real. To replace what
we have with plastic, contrived history, mechanical history, is almost
sacrilege.'
When Congress finally got into the act with hearings in June, this was the
message they heard - that US history was too important to be left to Disney
to reinterpret. Disney executives, Governor Allen and county officials all
weighed in with counter-arguments, but the public relations war among the
opinion makers was one-sided.
Even so, the idea that Disney gave up simply to avoid the disastrous image
of historians and socialites lying before its tractors stretches credulity -
even for a company known above all for its lovable Mouse, Duck, Snow White
and Lion King.
However the battle to overcome such opposition is not what a stretched
Disney management, weakened by death, illness and resignation, needs at
present. With attendance flat or down at all of its theme parks except Tokyo
(where the Japanese have no problems with American history), but its
animated film division on a huge roll, the company is casting around for new
directions - most likely into commercial television.
So it has folded its Haymarket tent. Local businessmen said yesterday they
were sad, but in the Piedmont valleys the white wine spritzers will be
flowing freely this weekend.
