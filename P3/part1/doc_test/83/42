EXHIBITION AT LACMA SHOWS THE GREAT REGIONALIST ONCE AGAIN IS SPEAKING TO

The decade ended, the world seemed to crumble like a chimney falling in slow 
motion. The wreckage revealed grimy scraps of gilt-edged securities, broken 
bottles of bathtub gin, the fender of a yellow Stutz Bearcat -- detritus of 
good times gone. Bony derelicts would soon rummage in the rubble to a harmonica 
tune asking, "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? " 
</P>
<P>
When the market crashed in '29 people got scared of racy ideas that had fueled 
their roaring decade in the same way they would get scared again at the end of 
the '60s. Have we gone too far? Is all this misery God's punishment for the 
hooch, the easy sex and rebellion against The Establishment? Neoconservative 
nervousness set in as it did again in the '80s traumatized over drugs, and AIDS 
and longing for the simple solutions of the old-time religion. The '20s had 
Father Coughlin, we had Rev. Falwell. They had the Scopes trial, we have 
abortion rights wrangles. Whatever, it's still religion vs. science. Our 
legions of homeless and economic uncertainties are like theirs, except, of 
course, we don't have a Depression. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was international then, too. In Paris, Picasso started painting in his 
Neo-Classical manner. England looked at the discouraged realism of Gwen John 
and Walter Sickert. Hitler replaced modernism with Fascist Realism. Abstract 
art, associated with left-wing radicalism, was on the run. In the United 
States, the new hero was Thomas Hart Benton. His big, ropy murals depicting 
hillbillies and good old boys and girls of Heartland America reassured people 
that Yankee values were safe as strongboxes. Now once again we find easily 
accessible art agreeable. We have David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art opens a revivalist retrospective of 
Benton's art. It manages to be artistically absorbing despite the necessary 
absence of his major works, the unmoveable murals. More importantly, it feels 
less like an art exhibition than the point in a historical cycle where the 
vectors of past and present come together -- making new beginnings possible. 
There is something quite awesome about it. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that would make its significance clearer would be a back-to-back 
retrospective of the art of Jackson Pollock. Pollock is the invisible actor 
whose specter establishes the broader significance of this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was Pollock's teacher, mentor, surrogate father and drinking buddy at 
New York's Art Student's League in the early '30s. The fact has long been 
known. Until now the relationship tended to be characterized as one where 
Pollock rebeled against a fuddy-duddy teacher. Today it looks different, thanks 
to the exemplary Benton catalogue by Henry Adams and to a controversial recent 
Pollock biography widely read in art circles, "Jackson Pollock: An American 
Saga" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Rolled together, the two books 
and the exhibition show that Benton and his art were intensely modern at bottom 
and that Pollock and his art would have been all but impossible without the 
older man. 
</P>
<P>
There was indeed a kind of mythic Oedipal struggle between them but it was less 
personal than generational, a fact that links both to the larger history of 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Benton led an artificially manufactured back-to-the-roots art movement called 
Regionalism whose other heroes were Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry. People 
loved Benton's salty, pugnacious manner and wrangled delightedly over bold 
murals his detractors called "tabloid art." He once admitted, "I paint 
sometimes to get people to criticize my work." He was so popular in 1934 he 
became the first artist ever to make the cover of Time magazine, leading Andy 
Warhol by decades with an artistic career fueled by publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest Bentons on view at LACMA prove him both talented and urbane. His 
Huck Finn image was always something of a pose. Born in Neosho, Miss., he was 
the great-nephew of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton. His father was an abusive, macho 
local politician who married an ambitious young beauty who goaded the old man 
into running for Congress. He won and young Tom grew up as much in the 
political climate of Washington as anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, he went to Paris where he kept a mistress until his mother came and 
broke it up. He painted his sister Mildred in a realist style with a whiff of 
Gustav Klimt. He worked in the manner of Cezanne, the Impressionists and in the 
abstract "Synchronist" style of his imperious pal Stanton MacDonald Wright. A 
handsome late portrait shows real affection and admiration for his difficult 
old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Serious family financial reverses forced his return to the States. He settled 
into his Hopeful Years in New York where he married Rita Piacenza, who suffered 
his egotism with good grace. She manipulated his career like a maestro. 
Traumatized by the death of his father, he started disappearing on long trips 
into Missouri and the Ozarks. He discovered the Italian 16th-Century mannerist 
Tintoretto. Benton absorbed his style and his method of working from clay 
models. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was meticulous in his working habits. From all this he developed the 
distinctive regionalist style that critics scorned for its Old Master sources. 
Delacroix and Gericault are already in "People of Chilmark." Later, you can see 
the influence of Brueghel and the Flemish Primitives. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II it was all over for Benton. His agrarian America was 
swamped by industrialized suburbia just as today mighty industry has become the 
rust belt and technology is king. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was relegated to the status of a colorful has-been. He was accused of 
being a fascist, even though, in truth, he was a left-wing populist. Then, as 
now, his wrangles with fellow artists such as his arch enemy Stuart Davis took 
on nasty political overtones. In fact, it was only a territorial battle between 
abstract and figurative art, which were seen, respectively, as liberal and 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Benton was accused of being a racist. His paintings of blacks have an element 
of caricature but so do his paintings of everybody. The racist thing rubbed off 
on him from his friend, the critic Thomas Craven, who called photographer and 
Modernist entrepreneur Alfred Stieglitz "a Hoboken Jew without knowledge of or 
interest in the historical American background." 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that Benton was an enthusiastic boozer who -- although married 
with children -- harbored deeply mixed feelings about women and despised 
homosexuals, especially of the arty sort. 
</P>
<P>
When he left New York, disgusted, to return to Missouri in 1935 he wrote, "If 
young gentlemen or old ones either want to wear women's underwear and cultivate 
extraordinary manners it is all right with me. But it is not all right with the 
art they affect and cultivate." 
</P>
<P>
By the '50s, art students were trained to put Benton in the same category of 
popular-artists-to-be-scorned as Norman Rockwell and Andrew Wyeth. Benton, the 
man, hung on until 1975 when he died of a heart attack in his Kansas City 
studio. At 85, he was enjoying something of a revival and had just completed a 
big mural called "The Sources of Country Music." 
</P>
<P>
But the art world's new hero was Pollock. Surely he had learned some of his 
surly macho behavior from Benton. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition makes Benton's fundamental modernity inescapable. A set of large 
studies for "The American Historical Epic" reminds us of El Greco but basically 
the work could not have happened without Cubism. Benton articulated his space 
with curved lines that unite compositions like the snake in the "Laocoon." 
Forms are sculptural but everything pops to the surface as one big 
claustrophobic arabesque. That's where Pollock comes in. He had to have seen 
these pictures and subconsciously transferred the nervous dynamism of their 
basic composition to his famous "drip" paintings. Pollock and Benton shared a 
common compulsiveness. Tom's was wound up tight, Jackson's explosive and 
Dionysiac. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's paintings could not have happened without that quintessential modern 
art form, the movies. There is something of the American pioneer films of Gary 
Cooper and Susan Hayward in the history cycle. "Boomtown" looks like the set 
for some oiler flick with Clark Gable. "Hollywood" is only one of the pictures 
he composed using a cinematic montage technique to cross-cut to related scenes. 
Later he painted Burt Lancaster in "The Kentuckian" and Marlon Brando in 
"Streetcar Named Desire." There's something odd about the whole concept, like a 
novel written after a film. Compared to Edward Hopper's brooding movie palace 
paintings, Benton's seem exhibitionistic and a little jealous. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Benton art comes on like a baroque freight train, it's curiously 
elusive emotionally. There is affection in it but it's like the work of a guy 
who always says, "I love you honey but your feet's too big." Mean around the 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
Benton evokes the whole generation of Depression-era artists from Gropper to 
Shahn and the Soyer brothers. Form is mangled and work seems as haunted as the 
period. A work like "The Hailstorm" is so nightmarish you want to call the 
style "Surregionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has really defined Regionalism according to the feelings it projects. 
It's haunted and inbred like meeting a small-town family whose good manners are 
all about hiding the skeletons in the closet. Benton did two big nudes in 
1938-39. "Persephone" and "Susanna and the Elders." Both deserve the 
contemporary description of one of the pictures as a "skinny-shanked, 
sex-starved Midwest teacher." 
</P>
<P>
In the catalogue Adams links them psychologically to Benton's beautiful 
antiseptic mother and his dirty old dad, but they take on other meanings -- the 
tainted voyeuristic snicker of Erskine Caldwell's novel, "God's Little Acre." 
They transfer Titian's grand manner European style to the Midwest and a great 
erotic tradition takes on a scolding, moralistic tone. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's art is neurotically modern, but it is also inescapable. It broadcasts 
a sense of authenticity to its times and its maker and lends credence to 
President Harry Truman's belief that Benton was "the best damn painter in 
America." His drawing was crabbed but amazingly accurate. He composed complex 
groups of figures with a unity and believability that remains unmatched. No 
artist today with pretensions to making a narrative art can touch him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, how can you hate him? He once said in a public lecture that the tune 
"Pistol Packin' Mama" is "True art." 
</P>
<P>
Why is this important? After all art is just art and paintings is just 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Blissfully, that is what this exhibition and the books prove wrong. Anyone 
interested in culture will be well rewarded for taking the trouble to plow 
through their combined 1,147 pages. Each humanizes its subject while placing 
him in the context of those roiling, complex times surrounding the Great 
Depression. Their art becomes so clearly crucial to their historical moment 
that it is as impossible to imagine the time without them as without Franklin 
D. Roosevelt or Joe Louis. The art so clearly grows from the soil of real 
events that it seems epic. 
</P>
<P>
If all this fails to convince of the central creative and intellectual role of 
the artist in this culture, then it probably can't be done.
