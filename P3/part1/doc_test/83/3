PRESIDENT George Bush and his predecessor, Mr Ronald Reagan, last night
launched their effort to inject a fighting spirit and poll-winning
confidence into the Republican party at the opening of its presidential
convention in Houston, Texas.
Scorning polls showing him 20 points behind Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
challenger, Mr Bush told cheering supporters at a rally that he was going to
make as big a comeback as Harry Truman in 1948.
Mr Reagan, in a speech prepared for the convention, praised Mr Bush as 'a
steady hand on the tiller' who would steer the US through a turbulent time
of change.
Their attempts to rouse Republican spirits came after the convention opened
in hesitant fashion, still with half an eye on the simmering crisis in Iraq
and concerned to settle its own internal battles - especially over abortion
 -without bloodshed.
The convention avoided a potentially divisive public debate on abortion when
abortion rights advocates conceded they did not have the votes to force
discussion of the issue.
After flying in to Houston, Mr Bush told supporters he was itching to take
on his opponents. He noted that Mr Clinton had said he was already planning
his transition into the White House.
'I half expected when I went over to the Oval Office to find him over there
measuring the drapes,' he said. 'Let me say as the first shot out of the
barrel: Put those drapes on hold. It's going to be 'curtain time' for that
ticket.'
Mr Bush also pledged to turn his attention to US domestic problems in a
second term. 'We have changed the world and now we will change America
because America is the land of eternal strength.'
He pledged to produce an economic revival plan which would cut government
spending and use tax incentives 'to get this country moving again'.
To cheers, Mr Bush said: 'Houston, get ready for . . . the most stirring
political comeback since Harry Truman gave'em hell in 1948 . . . It starts
right now.'
Mr Bush also gave one the strongest defences of Vice President Dan Quayle
since some Republicans appealed to him to dump Mr Quayle from the Republic
ticket. 'He has been a super vice president and he will be for another four
years,' Mr Bush said.
In his prepared speech, a combative and nostalgic Mr Reagan said the stakes
were high in the November 3 presidential election and 'we cannot afford to
take a chance.'
'We know President Bush. By his own admission, he is a quiet man, not a
showman,' Mr Reagan said. 'His is a steady hand on the tiller through the
choppy waters of the '90s.'
