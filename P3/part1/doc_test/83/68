<TEXT>

Mystery writers are often so prolific one name isn't enough. Erle Stanley 
Gardner was also A. A. Fair; John Dickson Carr was also Carter Dickson. Barbara 
Nickolae is a Southern California writer who has previously been Nickolae 
Gerstner and Barbara Pronin, which internal evidence suggests is her real name. 
Under any byline, her new Finders Keepers is an unusually expert and clever 
work. Its plotting, while highly improbable in real-world terms, is ingenious, 
eminently readable and suspenseful. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is the Monterey Peninsula. Shannon Buchanan, a young single mother, 
homeless except for her battered car, is arrested and charged with kidnaping. 
The cops say the golden 3-year-old she knows is her daughter is in fact a child 
she kidnaped outside a San Diego store a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The mother's story is shaky. She's made an itinerant living as a waitress and 
sidewalk portrait artist, earning just enough to support herself and young 
Mandy. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Phil Tewkes is moved by Buchanan's anguish. Then again, the San Diego 
parents are sure Mandy is their lost Suzanne. And there seems to be a death 
certificate for the child Buchanan gave birth to. The ambitious district 
attorney and his smooth political aide see the conspicuous case as a nice boost 
toward the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
The book has begun with the murder of a woman, and now a body turns up in 
Monterey Bay. It is linked to the case; the author is drawing in the strands of 
her intricate plot. Buchanan is clearly victim not perpetrator, which makes the 
circumstances of her arrest the more mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolae's unfolding of the complicated back-story is very skillfully handled, 
and the climax -- with its nicely concealed switch -- is grand theater. 
Whatever the artifices of plot, the emotions of mothers and child and entirely 
credible. An admirable debut. 
</P>
<P>
"John Sandford" is said to be the pseudonym of a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist, whose habitat, at a wild guess, is the Minnesota-St. Paul area, 
where Rules of Prey is set. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients are familiar enough: a cat-and-mouse game between a crazily 
smart serial killer and the detective who is trying to nail him. The detective 
is a womanizing bachelor who drives a Porsche, being rich from inventing 
computer games. He's also in constant trouble for killing people (five notches 
so far) in line of duty. Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood rolled into one, 
you'd have to say. 
</P>
<P>
The killer leaves provocative notes on the bodies ("Never carry a weapon after 
it has been used," for example). He's a mild-mannered lawyer, the source of 
whose mania is never really clear except that he seems to be a 97-pound 
weakling who never got in shape. 
</P>
<P>
There is a love interest. Several, actually, including an intended victim who 
got away from the killer, and a television reporter who never heard of 
off-the-record. (On the other hand the detective hands out false information 
without a tremor of guilt.) 
</P>
<P>
Sandford orchestrates the two men's parry-and-thrust with rising tension. The 
killer escapes one trap in a vivid tragical-comical burst of action. The last 
pursuit, colored by a heavy overlay of cynicism, is a rousing cap to a sleek 
production that is a Book-of-the-Month main choice, and seems hand-tailored for 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever her regrets about the singing career that was not to be, Margaret 
Truman has become a first-rate mystery writer. Murder at the Kennedy Center is 
her eighth. Like the others, including the excellent "Murder at the CIA" in 
1987, the new one draws on an I-was-there expertise that makes the Washington 
political scene clang with credibility. 
</P>
<P>
It's presidential nomination time in an unstated near-future year. One of the 
leading Democratic hopefuls, Ken Ewald, is enjoying a gala televised 
fund-raiser at the Kennedy Center. Afterward, a sexy campaign staffer is found 
shot to death in the shrubbery outside. 
</P>
<P>
McKensie Smith, a campaign adviser retired from law practice to teach at 
Georgetown, is dragooned into defending the candidate's son, who is the chief 
suspect. (It was Ewald's gun, and the son had been sleeping with the victim.) 
But nothing, thankfully, is simple. Political espionage, betrayal, blackmail, a 
corn-pone Southern rival, a television evangelist, an opera singer and agents 
of a Panamanian strongman named Morales are all on view. The proceedings are 
well-paced, colorful and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Truman, who took some sharp jabs at the CIA last time, is in "Murder at the 
Kennedy Center" having a trenchant say about the difference between the 
practical politics of compromise and a corrupting cynicism whose only goal is 
power. The Truman book is a Literary Guild main selection. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs are manifestly discovering that crime pays. The profitability may be 
explained partly by the huge success of television's "Murder, She Wrote" and 
the enchanting Angela Lansbury as mystery-writer Jessica Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
Art has now imitated art. Gin and Daggers, as by Jessica Fletcher and Donald 
Bain, is the first of what promises or threatens to be a series of new 
mysteries (apparently not novelizations of show scripts) starring Fletcher as 
first-person narrator. 
</P>
<P>
The setting of "Gin and Daggers" is London and the English country house. 
Jessica, abroad to address a mystery writer's conference, spends a weekend with 
a grande dame, an Agatha Christie-like figure who is found dead, and not by her 
own hand either. Her last book hadn't sounded like her at all. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects include a sullen protege and the author's niece, among others. At its 
least successful, the book struggles to pay obeisance to the show by having 
Fletcher's pals, including the sheriff, from Cabot Cove, fly in unannounced to 
help her. The book is a cut above most novelizations but well shy of Ruth 
Rendell terrain: a tightly focused fan work. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Fleming wrote as a hedonist who prospered by dramatizing a life's worth of 
fantasies -- acquisitions, indulgences, guilt-free sex and violence. John 
Gardner writes in Win, Lose or Die as a military affairs reporter who describes 
the operations of a Harrier VTOL aircraft as lovingly as Fleming described 
Pussy Galore. Gardner is long on facts, short on feelings. 
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth of the counterfeit James Bonds by Gardner, who is no kin 
stylistically or otherwise to the late American writer of the same name. Bond 
is back on Navy duty aboard a ship where Bush, Gorbachev and Thatcher are to 
hold arms-reduction talks. M, and possibly Q and R, know that there is to be a 
terrorist attack on the ship with the aim of holding the three world leaders 
for several zillion dollars in ransom. The terrorizing group, BAST, is a 
private enterprise of generally Middle Eastern persuasion but no known 
theological ties. Its leader, who intends to dispose of practically everyone, 
is as colorless a supervillain as ever Bond has faced. Call him Drabfinger. 
</P>
<P>
Bond couples predictably if distractedly with three ladies, two of them are 
wiped out almost instantly. He does a commendable dogfight with one of the 
terrorist's minions in a matching Harrier. But it is all so unamusing and 
juicelessly programmatic. The persistence of the series, despite these pallid 
copyings, is the ultimate tribute to the richness of Fleming's original 
invention.
