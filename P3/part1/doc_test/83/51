The most significant fact about President Clinton's state of the union
address is what it did not say. We all know it was mainly devoted to a
detailed economic programme for tackling the budget deficit; some people
even think the programme looks plausible. What has been less noticed is that
this economic programme was almost the only subject in the speech. There was
virtually no reference to the international scene, and certainly nothing to
suggest that President Clinton has a foreign policy, or even feels the need
of one.
This would be consistent with Mr Clinton's campaign rhetoric, but it is a
remarkable break with tradition.
It is instructive to glance back at Mr Clinton's predecessors, and at what
each of them said in his first state of the union speech. It turns out that
almost all of them, going back as far as the second world war, devoted
considerable time to foreign policy. As you would expect, George Bush went
on at length about the international scene - Panama, Poland, East Germany,
and the European allies. Ronald Reagan expatiated on nuclear arms control
with the Soviet Union, Star Wars, Nicaragua and Afghanistan, not to mention
the European allies.
Jimmy Carter talked about a new international order, human rights, nuclear
arms control, Middle East, Poland, and the European allies. Gerald Ford
delivered a long section on international relations, including communist
countries, nuclear arms control, the developing world, and the European
allies. Richard Nixon spoke of the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union, nuclear
arms control and the European allies. President Johnson talked about
disarmament, east-west relations, and the European allies. John Kennedy
spoke of Vietnam, the Congo, the Soviet Union and China, and the European
allies. President Eisenhower talked of defence, the Korean War, and the
European allies.
President Clinton's was quite different. In two brief paragraphs he makes
perfunctory nods in the direction of the generalities of America's
traditional aspirations as a great power; but the passage contains not a
single specific. The US needs a restructured defence to deal with new
threats of the post-cold war world; the US has responsibilities as the
world's only superpower; the US must be prepared to lead a world challenged
by ethnic conflict, by proliferation of weapons, by the global environment.
But there is no hint of what are the real foreign policy objectives of the
new administration. Nor is there any mention of a single foreign country by
name. In particular, there is no reference, direct or indirect, to the
European allies.
To find a general US policy declaration which is as domestic as this, you
have to go back to Harry Truman in 1945. There may be a reason for the
similarity. Truman was bringing the boys home from a world war; Clinton has
probably grasped, and welcomed, the implications of the end of the cold war.
Foreign policy is expensive. In wartime it is an essential ingredient of
government. But in peacetime you do not need so much of it.
The optional characteristic of foreign policy in peacetime is particularly
applicable to the US, because it is now virtually invulnerable to
aggression. During the cold war America was in permanent danger because of
the nuclear confrontation in Europe. Today that threat has almost vanished.
America's European allies face new and serious risks of conflict, including
those in the former Yugoslavia and the disintegrating Russian empire. But
these risks need not affect the US, unless the US chooses; and if Mr Clinton
has his way, the US will not choose.
Some will object that the actions of the new administration already belie
its words. President Clinton may prefer to stay at home; but in practice he
has been goaded willy-nilly into taking the leadership of the Euro-UN peace
process for Bosnia. The world needs America to lead, so President Clinton is
obliged to do his duty.
The world is being taken in by a public relations exercise. True, President
Clinton could not categorically turn down the pressing pleas of the
Owen-Vance mediators; but he agreed to take part only on terms which
virtually guarantee to stalemate the peace process.
When the US says it might, after all, be prepared to use force in Bosnia,
the world is impressed and relieved. The small print tells a different
story. The US will use force only to back up an agreement, but no such
agreement is in sight. The US will support a peace plan, but not the
Vance-Owen peace plan. Yet Vance-Owen set the agenda for all other plans.
Vance-Owen would require the Serbs to surrender much of the territory they
have captured. Any different plan should in justice require them to
surrender even more. But Washington's first step has been to submit the
Bosnia peace process to the Russians, who are Serbia's most powerful allies.
In short, the Washington shift probably reduces the (already minimal) chance
that the peace process could lead to an agreement which might be enforced.
What we have instead is US 'leadership', because that is what the rest of
the world demands, but it is the kind of leadership which is designed to
lead nowhere.
Europe will have cause to reflect that it does not rate a mention in
President Clinton's first state of the union speech. Already under Bush it
was clear that the US did not intend to take responsibility for Europe's new
disorders, let alone for the peaceful reconstruction of the ex-Soviet
empire. We may now need to come to terms with the idea that Mr Clinton
really does intend to put the US economy first, second and third.
