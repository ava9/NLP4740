<TEXT>

Oh, that we had elected a facsimile of Harry Truman! He wasn't about to let 
countless American youths be slaughtered invading an alien land, not when he 
had an ace up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
He carried a big stick and he used it. May our current leader love our young 
that much should all hell break loose!
