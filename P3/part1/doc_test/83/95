BUT IN DEALING WITH HAFEZ ASSAD, WE MUST NOT PRETEND THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS

<P>
It is no criticism of the Bush Administration to note that it has been driven 
by circumstances, persuaded by allies and tempted by short-range needs to 
accept -- even to solicit -- collaborators whose record and whose morality are 
no better than the enemy against whom we now mobilize. Franklin Roosevelt 
welcomed Josef Stalin into the alliance against Nazi Germany. Harry Truman 
included unpalatable regimes in the alliances he constructed to contain Stalin. 
Jimmy Carter accepted Omar Torrijos as his partner for Panama and Pakistan as a 
helpmate to turn back the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan first 
"tilted" to Iraq and eventually sold weapons to Iran. Now, Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III and the Bush Administration seek to cement Syria into the 
coalition marshaled against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
World politics has forever driven governments to make alliances based on 
convenience and necessity as well as shared moral principles. It is generally 
believed that a government that wholly eschews Realpolitik can neither long 
play a significant role in world affairs nor serve its own moral goals. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing aggression, constructing new collective security arrangements, helping 
maintain independence and order, protecting world access to Middle East oil all 
require active collaboration with non-democratic governments, many of whose 
principles and practices do not meet Western standards. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible for the United States to pursue a politics of the greater good 
and the lesser evil and still remain true to fundamental American principles, 
providing that we face what we are doing and not pretend that our new, unsavory 
ally has suddenly changed his nature. 
</P>
<P>
Western governments still believe that it was reasonable to tilt toward Saddam 
Hussein's government when the Ayatollah Khomeini's forces threatened to defeat 
Iraq. But helping Hussein develop weapons of mass destruction was another 
matter. So was turning a blind eye to Iraq's use of poison gas against Iranians 
and Kurds. Realpolitik did not require that the United States and the West 
condemn Israel for the destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor. To the contrary, 
realism required that the United States and the West face the fact that Israel 
was acting in self-defense and in the process benefiting the region. 
Realpolitik did not require or even permit the United States or others to 
pretend that Hussein had become "some sort of moderate by some sort of 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, because we did not warn Hussein against aggression but repeatedly 
affirmed that the United States had no alliance or commitment to Kuwait, 
Hussein had no opportunity to realistically assess the probable consequences of 
seizing Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Those errors are now behind us. But the mind-set responsible for them lives on 
and threatens now to distort American policy toward Syria, whose leader has 
killed as many people as Hussein has as brutally but more cleverly subverted 
and conquered a neighboring Arab nation, and who, moreover, has direct ties to 
terrorist attacks on Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It is the famous "Arabist" mind-set that is common in the State Department's 
Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and in the foreign offices of Europe. The bureau 
is peopled by intelligent, industrious specialists on the language, culture, 
history and politics of the Arab World. Many of them have learned to view the 
world through the eyes of those whom they have studied and all too often have 
come to feel a unique indulgence toward Arab strongmen, a special irritation 
with Israel and a sense that U.S. concerns with democracy and human rights are 
not quite relevant to their area. 
</P>
<P>
This "clientism," often the other side of the coin of area expertise, distorts 
U.S. policy, especially with regard to Iraq, Syria, the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The same tendency that led the State Department to conclude that the PLO had 
renounced terrorism and ignored evidence of Hussein's impending aggression may 
lead it now to become more entangled with Hafez Assad than is either necessary 
or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
It may already have led them to underestimate the danger that violent PLO 
neighbors constitute for Israel and to recommend tacit, offstage linkage of the 
Israeli/Palestinian issue to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
International politics may sometimes justify or even require an alliance with 
unpalatable leaders or regimes. It never justifies asking unreasonable risks of 
a democratic ally such as Israel or forgetting that the United States' 
permanent interests lie with democracy and the democracies.
