The life of a black celebrity is perilous enough, but the black celebrity who 
becomes a spokesperson is asking for pure hell. Not only has the outspokenness 
of those regarded as radicals gotten them into trouble, but as Gary Giddins' 
recent book "Satchmo" (Doubleday), revealed, even a non-radical like Louis 
Armstrong could come into conflict with the American secret police for his 
criticisms of Eisenhower's handling of segregation in the South. 
</P>
<P>
If Paul Robeson had fulfilled the role that American society had prepared for 
him -- that of a patriotic token, lecturing the underclass of his time about 
their "slovenly" habits and exhibiting by his efforts that with hard work and 
determination one could achieve anything in this land of opportunity -- he'd 
probably still be around, delighting audiences with his spirituals and playing 
"Othello" in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
But Robeson broke out of his role. He chose to use his celebrity status as a 
platform for speaking out against the injustices of the oppressed all over the 
world, and especially of blacks at home. For his efforts, he was hounded by his 
enemies into physical and mental breakdown; and, in one of those Orwellian 
ironies that black life in America accumulates, this man, who was persecuted 
from the early '40s until his death in 1976, was diagnosed as having a 
persecution complex. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, at the height of America's Cold War hysteria, the State Department 
lifted his passport, lowering an iron curtain on his opportunity to earn a 
living abroad. Not only did J. Edgar Hoover's FBI become part of the Robeson 
family, it seems, devoting more resources to the investigation of one black 
singer,actor and intellectual, during the '40s and '50s, than to investigating 
organized crime, but even the Communist Party sent an informant, posing as a 
bodyguard, to spy on Robeson. Though Robeson was sympathetic to some Communist 
causes, he never joined the Party and was never brought under its discipline. 
He once refused its order that he be silent. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson's father, the Rev. William Drew Robeson, who had escaped from slavery 
in 1850, at age 15, was forced out of his New Jersey ministry and into poverty, 
punished by the white elders of the presbytery for his tendency to speak out 
against social injustice. In later years, when Robeson himself was subjected to 
vitriolic abuse from the press and the government, a family friend would 
comment: "They did it to his father." 
</P>
<P>
Robeson graduated from Rutgers where he excelled as an athlete and in 1921 
married Eslanda Cardozo Goode, whose great-grandfather was Isaac Nunez Cardozo, 
a member of a Spanish-Jewish family, and whose grandfather, Francis Lewis 
Cardozo, was described by Henry Ward Beecher as "the most highly educated Negro 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Duberman's excessive and voyeuristic detail about Robeson's 
"multiplicity of romantic and sexual encounters," details which degrade an 
otherwise useful, fine and well-researched biography, Robeson and his wife 
remained companions until her death from cancer in 1965. A serious rift between 
the two occurred after the publication of her book, "Paul Robeson, Negro," in 
which she alluded to his affairs and described him as lazy. (Throughout the 
book, whenever there's a dispute between Robeson and his wife about a fact, 
Duberman sides with Essie Robeson.) 
</P>
<P>
A C-student at Columbia Law School, Robeson stumbled into an acting career in 
1920, appearing in some dreadful thing called "Taboo," in which, typically, 
Afro-American religion was subjected to the usual ignorant stereotyping. 
"Taboo" was written by what Duberman describes as a "fashionable young white 
socialite" named Mary Hoyt Wiborg, daughter of a wealthy financier, Frank 
Wiborg. (Throughout his life, Robeson would roam around freely among different 
classes, from the Australian aborigines, whose treatment he bitterly criticized 
during his stay in Australia, to the denizens of the English court.) Though 
Duberman provides testimony from some of the many he interviewed that Robeson 
regretted his lack of acting and singing training, he received high praise for 
his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson would be criticized for playing such trashy roles throughout his 
career. He appeared in "Show Boat," "The Emperor Jones," "Tales of Manhattan" 
and "Sanders of the River" (which Jomo Kenyatta, one of the performers (!), 
praised). Robeson hated his film roles and was evidently duped sometimes by the 
usual promise of control over the script, or perhaps saw himself as paving the 
way for a succeeding generation of black film actors, who he felt would have it 
better (to no avail, since some of today's black actors take roles that make 
Robeson's role in "The Emperor Jones" seem majestic). Even the role of 
"Othello" was demeaning, Shakespeare's Moor being a little more dignified than 
"The Emperor Jones" but still a gullible half-cannibal who constantly berates 
himself for his inferiority to the Venetians and who takes no offense when they 
call him racist names. At any rate, by the 1930s, Robeson had bitterly 
denounced both "Sanders in the River" and "The Emperor Jones." Robeson 
evidently had more freedom when he performed in movies by black film maker 
Oscar Micheaux and in an experimental film entitled "Borderline." One of 
"Borderline's" producers was a founder of modern poetry, and a feminist, Hilda 
Doolittle. In the film, he appeared with his wife, Essie. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson's concert career was as controversial as his film and stage careers. 
Zora Neale Hurston accused him of corrupting the original intent of the folk 
song's creators, and of pandering to white audiences. Others, arguing that he 
limited his range by singing the songs of the black proletariat, urged him to 
attempt "serious" European music. The ever-culturally conservative black middle 
class was offended by his songs and by his politics. Some of the most scorching 
criticisms of his left-leaning views emanated from the black press, but the 
black press didn't have the power to persecute him as relentlessly as the white 
press did. 
</P>
<P>
It was the white press that stirred up violent passions against him for 
appearing in Eugene O'Neill's "All God's Chillun Got Wings" opposite a white 
actress, and it was the white press that created the atmosphere for an ugly 
civil disturbance which took place in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1947, where Robeson 
had gone to perform for a benefit. And it was a white American wire service 
that distorted a key political speech that Robeson made in Paris, a smear that 
led Robeson's enemies to declare open season on him and NBC to ban him from its 
air waves. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Robeson was a victim of the experiential difference 
between blacks and whites, a gap which, according to a recent NAACP poll, still 
exists. The black experience, when not ignored, is arrogantly dismissed as the 
"paranoid" imputing of conspiratorial views that aren't there. Based upon his 
often-humiliating experience -- especially in the area of public accommodations 
-- and of his observations about black life in the United States, Robeson's 
version of American political reality was deeply different from that of 
powerful white men in the government, who considered him ornery for pointing 
out that the human rights violations, which they hypocritically condemned 
abroad, also existed at home. He once got into a heated argument with Harry 
Truman in the White House about such contradictions. Truman responded to 
Robeson's un-paranoid plea for anti-lynching legislation by ending the 
interview. Truman later included Robeson in a "gang" that he claimed he'd 
defeated. Eleanor Roosevelt's view of Robeson was similar to Truman's. 
</P>
<P>
Duberman's book indicates that Robeson could have made it easier for himself 
had he recanted his support for the Soviet Union, something that he refused to 
do. His support for the Soviet Union has always baffled many. Robeson was 
warned by Emma Goldman in the 1930s that the Russian Revolution had its cruel 
side. And even after the purges, the Soviet Nazi pact, the invasion of Hungary, 
the revelations about genocide committed by Stalin, Robeson remained loyal, 
shrugging off every criticism of a country he regarded as an ideal, color-blind 
worker's paradise. He must have known, after partying with Khrushchev and his 
friends in their private lodges, that some Communists live much better than 
others. He was himself a cultural nationalist, but apparently took little note 
of the fact that the Soviets had attempted to eradicate the cultures of Latvia, 
Estonia and Lithuania. One wonders how Robeson would have reacted to glasnost, 
perestroika, the appeal for Western capital, the experiments with private 
enterprise, and the mass murders committed by Soviet forces in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson was again permitted to travel abroad thanks to a Supreme Court decision 
in 1958 for which William O. Douglas wrote the majority decision, declaring 
that "The passport division had no right to demand that an applicant sign an 
affidavit concerning membership in the Communist Party." Ill health forced him 
to return to the United States. During the last years of his life, he was 
honored by a generation of civil rights workers whose coming his career had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed attitudes with which his country viewed the career of Robeson -- a 
man both praised and damned in his native land, and a man who had the courage 
to articulate in public ideas most confine to their thoughts -- didn't end at 
his death. Last year, in New York, "A Celebration of Paul Robeson" was held. 
Among the sponsors were American Express, General Electric, ITT, Philip Morris, 
Mrs. Vincent Astor, and The Rockefeller Group.
