for number of refugees

Blaming the upsurge in the number of Haitians fleeing their country on 'the
illegitimate military regime's repression', US secretary of state Warren
Christopher yesterday insisted that diplomatic and economic pressure would
succeed in driving out the military leaders who ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago.
'The longer the tragic situation continues, the harder it will become for
those wealthy people who have propped up the dictatorship. In particular,
the more protracted the crisis, the more tenuous is the future of the
Haitian military,' Mr Christopher told the Senate foreign relations
committee yesterday.
Over 2,500 Haitians have been picked up by the US Coast Guard in the last
four days, fleeing to the US in small and often home-made boats and
threatening to swamp the refugee processing system the administration has
set up in Jamaica.
The Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to allow the US to set up another
processing centre and President Bill Clinton has decided to re-open a
refugee camp at the US Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba - a solution
adopted by former President George Bush before he decided simply to
repatriate all Haitians picked up at sea.
Mr Christopher's insistance that the exodus was caused by the military
regime's repression was designed to head off criticism that the
administration had virtually invited Haitians to flee by conveying the
impression that they stood a better chance of winning asylum at the new
processing centre in Jamaica than in the three centres already operating in
Haiti.
The administration has also tried to ratchet up its sanctions on the regime
of the military leader, Gen Raoul Cedras. Earlier this week, it revoked
almost all visas held by Haitians, to reinforce its existing ban on
commercial flights to and from Haiti.
Mr Christopher's comments came as part of a wide-ranging discussion of US
foreign policy issues before a panel of senators, many of whom were visibly
worried at the prospect that the US might tire of waiting for sanctions to
work, and turn to military force to restore Mr Aristide.
'All we are hearing is invasion, invasion, invasion,' grumbled Senator Jesse
Helms, the extreme right-winger from North Carolina who is the senior
Republican on the foreign relations committee.
Mr Christopher won applause - rare and welcome in recent months, when the
administration's foreign policy team has been under steady attack for
inconsistency and indecisiveness - from both Mr Helms and Senator Claiborne
Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the committee.
'I'd like to commend the president and the secretary for the steady hand
they have exercised at the tiller of the foreign policy ship of state. . .
We have not been goaded into an untimely, unwise use of force, whether in
North Korea or Haiti or Bosnia, that would have jeopardised American lives
for an uncertain outcome,' Mr Pell said.
Mr Christopher said his efforts were focused not just on immediate problems
but on 'what I believe to be the most important contribution that I can make
to American foreign policy': the creation of long-term relationships and
structures to last beyond short-term uncertainties that he likened to those
facing President Harry Truman and secretary of state Dean Acheson at the end
of the second world war.
'They met the challenge of reconstruction after world war II, and we are
meeting the challenge of reconstruction in the post-cold war period now,' Mr
Christopher said.
