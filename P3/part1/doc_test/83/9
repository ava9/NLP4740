THE vagaries of the Electoral College make presidential elections seem more
decisive than they really are. Even in the closest of the 12 post-war
contests, the winner was a clear 57 ahead in the 538-member electoral
college.
On average, the margin of victory has been 267 - a landslide of more than
two to one. This has been in spite of the fact that the average lead in the
popular vote has been less then 10 per cent and that there have been four
close calls out of the last 12 races - in 1948, 1960, 1968 and 1976.
The reason lies in the surprising uniformity of electoral behaviour in the
US. In 1988, only Utah and the District of Columbia were more than 10 per
cent away from the national result.
More important, seven of the eight largest states had a vote that was within
3 per cent of the national figure. To adapt the old Maine adage - as one
state goes, so go the rest.
However, the fact that the votes in each state are always cast en bloc means
that the candidates focus their attention on the large states. The three
electoral college votes of Delaware or Wyoming are most unlikely to decide
the outcome. But the 54 votes of California or the 32 of Texas could easily
settle a close race.
The electoral college does offer the possibility of a perverse result. In
1876 and 1888, the candidate with fewer votes won. It would always be
theoretically possible for a candidate who lost in half the states by large
margins, and won the rest by a hair's breadth, to win with only 40 per cent
of the popular vote. But the law of averages rules that out.
In recent elections, anyone who secured 49 per cent of the popular vote
could be assured of a majority in the electoral college - even though there
does seem to be a slight Republican bias in the system: 49.5 per cent of the
popular vote would usually have given victory to their candidate. However
the chances of the loser in the popular vote emerging as president are very
small.
The US is thought to have two-party politics. But, in every recent election,
ten or more presidential candidates have been on the ballot, ranging from
Liberation to Communist.
This year the Mahareshi's Natural Law party has joined the gaggle of
no-hopers who together will share less than 1 per cent of the vote. However,
in the half century before Ross Perot's interventon there have been four
third party candidates who have been taken seriously, at least as spoilers.
In 1948, Harry Truman faced rebellion both from the Dixiecrat right of his
party and from the fellow-travelling left. In 1968, George Wallace offered
the most substantial of segregationist challenges and, in 1980, John
Anderson supplied an honourable centrist alternative to the inadequacies of
the major party contenders.
But all these attempts to buck the system faded as the campaign advanced,
bringing the real choice to the voters.
In theory, the Perot intervention could decide the 1992 election; in
practice this is most improbable. On current opinion polls Perot will not
top 10 per cent - 5 per cent is probably nearer the mark. His votes will be
drawn from both sides, hurting Bush more in the South (particularly in Texas
and Florida) and Clinton more in California and some of the industrial
states.
However, the net difference in any state is unlikely to exceed 2 or 3 per
cent; since it will work both ways, the chances of its being decisive
nationally are very low.
Inside the Beltway at least, Republicans are looking to the British analogy.
They are imitating the Conservative tax advertisements of last March and
they are dreaming of the late surge that, it is alleged, snatched victory
for John Major from the jaws of defeat.
They also hope that the opinion polls may be as systematically erroneous
across the US as they proved to be in the UK.
There is little evidence to support such wishful thinking. The veteran
George Bush is not not the new arrived John Major. The historical baggage of
the Democrats is much lighter than that carried by the British Labour Party.
Late swings can happen. In 1948, it seems, one did save Harry Truman. In
1980, another gave Ronald Reagan his landslide.
Therefore, with 19 days to go this year, the pundits are keeping their
fingers crossed. But, at the moment, there is nothing in the opinion polls -
and certainly nothing in the electoral system - which can offer substantial
comfort to the Republicans who want to believe that George Bush can pull off
a John Major.
