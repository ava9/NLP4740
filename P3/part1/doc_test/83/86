<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "When the Economy Is </F>
Flourishing, Congress Gives a Standing Ovation"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Bill Clinton arrived at the podium in 
the House of Representatives to deliver his first State of the 
Union message at the height of his popularity, like an 
experienced sportsman who, while making minor slipups on the 
way, skillfully peaks in time for the crucial competition. 
  Figures that have just been published show that at the end 
of 
his first year Clinton has outstripped even such a revered 
President as Ronald Reagan. 
  There is no doubt that the number of those who approve of 
Clinton's activities in the White House will increase following 
his well-judged and passionate speech which met with applause, 
ovations, or whistles of approval on at least 63 occasions. 
Clinton thanked Congress for all the achievements of the first 
year of his presidency, which make a rather impressive picture. 
It was on the legislators -- the people who who almost wrecked 
his budget (it was passed by one vote), all but consigned to 
oblivion the program to change the tax system and reduce the 
state debt, and furiously resisted restrictions on the use of 
weapons (the Brady law) -- that the President bestowed his 
special thanks, his final sentence sounding amazingly 
convincing: "Not once did I use my presidential veto," Clinton 
said, meaning that the combination of firmness and compromises 
that characterizes the administration made extreme measures 
unnecessary. 
  Economic growth, which some perspicacious experts predicted 
back in the final months of Bush's presidency, is now a 
statistical fact. Clinton pointed to production growth, the 
increasing number of jobs, the low interest rate, and increased 
consumer confidence. "For the first time since Harry Truman we 
will have had three consecutive deficit-free years and the 
dollar will have stayed where it is," the President said, 
prompting the one of the longest ovations. 
  Clinton stressed that all this was achieved without raising 
taxes for the vast majority of the population, and, above all, 
without placing an extra burden on the backbone of society -- 
the middle class. "Only the very rich, only 1.2 percent of the 
population, will pay higher taxes; no one else, and that is a 
fact," the President said. 
  Noting that many politicians in Washington had recommended 
him to continue the policy of cutting defense expenditure this 
year, Clinton said that he had rejected that approach: In the 
new budget for fiscal 1994-1995 the U.S. armed forces will not 
receive any less money than in the previous year. 
  Addressing not so much the legislators as the ordinary 
people 
who put him in the White House, Clinton mapped out a tough 
schedule for the next campaign, on which he is certainly pinning 
the future of his presidency -- a statewide health program.
