In the months leading up to last October's general election, some senior
members of the Liberal party quietly began to plot the downfall of their
leader, Mr Jean Chretien.
Mr Chretien had been a big disappointment in the three years since he won
the party leadership. He had failed to capitalise on the unpopularity of Mr
Brian Mulroney's Conservative government.
The opposition leader's heavily-accented English and less-than-perfect
French helped fuel the impression that he was out of his depth. His
fellow-Quebeckers had not forgotten or forgiven his role as justice minister
in outflanking the francophone province's separatist government during
constitutional talks in the early 1980s.
However, the dissatisfaction has evaporated since the Liberals' election
victory. The would-be plotters are now senior cabinet ministers. Most
Canadians - including non-Liberals - have come to regard their new prime
minister with respect, and even with quiet affection.
Mr Chretien's down-to-earth manner and his common sense approach to
government are a sharp contrast to Mr Mulroney's regal style. They have
proved an effective antidote to the revulsion felt by many Canadians against
their politicians and the political process.
Mr Patrick Gossage, a Toronto public relations consultant who has close
links with the Liberals, describes Mr Chretien as 'somebody who is by nature
not the slightest bit puffed-up, arrogant or self-satisfied'. Referring to
his home town in rural Quebec, Mr Chretien calls himself 'the little guy
from Shawinigan'. He has eschewed the official, armour-plated Cadillac
limousine used by Mr Mulroney for a taxi-like Chevrolet Caprice.
Mr Chretien is sometimes compared to former US President Harry Truman. But
like Mr Truman, the Canadian leader's folksy style masks a finely-honed
political compass.
Aged 60, Mr Chretien is one of Canada's most experienced politicians. He
celebrated his 30th anniversary as an MP last year, and his cabinet
experience stretches back to 1967.
He held almost every senior portfolio in the 1970s and early 1980s when Mr
Pierre Trudeau was prime minister. At times of despair in the Liberal camp
over the past few years, Mr Chretien's supporters would take solace that,
for all his drawbacks, their leader had never been tarred by a major mistake
or by scandal.
Since the start of last year's election campaign, Mr Chretien has steered
clear of the debate on Quebec sovereignty by insisting that the Liberals'
top priority is to create jobs, not squabble about the constitution.
But as another poll in Quebec draws nearer, he will find it increasingly
difficult to remain above the fray.
Like Mr Trudeau, his mentor, Mr Chretien has never made any secret of his
disdain for Quebec separatists. But in contrast to Mr Trudeau's coldly
logical arguments in favour of a united Canada, Mr Chretien wears his
patriotism on his sleeve.
'Whatever happens, I am personally convinced that it is possible to be a
proud Quebecker and a proud Canadian at the same time,' he wrote in his
recent autobiography. 'Far from being exclusive, they are complementary, for
without Canada Quebec cannot survive.'
Mr Chretien recalls his 93-year old father saying after the separatists'
defeat in the 1980 sovereignty referendum: 'I can die now, the Liberals are
back in power and Quebec will remain in Canada.'
Such views have not been popular, however, in Quebec where Mr Chretien is
portrayed in the media and by influential intellectuals as a bumbling Uncle
Tom.
According to a recent opinion poll in the Globe and Mail newspaper, almost
two-thirds of Quebeckers think the prime minister should remain neutral in
the looming battle over the province's place in Canada. However, it would be
out of character if he did so.
