THE US Congress reconvenes in Washington today for a final session that is
likely to see more jockeying for political position than efforts to enact
legislation.
With a fiercely fought presidential election entering its closing stages - a
last flurry of campaigning traditionally launched during yesterday's Labor
Day holiday - the tussle between the Democratic-controlled Congress and
Republican President George Bush has already assumed a central role in the
contest.
Mr Bush yesterday continued his campaign attack on the 'gridlocked
Democratic Congress', which he blames for not passing his legislative
proposals. The topics on which he and Congress are likely to clash in the
next few weeks include the North American free trade agreement (Nafta),
which some leading Democrats fear could cost US jobs; the mismanagement of
federal disaster relief to Florida and Louisiana in the wake of last month's
Hurricane Andrew; and a bill to guarantee the same rights to choose an
abortion as are currently protected by the Supreme Court's Roe vs Wade
decision.
In his battle against Congress, Mr Bush has sought to don the mantle of
President Harry Truman, whose come-from-behind victory in 1948, with a
campaign against the 'do-nothing Congress', has become his favourite
reference.
But Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate who in recent opinion
polls leads the incumbent president by a margin of between 6 and 15
percentage points, yesterday hit back with a visit to President Truman's
hometown of Independence, Missouri.
The visit was designed to remind voters that Mr Truman was a Democrat and
that the Congress he railed against was controlled by Republicans.
