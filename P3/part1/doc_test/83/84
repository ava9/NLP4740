GETTING HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE LEFT-OUT MILLIONS; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS, NOT GOVERNMENT, SHOULD BE THE SOURCE

One of America's oldest public-policy debates involves the question of how to 
provide access to health insurance. The debate on national health insurance has 
ebbed and flowed since President Harry Truman first proposed Medicare in 1948. 
In 1989 the issue is coming to flood tide again. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because 37 million Americans have no health insurance. They are eligible 
for neither Medicare nor Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California), and they 
have no private coverage. They go about their lives trying not to get sick, 
wondering what will happen to them if they do. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 37 million without insurance, 5.5 million live in California. Almost 3 
million of them have jobs, yet still have no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Something must be done for these people. Their circumstances are potentially 
disastrous, for there is no longer an adequate public "safety net" to care for 
them. County clinics and county hospitals are seriously overloaded and 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
To find reasonable solutions even for a part of this problem, we must examine 
the history of health insurance in America. Clearly, it always has been 
employment-based; health insurance is a benefit for 200 million Americans 
because family breadwinners have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds like good news. It is not. 
</P>
<P>
The number of those covered by health insurance is shrinking. Since 1984, the 
percentage of working Californians who have no health insurance through their 
jobs has risen from less than 15% to more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable to have an incomplete system that leaves people out, and 
steadily continues to leave more people out. The 60-year-old pact between 
business and government -- to provide health insurance in exchange for tax 
benefits -- must be reexamined to determine if it is still viable. 
</P>
<P>
There are two options: Restore the vitality of the employment-based system or 
abandon employment-based health insurance and replace it with government-based 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly prefer the first solution. To that end, I have introduced a bill in 
the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It will stimulate the employment-based system in California and re-start its 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what the bill does: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requires everyone who employs five or more persons more than half time to 
provide them health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requires only essential health benefits such as physician care, acute 
hospital care, laboratory and X-ray services, maternity care and limited mental 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The bill relies entirely on the private sector. It calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No government cost. 
</P>
<P>
As is typical with important legislative endeavors, there are still problems to 
be worked out. The health-insurance market, especially for small businesses, 
has been so disrupted by high costs that coverage often is unobtainable. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry recognizes this, and is working to develop new 
underwriting rules for small employer pools that will improve both availability 
and affordability. When these are perfected, California law must provide 
protections that will make them work. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to contain health- care costs. Physicians and hospital 
managers acknowledge this and are prepared to accept further refinements of the 
changes made by the Legislature in 1982 that encourage competition among 
health-care providers. Those reforms have proved that competition works better 
than regulation to contain health-care inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The success of those reforms, confirmed by a RAND Corp./UCLA study in 1988, 
persuade me that a private solution is the better solution. It will be more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
It is simply a fact that California's government has no money with which to 
build a government-based system to improve the public "safety net." It is a 
more important fact that employers, insurers and health-care providers want a 
private solution and are ready to work to find it. 
</P>
<P>
I am convinced that the elusive political moment to solve this health insurance 
problem is at hand. Requiring employers to provide insurance is not 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of California's employers, large and small, already provide health 
protection for their employees. Asking all to participate only levels the 
playing field. It creates fair competition in every business and industry. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation I am proposing asks California's business community to decide 
finally whether it wants to renew its 60-year-long commitment to 
employment-based health insurance or to relinquish it. 
</P>
<P>
After that question is fully debated and fairly answered, those who must make 
public policy can move forward constructively. We cannot continue to leave 5.5 
million Californians out of the health system.
