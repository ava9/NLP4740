Democratic leaders took the offensive today against President Bush's high 
approval ratings, accusing the President of broken promises and timid 
leadership and vowing to end his "free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice presidential nominee on the party's 
losing 1988 ticket, told the Democratic Leadership Council that Bush's campaign 
pledge of no new taxes has become "pure Bushlips." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said the Administration has proposed an array of "crypto-taxes" such as 
user fees, surcharges and other levies. He also accused Bush of being too 
worried about public opinion to help emerging democracies around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine Harry Truman hesitating to unveil the Truman Doctrine or the 
Marshall Plan or the Berlin Airlift because he feared public opinion polls? Can 
you imagine John Kennedy doing a poll before he dealt with the Cuban missile 
crisis?" Bentsen asked. 
</P>
<P>
The same theme was sounded by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely as our principles and values are prevailing throughout the world, 
America's trumpet is sounding an uncertain note," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The often-fractious Democrats were trying to play down their differences today 
as two major party groups met in separate cities to plot strategy for their 
next attempt to recapture the White House. 
</P>
<P>
While the leadership council, dominated by elected officials, met in New 
Orleans, the Democratic National Committee was meeting in Indianapolis.
