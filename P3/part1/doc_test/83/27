Believe it or not - and after Tuesday's Massacre of the Democrats, it
requires some stretching of the imagination - there are serious people
arguing that Bill Clinton is potentially in better shape today than since he
became president. More remarkably, some of these people are Republicans,
whose joy at their victories in the mid-term elections should be unalloyed.
They draw on the lesson of 1948, when President Harry Truman, saddled with a
Republican landslide two years earlier, won re-election by campaigning
against the 'do-nothing Congress'.
The contemporary analogy was provided by a senior member of the Reagan
administration on polling night: 'If the Republicans were to lead the
majorities (in Congress) the way they've led the minorities, they would be
in trouble. They'd give Clinton a target to run against in 1996 - and though
he might not be a skilled chief executive, he sure is a skilled politician.
And it is not as if they speak with one voice.'
On Tuesday night, even Newt Gingrich, the slash-and - burn conservative
Republican from Georgia who stands to be the next Speaker of the House,
sounded for the first time a little awed by what lay ahead, promising
co-operation rather than confrontation with the White House. He went so far
as to speak relatively kindly of his fellow Republican Robert Dole, majority
leader in the next Senate who is only occasionally an ideological bedfellow.
The Republican sweep was impressive, with control of the House for the first
time in 40 years, of the Senate for the first time in eight, and with at
least eight Democratic governors evicted.
Oliver North and Michael Huffington, poster boys of the alienated hard
right, lost in Virginia and California and Ted Kennedy won in Massachusetts.
But otherwise the cull of famous Democrats was large: Mario Cuomo in New
York and Ann Richards in Texas among the governors; Jim Sasser, who might
have been the next party leader in the Senate, in Tennessee; Congressmen Dan
Rostenkowski in Chicago and Jack Brooks in Texas, past and present chairmen
of the ways and means and judiciary committees with 78 years in the House
between them.
The biggest scalp of all - of Speaker Tom Foley in the state of Washington -
was left hanging from the belt of Mr George Nethercutt, a Republican lawyer
and political novice.
Almost all the voter tunes were sung from the Republican hymnbook. The
promise of less government and lower taxes helped George Pataki beat Mario
Cuomo. Referenda on tax-cutting and limiting the terms of elected officials
were passed almost everywhere they were on the ballot.
Most Democrats were out-toughed on the crime issue, with Governor Lawton
Chiles's survival in Florida over Mr Jeb Bush a rare exception and Mr
Cuomo's defeat the classic proof. Conservative hostility to illegal
immigration was endorsed comfortably in California. The right-wing Christian
lobby failed to return Oliver North, but did well elsewhere. The gun lobby
was instrumental in knocking off Mr Brooks in Texas, accusing him of
apostasy on gun control.
A constant national strain, most virulent in the south and its borders, was
distrust and a dislike akin to hatred of Mr Clinton himself. Democrats lost
in all the states to which the president had devoted his energies in the
last week of campaigning - Minnesota, Delaware, Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Ohio. Mr Gingrich, it appears, made the right strategic decision in turning
the mid-term elections into a plebiscite on the presidency.
But the US still must be governed in the next two years and this is where
Republican elation is tempered among its more thoughtful members. The
party's 'contract with America', effectively its election manifesto, lays
out a plan and a 100-day timetable for introducing legislation, but its
passage in anything approximating the proposed form may be doubted.
One reason for doubt is resistance to it by moderate Republicans in the
Senate (Mr Dole, for one, is still sitting on the fence over term limits).
Another is that Mr Clinton possesses a veto and the Democrats enough
numbers, if they stick together, to block legislation in the Senate by
filibusters, much as the Republicans did in the last session.
Not all will be legislative gridlock revisited. The Republican party's
contract demands that the president be given a 'line item' budget veto,
empowering him to strike out an offending item of spending without throwing
out a whole bill. Mr Clinton has no problem with this, since he advocated it
in 1992.
Nor will he resist the middle class tax cut demanded by Republicans. This is
already in the White House planning stages, though funding it without
increasing the federal deficit is another matter.
Welfare reform is a subject on which both parties agree in principle,
differing only in detail. Modest healthcare reform initiatives cannot be
excluded.
But battles royal can be expected on many other fields - on the proposed
amendment to the constitution requiring a balanced budget, for example, and
on Republican desires to beef up defence spending. The thorniest problem
will be the cutting of federal 'entitlement' programmes such as social
security and medicare, where the Republican contract promised 'gain without
pain'.
The conduct of foreign policy, and its economic and trade components, will
not be any easier, especially if Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the
ultimate arch-conservative, exercises his option to chair the foreign
relations committee (he has the choice of agriculture). The new 'America
First' Republican majority in the House features few conventional
internationalists and sentiment against US military excursions overseas or
involvement in Bosnia, Rwanda and other distant hotspots has increased on
the right, complementing its presence on the left.
Just as serious is the weakening of the old Republican free trade
constituency that helped pass the North American Free Trade Agreement last
year. If the lame-duck Congress does not approve the legislation to
implement the Gatt Uruguay Round in three weeks - and it will do so only if
enough retiring members vote with their consciences and defy an electorate
to which they are no longer subject - its prospects in 1995 look bleak.
Other trade initiatives in Asia and South America, both with summits in the
next five weeks, could be still-born unless what are perceived as American
interests are aggressively protected.
Even if the political will to co-operate proves stronger than expected,
mutual animus is certain to increase because the Republicans will use their
majorities to make a meal out of Whitewater. The tangled skein of the first
family's investments long ago in Arkansas has been off the political screen
for the last few months while the special counsel, Mr Ken Starr, goes about
his work. But the hiatus will not last.
Mr Gingrich has already promised a wholesale investigation of 'White House
corruption'. But even his zeal is likely to pale in comparison with that of
Senator Al D'Amato from New York. He is expected to turn his chairmanship of
the banking committee into a standing inquisition not only into Whitewater
but also into the president's private life and the suicide in the summer of
1993 of Vince Foster, the close Clinton friend and deputy White House legal
counsel.
Having helped dispose of Mr Cuomo, the senator's notorious appetite for
blood has been whetted. He is likely to find an ally in Congressman Jim
Leach of Iowa, another leading Whitewater critic, who stands to inherit the
House banking committee from Henry Gonzalez, the president's staunchest
protector. Both panels, it must be assumed, will leak like sieves and
arrange for televised hearings with maximum exposure.
Further complicating the immediate future is the polarisation of both
parties, if anything more acute among Republicans than Democrats. The House
may prove monolithic under Mr Gingrich, but there is an influential fistful
of Senate moderates - including Bill Cohen of Maine, Nancy Kassebaum of
Kansas, Bob Packwood and Mark Hatfield of Oregon, John Chafee of Rhode
Island and James Jeffords of Vermont - with committee seniority and a
preference for pragmatic over conviction politics.
It also matters that the country is about to enter another election cycle -
for the presidency in 1996. Unless there is some awful Whitewater
development that sinks public confidence in him irrevocably, Mr Clinton
still looks the likely Democratic candidate. If not him, it will be
Vice-President Al Gore, bruised though he was on Tuesday by the Republican
sweep in his native Tennessee. A challenge cannot be ruled out, either from
the left or from the grumpy middle represented in 1992 by Paul Tsongas. But
at present it appears unlikely to succeed.
The Republicans, however, are no closer to finding candidates for 1996 than
they were before the mid-term elections. All the leading suspects are still
around, but Senator Dole will be pre-occupied with congressional management
and Mr Gingrich has no known presidential ambitions. Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas did his cause good by campaigning mightily for Republican candidates
and has assembled a substantial war-chest, but his manner turns as many
people off as on.
Lamar Alexander, former cabinet member and governor of Tennessee, has been
diligently cultivating the grassroots, as have Dick Cheney, ex-secretary of
defence, and James Baker, ex-secretary of everything. The bids, more likely
for the vice-presidential slot, from three governors returned on Tuesday -
Pete Wilson in California, Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin and William Weld in
Massachusetts - have gained in value, while the stock of Christie Whitman of
New Jersey remains high.
However, the ideological differences between the above personalities could
burst at the seams the 'big tent' that the party professes to represent. And
some proto-candidates may find it easier to get elected to the White House
than win the Republican nomination. One who surely cannot win the nomination
because of rightwing opposition but has already put down a marker for the
moderates by declaring is Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
With the main parties divided or listless and distrusted, an independent
candidacy in 1996 remains on the cards. Ross Perot can boast that his
endorsements, generally of Republicans, worked (though not at home in Texas
with the defeat of Ann Richards).
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a nominal Republican who endorsed Mr
Cuomo, would have looked better as an independent prospect in 1996 if the
governor had won. Now he may be forced into his destiny by taking on his
long-term foe Senator D'Amato in the 1998 Senate race. The political right
remains the more fertile ground for independents and libertarians and, as in
1992, that is also not necessarily bad news for Mr Clinton because it will
divide the Republican vote.
However, the president cannot afford to to sit back and wait. To sacrifice
the initiative to the Republican Congress over the next two years would be
good for neither his government nor his own political future. He could
choose to go veto-crazy, but George Bush's exercise of that power did him no
good at all.
Thus the White House watchwords of the moment are of 'repositioning' or
'relaunching' the presidency. With the economy still in reasonable shape and
with foreign policy suddenly fruitful (Haiti, North Korea, the Middle East,
Russia, if not Bosnia), Mr Clinton is not without fertile prospects. No less
than five foreign trips are on his schedule for next year. If the country,
in its isolationist mode, ignores external policy it is a fair bet that Mr
Clinton will return to some of the domestic themes that propelled him into
office in 1992 - emphasis on personal and community responsibility,
tolerance in race relations, for example.
But sooner or later, and all of yesterday's protestations of co-operation
notwithstanding, Mr Clinton will surely round on the Republicans running
Congress and their record in exercising the power to which they have long
been unaccustomed. And that is why some serious Republicans are worried by
Tuesday's results.
For the overriding lesson of the congressional mid-term elections, as it was
to a degree in 1992, is that it is far easier to run against somebody or
something than for both. Ask the ghost of Harry Truman.
