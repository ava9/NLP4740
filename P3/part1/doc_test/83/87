<F P=106> [Jurek Martin article: "America Lays Ghosts of Its War in </F>
Vietnam"] 
  [Text] American presidents sometimes act out of character 
when occasion demands. Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, 
launched the Marshall Plan and NATO to put war-shattered Europe 
back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, cold war 
warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation and 
communication with China and the former Soviet Union 
respectively. 
  By these historical standards, there is something both 
consistent and logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under 
the Vietnam War by his decision last night to end the trade 
embargo. This is a president, after all, who never served in 
uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the war. There 
was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his 
evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest 
victim, nearly 20 years after military hostilities had ceased. 
  Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only 
war the U.S. can definitively be said to have "lost" in 200 
years that Mr Clinton did not rush into normalising relations 
with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up political 
constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road 
map laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first 
flushes of victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been 
tempted also to come to terms with Vietnam. 
  America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since 
President John Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist 
tide over 30 years ago. It must begin with the 67,000-plus 
soldiers who never came home and the many more who returned 
maimed in body and mind, the first returning U.S. soldiers not 
to be welcomed as conquering heroes. 
  It took many years, and more controversy, for their 
sacrifice 
finally to be recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on 
the Washington Mall. It is a recognition like no other -- a 
long low dark gray wall etched with the names of everyone who 
died -- and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and classical 
Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes. 
  The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in 
popular culture, recognised in films and books beyond number. 
Words and images from that era still resonate the "domino 
theory," Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the My Lai massacre 
and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of the 
little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of 
a captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the U.S. 
embassy in Saigon as the last Americans were evacuated. 
  Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign 
conflict which found the nation so divided. The chalice 
inherited by the "best and the brightest" in government, who 
flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly stayed with 
Johnson, was poisoned. 
  Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to 
society 
so much less than they might have been. A few sought 
consolation in different forms of public service -- like Robert 
McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and guilt as defence 
secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the World 
Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting 
together memoirs of the period. 
  Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil 
in the streets of Washington and around his country, decided not 
to run for re-election in 1968 and died, a broken man, three 
years later. 
  His Democratic Party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost 
the presidency in 1968 but took years to come to terms with 
Vietnam, holding the White House for only four of the next 24 
years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was captured by 
George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to a 
landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not 
above manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the 
election to maximise his victory (he lost only liberal 
Massachusetts.) 
  Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy 
Carter into the White House but he, too, was afflicted by the 
Vietnam syndrome, this time in Iran. A botched rescue attempt 
in the spring of 1980 of the U.S. hostages in Tehran came to 
seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's 
blunt assertion that he would set "a date certain" for release 
of the hostages, in the absence of which U.S. bombs would start 
falling. 
  Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this 
lesson better, committing themselves to the doctrine of "main 
force," winning little victories in Grenada and Panama and a big 
one in the Gulf, and proclaiming with each notch on the belt 
that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that U.S. forces would 
now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not 
help George Bush in 1992. 
  Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no 
evidence of American appetite for foreign military adventure, be 
it in Bosnia, Somalia or anywhere not incontrovertibly related 
to the national interest. 
  This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the 
imperatives of domestic renewal. But it may also be the real 
final legacy of Vietnam. "No more war" was a powerful chant in 
the streets of America in 1968. It would still be so today.
