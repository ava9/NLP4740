John Major's trip to Washington and the rumpus over the Thatcher Collection
raises the question of the ownership of gifts received by national leaders
during their time in office.
Harry Truman took a characteristically simple view. Introducing his 1973
biographer Merle Miller to the part of the Truman Library, in his native
Independence, Missouri, that was devoted to such gifts, he observed: 'They
were given to the president of the United States, which is what, for a time,
I was, but I never thought they were for my personal use.'
But there was one exception: a jewelled sword, from King Saud of Saudi
Arabia. Truman explained: 'I told Bess (his wife) I'd give that to her if
she'd kick Bricker (a Republican senator from Ohio) in the ass, but she
wouldn't do it. So it's still here.'
