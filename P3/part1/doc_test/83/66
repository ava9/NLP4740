JACKSON ON DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson makes an impassioned plea for universal voter registration as a panacea 
for greater democracy. What he would get is massive voter fraud. Without the 
safeguards that exist in the present system of voter registration the country 
would return to the days of Boss Tweed in New York and Big Bill Thompson in 
Chicago where names on tombstones were voted with regularity.

Back in 1950, dismayed with the voter turnout in the 1948 general election in 
which Harry Truman won California by a margin of less than 1 vote per precinct, 
I sought to become a deputy registrar and thus improve the odds for a 
Republican candidate to be elected President. I found that this involved 
attending a few hours of school on North Spring Street in Los Angeles. 
Inconvenient though it was for me as the proprietor of a one-man business, I 
attended and qualified to register potential voters. When I suggested to the 
then-county registrar of voters, Ben Hite, that a school for deputy registrars 
in remote corners of the county like Pomona might assure a bigger supply of 
applicants, he said that experience has shown that those who took the trouble 
to attend the school on North Spring Street made more dedicated deputies.

Anyone who can't find the time to locate a deputy registrar at a shopping mall 
or even a neighborhood market isn't really trying and probably wouldn't become 
an active voter in an election; certainly not in the 80% proportion that 
Jackson claims. Unless non-voters in a general election were purged, there'd be 
a great deal more tombstone voting. So some living, potential voters would also 
be purged, but if they are so indifferent about this privilege as to fail to 
vote in a general election (not one of the many special issue elections), 
continuing them on the voter rolls would make little difference. No, what we 
need are motivated and informed voters, not mere masses of registered citizens.
