HUNTER by E Jean Carroll Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 341 pages
LIKE IT or not, it is difficult to avoid Dr Hunter S Thompson. Only recently
Garry Trudeau devoted another of his 'Doonesbury' cartoon strips to the
latest episode in the extraordinary life of Duke, the drug addict, quondam
diplomat and Colorado recluse who is modelled on the self-styled 'gonzo'
journalist.
There have been at least three biographies of the man in the last year or
two. For those who keep track,E Jean Carroll's is the one by the author who
actually slept with him and nearly married him. This is not bad for a
character who has produced only one seriously good book in 30 years (Fear
and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, a brilliantly idiosyncratic account of
the 1972 election) and is considered even by his fans to be one of the most
disappointing literary talents of his generation.
Ms Carroll's technique is clever. Every third chapter or so gives an account
of her own 'romance' with Thompson, written in the best Vanity Fair/Tom
Wolfe style, deliciously revealing, funny, and self-mocking. The rest is a
series of quotes from family, friends and enemies, from Louisville,
Kentucky, via the Hell's Angels and political writing to the Colorado cabin.
Thus she begins: 'I have heard the biographers of Harry S Truman, Catherine
the Great, etc etc, say they would give anything if their subjects were
alive so they could ask them some questions. I, on the other hand, would
give anything if my subject were dead. He should be. Oh yes. Look at his
daily routine: 3.00pm rise: 3.05 Chivas Regal with the morning papers,
Dunhills. 3.45 cocaine: 3.50 another glass of Chivas, Dunhill: 4.05 first
cup of coffee, Dunhill: 4.15 cocaine: 4.16 orange juice, Dunhill; 4.30
cocaine; 4.54 cocaine . . .'
Eventually you get the picture, through the 7pm lunch at the Woody Creek
Tavern (Heineken, two margaritas, two cheeseburgers, fries, tomatoes,
coleslaw, taco salad, fried onion rings, carrot cake, ice cream, bean
fritter, Dunhills, another Heineken, cocaine, and for the ride home a glass
of shredded ice over which is poured three or four jiggers of Chivas.) At
9pm he 'starts snorting cocaine seriously'; at midnight, fortified by
Chartreuse and pornographic movies, he is 'ready to write.'
Or not, because it is a long time since Hunter Thompson has written
anything. But there is no point in being po-faced about this. To write may
be to disappoint: to be Hunter S Thompson is to be a weird kind of icon.
Dick Goodwin, an old friend and intimate of the Kennedys, says: 'Hunter
Thompson is a unique character of our times. He is a reality, which is one
thing. And he is a symbol, which is another totally different thing. And
thirdly he's both ultimately sane and crazy. He is also drunk and sober'.
Carroll, with the deftest of touches, offers the most entertaining of reads
with, correctly, an absence of moralising. Other minor literary characters
should be so lucky.
