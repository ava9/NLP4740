Writer-director Christopher Coppola -- nephew of Francis Ford -- hopes to get 
his "Black Stallion III" under way this fall in Northern Nevada, he told us. 
He's just returned from North Dakota, where he found a new black Arabian to 
star in the latest film installment based on the series of Walter Farley young 
adult books. 
</P>
<P>
The original Black -- seen in the first two films (1979 and 1983) -- "was too 
old to be in the movie -- and he'd lost an eye in an accident," Christopher 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Reno, now 22, who starred in the two previous films, is also over the 
hill. His character -- a young boy who tames a stallion -- is in his mid-teens 
in "III," coping with the Black becoming wild again, against a '50s American 
west backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Rooney is expected back as the trainer, but casting is under way for the 
plum role of the boy.
