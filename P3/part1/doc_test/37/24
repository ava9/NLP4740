THE GUY FROM CHICAGO ARRIVES; 
</P>
<P>
JOE MANTEGNA IS HAVING A HOLLYWOOD DREAM SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
HE IS, IN THE simplest terms, not a New Yorker. Reared in the shadow of Al 
Capone and schooled in Chicago-style realism, Joseph Anthony Mantegna is a 
counterpoint to the American tradition of celluloid heavies. Among the Brandos, 
Pacinos and De Niros, Mantegna is an actor's alternative to that brawling, 
Lower East Side Italian tough guy: a Pinteresque con man with a sharkskin suit 
and the soul of an ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
He has located himself on the American cinematic consciousness with a series of 
small, sharply etched supporting roles in big silly movies -- "Three Amigos!," 
"The Money Pit," "Suspect," "Compromising Positions" and "Weeds." But Mantegna 
has achieved his greatest distinction as an actor by playing alter ego to 
playwright and fellow Chicagoan David Mamet. In the dozen years that he has 
performed in the Pulitzer Prize-winner's dramas, Mantegna has become "The Guy" 
-- the embodiment of Mamet's nasty-boy urban brotherhood whose Janus-faced 
ethos of deceit and loyalty is pounded out in scatological, syncopated riffs. 
Together, Mamet and Mantegna have created some of the most dazzling and 
despicable American male characters of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is playing Ricky Roma, the cold-blooded real estate salesman of 
"Glengarry Glen Ross" -- for which he won a 1984 Tony Award -- or Bobby Gould, 
the perfidious Hollywood boss in the 1988 Broadway hit "Speed-the-Plow," or 
Mike Mancuso, the manipulative con artist in the film "House of Games," or even 
the bungling Mafia hit man in Mamet's comedy "Things Change," Mantegna is the 
new American huckster. It is a characterization more complex than the 
lead-with-the-fists psychopaths favored by director Martin Scorsese, one that 
has less to do with the spray of a tommy gun than the hurling of epithets with 
the reverence of Hail Marys. Mantegna has "a post-De Niro, post-Pacino acting 
style that strikes that balance between cynicism and idealism," says Jack 
Kroll, chief theater and movie critic of Newsweek. "Mantegna plays guys who've 
wised up enough to know it's all crap, but who can't leave it there." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is poised to take his post-modernist persona into a larger arena. He 
may not yet be a full-fledged star in Hollywood, but Mantegna is having the 
biggest year in his career. After jerking Hollywood's chain two years ago with 
his cutting performance in "Speed-the-Plow" -- a role that was said to be based 
on former Paramount president Ned Tanen -- Mantegna swiftly landed major roles 
in four films. This month, the actor opens in two of the most anticipated 
releases of the year -- "Godfather III," Francis Ford Coppola's $50-million 
Mafia sequel, and "Alice," Woody Allen's new comedy. Both films are expected to 
increase not only Mantegna's visibility and asking price but also his reach as 
an actor. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the two roles are a leap ahead for Mantegna, whose broad Chicago accent 
and patently ethnic look, just this side of handsome, have so far denied him 
real leading-man status. In "Alice," which also stars Mia Farrow and William 
Hurt, Mantegna plays a jazz musician and gives a rare good-guy performance as 
well as playing his first romantic role. In Coppola's saga, Mantegna takes his 
silkily minimalist malevolence up against Pacino's in one of the film's more 
pivotal roles, Joey Zasa, the powerful rival to the Pacino-led Corleone family. 
Already some critics are suggesting that "Godfather III" may make stars out of 
Mantegna and Andy Garcia the way the original "Godfather" films did for Pacino, 
James Caan and Robert Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
It is exposure that has been long in coming for the low-key but intense 
43-year-old whose first professional theater successes occurred more than two 
decades ago. The younger son of a widow who could only afford to send him to 
Morton Junior College, Mantegna grew up in Cicero, Ill. -- a tough, blue-collar 
suburb whose infamous favorite son remains Al Capone. Mantegna's professional 
acting career began when he landed roles in the Chicago production of "Hair" 
and the lead in a Ragu spaghetti sauce advertising campaign. When he moved to 
Los Angeles in 1978, jobs for an ethnic character actor with few screen credits 
were so few and far between that he supported himself by running a small 
photography business -- taking head shots of other actors. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Glengarry Glen Ross," and especially since "Speed-the-Plow," Mantegna 
has worked almost nonstop. Says Fred Roos, co-producer of "Godfather III," "I 
saw Joe in 'Glengarry' and was just knocked out by him. We had been looking to 
cast him for a long time." Roos is not alone in his assessment. Next year 
Mantegna can be seen with John Malkovich, another Chicago actor, in "Queens 
Logic," a "Big Chill"-type comedy. Later in the year will come "Wait Until 
Spring, Bandini," from the John Fante novel, with Faye Dunaway. He has just 
finished shooting his third Mamet movie, "Homicide," a police thriller that 
will be released sometime next year. And always there will be more Mamet plays 
to headline. "Joe Mantegna is already one of our best actors," says Roos. "Will 
he have the kind of career that Hackman and Duvall have? Yes, he will have 
that." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT AM I DOING? What am I doing now, at this moment?" Mantegna asks with 
staccato, unmistakably Mamet-like rhythms. "At this moment, what I am doing is 
packing boxes in my garage." 
</P>
<P>
It is an early autumn day and the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of 
Mantegna's Toluca Lake home, are remarkably free of smog. It is a pleasant 
afternoon for the actor to pursue one of his longstanding rituals: bundling his 
family belongings into cardboard boxes for another out-of-town job, this time 
the three-month location shoot in Baltimore for "Homicide." "Well, I do it," he 
says, carefully writing his name and address on a box cover. "I just do. That's 
part of the deal, that we all go together." 
</P>
<P>
It is a typical Mantegna comment, straightforward, unadorned. It is delivered 
in his unpretentious Chicago accent, backed up by a steady, assessing gaze. 
There is no smile -- not yet -- and in person he is taller, leaner and more 
handsome than his compact, jowly screen image. He is also utterly unlike the 
con artists and killers he usually portrays. Contentedly packing up his 
family's goods, Mantegna seems trustworthy, this father of two who has been 
married to the same woman, Arlene, for more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Mamet's theory, that we travel in a club," says Mantegna, leading his 
visitor from the garage into his tidy, three-bedroom ranch with a white, airy 
living room furnished in oversized white sofas and a corner table covered with 
dozens of framed family photographs. "I'm going to instantly know 50 people 
when we get to Baltimore," says the actor, settling on a sofa. "That's nice. I 
travel so much -- three, six months out of the year -- and I don't want to be a 
gypsy. But this is my life. I have a good collection of friends, and I like to 
keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mantegna is regarded by his wide circle of acquaintances as the most 
loyal of friends and an inveterate family man, "as good as they get," says 
Gregory Mosher, director of New York's Lincoln Center Theater and Mamet's 
longtime director. 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna's two daughters, 3-year-old Mia Marie and 4-month-old Gina Christine, 
are in the next room with their nanny. His wife is out somewhere, scouting new 
office space for her brownie business. During the next several hours, a 
limousine must be ordered, schedules must be coordinated, phones answered, 
children fed. One senses that Mantegna is deeply rooted in his family's 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
This home-centered contentment is more than just the happy circumstances of the 
actor's off-screen persona; it is the hard-won result of a life of hard knocks, 
the fulcrum for Mantegna's on-screen rogues' gallery of tough guys. "He wants 
to be known as old Joe," says John Leckel, Mantegna's first drama teacher. "But 
he has an iron discipline, an incredible ego and a need for acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is complex without being neurotic," explains Mosher, who has known 
Mantegna since the director's days as artistic head of Chicago's Goodman 
Theatre. "He has had a long, tough climb. But it's the guy with a huge heart 
that is best equipped to play villains, and Joey has vast emotional reserves to 
create characters with moral and ethical ambiguities." 
</P>
<P>
Mention these observations to Mantegna, and he becomes predictably 
self-effacing. "If there is that in my performances -- that empathy -- then 
that is what I am after. That's the secret of playing a character like that. 
You can scream and be angry, and that's more fun and easier than being 
sensitive. But you become stereotypical. There has to be more to it to make it 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna's brand of specialness, the result of honing his craft, is just coming 
to fruition. While he happily acknowledges that "David (Mamet) has given me 
high visibility with those kinds of characters," he says that this past year 
"was an actor's dream. . . . What I liked about doing Woody's movie was that he 
obviously sees something in me, something that other (directors) didn't. I get 
to play a regular guy. I'm more anxious to see this movie than the 'Godfather.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The regular guy whom Mantegna plays in "Alice" is a musician and divorced 
father who woos and wins his ex-wife (Judy Davis) as well as the honeyed, 
moneyed, repressed wife (portrayed by Mia Farrow) of a domineering Wall Street 
banker (William Hurt). It is a performance that Mantegna describes as "playing 
me more than a character. I'm playing Joe Mantegna more than at any other 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's a totally natural talent," Allen says. "He makes any line of written 
dialogue sound like a real person talking." Adds Juliet Taylor, Allen's 
longtime casting director: "We were looking for an actor to carry the film's 
emotional weight, and there are only so many people who are that compelling. 
Joe is an actor that a lot of us have admired, but to know him is to know that 
Joe exudes a warm, appealing reality." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna has the reputation of being something close to a director's dream: 
"He's done a lot of work beforehand," Roos says. "He doesn't need a lot of 
direction, and he never pulls any attitude." Even when discussing the reclusive 
and demanding Allen, Mantegna simply smiles. "Well, fun is the wrong word. He's 
different. If you're an actor who demands a lot from your director, this is not 
your guy. It's not like I could say, 'Hey Woody, let's rap.' He's so quiet and 
shy and retiring. But I went into it thinking, 'It's Woody Allen, I love what 
he does, and even if it's horrible, this too shall end.' " 
</P>
<P>
About Allen's notorious habit of reshooting, Mantegna shrugs. "Your first 
impulse is to say, 'It's me; they saw the dailies, and they want another 
actor.' But usually Woody would just say, 'What you did the first time was 
fine.' I'm not that much of a directing student. Just tell me where to stand, 
and I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice," which was slated to finish shooting in November, 1989, didn't finish 
until this April, nearly six months beyond its original wrap date, creating a 
scheduling conflict for Mantegna, who was needed in Italy for "Godfather III" 
in December of last year. He had to fly to Rome, film his scenes, then fly back 
to New York for "Alice." "Woody didn't want me to blow the 'Godfather,' and he 
could have wrecked it," says Mantegna. "I remember I finished in Rome on 
Monday, flew out on Tuesday and was back in New York shooting with Woody on 
Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
It is a similar kind of insouciant professionalism that Mantegna brought to his 
work in "Godfather III," one of the more crisis-attended, gossip-mongered 
productions in recent years. "Yeah, I read the press about how Francis 
(Coppola) just directs from his monitors in his metal cylinder -- the 
Silverfish. But I found him to give the actors what they needed. I mean, with 
Francis it's more grand opera. Let's face it, it is the 'Godfather.' His 
attention to videos and electronic monitors seems wise. I mean, when you're 
making a picture that is like $10,000 a minute, you want to cover yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the easiest roles for Francis to cast," co-producer Roos says 
of Mantegna's Zasa. "A Mediterranean-looking Italian, a man who could be hard 
but also a bit of a dandy and showoff. We knew that Joe could do all those 
things." Mantegna is cautious when describing his own performance. "People ask 
me, 'Do you play a good guy or a bad guy?' I say, 'Who the hell are the good 
guys in the "Godfather?" ' I'm a guy -- not a blood relative of the Corleones. 
I start out as part of the family and go askew of them, a rival-to-the-throne 
type. It's not like Al (Pacino) or Andy (Garcia) or the crux of the movie, but 
it's a good role, and I'm very happy with it. I mean, I don't really have 
career goals. If I just stay where I am at, what could be better?" he adds, 
sounding less like a Hollywood success story than a guy who feels lucky just to 
have a job. 
</P>
<P>
There is something about Mantegna that resembles a kid with his nose pressed to 
the shop window. He is quick to say, "Ask anybody that knows me, nothing ever 
comes easy for me." This actor weathered one of the most visible roles of his 
life -- playing opposite Madonna on Broadway in "Speed-the-Plow" -- with a rare 
facial disease that several producers misinterpreted as the effects of a 
stroke. But his knock-on-wood fatalism is perhaps most evident in the way he 
downplays his rather exclusive relationship with one of the country's leading 
playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
"David never says, 'I wrote this for you.' It's always, 'I've got this (script) 
and I think you'd be good.' That's it. It's so informal it's like a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in school, so much of what I was reading was written with New 
Yorkers in mind," Mantegna says. "You know, knishes and the BMT, and if you're 
from Chicago you go 'What the hell is this?' Right away you're at a certain 
disadvantage. What I feel about Mamet is that you don't have to do so much 
homework." 
</P>
<P>
There is a pause. "I know the kind of people David is talking about. There was 
this other world out there that intrigued him, and he sought it out and wrote 
about it. He was from the South Side, his father was a lawyer and he had a 
little more privileged life. I didn't have to seek that world out. It didn't 
intrigue me, I was part of it. I know what it was like to come home at night 
and see the cops drag slot machines from the corner bar, see your friends get 
arrested, get shot. It was just part of life." 
</P>
<P>
THE SECOND SON OF second-generation Sicilian and Italian parents, Mantegna, the 
man for whom "nothing comes easy," was born in Al Capone's hometown because of 
his own family's misfortune. Tuberculosis had killed his grandfather on the 
family farm in Oklahoma, "and my grandmother packed my father and my uncle, who 
had also caught TB from the cows, off to Chicago." The illness left its mark 
and imbued Mantegna with a sense of "Italian fatalism," says one old friend. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a lot of medical problems," recalls the actor. "We didn't see 
him much when I was growing up. He traveled a lot, and for four years he was in 
a sanitarium in New York where they wheeled you out in the mountain air." They 
were a small family for an Italian household: two boys, an ailing father and a 
mother who worked, all housed in a tiny apartment. "My father couldn't really 
support us, so my mother did," Mantegna says. "She wrapped packages in the 
mail-order department at Sears." He was eight years younger than his brother 
Ronald, who today is an advertising executive in Chicago. "If there's an 
Italian word for mensch, he's it," Mantegna says. "He was more like a father to 
me than a brother." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna attended Morton East High School, a sprawling place full of the 
children of second-generation Czechs, Poles and Italians where "you had the 
guys who were real criminals, then there were the Beaver Cleaver types. I was 
somewhere in between," he says. "I was something of a wise guy." 
</P>
<P>
It was a largely unremarkable four years except for the influence of one man -- 
John Leckel, the school drama teacher who ran a quasi-professional theater 
training program at two high schools and junior college. "Jack used to bid on 
used Broadway sets and get them for our productions," recalls Mantegna. It is 
Leckel whom Mantegna credits with having changed his life. "A lot of my friends 
were going to college, but I didn't have the money to go anywhere, and Jack 
said, 'Stay and do the plays here.' So I did -- 'Hamlet,' 'Merchant of Venice,' 
'Brigadoon.' I was a big frog in a little pond, but I was beginning to get a 
sense that I might be good." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the most outstanding student I ever had," says Leckel today. "Joe came 
from no money, had no family ties to the business; he just did everything 
right. He was a song-and-dance man who was also funny and who could act. You 
don't run across a kid like that very often." 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Jack," Mantegna says, "I don't think I would be in this 
business." It was an almost surrogate father-son relationship; while keeping 
the crazy late hours of the theater world, Mantegna would frequently wind up on 
his teacher's doorstep, where he would be invited in to cook a meal and spend 
the night on the couch. During his stint playing in a high school rock band, 
"The Apocryphals," Mantegna persuaded his teacher to co-sign a $10,000 loan for 
equipment. "He was always the most responsible kid," Leckel says. "He was this 
little adult. He knew how to manipulate those around him." 
</P>
<P>
It was an attitude that Mantegna took with him to Chicago's prestigious Goodman 
School of Drama, which he attended on a partial scholarship. He studied at 
Goodman for two years, leaving a year shy of graduation because he landed a 
role in the Chicago production of "Hair" in 1969. After that came a slot in the 
musical "Godspell." "I was making 300 bucks a week, which was a lot of money 
for a 21-year-old kid in 1969," says Mantegna about those early jobs. "I 
remember saying, 'Who said this is tough?' But I didn't make that kind of money 
for the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
For the next several years, Mantegna, newly married to Arlene, a "Hair" 
co-star, weathered some lean times, working largely at the Organic Theater. "I 
was the master of unemployment, I really worked that sister," he recalls. It 
was the pre-Steppenwolf Chicago theater era, and the Organic, the Goodman and 
the infamous Second City were the only games in town. Those, and Mamet's own 
theater, the nascent St. Nicholas Theatre. "We were pretty much a small group," 
Mantegna says, "and we all kept thinking we would eventually have to move to 
one coast or another, but the work seemed good." 
</P>
<P>
It was during this time that Mantegna and a handful of fellow actors wrote and 
performed a play, "Bleacher Bums," as a way of getting more work. The play ran 
for one season in Chicago, then moved to New York and was later televised and 
taped; the eight actors and director, Stuart Gordon, each received an Emmy. "In 
a business where it is not the hallmark, Joe was extremely well-grounded," 
recalls Richard Fire, artistic director of the Organic Theater and one of the 
play's co-authors. "You could really depend on him." 
</P>
<P>
Later came the move to Los Angeles in 1978, a sort of collective migration of 
Chicago actors, including Mantegna, Dennis Franz and Richard Gilliland. "I came 
because it was California, it was warm and I went nuts," says Mantegna. "I had 
been in (Studs Terkel's play) 'Working' off-Broadway, and the idea of staying 
in New York, it was like another Chicago. So I came out here and lived off 
unemployment and my photography business for years. It took me six months to 
get an agent, and then they dumped me because I didn't get any work." 
</P>
<P>
They were tough but happy times, Mantegna recalls now. He and Arlene lived in a 
small Valley apartment, making ends meet with a series of odd jobs. "I'd get 
one acting job about every six months," says Mantegna. "But it was great. We'd 
go to the beach, have dinner at a friend's house." By 1983, he was back in 
Chicago debuting Ricky Roma, finally on his way. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORY OF THE first meeting between actor and playwright in 1974 has 
acquired legendary status among their friends. Mantegna was slogging through 
his fallow post-"Hair" period by performing at the Organic. "Mamet had seen our 
work and came to us with 'Sexual Perversity in Chicago,' and I said 'No.' Smart 
move," says Mantegna with a laugh. "But I had already been cast as the 
understudy in 'Lenny' that summer, and they were paying me more. I liked his 
play, but I didn't know Mamet from the man in the moon." 
</P>
<P>
It would be two years before Mantegna would work with Mamet, in a Chicago 
production of "A Life in the Theater." It would be another six years before the 
two would collaborate again -- in the 1982 production of Mamet's lesser-known 
work, "The Disappearance of the Jews," performed at the Goodman Theatre. It 
wasn't until Mantegna played Roma, the shark-like, small-town real estate 
salesman in "Glengarry Glen Ross" in 1983, that the actor-playwright 
relationship bloomed. The production ran for more than two years -- Chicago, a 
national tour and finally Broadway; Mantegna won a Tony and Mamet the Pulitzer 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe became a very powerful actor with that role," says actress Lindsay Crouse, 
Mamet's former wife, who played opposite Mantegna in "House of Games." "Joe 
gained tremendous self-confidence during the run." 
</P>
<P>
According to Crouse and other acquaintances (Mamet has declined any interviews 
for several years), the chemistry between actor and writer has less to do with 
camaraderie than it does with artistry. "Joe is the voice of those characters 
that David writes best -- he is 'The Guy,' " Crouse adds. "As a writer, you 
search for someone who comes close to that voice in your head, and when Joe 
opens his mouth, it's him, and David knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna is less certain. "Did Mamet tell you that I'm 'The Guy?' " he asks. 
"I've read that, but never once has he told me that. David is David. It's the 
dilemma I have of describing a guy I've known for 15 years. We're very close on 
some levels, we're not on others. I like the way he writes, and he sees 
something in me that he likes as a performer, and I'm comfortable with that." 
</P>
<P>
Mosher, who has worked with both actor and writer for many years, calls it a 
symbiotic relationship that works because of the duo's shared landscape. "There 
is nothing European about Joe; he's not New York, like Pacino or Hoffman. He's 
another point on the compass. There is nobody like him, if you think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet being "The Guy" for one of the country's most acclaimed dramatists, whose 
use of language has been compared to British dramatist Harold Pinter's, holds 
its own challenges. "Mamet's a guy who is very conscious of writing in a 
certain rhythm -- iambic pentameter. When he writes, you can sometimes see him 
tapping it out with a pen," says Mantegna. "Not a lot of writers actually work 
out the beats. That's why you can't casually change a line." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna admits that Roma's first speech in "Glengarry," a 15-minute monologue, 
"was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done. It's tough enough to do 
Mamet, but when it's a stream-of-consciousness thing, it's like learning the 
Gettysburg Address in Japanese. There are no external reference points, and if 
you get lost -- like I did on opening night -- you just can't vamp it to get 
back on track. With David, it's like doing Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
If the playwright's use of language has occasionally flummoxed the actor, 
Mamet's characters -- salty-tongued, tough-minded salesman and hustlers -- have 
proven less elusive. "The trick is that different personalties gravitate 
towards different occupations," Mantegna says, "so whether it's a real estate 
salesman or a studio head or a con man, the trick is to find that aspect of his 
personality that makes him do that thing, that job. . . . So I look at the 
script and say, 'What is this guy about?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna admits that his approach to acting differs from that of Mamet, who has 
been an acting teacher. "David is very heavy into Stanislavsky, but that's not 
my background," says the actor. "I look at the script, and I use parts of 
myself and people that I know to help me become that guy. I put together a 
composite, and that includes the way I look, talk and behave." 
</P>
<P>
For most of Mamet's characters, Mantegna says it comes down to discovering why 
those characters believe in themselves. "Regardless of how evil a person is -- 
I mean Hitler didn't think he was a bad guy -- they don't start the day 
thinking who they can screw that day," explains Mantegna. "They think what they 
are doing is best for themselves. Ricky Roma, Mike Mancuso, Bobby Gould, these 
guys believed in what they did. So I play that character who is totally in love 
with himself. David does not write guys who don't love themselves. He writes 
about strong men, and he will give as much integrity to a thief as he will to 
an average guy." 
</P>
<P>
THE SOFT CALIFORNIA afternoon has grown longer. Mantegna's wife is home, and a 
crowd of several co-workers, children and the nanny gathers in the kitchen. For 
a moment, there is a discussion of a moving van and feeding schedules. 
Mantegna, still on the couch, begins to whistle the theme song from "I Love 
Lucy," until his daughter Mia Marie wanders in from her nap. "Yeah, this one," 
he says, pulling his child into his lap, "was born four months premature. I 
could talk to you for hours about that." 
</P>
<P>
And then he begins to recall the filming of "Weeds," the 1987 prison drama 
starring Nick Nolte, which was shot in Stateville, one of the country's 
toughest maximum security prisons, in Joliet, Ill.; actual convicts worked as 
extras. "I remember we shot one scene," says Mantegna, slowly stroking his 
daughter's hair, "and I looked over -- there was Richard Speck -- remember 
Speck, who killed about 20 women in Chicago in the '60s? Behind those eyes 
there was just this killer." 
</P>
<P>
There is a pause. "Yeah, in the 'Godfather' I play a guy who's killed people. 
How do I get to that point?" he asks, looking down at his daughter. "I think 
about what I would do if someone threatened my family. I remember the night she 
was born. The doctor saying 'Sign this paper so we can give her oxygen, but it 
might cause blindness. Now sign this, so we can do this to her, but it might 
cause brain damage,' " he says, looking up. "And there you were thinking you
