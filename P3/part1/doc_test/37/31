There are not many movies that get a round of applause even before they start, 
but "The Godfather Part III" pulled that extraordinary feat as the curtain went 
up in Los Angeles on its first public showing. 
</P>
<P>
In even better news for Paramount Pictures, which has invested at least $58 
million in the highly anticipated sequel, the Wednesday screening produced 
robust applause as the final credits rolled.

<P>
"Without question, this is the one everybody's talking about," said John Krier, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. "Ever since 'Dick Tracy,' all the 
talk has been about 'Godfather.' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael Medved, a reviewer for the television show "Sneak Previews," called the 
movie "impressive. If there was a Medved scale, it would be about a nine." 
</P>
<P>
The film will open Christmas Day on 1,800 screens in the United States and 
Canada.
