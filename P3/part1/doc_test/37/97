It is Halloween, and the deadly double genitives are back. Tearing off
syntactical bandaging, the movies and their titles rise from the laboratory
table.
Two years ago we had to grapple with 'Francis Coppola's Bram Stoker's
Dracula'. Now it is 'Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'. The new
movie opens the London Film Festival this Thursday and crashes on to public
screens the next day.
Since Universal Pictures still owns the one-word titles for the two great
Gothic classics, everyone else has to think up these rolling-stock monikers.
But the Columbia-Branagh Frankenstein, we hear, is fiercer and pithier than
its title. And there is much to look forward to in an acting showdown
between our classical Ken, playing Frankenstein, and America's method
master, Robert De Niro, playing the creature. I shall review the film (still
under wraps from critics) next Thursday.
London's movie epicentre is the Barbican. Their season, just beginning,
boasts everything from Orson Welles' Macbeth to Peter Greenaway's Prospero's
Books via James Cagney in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Grigori Kosintsev's
Hamlet, and - strangest and rarest of all - a 1920s German 'trousers role'
version of Hamlet, starring Asta Nielsen.
On the video trail this week: a second chance to be carried away by
transvestism. In Mrs Doubtfire, Home Alone director Chris Columbus teams up
with American motormouth Robin Williams in the funny tale of a
cross-dressing nanny. For more traditional tastes there is what the
double-possessive movie-title trend would call 'Alan J Pakula's John
Grisham's The Pelican Brief'. The director of Klute meets the best-selling
thriller novelist, guaranteeing frissons in this Florida-set conspiracy
tale, starring Julia Roberts.
Best of all on video is The Piano. What do we call this if we want to give
it double proprietorship? It would have to be Jane Campion's Jane Campion's
The Piano. She wrote and she directed. And she turns the mid-19th century
New Zealand bush into a violently beautiful setting for a mute heroine
(Oscar-winning Holly Hunter) and her baptism in a new emotional world.
Marvellous.
