Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) is going back to Vietnam next month for the first time 
since he won a Medal of Honor there. 
</P>
<P>
Details are still being arranged, but Kerrey plans to go to Vietnam and 
Cambodia and meet with their leaders. Kerrey was a 25-year-old Navy lieutenant 
in Vietnam in 1969 when an enemy attack left him severely wounded, eventually 
resulting in his losing a leg. . . . Al Pacino and girlfriend Diane Keaton flew 
to New York from Italy to attend the funeral of his grandmother, Katie Girado, 
on Thursday. Pacino and Keaton were in Rome filming "Godfather III".
