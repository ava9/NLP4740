'THE GODFATHER PART III' DOESN'T ACHIEVE ITS TOWERING GOALS, BUT THE CAPSTONE 
TO THE CORLEONE SAGA IS STILL ONE OF THE YEAR'S BEST FILMS

"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Corleone in 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather" (1972) 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years, it was an offer Francis Ford Coppola couldn't refuse. In "The 
Godfather Part III" (opening Tuesday citywide), he and Mario Puzo return to 
their franchise: the Corleone Family Saga. Once again, they take up the 
violent, virtuosic, densely detailed epic of gangsters and American society -- 
of omerta and famiglia, bullets and cannoli, blood ties and blood-stained 
vendettas -- that they spun with such staggering aplomb and world-wide impact 
in "The Godfather" (1972) and "The Godfather Part II" (1974). 
</P>
<P>
This new sequel, in which Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to go straight 
and crash the Vatican itself, is another rich, broadly scaled work, shot 
through with brutality and brio. It has arias and grand moments to match either 
of its predecessors: the coldly festive opening at a celebration of a Mafia 
don's charities; a nervous, panoramic Little Italy assassination; a jolting 
comic-violent scene in which Andy Garcia, playing the newest Corleone, faces 
down two would-be assassins who interrupt him in the middle of an assignation. 
</P>
<P>
The movie carries the trilogy's recurring major figure -- Pacino's Michael 
Corleone -- from 1979 to his death, knitting together dozens of old plot 
strands, themes and symbolic motifs. It brings back the original 
cinematographer, Gordon Willis, that virtuoso of deep shadows, metallic 
sunlight and deceptively flat perspectives. It reintroduces a gallery of 
familiar faces -- including sister Connie (Talia Shire), divorced wife Kay 
(Diane Keaton), and ultra-disturbing background figure torpedo Al Neri (Richard 
Bright) -- and drives them toward an operatic climax, where, to the strains of 
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Michael meets a family destiny right out of 
Verdi, Shakespeare or James M. Cain. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, though "Godfather III" is definitely one of the best American movies of 
the year -- a work of high ensemble talent and intelligence, gorgeously mounted 
and crafted, artistically audacious in ways that most American movies don't 
even attempt -- it's still a disappointment. It fails on the highest level. 
It's not the capstone we might have wanted Coppola to make, not quite a fitting 
climax to a series that ranks among the American cinema's most remarkable 
sustained achievements. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter, perhaps, of both script and tone. The first two "Godfathers," 
dominated by Pacino's menacingly passive Michael and by the magisterially 
gravelly croak of Marlon Brando or Robert De Niro as the old and young Don Vito 
Corleone, were violent tales done with incongruous subtlety and discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, in his early 30s, Coppola's narrative style was marvelously 
circumspect. He bathed those earlier films in a tender melancholy, a sense of 
reverie that stood in eerie counterpoint to the lurid events and horrific 
gangland killings. Part I is more boisterous and bloody, Part II more complex, 
poetic and charged with grief. But neither ever seemed to raise a voice 
unnecessarily, or strain for an effect. 
</P>
<P>
Part III, by contrast, has scenes or plot twists -- a flabbergasting helicopter 
attack on a Cosa Nostra commission meeting; the incongruously rapid rise of 
Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Garcia); a Byzantine hive 
of intrigue revealed at the Vatican -- where the tone seems forced, under-felt, 
almost strident. Is that copter rub-out an allusion to the "Ride of the 
Valkyries" in "Apocalypse Now"? What prompts the operatic vocation of Michael's 
son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio), beyond Coppola's own musical family? Why are 
dialogues between the partially reconciled Michael and Kay so bland and 
perfunctory? And how can Michael muster the muscle to stave off attacks from 
other Mafiosi after going completely "legitimate"? 
</P>
<P>
Since "Apocalypse Now," Coppola has changed into a very different filmmaker 
than he was in 1974. Now, he regularly goes for visual opulence, extravagant 
effect; his masterpiece of the '80s was the film noir, German Expressionist, 
neo-realist teen melodrama "Rumble Fish." But "Godfather III," for all its 
obvious quality and visual bravura, lacks the fullness or inevitability of the 
first two films: the ways Coppola and Puzo seemed to skim easily over the 
social and criminal terrain of the first half of the 20th Century. In a way, 
this movie seems to come from a whole different world -- and not simply because 
it's set in 1979, five years after the release of "Godfather II," and 20 years 
after the conclusion of the events it portrays. 
</P>
<P>
In "Godfather III," there's something sad, slightly vacant and dourly dreamy in 
Pacino's eyes as the 59-year-old Michael. Set deep in a bulldog mug, with a 
crew-cut receding back, they're the eyes of a man who'd rather be almost 
anywhere but in his immediate surroundings, a man who -- like the Misfit in 
Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" -- believes "There ain't no 
real pleasure in life." 
</P>
<P>
It's Pacino's face -- its wasted, bitter, ravaged resignation -- that many 
people will recall longest from "Godfather III." And they'll also remember the 
leaner, slicker, more wolfish features of Andy Garcia as the up-and-coming 
new-style don. Garcia seizes the screen here, and gives an explosive, 
tigerishly self-confident performance. Playing Sonny Corleone's short-fused, 
illegitimate son -- who was being conceived in the wedding scene of the first 
"Godfather" -- Garcia creates a tense, narcissistic killer. Unlike Michael, 
he's supremely equipped by instinct to be a gangster: a man of fast reflexes, 
intense ambition and no moral qualms. In his first confrontation with Joey Zaza 
(Joe Mantegna), Michael's successor and rival, Vincent nearly bites off his 
ear. 
</P>
<P>
Pacino, on the other hand, plays Michael as a tough, self-contained pro, 
trapped in gloomy self-examination after a life of brutal, near-reflexive 
decisions and actions. He's rotting inside. His disease -- diabetes -- suggests 
here spiritual as well as physical decay. And, after rising to the top, he's 
now trying to go beyond, to move hundreds of millions of dollars, buy God's 
emissaries and enter Heaven through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Corleone, do you renounce Satan?" a priest asked Michael during the 
baptism of his godson in the first "Godfather," a scene that was shockingly 
intercut with the systematic execution of his enemies. The irony of that 
legendary climax lay in the juxtaposition of outward piety or conformity with 
covert slaughter; an irony carried on even more heavily here, with one church 
scene after another, and Michael actually confessing three decades of crimes to 
the future Pope John Paul I (Raf Vallone). Michael, an outsider in a family of 
gangsters, had become the most dangerous criminal of all: the soured idealist, 
the man who knows and hates evil, but does it anyway. He was the murderer who 
fully accepted Montaigne's maxim, "Hypocrisy is the debt vice pays to virtue.". 
</P>
<P>
There's always been an obvious connection between Coppola and Michael; Coppola 
deliberately played it up in "The Godfather," giving Michael the middle name 
Francis. In "Godfather III," the identification becomes almost eerie. Michael 
is a man from a tight-knit family, risen to the top, living a life of tension 
and near financial ruin, desperately trying to pull away from a business that 
won't let him go. 
</P>
<P>
When Coppola decides to end the film with the possible sacrifice of a child, it 
obviously has personal reverberations. So do Michael's financial takeovers. And 
so does his tight-knit family: Talia Shire's newly icy, resolute fury; the 
artistic aspirations of Anthony; Kay's moral superiority. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola and Puzo notably ignore politics this time around, but as they focus on 
the last ravages of the Corleone family, driven to their dissolution, they also 
create a vast incestuous tangle among the worlds of crime, business, religion 
and art. In this corrupt alliance, only the world of art is presented as 
uncompromised and pure. It's the world that the idealists like Anthony try to 
escape into; it's also a world that, as in the performance of "Cavalleria 
Rusticana," bizarrely mirrors everything that happens outside it. 
</P>
<P>
But religion is just as tainted as the others, polluted by its vast acquisition 
of wealth and power. Coppola and Puzo deliberately play here with references to 
the Vatican Bank scandal, as well as rumors about the possible murder of the 
Pope. "All my life I kept trying to go up in society," Michael remarks to 
Vincent. "Where everything higher up was legal. But the higher I go, the 
crookeder it gets. Where the hell does it end?" 
</P>
<P>
In hell, obviously, which is exactly where "Godfather III" leaves Michael: the 
emotional Hades of a man who has sacrificed the only thing that gave all his 
crimes meaning -- famiglia. In the last shot of the movie, an orange -- a fruit 
that has had numerous sinister connotations through all the episodes of the 
saga -- slips from his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, when he made the first of the "Godfather" movies, Coppola scored an 
unprecedented coup. He seemed to have made a movie that was "Citizen Kane" and 
"Gone With the Wind" simultaneously: a huge blockbuster, biggest of its time, 
that also had depth, social vision and multiple layers of meaning, a film that 
satisfied both the vast pop culture audience and the intelligentsia. For this, 
he became a hero to many film critics, some of whom were all too eager to cast 
him as villain or betrayer -- or fool -- later on. 
</P>
<P>
The Corleone saga was something unusual in gangster movies: a crime epic that 
presented the Mafia family and, especially, their leonine, mumbling patriarch 
Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the kind of sweepingly romantic terms that 
characterized more conventional, affirmative family epics. And part of its vast 
audience obviously ignored Coppola's dark subversion of their image; they found 
the Corleones endearing, Michael almost heroic. Coppola brilliantly used actors 
-- Brando, Pacino, Keaton, Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale and 
the others -- whose sensibility opened up their parts in unique ways. They 
seemed -- still seem -- more like a family of artists than a family of 
criminals. As a group, they had incongruous sensitivity, delicacy and grace -- 
and vulnerability as well. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola didn't cast gangster "types" except in the non-Corleone roles and 
that's what gives the movie its tense undercurrents. The most moving moment in 
all three movies came from the late John Cazale as Fredo in "Godfather II": 
delicate, enervated, reclining painfully beside Michael, who will soon kill 
him, crying out his rage and pain at being passed over. Sweet, ineffectual, 
doomed Fredo didn't belong in the average gangster movie. But then, none of 
them did: not even Caan's Sonny, the hot-headed ladies' man. 
</P>
<P>
But time's passage has destroyed or altered the context in which those first 
two "Godfather" movies were produced -- a momentarily fertile climate for 
offbeat movies in the early '70s -- and replaced it with another, shallower era 
where financial stakes are huge and artistic gambles minimal. The daringly 
structured "Godfather II" probably couldn't be made today, and 16 horrifically 
intense and sometimes brutal years have intervened for Coppola: years filled 
with sudden success, financial catastrophes, spectacular public and artistic 
reversals and family tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, we can sense all of this in the new film. Perhaps because the first 
script was written too hastily, in six weeks instead of the six months Coppola 
requested, the writing is both overly formulaic and strangely unguarded and 
open. Despite frequent rewriting afterward, Coppola hasn't let his attitudes 
and feelings get swallowed up in the material. They keep jutting out: most 
obviously in the way he uses his lightly experienced and miscast daughter Sofia 
(a last-minute replacement for Winona Ryder) as Michael's daughter Mary, 
lavishing an almost defiant paternal affection on every shot. Oddly enough, 
"Godfather III" is in some ways a typical, perhaps too typical, movie sequel 
and, in others, a startlingly confessional film. Real anguish and pain keep 
seeping up through the predictable kinks of the story. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most attractive things about Coppola is the very intensity and range 
of his ambition, the way he wants to be a super-filmmaker, master of 
everything: a fine writer, a visual virtuoso, a technical whiz-bang, a master 
of complex effects and camera movements and an actor's director generating the 
raw, improvisatory magic of a Cassavetes or Scorsese. But sometimes you can't 
be everything, and this movie's major weakness lies in the area that's always 
been one of Coppola's prime assets: his screenwriting. The frequent rewriting 
after the original six-week wonder can't overcome flimsiness or broadness in 
the framework. In the end, "Godfather III" is more conventional than its 
antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
It's inevitable. On short notice, Coppola and Puzo get what you would expect: 
the broad symbolic outlines and motifs and the big "aria" scenes. But they 
haven't been able to tie everything together, fill in all the connections, 
remove scenes that obviously don't work, re-create the seamless embellishment 
and profusion of the earlier films. Six weeks was an offer they should have 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Almost equally damaging: the defection of Robert Duvall, due to a salary 
dispute. In 1974, "Godfather II" also lost Richard Castellano's Clemenza to 
salary demands; Coppola had to kill off the character and give his lines to 
Michael Gazzo's Frankie Pentangeli. But Duvall's Tom Hagen is more crucial than 
Clemenza. As the Corleones' adopted son and consigliere, he's so inextricably 
tied into the whole texture and emotional weave of the story that he's always 
seemed indispensable, perhaps even part of some inevitable, slowly ripening 
climax, a last bloody act where Hagen would play combatant in a final betrayal 
and clash with Michael. Writing Duvall out of the movie seems painfully 
unnecessary. Leaving a priestly son (John Savage's Andrew Hagen) in his place, 
while handing over some of his lines to George Hamilton, as a silken new 
consigliere, is a poor substitute. 
</P>
<P>
In light of all this, it may seem perverse to call "Godfather III" one of the 
year's best American movies. But it is. The brilliance and fertility of 
Coppola's talents and the excellence of his cast and crew pulls him through 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
He's always been a great assembler of talent; if he's a dream-castle builder, 
he's a supremely generous one. Visually, this is the most gorgeous of the three 
"Godfathers"; Willis and production designer Dean Tavoularis have outdone 
themselves. And it's loaded with fascinating moments: Garcia's magnetic 
psychopathology, Pacino's weary pursuit of grace, Eli Wallach's angelic 
duplicities as Don Altobello and, especially, that climactic opera house 
set-piece, with its bravura echoes of "Senso" and Hitchcock's second "The Man 
Who Knew Too Much." And if the movie loses some -- maybe even most -- of the 
battles you wish it had won, it still scores a magnificent final victory by 
rounding out a series that ranks with the most ambitious and extraordinary 
creations in American movies. 
</P>
<P>
When you try so hard for beauty, complexity and richness, you can leave the 
audience with a banquet even when you fail. That's what Coppola does here. The 
problems that afflict him in this compromised "Godfather III" (rated R, for 
sex, violence and language) are ones perhaps endemic to today's big-budget 
moviemaking. Its triumphs are the victories -- perhaps partial but certainly 
precious -- of moviemakers working together, of artistic devotion and ambition, 
of the ensemble, the famiglia. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Godfather" series -- like "Citizen Kane" for Orson Welles -- has perhaps 
been Coppola's crown jewel and also his curse. But, if he hasn't completed it 
perfectly, at least he's completed it with passion. And passion is something 
that should never have a price.
