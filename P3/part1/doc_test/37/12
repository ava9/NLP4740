Waiting for Godfather: Movie buffs who've been waiting 16 years for another 
entry in Francis Coppola's "Godfather" series will have a to wait a little bit 
longer for "The Godfather, Part III." Paramount Pictures has moved the opening 
date of the film from Nov. 21 to Christmas Day. The $50-million-plus gangster 
epic, which reunites Coppola with stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, was shot in 
Italy and New York last winter and spring and recently went back into 
production for two weeks of additional shooting. BETH KLEID
