Stuck for a last-minute Christmas gift for the spouse or kids? 
</P>
<P>
Want to be a trend-setter? Maybe a Chinese potbelly pig is just the thing. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving from China and Vietnam about six years ago, the pint-size 
porkers have become popular in both Northern California and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A bit part in the movie "Air America" helped; so does a co-starring role in one 
of Cal Worthington's car commercials. 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Hupp, a former Encinitas resident now living in Butte County, has his 
way, San Diego County will be the next hot spot. To test the market, he shipped 
two of the mini-swine to a friend in Encinitas, who is advertising for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
For $1,000 you can get either Lotus or Pearl, stout and covered with bristly 
black hair. Maximum adult size: 20 inches tall, 80 pounds, belly almost 
dragging the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, ads buying and selling potbellies fill a column in the Sunday 
newspaper. In Los Angeles, a Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn. has 
formed to ensure that they're treated as pets rather than livestock on such 
matters as zoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the San Diego market is ripe for potbelly pigs," said Hupp, 38, a 
nurse. "They're clean, affectionate and smart." 
</P>
<P>
And a good investment maybe. In Sacramento, a brood sow with good bloodlines 
goes for $3,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Hupp sees the potbelly as the ideal modern pet, even for condo-dwellers: 
quieter than a dog (a soft grunt), more solicitous than a cat, more intelligent 
than goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
True, the potbellies do share a characteristic with their behemoth brethren. On 
warm days, they like to roll around in water or mud. 
</P>
<P>
"You can easily take care of that need with a small wading pool in your back 
yard or porch," Hupp said. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that's a small price to pay for love and loyalty. 
</P>

Role-Playing Psychologist 
</P>
<P>
Movie madness. 
</P>
<P>
* There's always a local angle, even in "Godfather III," which opens on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla psychotherapist Linnda Durre has a bit part in a scene where Al Pacino 
summons other Mafia dons to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Durre plays a floozy cocktail waitress, dressed in gold lame top and stockings, 
tangerine miniskirt and sequined bow tie and hat. Filmed in Cinecitta studio in 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Durre, who had gone to Italy for vacation, got the part through a friend. She 
has studied acting, written a television pilot and attends a comedy workshop in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In between, she does family and marriage counseling. 
</P>
<P>
* Depending on your taste, this is either good or bad news. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, one of the busiest X-rated movie theaters in San Diego was the 
Capri on Park Boulevard in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Then Great American Savings Bank, which had a branch next door, got annoyed 
with its steamy neighbor. It bought the property and booted the operator. 
</P>
<P>
The theater reopened as the Park, showing foreign and artsy fare. 
</P>
<P>
Now San Diego-based Great American has been bought by Wells Fargo. Rumors 
spread that Wells, based in libertine San Francisco, might allow the return of 
more profitable skin flicks. 
</P>
<P>
But a Wells spokesman says no: The theater will remain high-brow. 
</P>

<P>
Betty-Watchers Wait for Bargains 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people interested in buying a transcript of Betty 
Broderick's first murder trial. So far, though, no sales. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, defense attorneys, journalists and the CBS entertainment division 
have shown interest. But nobody wants to buy the first copy and pay full price. 
</P>
<P>
The first copy of the estimated 3,000-page transcript will cost about $6,720. 
Subsequent copies are about $2,520. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the transcript is owned by the court reporter. The amount that can be 
charged per page for a transcript is set by court regulation. 
</P>
<P>
For budget-conscious Betty-watchers, a transcript of just her three days of 
testimony should go for around $500, once the first full transcript is sold.
