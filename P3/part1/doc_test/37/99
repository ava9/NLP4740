More sequels due in coming months: "Halloween V" (from Galaxy), "Leatherface: 
Texas Chainsaw Massacre III" (New Line), "Back to the Future II" (Universal), 
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (Warners), and "Two Jakes," the 
long-awaited sequel to "Chinatown" (Paramount).

<P>
Already talked-about for next summer's slate: "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventure II" (Orion), "48 Hours II" (Paramount), "RoboCop II" (Orion), 
"Gremlins II" (Warners), "Exorcist III: 1990", "Back to the Future III" 
(Universal), and "The Young Guns II" (Fox).

Also planned: "Basket Case 2" (Shapiro/Glickenhaus), "Child's Play II" 
(Universal), "Good Morning Chicago" (Touchstone), "The Rescuers Down Under" 
(Disney), "Ernest Goes to Jail"(Disney), "Three Men and a Little Lady" 
(Touchstone), "The NeverEnding Story II" (Warners), and "Rock and Roll High 
School Forever" (Concorde). 
</P>
<P>
And look at some titles just registered with the MPAA: "Naked Gun II" 
(Paramount), "Action Jackson II" (Warners), "Predator II: Body Count" (Fox), 
and "Die Hard II: The Taking of Los Angeles International" -- an alternate 
title for "Die Harder" (Fox). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talk persists about a possible "Batman II" and a follow-up to "9 1/2 
Weeks." And "Godfather III" (Paramount) is casting. 
</P>
<P>
And while "Highlander" grossed a mere $5.6 million domestically for Fox, it 
took in $100 million internationally. That's why director Russell Mulcahy and 
actor Christopher Lambert are reteaming for . . . "Highlander II." Pat H.
