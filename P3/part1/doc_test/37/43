LIZ SMITH: EATING OUT OF CARTONS -- IT'S AN ALL-TIME NO-NO

"NEVER, NEVER eat anything out of a carton, even if you are at home alone with 
the shades drawn. Doing so is wicked and constitutes Miss Manners' one 
exception to the generally genial rule about violations of etiquette not 
counting if you don't get caught," writes Judith Martin. 
</P>
<P>
So now we know why the Corleone family of "The Godfather" films has had so much 
trouble in its dynasty. It all probably stems from "eating Chinese takeout" 
from cartons in that famous scene from the first movie. 
</P>
<P>
And that's nothing. Frank Sinatra's late mother used to rebuke him for drinking 
from the milk carton while standing in the cool shadow of the refrigerator. 
Dolly Sinatra knew her "Miss Manners" stuff, you see. 
</P>
<P>
THE MOST coveted role in Hollywood for any young actor is the lead in Tim 
Burton's next movie, "Edward Scissorhand," for 20th Century Fox. (It will be 
Burton's first movie since the sensational "Batman.") 
</P>
<P>
The star is to be Johnny Depp of TV's "21 Jump Street," and he'll do his acting 
during a series hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN DENNIS MET MEG -- The delightful Meg Ryan and the divine Dennis Quaid, 
those co-stars of "D.O.A." and "Innerspace," are engaged -- formally. Their 
long-playing off-screen romance seems to have reached a more serious phase. 
</P>
<P>
NOW ABOUT "Steel Magnolias." My pal Pia Lindstrom insists it's a movie that 
people will enjoy, provided they never saw the brilliant off-Broadway play by 
Robert Harling. I'm not sure. I think it's the most overwrought cinema in 
recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is half way over before it settles down enough that you can 
understand what the actors are saying. By then you have a terrible headache. 
The actors don't interact; they seem each to be doing some individual thing. I 
know Ray Stark, Herb Ross and writer Harling felt they had to "open up" the 
play, but they've sunk it under big-screen, epic entertainment values. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, however, is for the most part, fascinating. Dolly Parton rises above 
everything; she is subdued, simple, believable and simply great as the beauty 
shop owner. Shirley MacLaine is excellent once they let her quit screaming and 
dragging a big dog around as in her chaotic entrance. Olympia Dukakis is 
wonderful but seems to be in a Noel Coward drawing room comedy. Daryl Hannah 
plays well against her sexy image as the "born again" beauty operator. 
</P>
<P>
I was disappointed by the all-important relationship between the mother (Sally 
Field) and the saintly daughter (Julia Roberts.) This is crucial to the plot, 
but I felt the most they convey is the usual mother-daughter squabbling. And 
Julia is more like a spoiled brat than a girl whose sweetness touches all 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
So, I'd say go see the play, one of the best ever of its kind. Then see the 
movie, just so you'll be able to shake your head at how Tri-Star missed the 
boat by a Louisiana country mile.
