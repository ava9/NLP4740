* The long-awaited sequel to "The Godfather" (1972) and "The Godfather -- Part 
II" (1974), both Oscar-winners as Best Picture, will finally reach movie 
screens on Christmas Day. Superstar Al Pacino reprises his character of Michael 
Corleone, with Andy Garcia in the role of Pacino's illegitimate nephew.

Born in Cuba, Garcia was 5 when his parents moved to Miami in 1961. While his 
family built a multimillion-dollar fragrance empire, the handsome young man was 
bitten by the acting bug. His career includes the films "A Show of Force," 
"Stand and Deliver," and "The Untouchables," as well as television and stage 
appearances.

* The newly released $35-million movie epic, "Havana," is a love story set 
against the 1959 Cuban Revolution. It stars Robert Redford as a gambler whose 
life is changed when he becomes involved with an aristocratic revolutionary's 
wife, played by Lena Olin. Raul Julia co-stars. During the filming in the 
Dominican Republic, Redford expressed his desire to learn Spanish to "have more 
contact with Latin America." The actor, who has directed such movies as 
"Milagro Beanfield War," added, "There are many films coming out of Latin 
American countries that don't carry big budgets but which are of undeniable 
quality."

* An L.A.-based singer, "rapper" Que Pasa, is making a splash in the Latino 
recording industry. His hit "Mami yo te quiero" ("Mommy, I Love You") is in the 
Top 10 in several Spanish-speaking countries, reaching number one in Argentina 
and Chile. Que Pasa was born in Venezuela and raised in the United States. 
After graduating from college, he worked as a sound engineer before switching 
to a recording career. Unlike traditional "rap" music, Que Pasa's songs combine 
traditional Latino rhythms, lyrics and instrumentation, making for a very 
distinct new sound. ELENA KELLNER
