JACK'S LIFE; A BIOGRAPHY OF JACK NICHOLSON by Patrick McGilligan Hutchinson
Pounds 18.99, 475 pages
The oddest thing about Jack Nicholson's superstardom is the way it began; or
rather for ten years did not begin. From the late 1950s to the late '60s any
fan of bargain-basement American cinema could have seen this actor in any
number of lead roles. I did myself. But dashed if I or anyone I knew back
then ever picked him out for major stardom.
He was principle juvenile in Corman's The Raven and The Terror (both 1963);
lead cowboy in two back-to-back Monte Hellman Westerns, The Shooting and
Ride In The Whirlwind (1966); prominent biker in Hell's Angels On Wheels
(1967). In every role he was the same, combining the forgettable good looks
of a young Bob Cummings (remember him?) with the acting ability of a plank
of wood.
But when Nicholson played a supporting part in Easy Rider in 1969 - the
twangy, worldweary Southern lawyer - he became an overnight sensation. Up
went the salary; up went the living altitude; and up went the adrenalin of
Hollywood gossip writers, sensing new copy in this fast-living,
slow-talking, high-rolling man from absolutely nowhere.
Patrick McGilligan's entertaining, well-researched book spares little in the
matter of cocaine, womanising and the rest. Much of this, though, is
born-again newspaper stuff, skilfully re-assembled. The real piece de
resistance is the account of Nicholson's childhood and genealogy.
He was brought up by a grandmother masquerading as his mother, even though
his real mother was alive and around. He grew up amid a sea of relatives,
mostly females beginning with 'E'. (Try to keep up with the Ellas, Emmas and
Ethel Mays). And his real father - well, who was his real father? Was it
John J. Nicholson or Eddie King or (shortest odds) Don Furcillo-Rose, who
lived and apparently still lives in New Jersey and has yet to meet his
probable son.
This is all grist to the legend, which as with all stars is more interesting
than the facts. As the great bad boy of modern American cinema, Nicholson
would have to have been born on the wrong side of the sheets. As a late
starter, who needed the right off-kilter role before maturing, he had to
have had all that multiple mothering. And as a chameleon actor capable of
every colour from antic mockery (Batman) to high emotionalism (Five Easy
Pieces, A Few Good Men) to Stanislavskian self-effacement (Ironweed), he had
to have all that warring Irish-American-European ancestry in his genes.
Rich as McGilligan's material is, one has to quibble that a whole,
consistent portrait of its subject never quite appears. There are finally
too many Nicholsons. On one page he is a pleasure-seeker who uses and abuses
women and friends, much as he uses and abuses certain substances. On
another, he is he a control freak and right-wing homophobe. Now he is an
instinctive actor, now a cerebral one; now a miser, now a spendthrift.
Greatest riddle of all: is he a Citizen Kane imprisoned by his own wealth
and fame or a Jolly Jack Star, riotously indifferent to the protocols of
celebrity?
The guessing game keeps us reading, but by final page we are still guessing.
Does it matter? Not much. En route there is plenty to enjoy and to take home
to form your own theories. I loved the account of Nicholson's Z-movie
apprenticeship under the mythic Corman: one of whose cost-saving devices was
to tear apart a script, giving each actor just his own bit. I hung on, as if
to some compulsive soap opera, to the will-they-won't-they-find-happiness
romance of Jack and Anjelica Huston (sometimes ill proof-read as Angelica).
And a collector of filmic tittle-tattle could dine out for life on tales of
the plum roles Nicholson rejected en route to stardom: from Jay Gatsby to
Michael Corleone in The Godfather.
It is only when McGilligan reaches for the final brushstroke or the Big
Statement that the book wobbles. Or when the writer draws himself up for
some clinching epigram on aesthetics. On Nicholson's three admittedly
non-brilliant attempts at directing - Drive He Said, Goin' South, The Two
Jakes - McGilligan says: 'He did not lead a structured life. He could hardly
be expected to make a structured film.'
Ah - really? Dear Vincent Van Gogh (or William Blake or Orson Welles or
Fyodor Dostoevsky), You do not lead a structured life, so you can hardly be
expected . . .
