MOVIES: WHILE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS MAKE THEIR LAST RUNS, THE STUDIOS ARE GEARING 
UP FOR FALL WITH MORE ADULT-THEMED, PRESTIGIOUS FILMS. HOPES ARE HIGH FOR 
RINGING UP BIG NUMBERS.

<P>
Ah, fall . . . . 
</P>
<P>
An adult can safely venture back to the movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The body-count films of summer yield their spaces for more thoughtful and 
prestigious fare. 
</P>
<P>
Generalizations? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Any season that features work by such stellar directors as Martin 
Scorsese, Barry Levinson, Mike Nichols, James Ivory and Philip Kaufman, to name 
a few, leads to higher expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Films do change in the fall," said Tom Sherak, 20th Century Fox's marketing 
and distribution president. "The material seems to get more upscale, more 
adult." 
</P>
<P>
"Fall is within striking distance of the awards," added Greg Morrison, Pathe 
International's president of worldwide marketing, noting that historically, a 
preponderance of the films receiving nominations are late fall/Christmas-season 
releases. "If you open much earlier than fall, it's very difficult to get the 
loop-line going to the end-of-the-year awards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As summer wanes, fading fast are those $100 million-plus box-office 
blockbusters: "Pretty Woman," "Total Recall," "Ghost," "Die Hard 2" and "Dick 
Tracy." Not to mention those "lesser-grossing" films and sequels: "Days of 
Thunder," "RoboCop 2," "Gremlins 2," "The Two Jakes," "Another 48 HRS.," "Young 
Guns 2" and "Back to the Future, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, "lesser grossing" is a relative term. When a film's budget is high, 
like the $50 million to $55 million "Days of Thunder," and it grosses $76.9 
million (to date) during summer, a good number of film executives have been 
known to become squeamish. They'd rather place their bets on a lower costing 
film that has a potential of generating income several times over the cost -- 
the kind of movie more typical of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Among last year's examples, Tri-Star's low budget "Look Who's Talking," 
released in October, went on to gross $138 million and is still earning revenue 
in the home-video market; the September release of the Al Pacino starrer, 
Universal's "Sea of Love," did $57 million in business. 
</P>
<P>
This fall's first big weekend arrives Sept. 14 with the release of three highly 
anticipated films, starring a slew of stars, ranging from Clint Eastwood to 
Meryl Streep to Jeff Bridges. The "season" ends mid-November, when the first of 
the Christmas holiday pictures arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall leaves barely turn and we're already ringing Christmas bells," 
chuckled Pathe's Morrison, whose company releases films through MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the holiday season is more and more encroaching on what was 
traditionally considered fall. This year, several of the larger holiday-size 
movies, such as "Rocky V: The Final Bell" starring Sylvester Stallone, and 
"Kindergarten Cop" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, are scheduled for release 
the week before Thanksgiving Day. They will be followed by Francis Coppola's 
"The Godfather Part III," opening Nov. 21, the day before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, back to September: 
</P>
<P>
Looming large on the horizon is Eastwood's portrayal/impersonation of the late 
John Huston in Eastwood's "White Hunter, Black Heart" (Warner Bros., Sept. 14), 
a film adaptation of Peter Viertel's thinly disguised novel about the making of 
"The African Queen." Jeff Fahey, George Dzundza and Marisa Berenson also star 
in this film about a brilliant and erratic filmmaker obsessed with hunting an 
African elephant. 
</P>
<P>
More drama set against a filmmaking background will come in "Postcards From the 
Edge" (Columbia, Sept. 14), Mike Nichols' film adaptation of Carrie Fisher's 
semi-autobiographical novel about a mother-daughter relationship in Hollywood. 
The film stars Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
"Texasville" (Columbia, Sept. 14), the sequel to 1971's Oscar-winning "The Last 
Picture Show," reunites Peter Bogdanovich with such original cast members as 
Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Eileen Brennan, Cloris Leachman 
and Randy Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
In "GoodFellas" (Warner, Sept. 21), director Scorsese and star Robert De Niro 
reteam to tell yet another true story, based on Nicholas Pileggi's book 
"Wiseguy," of a Brooklyn kid "adopted" by neighborhood gangsters and raised as 
a member of their crime family. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Joe Pesci and Paul 
Sorvino co-star for producer Irwin Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
Psychological terror drives three films this fall. In "Pacific Heights" (Fox, 
Sept. 28) a tenant, Matthew Modine, terrorizes landlords Melanie Griffith and 
Michael Keaton. John Schlesinger directs this true-story thriller. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Desperate Hours" (MGM/UA, Sept. 28), Michael Cimino's remake of the 
1955 chiller, Mickey Rourke assumes the Humphrey Bogart role of the escaped 
convict who holds a family captive. Anthony Hopkins, Mimi Rogers, Lindsay 
Crouse and Kelly Lynch also star. 
</P>
<P>
Another feature in an autobiographical mode is Barry Levinson's "Avalon" 
(Tri-Star, Oct. 5), a saga based loosely on his own immigrant family's pursuit 
of the American dream through three generations. The ensemble cast includes 
Elizabeth Perkins, Joan Plowright, Aidan Quinn, Leo Fuchs and Lou Jacobi. 
</P>
<P>
Using the journals of Anais Nin, writer-director Philip Kaufman explores a 
real-life sexual awakening in "Henry and June" (Universal, October), in which a 
young woman is torn among her husband, author Henry Miller and Miller's exotic 
and mysterious wife. Fred Ward, Uma Thurman, Maria de Medeiros, Richard E. 
Grant and Kevin Spacey star. 
</P>
<P>
"Memphis Belle" (Warner, Oct. 12) marks the first film from British producer 
David Puttnam since his departure as head of Columbia Pictures. Matthew Modine, 
Eric Stoltz, John Lithgow, D.B. Sweeney and Billy Zane star in this drama about 
American airmen who flew a B-17 bomber during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
One widely heralded independent from the film festival circuit is "To Sleep 
With Anger" (Samuel Goldwyn, Oct. 19), a contemporary drama written and 
directed by Charles Burnett. Danny Glover stars as a seemingly benevolent 
visitor whose presence precipitates a clash of values and loyalties in a black 
Los Angeles family. 
</P>
<P>
From the Coen brothers -- Joel (writer-director) and Ethan (writer) -- comes 
"Miller's Crossing" (Fox, Oct. 5), a 1929 tale of the political and gang 
warfare in an Eastern city which erupts from a shattered friendship. Gabriel 
Byrne, Albert Finney and John Turturro star. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grifters" (Miramax, Nov 9), another Scorsese production -- which he 
produced for director Stephen Frears -- brings to the screen a yarn by Jim 
Thompson, whose novels about criminal personalities have long fascinated 
filmmakers. John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and Anette Bening star in this 
exploration of the world of con artists. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck plays an American cowboy who must battle man and nature in "Quigley 
Down Under" (MGM/UA Oct. 19), an Australian Western directed by "Lonesome 
Dove's" Simon Wincer. Laura San Giacomo plays a mysterious woman who thinks 
Quigley is a ghost named Roy. 
</P>
<P>
In the suspense film "Jacob's Ladder" (Tri-Star, Nov. 2), strange visions haunt 
a Vietnam vet who fears for his sanity. Adrian Lyne directs Tim Robbins, 
Elizabeth Pena and Danny Aiello in this tale of military experiments and 
psychological terror. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish and Ireland figure in several films. In the political thriller 
"Hidden Agenda" (Hemdale, late October), director Ken Loach focuses on an 
investigation into the murder of an American human-rights worker. In "Fools of 
Fortune" (New Line, Sept. 14), directed by Pat O'Connor, Julie Christie and 
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star in a family saga set within the Irish 
rebellion against England. 
</P>
<P>
In "State of Grace" (Orion, Oct. 5), directed by Phil Joanou, Sean Penn plays a 
man who returns to his Hell's Kitchen neighborhood where he must choose between 
the cold-blooded Irish street gang of his youth and his family and girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
In his political thriller "The Man Inside" (New Line, Oct. 26), writer-director 
Bobby Roth tells the true story of German investigative reporter Gunter 
Wallraff and his undercover operation that exposed the corrupt practices of his 
country's leading newspaper. Jurgen Prochnow, Peter Coyote and Nathalie Baye 
head an international cast. 
</P>
<P>
In a different kind of political thriller, "Life and Nothing But" (Orion 
Classics, Sept./Oct.), Bertrand Tavernier dramatically explores the question of 
who really lies beneath Paris' Arc de Triomphe in the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier. Such previous Tavernier players as Philippe Noiret and Sabine Azema 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hackman and Anne Archer get trapped aboard a train carrying hit men out to 
kill them in "Narrow Margin" (Tri- Star, Sept. 21), a thriller directed by 
Peter Hyams. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In "The Hot Spot" (Orion, Sept. 21), Don Johnson plays a drifter who becomes 
involved with two disturbing desirable women, Virginia Madsen and Jennifer 
Connelly. Dennis Hopper directs this tale of a dangerous triangle.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Wrong names -- Carl Reiner was mistakenly identified as director of "Object of 
Beauty" in an article in Wednesday's Calendar. Reiner is the director of 
Columbia Pictures' upcoming "Sibling Rivalry." Michael Keaton will play the bad 
guy in "Pacific Heights"; Matthew Modine will play another role. Universal's 
"Kindergarten Cop" was listed as a pre-Thanksgiving release. Its scheduled 
opening is Dec. 14.
