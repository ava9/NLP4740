PRODUCER ROBERT EVANS INVOKES 5TH AT HEARING IN MURDER CASE

"Cotton Club" producer Robert Evans, the first witness in a preliminary hearing 
into the 6-year-old murder of Broadway entrepreneur Roy Radin, took the witness 
stand Friday just long enough to invoke his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know a man by the name of Roy Radin?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the advice of counsel, I refuse to answer the question," answered the 
tanned, dapper producer of such film classics as "Chinatown" and the 
"Godfather" movies. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute debate that followed, in and outside of Municipal Judge Patti Jo 
McKay's chambers, set the stage for a Monday morning showdown between Conn and 
Evans' attorney, Robert Shapiro, over the question that has hung over Evans 
since last October: 
</P>
<P>
Is the 58-year-old former head of Paramount Pictures a suspect in the 
cocaine-related shooting death of Radin on March 13, 1983, in a remote canyon 
in the northeast corner of Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
Judge McKay warned Shapiro that Evans might be jailed for contempt if she finds 
him to be improperly invoking his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Three men and a woman, alleged cocaine dealer Karen Jacobs Greenberger, have 
been formally charged in the execution-style killing of Radin. One defendant, 
Robert Lowe, 42, remains in custody in Maryland where he is fighting 
extradition. The other defendants are ex-security guards William Mentzer and 
Alex Marti. 
</P>
<P>
In a public statement last October, shortly after the arrests of Marti, Mentzer 
and Greenberger, Conn refused to rule Evans out as a suspect in the murder. 
Since then, news articles, television programs and magazine studies have 
explored virtually every aspect of what has come to be called the "Cotton Club 
case." 
</P>
<P>
"This audience is filled with writers and reporters for one reason and one 
reason only," Shapiro told Judge McKay, motioning toward the packed spectator 
benches of her courtroom. "Mr. Evans is here . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Evans himself has remained silent about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports filed in support of search warrants in the case indicate that at 
least two potential witnesses implicated Evans in the murder. According to the 
reports, Evans was believed to have entered into a pact with Greenberger to 
hire Mentzer, Marti and Lowe to kill Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Radin, a corpulent theatrical promoter from Long Island, had struck a deal with 
Evans to raise $2 million for production of feature films, including "Cotton 
Club," according to court records. According to the prosecution, Greenberger 
sought to become a partner in the deal. After being squeezed out, she allegedly 
plotted Radin's murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Detailed 
</P>
<P>
In a letter attorney Shapiro had hand-delivered to Conn on Tuesday, the lawyer 
detailed Evans' cooperation with the Radin murder inquiry from its inception in 
1983. He warned that Evans would not testify as a witness for the prosecution 
until Conn rules Evans out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like something you'd see in a movie," Shapiro said outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Conn refused comment on Evans' status as a suspect. He said he did not have 
"sufficient evidence" to file charges against Evans, but also declined to offer 
him immunity from prosecution. He told McKay he believes Evans does not want to 
testify because "it involves an episode in his life that he may look back upon 
with regret." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the murder, Evans was deeply in debt from his involvement in the 
$42-million "Cotton Club" movie. He also had an admitted history of cocaine 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Evans recently began a comeback in film production after a five-year hiatus 
following the disappointing release of "Cotton Club." In addition to an 
executive producer credit on "The Two Jakes" sequel to "Chinatown," which stars 
Jack Nicholson and is now filming in Valencia, Evans is also distributing a 
home video documentary on the life and times of Pope John Paul II entitled "The 
Planet Is Alive."
