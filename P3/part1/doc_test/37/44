Rumor Mill?There is no truth to the rumor that producer Fred Roos was fired off 
the set of "Godfather III" in Rome Monday, the film's publicist, Don Levy, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox television news reported Monday night that director Francis Ford Coppola 
fired his longtime friend and colleague Roos from the set, and demanded that he 
leave Rome, and the New York Post announced the same thing on Tuesday. But Levy 
said that he spoke to Roos in Rome after the reports and Roos confirmed that 
there is "absolutely, unequivocally" no truth to them. "It was just a little 
rumor bubble taking off," Levy said. SHAUNA SNOW
