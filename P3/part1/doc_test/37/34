David Kirkpatrick, a onetime screenwriter who moved into the executive ranks, 
appears to be next in line for the co-presidency of Paramount Pictures, a 
high-profile post that Sidney Ganis is expected to vacate soon. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis and studio Chairman Frank Mancuso have been negotiating Ganis' exit for 
more than a week, according to a source at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The co-president, who is 50 and has two years remaining under his employment 
contract with Paramount, is expected to remain with the studio as a consultant 
and an independent producer, according to studio sources. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis didn't return a call seeking comment. Kirkpatrick also declined comment. 
A Paramount spokeswoman said: "This is all speculation, and we can't comment on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Ganis' departure began circulating in July, when Kirkpatrick left 
Walt Disney Co. to join Paramount as executive vice president. Kirkpatrick was 
given extensive authority over filmmaking when he joined the studio, and he 
quickly pushed Ganis aside in what some Hollywood observers described as a 
classic power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry sources expressed surprise that Paramount would put film 
production in the hands of Kirkpatrick, rather than a better-known executive 
such as former Paramount President Ned Tanen. "To have David and a bunch of 
kids running the studio isn't going to send the right message to Wall Street," 
one top talent agent said of the 38-year-old Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Tanen, who is 59, stayed on as a consultant to Paramount after resigning the 
presidency but has repeatedly told associates that he isn't interested in 
returning to an executive role. He didn't return a call Monday seeking comment 
on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso, 56, is said to have taken a much stronger hand in script and casting 
decisions at Paramount over the past several weeks, and some insiders 
speculated Monday that Mancuso would continue to involve himself more directly 
in movie decisions under a Kirkpatrick regime. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis, who came to Paramount after working as marketing vice president and 
principal aide to filmmaker George Lucas at his Marin County ranch, has been 
blamed by some in Hollywood for weakening Paramount's standing in the creative 
community during his two-year tenure as co-president. Several agents and 
producers have complained that the former marketing chief is indecisive and 
slow to act and that his cost-cutting efforts alienated some talent. (Paramount 
marketing and distribution chief Barry London is the other co-president.) 
</P>
<P>
Ganis didn't have strong relations with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, two 
of the most successful producers on the Paramount lot, and had argued against 
signing their lucrative production deal last year. But he is close to Francis 
Ford Coppola, among other filmmakers, and even as the studio's marketing chief 
he argued strongly in favor of producing "Tucker" to lure the director into 
making "The Godfather, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Ganis partisans maintain that he was unfairly blamed for Paramount's problems. 
They say, for instance, that Paramount's tough business affairs department 
repeatedly undermined him. "Sid made many decisions that business affairs 
overruled," one defender said. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis is given much of the credit for shepherding the studio's big summer hit 
"Ghost" through the studio. So far, "Ghost," the second-biggest hit of the 
year, has grossed $148 million. Ganis projects still in the Paramount pipeline 
include "Regarding Henry," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Harrison Ford, 
and "Dead Again," directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick has a reputation as being an aggressive executive and a savvy -- 
some say savage -- political player. But with filmmakers, he maintains a gentle 
touch -- too gentle for Disney's tastes, where his hands-off approach to movie 
making drew some criticism from fellow executives. 
</P>
<P>
This is Kirkpatrick's third tour of duty at Paramount. He began as a story 
analyst there after graduating from California Institute of Arts in 1974 and 
writing a screenplay called "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase," which was 
produced by New World in 1976 under the title "Dynamite Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Even as a story analyst in 1979, Kirkpatrick was writing scripts on the side. 
"Screenwriting was his first goal," recalled screenwriter Larry Wilson, who 
worked with Kirkpatrick at the time. 
</P>
<P>
He left Paramount to work with independent producer Sidney Beckerman at United 
Artists, then returned to Paramount in 1982 as executive director of 
production. At Paramount, he was the executive in charge of Eddie Murphy's 
films -- including "Beverly Hills Cop" -- and dealt routinely with Simpson and 
Bruckheimer, particularly on "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick left Paramount to join Weintraub Entertainment Group's film 
division, where he worked under Guy McElwaine, then chairman of the division. 
At Weintraub, Kirkpatrick oversaw an ill-starred slate that included "Fresh 
Horses" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick's career moves of late haven't happened quietly. When he left for 
Weintraub Entertainment in 1987, Paramount sued him for breach of contract. 
(The suit was later settled with a Kirkpatrick payment to the studio.) When he 
returned to Paramount this year, Disney sued him, claiming that Kirkpatrick had 
broken an agreement by trying to hire away one of its executives and by using 
internal information to interfere with a Disney production. Kirkpatrick is 
contesting the suit.
