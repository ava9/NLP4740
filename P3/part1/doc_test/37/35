A witness in the "Cotton Club" preliminary hearing testified Tuesday that a 
defendant in the case told him that former Paramount Pictures production chief 
Robert Evans and a reputed Florida cocaine dealer were the two people 
responsible for ordering the 1983 murder of New York theatrical producer Roy 
Radin. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Evans branded the testimony "an outrageous lie." 
</P>
<P>
William Rider, a brother-in-law of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, 
answered "yes" to each of Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn's questions regarding 
secretly taped conversations with one of the accused killers, William Molony 
Mentzer, during the fifth week of the Radin murder hearing in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Mr. Mentzer indicate to you that anyone else was involved in the killing 
of Mr. Radin?" Conn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Greenberger and Robert Evans," answered Rider, referring to the producer 
and to Karen DeLayne Greenberger, the reputed narcotics dealer and a defendant 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he say what their involvement was?" Conn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, essentially that they paid for the contract," Rider said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who is currently co-producing a sequel to "Chinatown" called "Two 
Jakes," could not be reached for comment. Evans was called as the prosecution's 
first witness, but refused to answer a single question. On advice of his 
defense attorney, Robert Shapiro, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that Bob Evans did not pay for it," Shapiro said in a phone 
interview Tuesday. "Any statement by anyone to the contrary is an outrageous 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro and Evans have maintained that the former Hollywood wunderkind would be 
willing to testify if Conn would guarantee Evans immunity from prosecution, but 
the prosecutor has never ruled him out as a suspect in the case. On Tuesday, 
Conn again refused to rule Evans out as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob (Evans) is getting killed in the press and he's totally innocent," Shapiro 
said. "We can't even cross-examine." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rider's statement implicating Evans marked the first time that 
testimony in open court linked the producer to Radin's murder, reports of 
Rider's claims first surfaced last year. The Times reported several weeks after 
the arrests of the four Radin co-defendants that Rider had told investigators 
that both Greenberger and Evans were involved in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Rider, who is being paid $3,000 a month by the district attorney under terms of 
the Witness Protection Program, claims that he fears for his life and the 
safety of his family as a result of his cooperation with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during Tuesday's testimony, Rider disclosed that he has a 
concealed weapon permit and carries a gun for protection. Judge Patti Jo McKay 
called a short recess during which Rider and his two Sheriff's Department 
bodyguards disappeared into a side room briefly, apparently to determine that 
Rider was not carrying a gun in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taped Conversations 
</P>
<P>
Rider told of a series of surreptitiously taped conversations that he had with 
Mentzer and two other suspects, Robert Lowe and Robert Deremer, from May 
through September of last year. In those conversations, which Rider turned over 
to sheriff's homicide investigators, Mentzer boasted of killing Radin and doing 
so at the behest of Greenberger and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"Radin was trying to be . . . a movie producer," Mentzer told Rider on one of 
the tapes played during Tuesday's court session. "He was selling drugs, he was 
selling drugs and, ya know, he did more than he sold, I think. And, uh, ya 
know, when he met Bob Evans, ya know, and Elaine Jacobs (Greenberger) 
introduced him to Bob Evans -- at that time Bob Evans was the biggest producer 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when Radin was driven to a desolate canyon in northeast Los Angeles 
County and shot to death, Evans was, indeed, one of the most successful film 
makers in Hollywood history, boasting a string of hits that began during his 
decade as Paramount production chief and included "Love Story," "Chinatown," 
both "Godfather" films and "Rosemary's Baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Meeting 
</P>
<P>
It was his independent venture -- "The Cotton Club" -- with director Francis 
Ford Coppola and screenwriters William Kennedy and Mario Puzo in 1983 that 
brought about Evans' association with Radin and Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Following a string of box office failures, Evans was having trouble coming up 
with the financing for his story of the notorious 1930s Harlem nightclub. 
According to testimony, he met Greenberger through a limousine driver who, in 
turn, introduced Evans to Radin. Radin subsequently signed a deal with Evans 
promising to raise $35 million to make "Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Greenberger hired Mentzer, Lowe and Alex Lamota Marti to 
kill Radin because the 33-year-old Long Island producer cut Greenberger out of 
the movie deal.
