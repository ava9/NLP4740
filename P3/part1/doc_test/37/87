FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: The great fame drain - British cinema talent is being
colonised by a predatory Hollywood. But, argues Nigel Andrews, we should
simply lie back and enjoy it

Colin Welland, waving that famous statuette, said 'the British are coming'.
But the Chariots Of Fire Oscar triumph was 15 years ago. More recently, the
British have indeed been coming, all over the movie landscape, but not quite
in the way envisaged by Welland.
A select committee of British MPs on a fact-finding visit last week to
Hollywood were reported to have been told by Steven Spielberg: 'There is no
British film industry.' Half a generation after our cinema thought it would
conquer the world by sitting tight and making home-bred history epics, we
have replaced a dominion movie culture with a diaspora movie culture. Many
British films, directors and actors now find themselves in the position of
being lucrative exports without any early life in a British factory or
warehouse.
Look at yesterday's key players. Richard Attenborough has returned to his
acting roots to make Jurassic Park and the forthcoming Christmas film
Miracle On 34th Street, after falling gently down the ladder of directorial
bankability from Cry Freedom to Shadowlands. And the Chariots
writer-producer duo of Colin Welland and David Puttnam have released a
humble childrens' comedy, The War Of The Buttons, with about as much Oscar
potential as an episode of Jackanory.
Meanwhile two of British cinema's one-time traitors and fugitives have
returned to become its all-hailed messiahs. The gone-Hollywood brothers
Ridley and Tony Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Top Gun, True Romance) have
bought Shepperton Studios, with the aim of turning it into an England-based
blast kiln for international cinema.
With luck this move - and its symbolic imprimatur for anti-nationalist
adventurism - will see the end of siege mentality cinema forever in this
country. By free movement in and out of other nations and cultures, British
cinema is creating a virtual new renaissance.
In many cases individual British movies and actors find that by going to
America first - followed by the rest of the world - they can make an
international impact almost before home audiences have heard of them. Four
Weddings And A Funeral, which opened in the US several weeks before its UK
release, has just become the most commercially successful British film of
all time. Why the jackpot? Because the film jumped straight into a foreign
market, rightly suspecting that selling itself to an outsiders' view of
Britain was better than selling itself direct to Britain herself.
If Weddings had opened first at home we might have dismissed it - knowing
our country too well - as a frothy piece of anyone-for-tennis comedy
romance. America and other countries, allowed a first glimpse, decided to
see it as quintessential Britain: as a mini-genre - the silly ass comedy -
gone mythic.
What director Mike Newell had done, much as Ridley and Tony Scott and other
Anglos had done to Hollywood's own action thrillers or sci-fi films, was to
raise the style stakes so that a little timeless archetypalism (even a
little post-modern preposterousness) upstaged or transcended the realism.
It is not just British films and directors, it is British actors that
America - and a world movie public following America - are now picking off
the remaindered shelves of British indifference.
For years Hugh Grant, formerly of Maurice (1987) and A Handful Of Dust
(1988), ranked nowhere as a movie presence. His comic potential was ignored
by most fellow Brits even in Bitter Moon, a highly promising trial run for
Four Weddings. In America, after Weddings opened, Grant's face launched a
thousand popularity polls and graced a dozen magazine covers. Once again
foreign eyes and ears had sensed a distilled and perfect 'Britishness' that
we were deaf and blind to.
It is part of a swelling tide of Anglophilia to which British cinema would
be foolish to play Canute, or to complain that we are 'selling out' to other
people's caricaturing vision of us.
Grant is rare only in being a nice chap in a British casting directory -
nay, an entire export industry - largely dominated by nasty chaps. Hollywood
comes to us for its villains. These have included Alan Rickman (Die Hard,
Robin Hood), Anthony Hopkins (Silence Of The Lambs), Jeremy Irons (Reversal
Of Fortune, The Lion King), Charles Dance (Last Action Hero) and Stuart
Wilson (No Escape), to name but the vanguard. (Actresses, nice or nasty,
export more slowly. But Emma Thompson is currently up there above-the-title
with Arnie, Danny De Vito and company.).
Why are the foreigners going for this new improved Brit pack? Partly because
our actors, theatre-honed, offer a performance panache increasingly
unavailable among American stars, who are either riddled with
late-generation Method tics (Hoffman, De Niro, Pacino) or branded with I for
Iconic Inanition (Schwarzenegger, Stallone).
But it may also be because Britain today is a uniquely placed buffer
culture. These pedigree toffs of ours, moving between suave villainy and
lovable silliness, belong to a country itself poised, in the dangerous days
of Gatt, between the moustache-twirlers of Europe and the honest folk back
in America.
In an age when the US is terrified of being left behind in the Great
Classiness Handicap, with Europe's countries banding together to cock a
high-culture snook at the new world, a love-hate romance is growing in
Hollywood with the one common-language country that US movies can recruit to
represent the old world's values for the new. Euro-awareness may also be why
Scorsese in The Age Of Innocence and Coppola in Dracula and Spielberg in
Schindler's List are increasingly turning to Euro-tinged subjects.
So while Hollywood seizes on British actors as special messengers of
erudition, elocution or patrician charm, audiences have flocked to Four
Weddings And A Funeral, believing there is a lost world out there, somewhere
near Europe, where fluffy, lovable, rambling human stories can happen:
stories that have no resemblance to America's own fast-food cinema of car
chases, cop action and ravening dinosaurs.
A decade and a half after we took 'Britishness' so seriously, after winning
that bunch of Oscars, that we thought the future lay in exporting UK
pageantry for ever and ever, we discover that the future for British cinema
 -its popular cinema at least - does not really lie with us at all. It lies
with those who better judge our charms and international selling-points and
have better equipment for marketing it. Our turn to be colonised and
exploited? If so, we should lie back and enjoy it.
