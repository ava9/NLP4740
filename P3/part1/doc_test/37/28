"How far should I go?" Winona Ryder asked Richard Benjamin, director of 
"Mermaids." 
</P>
<P>
"You're 15, crazy about him, thinking outrageous thoughts . . . ," he 
suggested, letting the film roll as Ryder fell onto her love interest (Michael 
Schoeffling) and -- behind his back but in plain view of the camera -- gave the 
actor's jacket a surreptitious lick. 
</P>
<P>
That touch is one of the more inspired in the film, a coming-of-age drama 
opening Friday in which Ryder plays the religious daughter of a promiscuous 
mom, played by Cher. 
</P>
<P>
"Winona's sensors are so good that I use her as litmus paper," says Benjamin. 
"If the words don't come out right, I change the approach. She's incapable of 
faking and is full of little gifts. That moment could only come from a wild, 
lusting, teen brain." 
</P>
<P>
Movie audiences can see more of Ryder's gifts, more facets of that much-vaunted 
19-year-old brain in the modern-day fable "Edward Scissorhands," which opened 
this weekend. This time Ryder is decked out in a blonde wig as Kim, a 
cheerleader whose initial skepticism toward Edward -- the unfinished creation 
of a scientist who left him with scissors for hands -- blossoms into romance. 
The movie reunites the actress with director Tim Burton, for whom she played 
the Edward Gorey-esque Lydia in the 1988 sleeper-hit "Beetlejuice," and pairs 
her for the first time with her real-life fiance, Johnny Depp (of TV's "21 Jump 
Street"), who plays the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder, small-boned and finely chiseled, arrives for lunch sporting a tailored 
vanilla pants suit and tennis shoes. Short dark hair classically cut, a touch 
of red lipstick highlighting her Cashmere Bouquet complexion, the actress looks 
less like a Hollywood star-in-the-making than a student arriving for a college 
interview. There's a radiance about her that reminds Tim Bur 
</P>
<P>
ton of the "timeless old movie stars," an innocence and fragility at odds with 
the force she's reported to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Winona has an honesty, an integrity which I respect," says Burton. "No matter 
what, she follows her own drummer. She's also canny about things. She knows a 
lot more than she lets on." Patrick Palmer, the line producer of "Mermaids," 
agrees: "The adult side of her is very clear, with very strong opinions. Like 
Cher, she's very calculating in that she knows what is good for her -- and does 
what is best for herself in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Scissorhands," Ryder -- tired of the pressures of "carrying" a 
film -- consciously took on a less prominent role than she had in previous 
movies: "Lucas" (her first movie, shot during her eighth-grade summer 
</P>
<P>
vacation), "Square Dance" (in which the 14-year-old Ryder gave Jason Robards 
and Jane Alexander a run for their money); the controversial, morally ambiguous 
"Heathers" (in which she took high school high jinks to new heights) and, more 
recently, "Welcome Back, Roxy Carmichael" (disappointing both personally and 
commercially). 
</P>
<P>
"Scissorhands" proved to be a much happier experience but presented its own 
particular challenges. "It would have been easier to hate her character because 
of the negative way she treated Edward at first," says Depp. "Winona walked a 
fine line. She played it so that the audience knows that her's was the only 
honest reaction -- that everyone else was treating him like a toy." 
</P>
<P>
"The story is a great combination of the mythic and the human," says Ryder, a 
spark lighting up her brown doe-eyes. ("You could dive into them and never 
leave," says a clearly smitten Depp). " 'Edward Scissorhands' is a beautiful, 
Gothic, romantic story with a lot of real-life feeling. Edward expresses the 
negative self-image possessed by so many -- especially in adolescence. The 
desperate feeling that everything you do is wrong, everything you touch you 
destroy." 
</P>
<P>
Burton says that her cheerleader role was the toughest Ryder has yet tackled -- 
a marked contrast to her trademark teen-in-torment roles. (Cher jokingly 
suggested that Ryder name her production company Teen Angst.) Alien turf for 
someone who had never "done the high school thing" . . . or even gone to a 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
"The part wasn't Shakespeare or Joan of Arc, but a definite stretch for someone 
who instinctively moves closer to the dark than the light," Burton observes. 
"Winona felt very uncomfortable in her clothes. She had a real identity crisis, 
but still exhibited a real power and total believability. That's what I counted 
on. Just like in 'Beetlejuice,' I needed somebody to ground the movie so it 
wouldn't spring off into the stratosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder's own childhood was, in fact, the polar opposite of the pastel-colored 
tract houses and suburban mores depicted in "Scissorhands." Moving to San 
Francisco from Winona, Minn., (for which she was named) while still an infant, 
she was one of four children reared by progressive, socially conscious parents. 
For a year, they all shared a 
</P>
<P>
300-acre plot with seven other families in the northern California town of Elk 
before moving to Petaluma where her family still lives. Imagination flourished 
in the absence of television. Eminences such as poet Allen Ginsberg drifted in 
and out. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Michael Horowitz, a San Francisco bookstore owner specializing in 
'60s fare, served as archivist to Timothy Leary (Winona's godfather). Mother 
Cindy, who makes educational videos, once converted a barn into a movie house 
where young Winona and the locals soaked up old films. "Winona has references 
beyond her years," notes director Benjamin. "She'll be bopping along and will 
suddenly observe that that's how Myrna Loy turned around in 'The Best Years of 
Our Lives.' " 
</P>
<P>
A voracious reader and a straight-A student, Ryder sprinkles her conversation 
with allusions to Gore Vidal, Louisa May Alcott and George Orwell (not just 
"1984," but "Down and Out in Paris and London"). J.D. Salinger is her patron 
saint, "Catcher in the Rye" her bible -- a book she's read, she swears, a 
couple of hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13, Ryder enrolled in acting classes in San Francisco's 
prestigious American Conservatory Theater. She lost out on a part in the film 
"Desert Bloom" to Annabeth Gish, but the impressed casting agent sent her tape 
to Triad Artists, which agreed to represent her. A substantial role in "Lucas" 
soon followed and the offers have been coming in ever since. "I never had to do 
the Hollywood thing -- to move to L.A., to do commercials or sitcoms," Ryder 
notes. "That probably pisses people off. But I've worked really hard. I'm not 
going to apologize for not struggling." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder describes herself as "obsessive," someone who experiences things 
intensely for awhile before latching on to her next fixation. "I'm moody that 
way," she says. "I need to keep changing and consuming in order to stay happy." 
</P>
<P>
Acting, however, took hold for good, becoming an all-consuming passion. 
"Sometimes I think it's an outlet, sometimes the opposite," she says. "It fills 
me up and I don't know where to put it. I guess I sweat it out in my sleep or 
something. It's great concentrating so hard you feel your brain will explode. 
When I'm acting well, it's the most exhilarating experience. When I'm bad, it's 
miserable. I feel like I'm lying to people . . . and that I have to finish 
lying so that I -- and they -- can go home. I feel like I'm gypping people, 
wasting their time." 
</P>
<P>
That's a rare occurrence according, to colleagues. By all accounts, she's a 
natural. No talking to herself. No breathing exercises or transcendental 
meditation. "Winona and I have the same acting style," observes Cher. "There's 
a sparseness to it and she prepares very little. She just goes out and does. 
Having so little life experience can be a blessing." Music, a central 
ingredient in Ryder's life, helps put her in the mood. For her dramatic role in 
"Beetlejuice," it was opera; for the ethereal "Scissorhands," the Cocteau 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
On "Mermaids," the Replacements' "Sixteen Blue" brought her back to the 
insecurities of that age. Before playing Charlotte, a Jewish teen going through 
a Catholic phase, Ryder read up on the saints, wore a cross and tried to pray, 
though she didn't know how. 
</P>
<P>
She also got in touch with the character's desperation -- her struggle with her 
burgeoning sexuality and her fear of turning into her racy, off-the-wall 
mother, Mrs. Flax (whose idea of a home-cooked meal is "finger foods"). "They 
loved each other in spite of it all," observes Ryder. "It's hard being a 
mother, hard being a daughter . . . and it doesn't come with a book of 
instructions." 
</P>
<P>
The shoot, it turned out, proved to be a baptism by fire. Director No. 1 Lasse 
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog") was banished when he determined to have the 
character of Charlotte's younger sister (Christina Ricci) commit suicide -- a 
plot twist deemed far-fetched by Cher. Frank Oz ("Little Shop of Horrors"), 
director No. 2, tried to turn the drama into "Greek tragedy," says Cher, devoid 
of irony and comedy. Emily Lloyd, initially lined up for the role of Charlotte, 
was replaced by Ryder, who, according to Cher, was considered a better genetic 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
"Noni and I had some catastrophic days and we cried a lot," Cher says. "Both of 
us were insecure being told that our instincts weren't on target. Noni was 
battling insomnia and chewing her nails up to her elbow. If I wasn't so strong 
and she so trusting we would never have gotten through it. I literally took her 
by the hand and said 'jump' -- and she did. We were like sisters. We lived 
together, hung out a lot, and got a lot of strength from each other." Depp, who 
visited the set intermittently, remembers it well. "There were a lot of 
long-distance phone calls," he says. "A lot of Ma Bell. Cher was a real rock 
for Winona, a pretty tough lady. I wouldn't want to go rounds with her." 
</P>
<P>
Though Ryder downplays her role in the turmoil, producer Patrick Palmer does 
not. "Winona led to Frank's leaving as much as Cher did," he states, referring 
to Oz's dismissal. "I was surprised she articulated things so well." The 
arrival of Richard Benjamin improved things considerably, but the shoot still 
proved to be an ordeal. It was the coldest December ever recorded in Boston and 
the 12- and 14-hour workdays didn't help. Ryder, prone to anemia, was so wiped 
out, recalls Palmer, that the production was postponed a week to let her 
regroup. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting the crucial sex scene proved embarrassing for Ryder -- "I was ready to 
pull out an ax and hack people if they looked at me funny." Recording the 
movie's voice-over was another thorn in her side. "I'm used to being told what 
to say, but not what to think . . . that's usually left up to me." Still she 
says, she's basically pleased with the film. "It has a lot of heart, I think." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ryder's next project, "The Godfather, Part III," that pushed her over 
the top. Mere mention of the film causes her to shut her eyes in pain. She had 
the role of a lifetime: playing Al Pacino's daughter in Francis Ford Coppola's 
sequel to two movies that had each won the best-picture Oscar. And Ryder backed 
out (to be replaced by Coppola's daughter, Sofia). There was talk of a nervous 
breakdown, rumors of pregnancy. Some say she had doubts about the role and, 
after working almost a year nonstop, just wanted some balance back in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says a plainly wounded Ryder. "The whole thing has been blown out of 
proportion," she claims. "I'd done three films in a row: 'Great Balls of Fire,' 
'. . . Roxy Carmichael' and 'Mermaids.' Right after ("Mermaids") wrapped, I 
flew to Rome with a terrible upper-respiratory infection and a 104-degree 
fever. I literally couldn't move. The studio doctor told me to go home, said I 
was too sick to work. It wasn't my choice. It was out of my hands. Sure it's 
disappointing, devastating in fact. I wish it didn't happen . . . but it did." 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" producer Palmer recalls advising Ryder to go ahead with the project, 
arguing that it was an American classic she shouldn't throw away. Her agent 
called her father, predicting that, if she jumped ship, she'd never work again. 
(Ryder now has a different agent.) Cher, however, took her side, maintaining 
that Coppola would understand. "Noni was fried, really fried," she says. "She's 
not a flake, but you can't wring out a wet rag. She's just a little girl . . . 
not a superwoman. And you can't start a film on 'empty.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tabloids and gossip columnists smelled blood -- one aspect of fame, says 
Ryder, that she still finds bothersome. "When I was young, I was the sweetheart 
of the press," says this veteran of nine Hollywood films. "They loved me, but 
were kind of waiting for me to mess up. I had no skeletons in my closet, no 
major past to talk about. I wasn't with anyone and didn't fall into that Drew 
Barrymore drug syndrome. Then I became engaged to Johnny and it's been bad ever 
since. Our relationship, fortunately, is a pretty solid one. If it was shaky, 
we'd be screwed. Michelle Pfeiffer said in an interview that she acts for free, 
but demands huge amounts of money for having to live in the public eye. She hit 
it on the head." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder bristles when asked about her two-year relationship with the 27-year-old 
Depp and the significance of that diamond on her left hand. "I get very 
protective because people try to categorize it. They see us as young actors 
doing that Hollywood-type thing. I hate labels. Johnny's my friend. We are in 
love. We're 'engaged' . . . but it's deeper than that. He's part of me, 
important to me right now." 
</P>
<P>
The two of them split their time between San Francisco -- Ryder's favorite city 
("What other one would name a street after Jack Kerouac?") -- a loft in New 
York and a new home she just purchased in Beverly Hills. Work, for the moment, 
has been put on hold so she can read, write (she keeps a journal and has 
written a screenplay) and relax with Depp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fine line between the excitement of doing some good work and taking 
care not to destroy yourself," says director Burton. "Winona is smart. Winona 
is sensitive. She knows she has to protect herself more and take it a little 
easier. She realizes she's been pushing too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Come January, however, Ryder will plunge in again, putting in a couple of weeks 
as a taxi driver in a movie by Jim Jarmusch ("Down by Law"). Though there are 
no plans beyond that, those around her doubt she has much to worry about. 
"Unlike Molly Ringwald, I don't think she'll have trouble making the transition 
to romantic roles," says Palmer. "She's sexual in her own way and can move 
right on to those Julia Roberts parts." 
</P>
<P>
Depp foresees even greater things. "Winona may be the Lillian Gish of the next 
century," he gushes. "I see her in 2040 still doing movies. She's got that much 
time and energy left . . . and it's hard to calm her down when she likes 
something."
