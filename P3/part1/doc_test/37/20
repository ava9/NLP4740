Halloween may be a month away, but in Hollywood it's beginning to look a lot 
like Christmas, as the studios rush to lock their end-of-the-year films into 
holiday play dates. 
</P>
<P>
The latest spate of jockeying took place following recent announcements that 
Paramount had pushed back the opening date of Francis Coppola's "The Godfather 
Part III" from Nov. 21 to Christmas Day and that Disney had pushed forward the 
date of "Three Men and a Little Lady" from Christmas to Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was waiting to see what (Paramount) was going to do with ('Godfather 
III')," said an executive at a competing studio. "No one wants to have to go 
against 'The Godfather' unless their film is directed at a completely different 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
If "The Godfather III" is the film event of the year, there are plenty of other 
contenders for box-office dollars. More than two dozen major titles, up about 
20% from last year, are scheduled to open over a seven-week period from early 
November through Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Included are a dozen or more prestige titles that are considered, within the 
industry, to be candidates for Academy Award attention. Among them: "Godfather 
III," Sydney Pollack's "Havana," Brian De Palma's "Bonfire of the Vanities," 
Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Sheltering Sky," James Ivory's "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" 
and Penny Marshall's "Awakenings." 
</P>
<P>
The list of those films that would seem to have purely commercial ambitions 
includes "Kindergarten Cop," with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood's "The 
Rookie," and the sequels "Rocky V," "Three Men and a Little Lady" and "Look 
Who's Talking Too." 
</P>
<P>
As one studio publicity chief put it, "It's more than competitive -- it's going 
to be murder." 
</P>
<P>
At theaters, it may be more a case of gridlock. Although there are about 24,000 
screens in the United States and Canada, the glut of movies will be hard to 
accommodate. Films aimed at broad audiences usually open with between 800 and 
2,500 prints; simple math dictates that some titles will be squeezed out. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's got to give," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations. 
Krier predicted that some films scheduled for release this year will be held 
back. "It's a case of who's going to give in first." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, distributors are standing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first Christmas I can remember where nobody wants to move, 
nobody's flinching," said Tom Sherak, executive vice president at 20th Century 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that everybody believes in their product," Sherak continued. 
"And given what's out there, if you don't have the goods, you've got to get out 
of the way, because it's going to be tough. It's going to look like a Pac-Man 
game. You know how that little yellow guy goes around and eats everything in 
his way?" 
</P>
<P>
The key to finding the power pill and avoiding being swallowed up? 
</P>
<P>
"You avoid head-to-head competition," said Si Kornblit, executive vice 
president of worldwide marketing for Universal Pictures. "This year, everyone 
sort of looked at everyone else, and then dropped their movies on the schedule. 
You won't find similar movies going against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Tri-Star is tentatively booking its baby movie -- "Look Who's Talking 
Too" -- for Dec. 7, 17 days after Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady" opens. 
Warner Bros.' animated version of "The Nutcracker" is scheduled to open Dec. 
19, more than a month after Disney's animated "The Rescuers Down Under." Fox's 
macho action film "Predator II" follows MGM/UA's "Rocky V" by a week ("I'll be 
happy to get all the people who go to see 'Rocky V' come see our movie the next 
weekend," said Fox's Sherak). 
</P>
<P>
The positioning of certain movies is crucial not only to the holiday grosses, 
but for the overall release strategy of the movies. Some films are, by the 
nature of their subjects, slow starters and don't figure to hit their stride 
until critics and Oscar campaigns weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
The boasting -- or bluffing -- has already begun. Disney executives say they 
moved "Three Men and a Little Lady" up a month because preview audiences were 
nuts about it. Fox officials claim that "Home Alone," a John Hughes-produced 
comedy, will be "the sleeper hit of the season." Columbia is spreading the word 
that Rob Reiner's "Misery" is the one that will leap out of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
More than bragging rights are at stake. The long hot summer is Hollywood's Big 
Season, accounting for about 40% of a year's overall receipts, but the 10-day, 
year-end holiday often sees the most intense moviegoing all year. In 1987, 
ticket sales during that period totaled about $160 million, or 3.76% of the 
year's gross. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a very large pie, and everybody wants to have a piece of 
it," said David Forbes, Orion's president of domestic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the beginning of the Christmas season has steadily moved 
forward and post time now comes before Thanksgiving. This season, Orion will 
get off first with "Dances With Wolves," a three-hour Western directed by and 
starring Kevin Costner. Orion is hoping that, like its "Platoon" of a few years 
back, "Dances With Wolves" will gain steam after a limited early release and 
perform all the way through Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to build an awareness, and a want-to-see factor," said Orion's 
Forbes, adding, "However you release your pictures, your goal is for them to 
have legs." 
</P>
<P>
