Seeing Double: Visitors to the corner of Broxton and Weyburn Avenues in 
Westwood Village will see the unusual sight of two movie theaters with the same 
film on their marquees: "The Godfather Part III."

Both the Mann Village and Mann Bruin theaters, across the street from each 
other, are showing the Francis Ford Coppola film at the same time. Mann 
Theaters director of operations Ben Littlefield said that the success of the 
film at the 1,500-seat Village Theater since it opened on Christmas Day caused 
the theater chain to open the movie at the 800-seat Bruin. "It takes a dynamic 
film with a large demand to warrant that kind of treatment," Littlefield said.
