For Matthew Broderick, working with Marlon Brando was the highlight of filming 
"The Freshman," which casts him in yet another youth role. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick recalled that he couldn't relax knowing he would meet the superstar. 
</P>
<P>
However, a big hug from Brando and his calm manner put him at ease. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a role model for everybody in the business," said Broderick. "No matter 
who they think is their role model, that person probably had Brando as a role 
model. All roads lead to Brando." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick stars in the film as a graduate student who gets hustled out of his 
possessions as soon as he arrives in New York to attend film school. 
</P>
<P>
Following and catching the thief eventually leads to a meeting with Brando's 
character -- a shady guy not unlike his Don Corleone of "The Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 28, admitted he once was bothered by the number of teen-age roles he 
was getting. But the quality of the characters has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I played my own age in Glory," he pointed out. "Eventually, as I age, I'll get 
more roles closer to my age."
