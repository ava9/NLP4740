BIDS ARE out; bankruptcies and restructurings are in. That may be a crude
oversimplication of the shift in business trends between the 1980s and
1990s, but it carries a large measure of truth.
For the US investment community - from bankers to lawyers - this sea-change
has meant a substantial reallocation of resources. M&amp;A departments have been
scaled down, while restructuring teams have been built up. Arbitrage
activities have been reduced, while 'vulture funds' (which invest in
distressed securities or bankrutpcy claims) have been either expanded or
launched. And so on.
All of which reflects a bankruptcy process which is substantially different
from that generally pertaining in the UK. One of the US's more endearing
philosophical commitments is to 'the right to a new life' - an axiom which
dates back to the Pilgrim Fathers. In the narrow context of corporate
affairs, this has evolved into the 1978 US Bankruptcy Code and its 'Chapter
11' process.
Very broadly, this allows a company to file for court protection from its
creditors. Assuming the courts agree, the company's assets cannot then be
seized; the debtor is allowed to suspend certain interest and debt
repayments and to cancel certain contracts; legal suits against the debtor
can be pursued only as claims through the bankruptcy court.
Once Chapter 11 protection is operative, the debtor and its creditors - who
usually form a 'committee' to represent often-disparate interests  - try to
agree on a restructuring plan. This may involve the sale of assets, creating
a cash pool which can be used to pay claims, at least in part. But creditors
are usually offered some interest in the ongoing business as well.
Reasons for the growth in the usage of Chapter 11 are largely self-evident -
the recessionary climate and the large amounts of debt taken on by many US
corporations during the 1980s. To a lesser extent, some companies have found
the ability to abrogate contracts useful and others - such as Manville -
have filed in the face of massive legal claims.
The bankruptcy process often looks attractive to non-US observers. After
all, jobs are preserved and, in the most successful cases, creditors have
enjoyed substantial recoveries. The downside is the time and money which
Chapter 11 can eat up; some cases have dragged on for over half a decade,
and fees can consume hundred of millions of dollars from the debtor's
estate. LTV, the steel company, is a good example: fees are estimated at
over Dollars 150m during a stay in bankruptcy which has now dragged into its
sixth year.
Already, some judges are scrutinising expenses intently - in turn, making
bankruptcy work far less lucrative for the professionals than, say, bid
activity. In the Southmark case, for example, the judge chopped Dollars 3m
off a Dollars 54m bill. The potentially litigious Drexel bankruptcy,
meanwhile, was hassled along by a ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton
Pollack. As a result, the bankruptcy was completed in two years, a time
limit few thought possible when the proceedings began.
Suggestions over how the Chapter 11 process might be reformed to reduce time
and expense vary widely. However, one commonly voiced notion is to shorten
the 'exclusivity period' - that is, the window when the debtor has the sole
right to produce a reorganisation plan. By giving the creditors an entree
earlier in the proceedings, some lawyers argue, months could be clipped
away.
A more controversial 'time-saver' is the pre-packaged bankruptcy - used, for
example, by Mr Donald Trump with his Taj Mahal casino property. Here,
debtors and creditors in effect agree on a restructuring plan before the
Chapter 11 filing is made. Chapter 11 is then used to implement the
restructuring scheme, and the debtor's stay in bankruptcy is confined to a
few months. But it is arguable whether this is how the process was meant to
be used.
In some cases, the presence of professional bankruptcy investors can also
speed matters along. Since most claims are transferable, 'vulture investing'
has become a fairly sizeable industry - with players ranging from
specialists Mr Michael Price at Mutual Shares and Mr Sam Zell at the
Zell/Chilmark funds, to mainstream fund management group T. Rowe Price and
to former corporate raider Mr Carl Icahn.
Even Goldman Sachs got in on the act, raising its Dollars 783m Water Street
fund in 1990, but then aborting the project when conflicts of interest
surfaced. Foreign investors have not been bypassed, either: Credit Lyonnais
has backed Apollo Partners, the restructuring business run by Mr Leon Black,
formerly an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Together, the
French bank and Apollo acquired most of the junk holdings of Executive Life,
the Californian insurer. The book value of the portfolio was over Dollars
5.3bn.
By giving creditors a potential market for their claims, and bringing
well-honed negotiating skills to the restructuring process, these investors
arguably serve a useful purpose. Final labour negotiations in the
long-running Wheeling-Pittsburgh bankruptcy, for example, were oiled by Mr
Ron LaBow - who had acquired virtually all the bank claims and stood to
become the major equity holder under the steel company's reorganisation
plan.
It is not just vulture investors who have been making money out of
bankruptcies. Another lucrative spin-off business has been the provision of
debtor-in-possession financing. DIP loans are new facilities provided to
companies once there have filed for bankruptcy protection. These usually
rank at the forefront of the creditors' queue for repayment, should the
company be forced to liquidate - so security is relatively good. Yet terms
are usually attractive to the lender - earning 2 to 4 per cent above a
standard business loan, with perhaps 3 per cent upfront as a fee.
Conversely, it is not the cost of bankruptcies which provokes criticism. The
process leaves much to the discretion of judges, and some are felt to be
more sympathetic to a debtor's position than others. It has been argued, for
example, that this explains a number of filings in Delaware, where there is
just one bankruptcy court judge, so the debtor knows at the outset who will
be assigned to the case.
But perhaps the biggest question-mark hanging over the process is its effect
on other healthy companies operating in the same sector. By keeping a
bankrupt company alive - and, indeed, giving it some operating advantages -
industrywide distortions can occur. This has been most marked in the airline
industry, where bankrupt carriers have undercut hugely, in a desperate
attempt to secure cashflow (regardless of profitability). Some relatively
sound airlines have been obliged to match this competitive pricing - and the
sector generally has faced a flood of red ink.
