WHY TRUMP'S TROUBLES ARE FAR FROM OVER; 
</P>
<P>
ATLANTIC CITY: THIS IS NO LAS VEGAS.

<P>
Developer Donald J. Trump's financial problems are rooted deeply in the faded 
seaside resort of Atlantic City, N.J., where he has such a high profile that 
the town has gotten the nickname of "Trump City." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's extensive gambling operations there were once thought to be the cash 
machines that would sustain his financial empire, but it was not to be. The 
rest of Trump's empire has proved so expensive to run that his three 
casino-hotels, which have had their own problems, have not carried the load. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has close to $2 billion invested in Atlantic City, and the ultimate fate 
of his empire may well be decided by how his casinos do financially during the 
current tourist season that ends in September. 
</P>
<P>
Like all casino operators, Trump has been hurt by the singular maladies 
afflicting Atlantic City, a racially divided town of 35,000 that offers none of 
the glamour and excitement of its primary competitor, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
While Las Vegas has thrived, the gambling industry in Atlantic City stumbled 
badly after hitting a peak in 1983, when it earned nearly $169 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt by rising promotion expenses and flat revenues, the casino-hotels lost 
more than $4 million in the first three months of 1990, according to the Casino 
Assn. of New Jersey, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The financial picture prompted Thomas D. Carver, the association's president, 
to suggest that Atlantic City may need "radical change" if it is to prosper 
once again. Seven of the city's casinos are losing money, Carver noted, while 
two others are marginally profitable. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that many casinos are heavily in debt because they were financed 
with high-yield junk bonds, meaning they face huge interest expenses on top of 
their other operating costs. Trump has heavy junk bond debts on each of his 
casino-hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City has high building and labor costs as well as pervasive poverty 
and a high crime rate. Its slums abut the seaside Boardwalk, along which 10 of 
the city's 12 casinos are situated. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Las Vegas' gaudy Strip does not fully awaken until sundown, the 
Boardwalk is a virtual no man's land most nights. "It's generally pretty 
deserted except during the height of the tourist season," said Carl Zeitz, a 
casino industry consultant and a former member of the New Jersey Casino Control 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitz said state lawmakers in New Jersey have ambivalent feelings about 
gambling, which has prevented casino gaming from expanding and flourishing as 
it has in Nevada. Atlantic City's first casino opened in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"New Jersey has not come to terms with gambling," he said. "We keep holding our 
nose. Yes, we legalized gambling, but we seem to view it as offensive. You 
cannot have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Although intended to limit the influence of organized crime, tough state rules 
have snuffed out the liveliness that makes Las Vegas such a draw, according to 
Zeitz. There are prohibitions against round-the-clock gambling and curbs on the 
kinds of games played in the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
A requirement that new casino-hotels have at least 500 hotel rooms has also 
prevented the spread of smaller casino-hotels and meant that potential casino 
operators must invest at least $300 million to enter the market, Zeitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City also does not have a major municipal airport, a critical 
shortcoming that prevents the town from attracting gamblers much beyond the 
middle part of the Eastern Seaboard. Most gamblers drive there from cities in 
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Other limitations include a shortage of first-class hotel rooms, a dearth of 
parking and inhospitable weather that limits the peak tourist season to May 
through September. Casino industry regulatory costs are also much higher than 
they are in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, Atlantic City is soon to get a new mayor, James Whelan, who 
many locals hope will usher in a era of honesty, racial harmony and better ties 
between the casino industry and the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
A white man who ran with significant black support, Whelan soundly defeated 
James L. Usry, a former school teacher and semi-pro basketball player who was 
indicted in January on charges of bribery and official misconduct. Usry is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hopefully a new beginning," said Redenia Gilliam-Mosee, an executive with 
one of the casinos who grew up in Atlantic City and used to make $30 a week 
working as a chambermaid. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home, Whelan turned down an interview, saying he was too busy. 
"I'm swamped with paper work," he said. He takes office shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump properties in Atlantic City today are a mixed bag of success, failure 
and question marks. 
</P>
<P>
Only Trump Plaza, at the center of the Boardwalk, has been a consistent 
moneymaker in recent years, and even it ran into bad luck in February when it 
lost more than more than $6 million at baccarat to a Tokyo real estate tycoon 
named Akio Kashiwagi. 
</P>
<P>
Using $200,000 chips, Kashiwagi lost more than $9 million at the casino-hotel 
in mid-May, though, so profits should rebound sharply in the second quarter, 
said one official in the Trump Organization. (The Trump Plaza's first-quarter 
loss was $3.67 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Trump Castle is clearly the weakest link. Situated on an inland marina well 
away from the Boardwalk, Trump has invested more than $400 million in the 
casino-hotel, which has lost money at mounting rates for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Trump barely met $42.6 million in payments on the Trump Castle bonds last 
Tuesday, avoiding formal default only with an emergency $20-million bank loan 
hours before the midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The Taj Mahal is the giant unknown, so expensive to build that already there 
are serious doubts about whether it will be able to meet the next interest 
payment on its bonds, due Nov. 15. The Taj opened in April at a cost of more 
than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The man originally chosen to run the Taj, Mark Grossinger Etess, was killed 
last fall in a helicopter crash, along with Stephen F. Hyde, who was Trump's 
top gaming executive. Some industry insiders believe Trump has never recovered 
from that blow. 
</P>
<P>
By some accounts, Trump has become unglued without Hyde, a popular and 
respected industry veteran who acted as a buffer between the volatile developer 
and the rest of the staff. Trump has since become increasingly active in the 
casino management, displaying a seat-of-the-pants style that has worn badly 
with some underlings. 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Donnell, former president of the Trump Plaza, quit in May because he 
tired of Trump's style. O'Donnell was particularly disgusted by Trump's 
criticism of Hyde's business decisions after Hyde died. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening of the Taj was marred by snafus and confusion, leading Trump 
to demote the general manager. Another executive, the chief financial officer, 
collapsed of exhaustion and was later let go. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Taj shattered all records in its first month of operation, raking in 
gambling winnings of $34.4 million -- the best monthly showing of any casino in 
the history of Atlantic City gambling. The Taj took in $36.5 million more in 
gambling winnings in May. 
</P>
<P>
The success, however, appears to have come at the expense of the weaker 
casinos, including the Trump Castle. Doubters also point out that Trump 
borrowered too much to build what is the world's most expensive casino. 
</P>
<P>
He raised $675 million in junk bonds in late 1988 at an interest rate of 14% to 
finish construction of the hotel, and even Moody's Investors Service, the 
debt-rating agency, has suggested that Trump is headed for a possible default 
on the Taj bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Outside experts believe the Taj needs to take in about $475 million a year -- 
and perhaps much more -- just to break even. Whether it will or not is a clear 
concern to New Jersey's casino regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days (at the Taj) are fantastic and other days are not up to 
expectations," said Anthony J. Parrillo, head of the New Jersey Division of 
Gaming Enforcement. "It's still too early to tell."
