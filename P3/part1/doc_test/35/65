A Hong Kong jewelry company paid a record $7 million for the Agra Diamond, a 
pink stone that once adorned the turban of a Mongol emperor, Christie's said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the auction house said the sale of various jewels Wednesday 
netted a record $20.7 million, with the Agra Diamond being the most prominent 
item. 
</P>
<P>
The 32.24-carat stone is the seventh-largest pink diamond in the world, and was 
once owned by Babur, the central Asian warlord who conquered northern India in 
1526 and founded the Mongol empire. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was purchased for $7 million by Ciba Corp., a leading Hong Kong 
jewelry firm. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the sum was the highest ever paid for a pink diamond. It 
had been owned by a private English collector. 
</P>
<P>
Babur received the diamond in exchange for sparing the lives of the family of 
the maharajah of Gwalior, and named it after the site of his capital, where one 
of his successors, Shah Jehan, later built the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor also bagged the Kohinoor diamond, which now sits in the Tower of 
London as a part of the crown jewels. But the pink stone was his favorite and 
was worn on the front of his turban.
