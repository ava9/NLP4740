<TEXT>
<P>
Westminster builder Dennis D'Ambra likes to point out that nobody ever said a 
blueprint was worth a thousand words. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for generations, anyone planning to build or remodel a house has had to 
rely on blueprints as a primary indicator of what the finished project was 
going to look like. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, D'Ambra believes, is that many homeowners don't know how to read 
blueprints. "They'll tell me, 'I saw the blueprint, but it confused me,' " says 
D'Ambra, 47, president of D'Ambra Inc. "Or they'll say, 'That's not what I 
thought it would look like.' The result is that we sometimes have to tear out a 
wall or practically start all over again. That can take a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
By chance, D'Ambra made a discovery several months ago that is changing the way 
people look at remodeling -- literally. He read a newspaper advertisement 
placed by a landscaping firm that used computer imaging to show potential 
clients what specific trees or shrubs would look like around their homes or 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"A light bulb went on in my head," D'Ambra said. "I thought, if computer 
imaging can be used as a 'before-and-after' tool for landscaping, why can't we 
do it in home remodeling?" 
</P>
<P>
The result is that D'Ambra's firm can show clients exactly what their home will 
look like after remodeling. The blueprints are still used by the people at the 
job site, of course, but the customer sees either a video or a still picture 
before any work is done. 
</P>
<P>
"It eliminates trial and error," D'Ambra said. "And it eliminates questions and 
misunderstanding. Nothing is left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
After first realizing that computer imaging could be useful in remodeling, 
D'Ambra and his son, Chris, 21, went to Canoga Park, where they met with 
officials of New Image Industries, which manufactures computer imaging software 
for other applications. In addition to landscaping projections, computer 
imaging has been used to show would-be dieters what they'll look like after 
dropping a few pounds and by plastic surgeons whose patients are eager to see 
what a face-lift or eyelid tuck would do for them. New Image also manufactures 
the hardware for the system. 
</P>
<P>
The system that New Image designed for D'Ambra allows Chris, now officially the 
construction firm's "image designer," to incorporate a virtually infinite 
number of roof-lines, door styles, driveways and other features into the image 
of a client's house. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't come cheaply. D'Ambra estimates that he paid more than $35,000 for 
the package. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been "dramatic," he said. "We keep putting new styles of homes 
into the database," he says, "and people can choose any feature they want and 
see what it would look like on their house." The charge to the client is about 
$100, applicable to any job the client might order from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone may say, 'I liked a roof-line I saw at a place in Laguna Hills,' " 
D'Ambra says. Or they might like the roof from one place, the window treatment 
from a second and the driveway from a third. Want a bay window moved around? 
Like to see a double door? 
</P>
<P>
"If it's in our database," D'Ambra says, "Chris can take the photo of their 
house, along with what they've said they want, and show them what they're 
looking for almost instantly. If it isn't, if they can give him a picture of 
what they want, within an hour to a day, he can show them what they had in 
mind, but on their house. 
</P>
<P>
"He can put a (Lamborghini) Countache in your driveway if you'd like, but we 
don't include the car with the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a client can see what the newly remodeled family home would look 
like in virtually any color. "You want yellow?" D'Ambra asks. "We can call up 
every shade of yellow. If you prefer a beige, you've got it. The system stores 
more than 32,000 colors. Want to see what the house will look like early in the 
morning or late in the afternoon? We can change the time of day or the angle of 
the shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Clients who want to see a video, rather than a still picture, of the proposed 
project get something even more exotic. The image, of course, starts when one 
of D'Ambra's sales employees goes to the client's home and shoots the "before" 
video. "If neighbors are walking by when we're shooting the video," D'Ambra 
says, "or a kid on a skateboard races past, they're going to show up on the 
'after' video too, moving past a house that doesn't even exist yet in that 
form." 
</P>
<P>
When working, Chris D'Ambra sits at a high-tech console surrounded by vinyl 
folders labeled "windows and doors," "exterior finishes," "roofs, fireplaces 
and brick," "new homes" and "driveways and steps." Cars and people can easily 
be superimposed on the property, he points out, jokingly placing a likeness of 
former President Ronald Reagan on the front walkway of a Whittier home 
("President Richard Nixon is not in our database," Dennis says). 
</P>
<P>
The new system has been especially helpful for clients who have no special 
features in mind, D'Ambra says. And there are a few clients like that. "People 
will come to us and say, 'I don't know what I want. You're the builder. You 
come up with an idea,' " he says. "Others want their house to look like 
(Donald) Trump's Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
D'Ambra Inc. has been in Westminster since the senior D'Ambra and his wife 
founded it in 1967 -- "when you could start with next to nothing," he adds. 
"You can't do that today." He has always fancied himself a "high-tech thinker," 
and the computer imaging equipment, he believes, makes his the only remodeling 
firm in Southern California with such a system. 
</P>
<P>
Since he started using computer imaging late last year, his firm has completed 
50 to 60 jobs -- everything from simple room additions to cases in which, he 
says, "someone doesn't want to move and wants to spend $100,000 to make his 
house look like a $700,000 place down the block." About 80% of his work 
consists of second-floor additions. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, only about 30% of his clients have asked to use the computer 
imaging equipment, probably because many of them already know what they want. 
</P>
<P>
Since the system is unique to the area, D'Ambra allows other builders -- many 
of them his competitors -- to use it, for a price. "Why not?" he asks. "There's 
nothing cloak-and-dagger about it. If everyone can benefit, there's no reason 
to keep it from them. This has given us a lot of exposure within the industry. 
We get a lot of calls." 
</P>
<P>
D'Ambra handles about 100 projects a year, all within a 20- to 25-mile radius 
from his office, "but at least 80% in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley, 
because that's where we're known. What we're doing is taking little houses and 
putting houses on top of them. We're bringing 1960s houses into the 1990s," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, his computer-generated photos are as realistic as they need to be. 
D'Ambra recently sought a zoning variance for a client from the Westminster 
Planning Commission. The man wanted a special garage built to house his boat. 
With a briefcase full of blueprints and a computer picture showing what he 
proposed to do, D'Ambra approached an inspector. "He looked at it," D'Ambra 
said, "and asked why we would want a variance for something that had already 
been built. He gave us the variance."
