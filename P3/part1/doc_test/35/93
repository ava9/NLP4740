Roulette wheels came to rest and the last card was turned onto the blackjack 
felt at Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel today as it became the first New 
Jersey casino closed under state order. 
</P>
<P>
When dealer Stan Kowal dealt his last hand at 3:47 a.m., more state gaming 
regulators were in the casino than customers, and gamblers were saying "Good 
luck" to Atlantis employees. 
</P>
<P>
The state Casino Control Commission last week determined that the gaming hall's 
$144-million debt was too big a risk to the industry's integrity to allow 
continued play on Atlantis' three-tiered casino floor. 
</P>
<P>
Only subtle signs indicated that casino employees were working their last 
shift. A blackjack dealer taped a small "goodby" note to his table, and some 
floor supervisors wore black-tinged carnations. 
</P>
<P>
At the craps table, Larry Fishman threw out the last set of dice. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed myself here for seven years," he said. "I wanted to do it for 
sentimental reasons, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981, when it opened as 
the Playboy Hotel &amp; Casino. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1985, Atlantis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but 
when a reorganization plan was finally implemented in September, 1988, the 
losses continued to mount. 
</P>
<P>
The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the arm of the state attorney 
general's office that polices the industry, reported that the Atlantis was 
losing money at the rate of $56,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
At the division's recommendation, the commission voted in April not to renew 
Atlantis' regular casino license and appointed a conservator. 
</P>
<P>
At least 1,000 of the hotel's 2,000 workers are affected by the casino closing. 
</P>
<P>
Near the slot machines, mechanics gathered to console each other this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinarily, we'd be fixing machines, but it doesn't matter now," said one 
mechanic who would identify himself only as John. "It took me a year and a half 
to get this job, and now I'm out looking again."
