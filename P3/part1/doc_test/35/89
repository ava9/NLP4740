IF YOU think Indian art is about refined miniature painting and the clean
lines of the Taj Mahal, then the exhibition 'Living Wood' at the Whitechapel
Gallery will change your mind.
Celebrating the South Indian woodcarving tradition, this is a pioneering
show of 120 animals, gods, spirits, chariots and architectural elements made
in southern India since the 15th century. From a 2 1/2 m high, gold-painted
strutting peacock used for temple processions to an equally large,
sumptuously carved door of Burma teak which once led into a wealthy trader's
mansion in Chattinad, all but a handful are on public view for the first
time.
India's craftsmen have produced some of the world's most remarkable
woodcarvings. Their skills so astonished the sophisticated Mughals who
invaded North India in the 16th century that they employed native Hindu
woodcarvers to build and decorate their Islamic buildings. This exhibition
concentrates on the pure Hindu traditions of the South, where the Dravadian
culture was never knocked on its side by Islamic invaders.
High-quality wooden sculpture has been a feature of life in southern India
down the centuries, and continues to do so, but until now it has largely
been ignored by academics. The vast wealth of material is mostly unpublished
and thus unknown except to the more intrepid travellers to India. George
Michell, who researched the exhibition and edited its substantial catalogue,
has set out to change this.
His aim of opening up another chapter in Indian art, to publicise the 'pure
enjoyment and aesthetic stimulus' of South Indian woodcarving, has meant
turning detective to ferret out the exhibits. Some, including a great
painted screen flanked by grinning monkeys, have been shipped from Perth,
Western Australia, where there is a foundation for Indian art, established
by an American who made a fortune in Australia and spent much of it on
Indian art.
By contrast, a great goddess sitting astride a winged bull and several other
votive images come from Mysore University's substantial Folklore Museum,
which miraculously struggles along on an annual budget of Pounds 80, with no
hope of exhibitions or publications. Closer to home, Mr Michell spent a day
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum unpacking 20 cases which had not been opened
since the Indian Collection was moved there from the Imperial Institute in
the 1950s.
The Whitechapel Gallery held its first exhibition of Indian art in 1904, a
general survey grandly entitled 'Indian Empire'. Mr Michell's show, ranging
from high-class, intellectual temple carving to simple pieces of nature
worship, is unified by each exhibit's freshness, directness and energy. Such
a show demonstrates just how far the appreciation of Indian art in Britain
has progressed.
Sponsored by The Henry Moore Foundation, Visiting Arts, Grindlays Bank, and
