PLAN TO MOVE CIVIC CENTER ABANDONED

The City Council has abandoned a proposal to move the civic center to a new 
site in a residential area, a plan that led to a contentious debate in this 
normally tranquil city. 
</P>
<P>
After a short public hearing Tuesday, the council voted 3 to 1 against moving 
the city offices to a new site at the corner of Center Drive and Villa Park 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the move, council members cited the results of a citizens' advisory 
committee survey that showed 90% of 950 respondents were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The move would have provided enough space to triple the size of the existing 
civic center, but many residents criticized the plan as an attempt to build a 
"Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mayor John Frackelton said he accepted the advisory committee's 
recommendation, he added that he would vote to drop consideration of the new 
site "with a heavy heart." 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Harold H. Saldarini voted to save the proposal, saying 
afterward that he thought the council had "missed a golden opportunity" to move 
the offices and library to the only other viable site in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some residents are angry that consideration of the new site was not 
dropped earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"They've known for months that the citizens are not in favor of the massive 
things they're proposing. But they continued to prolong this agony," said 
resident Don Ebrite. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that some form of expansion is necessary to relieve 
crowding at the current offices and to add a conference room and library space. 
The council will now pursue plans to expand the city's offices in the Villa 
Park Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although most residents agree the civic center offices are too crowded, they 
are divided on how much additional space is enough. JON NALICK
