<P>
Maybe you thought the time had come for Donald the midlife philosopher, the 
contemplative loner struggling heroically to bring a simple perspective to his 
highly chronicled life. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as they say in New York, fawgetaboutit. 
</P>
<P>
Just as his marriage, his business and that most cherished of his possessions, 
his name, appear to be in various stages of spectacular destruction, Donald 
Trump has provided a breathless nation with the second volume of his 
autobiography, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," written with Newsweek senior 
writer Charles Leerhsen. 
</P>
<P>
The book, published by Random House, which was rushing 500,000 copies to stores 
on Wednesday, delivers the same sophisticated evaluation of life's trials, 
temptations and rewards as the wildly best-selling first volume, "The Art of 
the Deal." And in a chapter heartwarmingly titled "Trump vs. Trump, Undoing the 
Deal," it also delivers Ivana ("My marriage, it seemed, was the only area of my 
life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection") and 
Marla ("The beautiful young actress who bore the brunt of the hysterical 
publicity, is a terrific person, but my relationship with her was not the cause 
of the trouble between Ivana and me"). 
</P>
<P>
The Donald writes that he is in pain over the end of his marriage. He racked 
his formidable brains trying to find a way to salvage this particular deal. 
"This was by no means a snap judgment. I've discussed the situation with many 
people. I even thought, briefly, about approaching Ivana with the idea of an 
'open marriage.' But I realized there was something hypocritical and tawdry 
about such an arrangement that neither of us could live with -- especially 
Ivana. She's too much of a lady." 
</P>
<P>
For a book that could properly be devoted to Chapter 11, the real one, which 
would be titled "The Art of Filing for Bankruptcy," The Donald sure does have a 
rosy way of looking at what others view as his economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three years have been a time of extraordinary challenges -- success 
and setbacks," Trump writes at the outset, describing what he calls the 
foundation of "Phase Two," of his life. "I bought and restored to greatness the 
Plaza Hotel, a New York landmark. I acquired the run-down Eastern Shuttle and 
made it, as the Trump Shuttle, the best airline of its kind. I erected the 
magnificent Taj Mahal, one of the largest casino-hotels in the world -- and a 
project that many experts predicted could never be completed." 
</P>
<P>
All true. Yet there are other truths left unexplored in these pages. Most hotel 
experts and financiers were astonished at how much Trump paid for the Plaza, 
which has been hemorrhaging money so fast that advisers have urged Trump to 
unload the debt-laden property. He has been desperately beating the bushes for 
somebody to take the money-losing shuttle off his hands. And then there is the 
Taj. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's most remarkable monument to himself, with its 3,000 slot machines and 
167 gaming tables, implanted in a gaudily splendid Eurocash setting, has 
boosted the casino capacity of Atlantic City by 20% since it opened, stealing 
clients from his other casinos and teetering mightily in the Northeast's 
failing economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
Just Tuesday, The Donald agreed to take on Stephen F. Bollenbach, a nationally 
known expert in bailing out troubled companies, as chief financial officer of 
the Trump Organization. Not the move of a man clutching the scepter of power 
with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
But Trump is still tough. He is appalled by America's decline, and he has bad 
words for the Japanese (he describes with relish an incident in which he threw 
a rude Japanese businessman out of his office). In a prescient bit of analysis 
written long before the current crisis, he calls it "brilliant" that Saudi 
Arabia and Kuwait, "countries in which many people live in mansions," stand by 
and allow us to police the Persian Gulf for them. 
</P>
<P>
Germans have treated us worse than anyone else, according to Trump. "For two 
generations American troops have provided security for West Germany against the 
Soviets, but if an American tried to sell a pencil on the street in Germany, 
the authorities would practically throw him in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Trump also has a lot to say about celebrities he has encountered. Frank Sinatra 
horrified Ivana and Donald at a dinner one night in Monte Carlo by being 
boorishly rude to his wife and then treating his fans as if they were scum. 
</P>
<P>
Since you can't libel a dead man, Trump really goes to town on Malcolm Forbes. 
He says they never had a good relationship, in part he thinks because his "more 
luxurious 282-foot yacht," the Trump Princess, came along and stole the 
spotlight from Forbes's formerly legendary 150-foot mini-vessel. But it is 
Forbes's way of life that eventually got under Trump's skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I gradually came to see him as a hypocrite who favored those who advertised in 
his magazine and tried, with surprising viciousness, to punish those who 
didn't. I also saw a double standard in the way he lived openly as a homosexual 
-- which he had every right to do -- but expected the media and his famous 
friends to cover for him." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that, a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
But The Donald that emerges from this memoir is a man caught in pursuit of an 
unreachable goal. Pleasure eludes him, relaxation is inconceivable. He says 
people mistakenly call him greedy because of the way he has amassed real 
estate, companies, helicopters, planes and yachts during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"But what those critics don't know is that the same assets that excite me in 
the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. I probably visited 
Mar-a-Lago, my 118-room house in Palm Beach, no more than two dozen times in 
the years I've owned it. As for my yacht, the Trump Princess, it is a dazzling 
trophy and a terrific business tool, but it never really became part of my 
personal life." 
</P>
<P>
We may be seeing a whole new Trump for Volume 3. He says celebrity takes its 
toll on a man, and points to Howard Hughes, a wealthy man who led a slightly 
less public life than Trump has so far. 
</P>
<P>
"The Howard Hughes story is fascinating to me because it shows that it's 
possible to fall very far very fast. As time goes on, I find myself thinking 
more and more about (Hughes) and even, to some degree, identifying with him." 
</P>
<P>
So one of these days maybe The Donald will decide to slip into a suite at the 
Plaza and just stay there, another celebrity running from the crowd that adores 
him.
