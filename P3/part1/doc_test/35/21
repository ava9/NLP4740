ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least one casino industry observer believes that Donald J. Trump was 
unfairly condemned when state regulators restricted his future investments in 
competing gaming companies. 
</P>
<P>
But other gaming analysts predicted Tuesday that Trump will not be frustrated 
by the restriction, part of a stipulation imposed Monday at Trump's casino 
re-licensing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In the stipulation, Trump agreed that neither he nor his affiliates would 
acquire directly or indirectly any securities of any holding or intermediary 
company with a New Jersey casino without the prior approval of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The stipulation affects future acquisitions and does not affect Trump's 
proposed purchase of Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel, which the billionaire 
developer has proposed converting into a luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making a nice cash flow on his investments in Atlantic City. I don't see 
why he would ever want to leave," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill 
Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said, however, that the state Casino Control Commission's restriction 
might frustrate Trump's interest in developing gaming halls in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wanted to make a run at Caesars World out there, for instance, and he's 
not permitted to buy stock here, it might affect his future in Las Vegas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst with the Philadelphia investment firm of 
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said Trump probably already has as much as he 
wants in Atlantic City. He already owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino 
hotels, and once he completes the massive Taj Mahal casino project, he will 
control 31.4% of the resort's gaming space, he said. Under state law, no one 
can own more than three casinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a 'Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
But Roffman said the commission's restrictions on Trump's investments in other 
casino companies "was a disgrace. It was a closed-door kind of thing where the 
commissioners said, 'We think you're dominating the Atlantic City skyline and 
we won't license you unless you make the following pledge.' 
</P>
<P>
"This should have been subject to a formal hearing and aired in public," 
Roffman said. "You just don't condemn a guy without an open hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Leonard, a gaming analyst for Laventhol &amp; Horwath of Philadelphia, 
said Trump knows he must bare his soul when appearing before the commission for 
his casino license renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"The casino license is a privilege, not a right," Leonard said.
