State casino investigators today expressed concern about the financial 
stability of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort but said it is too early to 
accurately predict the gambling hall's fate. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement before the state Casino Control Commission, Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Thomas Auriemma said the Taj Mahal's slot machine performance continues to lag 
and that a debt restructuring agreement reached with bondholders on Nov. 16 
fails to reduce the gambling hall's $675-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taj Mahal is not reducing its overall debt," Auriemma said. 
</P>
<P>
Auriemma and Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis agreed that the commission can 
examine the restructuring agreement although its exact terms have yet to be 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke as the casino commission began a hearing to examine the financial 
stability of the Taj, which opened last spring and is undergoing restructuring 
that will temporarily throw it into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
If they conclude that the casino is financially unstable, the commission 
members could lift its license and appoint a conservator to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
Trump himself was not at the hearing this morning. It is expected to last at 
least two days. The flamboyant developer, author of the best seller "The Art of 
the Deal," has battled financial and marital problems for most of the year.
