Maybe if Jim Jeffries hadn't tried that ill-advised 1910 comeback at 35, 
against Jack Johnson, none of this would have happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 80 years, most of the heavyweight champions -- George Foreman 
the most recent -- either fought too long or looked foolish in pipe-dream 
comebacks. Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavyweight champion in 1899-1905, was 
talked out of a five-year retirement by racists who insisted he knock the black 
champion, Jack Johnson, off his perch. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries, made a 10-6 favorite by gamblers, was beaten savagely by Johnson, who 
himself remained too long in the spotlight. At 37, he lost his title to Jess 
Willard in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Dempsey was inactive for 27 months in the 1920s, then was beaten 
decisively twice by Gene Tunney. Joe Louis, Max Schmeling, Floyd Patterson, 
Sonny Liston, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier all fought years past their prime, 
which brings us to Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, because he starched an over-the-hill heavyweight who wasn't much in 
his prime, Gerry Cooney, is being showered with money offers. Word is that 
Steve Wynn, who recently gave the world Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran at his 
Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, wanted Foreman to sign a three-fight deal that would 
include a Mike Tyson fight as the grand finale. Foreman turned him down, it's 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreman-Tyson fight is based on an assumption bigger than Foreman's waistline 
-- that he can first defeat a top-10-ranked opponent, a species Foreman has 
carefully avoided in his 20-bout comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn got Foreman on the phone after failing to bring middleweights Michael Nunn 
and Tommy Hearns together. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible roadblock to a Las Vegas Tyson-Foreman fight is that Donald 
Trump secured first-refusal rights to Tyson-Foreman when he bought the June 18 
Tyson-Evander Holyfield showdown for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
If Foreman beats Jose Ribalta, Trevor Berbick or another top-10 boxer, then the 
prospect of Tyson-Foreman becomes only slightly less ludicrous than it is now. 
Until then, George Foreman remains as ill-equipped to fight Mike Tyson as he 
was when he began his comeback in 1987 after a 10-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of over-the-hill heavyweights, are you ready for Larry 
Holmes-Michael Spinks III? Santa Monica promoter Harold Smith wants to match 
the two ex-champions -- both of whom were flattened by Tyson -- in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith talked to Holmes about such a matchup not long ago in Easton, Pa., and a 
$3-million purse for Holmes was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked, and Larry told Harold: 'Show me the money, Harold, then we'll 
talk,' " said Richie Giachetti, one-time Holmes trainer. 
</P>
<P>
And that, boxing fans, remains the name of the game. Money, $65,000 to be 
exact, brought Jim Jeffries back, and it's what brought Foreman back. Foreman 
would make millions in a Tyson fight, but the outcome would be the same as 
Jeffries-Johnson, with a young champion looking down on a beaten, old champion.

Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Boxing Update newsletter, Roberto Duran aided U.S. troops during 
the Panama invasion. Duran is said to have encouraged Panamanians not to resist 
the Americans and also to have "loaned" one of his apartments to U.S. troops, 
who used it to watch the Papal Embassy, where Manuel Noriega took refuge.

Jimmy Lennon Jr., will be the ring announcer for the Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas 
fight in Tokyo next Saturday. Lennon, 31, is in his eighth year of introducing 
fighters. His father, now retired, did the same for decades, mostly at the 
Olympic Auditorium. . . . Richie Giachetti, once Larry Holmes' trainer, on 
Douglas: "He's got a better shot than (Tony) Tubbs. But if he gets whacked, 
he's gone." . . . A federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday that all foreign 
TV-rights money from the Tyson-Douglas bout be paid into a court fund and not 
to Tyson's estranged manager, Bill Cayton. A spokesman for Don King, Tyson's 
promoter, claimed that Cayton has withheld as much as $500,000 in foreign TV 
money from Tyson. King, meanwhile, has been sued for $8 million by promoter 
Murad Muhammad after the Tyson-Razor Ruddock bout at Edmonton, Canada, in 
November was "postponed" and then not rescheduled when Tyson became ill.

Caesars Palace and promoter Bob Arum lost the Tommy Hearns-Michael Olijade 
middleweight fight they had tentatively set for April 26. That one will now 
open the new Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., on Showtime April 28. 
Arum, meanwhile, says George Foreman will "definitely" fight on an Arum show in 
April in Las Vegas, against an opponent to be named. As for the theory that 
Tyson-Foreman, should it occur at all, would wind up in Japan, Arum said: 
"George would resist that very strongly. He's a real patriot." On the same 
theme, Foreman told The Times a year ago: "Do we have to let the Japanese have 
everything? 
</P>
<P>
It's said that Steve Wynn offered Julio Cesar Chavez $4 million to fight Macho 
Camacho in Las Vegas. Camacho retained his World Boxing Organization junior 
welterweight title with a 12-round decision over Vinny Pazienza Saturday night. 
. . . Paul Banke, one-time Azusa amateur whiz, will get a second try at Daniel 
Zaragoza, the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight champion, in mid-March at 
the Forum. In June, Banke lost a unanimous decision to Zaragoza in his first 
title try. . . . March 14 is the 10th anniversary of the plane crash in Poland 
that killed 22 members of a U.S. amateur boxing delegation, including 14 
boxers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gonzales was to have met the winner of the recent WBC super-flyweight 
title fight in Seoul between Nana Konadu and Moon-Sung Kil, but he has been put 
on hold. In a controversial finish, the bout was stopped in the ninth round 
because of Kil's cuts, but Kil, not Konadu, was declared the 
"technical-decision" winner because he was ahead on all scorecards. If you find 
that hard to believe, you can imagine how Konadu and his corner reacted. 
Japanese reporter Joe Koizumi wrote afterward that the stoppage alone mystified 
nearly everyone, since Kil's cuts didn't seem all that bad. Whatever, WBC chief 
Jose Sulaiman, who was present, ordered a rematch as soon as possible. So, for 
Gonzales, who was promised the winner at the Forum, the wait goes on. In fact, 
he may give up on the super-fly title idea altogether and instead challenge WBC 
bantamweight champion Raul Perez. 
</P>

Mark Breland will defend his World Boxing Assn. welterweight title in London 
March 3 against Lloyd Honeyghan. . . . Unbeaten Virgil Hill will defend his WBA 
light-heavyweight title for the eighth time Feb. 25 in his hometown, Bismarck, 
N.D., against David Vedder. A victory by Hill would set up a possible HBO 
light-heavyweight unification tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox Lewis, the 1988 Olympic super-heavyweight gold medalist, improved to 7-0 
as a pro with a second-round KO of Noel Quarless Wednesday in London. He will 
next meet African champion Proud Kilimanjaro. . . . Henry Woods, top 
welterweight of the 1930s, died in Yakima, Wash., Wednesday. Woods, 75, was 
once the California lightweight champion and lost a 1935 decision to Barney 
Ross in a world title bout. . . . Olympian lightweight Todd Foster of Great 
Falls, Mont., 10-0 as a pro, may fight on an NBC card soon and then be signed 
afterward to a multifight package by the network. 
</P>
<P>
Mando Ramos celebrates the 21st anniversary of his winning the world 
lightweight title from Teo Cruz at 20 on Feb. 18 at Local 9 Shipbuilders Hall 
in Wilmington. An amateur boxing show, dinner and film highlights of Ramos' 
boxing career are scheduled. Tickets are $25, with proceeds going to Boxing 
Against Alcohol and Drugs. Information: (213) 519-7555.
