EASTER WEEKEND, Donald and Ivana Trump were hand-holding, having lunch with 
their kids, taking in a movie in Connecticut. People were talking 
"reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
As Earth Day weekend ended, the battling Trumps were in a no-reconciliation 
mode. After Donald's appearance on "The Larry King Show" on CNN and Marla 
Maples' exclusive on ABC's "PrimeTime Live," Ivana's attorney, Michael Kennedy, 
made two rare public statements. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said: "Donald Trump is 'the Master Manipulator.' But he has become 
bankrupt in all ways except financially." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was also derisive over Donald's charges that Ivana had tried to get 
many lawyers to take her case and been refused. Kennedy said: "There is not a 
lawyer in this country who wouldn't drop his briefs for this case!" (Ivana 
Trump remarked the day after she returned from the Aspen incident meeting Marla 
with Donald on the slopes that she went immediately to Kennedy. The reason? "He 
can't be bought by Donald. He can be trusted. And he has known the family for 
13 years and he always represents the powerless against the powerful.") 
</P>
<P>
I asked Kennedy many questions, but he declined to say more or to comment on 
the merits of the case. (Donald Trump responds: "Kennedy's words on moral 
bankruptcy are actionable.") 
</P>
<P>
IVANA'S PALS had much to say about what happened on TV last week. They've 
observed Ivana waver from angry resolution to a heart-melting susceptibility. 
Now intimates hope that "The Week of TV" will firm up her resolve. One 
commented: "The problem is that Donald appeared to be the soul of reason with 
Larry King, who put him on for a full hour with no annoying call-ins. King 
treated Trump like a pussycat. Then, although Marla may have reaped a TV 
ratings whirlwind, especially in New York, aside from revelations that she's in 
love with Donald and has never taken money from him, the interview rated a zero 
for content." 
</P>
<P>
From Ivana's side comes an amalgam of "reliable sources," remarking on both TV 
shows. These speakers insist they can't be identified for fear of "reprisals" 
from Donald. 
</P>
<P>
1. Donald says he is a family man. Reality: He carries on an adulterous affair 
for years. (Donald denies this.) 
</P>
<P>
2. Donald says the family is the most important thing to him. Reality: His true 
sensitivity to his family is shown in that he walked out on them. He then hired 
a self-acclaimed "killer who rips the flesh from witnesses" (lawyer Jay 
Goldberg) to defend himself against his wife and children. And Trump is 
reported having angrily fired his brother, Robert, from the Taj Mahal, although 
Robert is still in the Trump organization. (Donald says he did not fire 
Robert.) 
</P>
<P>
3. Donald says Ivana is getting $25 million and the house in Connecticut from 
the nuptial agreement. Reality: If the Trumps divorce, Ivana gets $10 million 
only, and the house. 
</P>
<P>
4. Ivana is said to have been disturbed by remarks her husband made on the King 
show to the effect that their children are "great," newspapers are kept from 
them, they are "insulated." Reality: Ivana's intimates say the children are 
"devastated," back in school in N.Y.C. and not "insulated" from comments by 
their chums. (Donald says: "It is disgraceful that Ivana and her 
representatives are playing the children for sympathy. I have assured the 
children no matter what happens to the marriage, I will continue to be their 
father and to provide moral support, love and affection and our relationship 
will in no way change. " 
</P>
<P>
5. On the King show, Donald restated his idea that "people grow apart." This 
was also repeated by Marla to Diane Sawyer. One intimate of both Trumps says, 
"Growing apart is one thing. Lying and cheating are another." This source 
insists that Marla wasn't truthful in the matter of money from Donald. "He has 
been supporting her for years." (Donald denies this.)
