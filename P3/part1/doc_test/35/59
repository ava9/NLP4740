A PROPOSED CHILDREN'S COURT FIT FOR CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
For children who must be removed from their parents' care because of abuse or 
neglect, proceedings in Los Angeles County Dependency Court can exacerbate the 
trauma of their tumultuous home life. 
</P>
<P>
The Dependency Court is housed in the Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los 
Angeles, a facility designed for hardened lawbreakers, not frightened children. 
Families waiting for their hearings often must stand in crowded, noisy 
corridors outside the courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The crush in the hallways has been bad enough to prompt the city fire marshal 
to cite the court for being "grossly overcrowded" on the 12th floor, where 
dependency hearings are held. Clerks, court reporters and counselors from the 
child advocate's office are housed in makeshift offices in unventilated storage 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
However, court officials hope that can change soon with the proposed 
construction of the Los Angeles County Children's Court in Monterey Park. When 
its doors open, perhaps early in 1992, the court will be unlike any other 
facility in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever built a building like this," said Frank Zolin, executive 
officer of the Los Angeles County court system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that anyone has designed a children's court where the 
entire caseload would (involve) neglected and abused children (rather than 
delinquents). There's nothing even similar." 
</P>
<P>
The six-story, $45.1-million project goes before the Monterey Park City Council 
for approval this week. The county Board of Supervisors will consider giving 
final design and construction approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the project is approved by the city and the county, ground would 
be broken next year at the six-acre site on the western edge of Monterey Park, 
near the junction of the Long Beach and San Bernardino freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the forbidding environs of the Criminal Courts Building, 
the Children's Court would be designed to be "child sensitive," Zolin said. The 
court building would include such amenities as diaper-changing rooms and 
secured play areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have scaled-down courtrooms that are less formal and less imposing in 
an effort to reduce the trauma on the children," Zolin said. "Obviously, all 
the areas that will serve the children, the waiting rooms, shelter care, will 
be designed with children in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The facility will also house all the various ancillary agencies that provide 
services to children. The county Department of Children's Services, the county 
counsel and the Sheriff's Department will all have office space in the 
building, as will private psychiatrists and psychologists and volunteers from 
the child advocate's office. 
</P>
<P>
Children whose cases are heard in the court will also benefit from its close 
proximity to Cal State Los Angeles, just across the San Bernardino Freeway. 
Zolin said the university and the court will be able to develop a closer 
relationship that will benefit both institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"People now working in Dependency Court will do in-service training at the 
university -- people in the county counsel, sheriff's deputies and counselors 
from the Department of Children's Services," Zolin said. "Also, it will be a 
learning opportunity for students from Cal State L.A. studying sociology and 
social case work." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles President James S. Rosser said the court would provide an 
ideal setting for internships for students in the university's School of Health 
and Human Services. Attorneys and counselors from the court would also be 
welcome to serve as adjunct faculty at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Zolin added that Cal State Los Angeles is a leading university in studying the 
particular social problems manifested in many of the cases heard each day in 
Dependency Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Cal State L.A. is one of the up-and-coming universities in the U.S. dealing 
with urban problems," Zolin said. "I believe proximity to Cal State L.A. and 
this partnership is really going to enhance research into domestic violence and 
child neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Rosser said the relationship between the university and the court "fits in with 
the urban-focus commitment we have as part of our mission as a university. . . 
. I'm very pleased to see (the court project) coming to a positive fruition." 
</P>
<P>
The Dependency Court was originally moved to the Criminal Courts Building on a 
"temporary basis" in 1978. Since virtually its first day there, court officials 
complained that a building created for criminal proceedings was not the proper 
place to decide such a sensitive matter as whether a child should be removed 
from his or her family. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the classic stories is about when one of the . . . youngsters was 
walking in through the front door and saw the (Criminal Courts Building) sign," 
Zolin said. "He turned to the case worker and said, 'Am I a criminal?' " 
</P>
<P>
"The Dependency Courts should never have been located in the environment of the 
Criminal Courts Building," he added. "That was an interim relocation that 
lasted 11 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awareness Rises 
</P>
<P>
The inadequacies of the Criminal Courts Building were worsened in the early 
1980s as the public and government agencies became more aware of child abuse. 
In the 1984-85 fiscal year, the caseload at the Dependency Court rose 23%. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the growing backlog of criminal cases made courtroom space 
downtown a precious commodity. Superior Court judges have said that 
overcrowding at the Criminal Courts Building could be eased considerably if the 
Dependency Courts vacated the courtrooms on the 12th floor. 
</P>
<P>
But the search for a new location for the Dependency Court was delayed by 
disagreement among officials about location and the type of facility to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the favored plan was to create 20 courtrooms by remodeling the 
former Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department store in Alhambra. An additional 
five courtrooms were to be housed in a satellite office in Irwindale. 
Eventually, however, court officials concluded that children would be best 
served in a single, new facility. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is not without its detractors, the most influential of whom is county 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Schabarum cast the lone opposing vote in May, 1988, 
when the Board of Supervisors voted to build the Children's Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hageman, Schabarum's assistant chief deputy, said the supervisor opposed 
the project largely because he believed that the project should be coordinated 
by the county Facilities Management Department, not by Zolin. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody questioning the need for better Dependency Court facilities," 
Hageman said. "It's who was doing (the construction) as much as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Zolin said he took over the reins of the project in May, 1988, under an order 
by county Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"I accepted the responsibility of putting the project together after Mr. Dixon 
made it a condition for there being a project," Zolin said, adding that 
Schabarum has long opposed efforts to build a centralized Juvenile Court 
facility. "Mr. Schabarum has criticized that decision by Mr. Dixon. That may 
explain his opposition since May of 1988, but Mr. Schabarum has a record" of 
opposing a new central Juvenile Court for 10 to 12 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's opposition was based, Zolin said, on his belief that the public 
would be better served by five satellite children's courts spread throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Mr. Schabarum will express that opinion again when the issue is 
before the supervisors" in March, Zolin said. "He favors five satellites, but 
our studies clearly indicate that it's more cost-beneficial to have a 
centralized program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes 'Taj Mahal' 
</P>
<P>
Hageman said Schabarum's opposition to the project was not based primarily on 
his preference for satellite courts, but added: "He thought it could be done at 
less expense by not building a Taj Mahal." Schabarum has not decided whether he 
will oppose the project when the board votes on its final design and 
construction next month. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to encounter little opposition from the Monterey Park 
City Council at a public hearing Wednesday night. Although the project violates 
a city ordinance prohibiting the construction of buildings over two stories, 
council members said they see no problem with the six-story courthouse because 
it will be separated by a freeway from the rest of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any problem with excluding it (from the height limit)," Mayor 
Barry Hatch said. "We're pretty stiff on the height limit, but I think this is 
an area where we can bend on it." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said the Children's Court project will yield social benefits to the 
county and a financial return to the city. The Children's Court site was traded 
by Monterey Park's Community Redevelopment Agency to the county in exchange for 
land on the east side of the Long Beach Freeway, near the Los Angeles Corporate 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park officials had sought to attract a developer to build a hotel near 
the corporate center. However, they were unable to conclude a deal for a hotel 
on their original site, which was relatively inaccessible and had the Sybil 
Brand Institute, the county women's jail, as a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The land (where the court is to be located) is of little value to us," Hatch 
said. As a result of the land swap, he said, Monterey Park has a much better 
location for a hotel and the county has an adequate site for the Children's 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely need the court," Hatch said. "It's for children who are in 
trouble, not problem children. We see it as a contribution to a great need."
