LIZ SMITH: LITERARY GUILD TRIUMPHANT IN FIGHT FOR 'DAZZLE'

THE LATEST titanic struggle wasn't in the prize ring, or between warring and 
rich husbands and wives, or in the Hollywood offices of agents talking about 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
It happened between those two respectable giants of publishing, the 
Book-of-the-Month Club and the Literary Guild. They entered into a really 
competitive fight trying to buy the latest novel of Judith Krantz. The 
Book-of-the-Month Club seldom ever buys commercial fiction of the Krantz 
stripe; they are more likely to seek history and biography. However, they 
wanted "Dazzle." Judith's past work has always gone to the Literary Guild, and 
the Guild again nailed down "Dazzle." 
</P>
<P>
They offered agent Mort Janklow $900,000 for book club rights. This does not 
begin to be the money Judith will make on her latest effort. She already earned 
millions in a three-book deal with Crown. And then, of course, there is the 
mini-movie to be made after this one is published next January. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. TO a recent tale about the talent drain at NBC. Emmy winner Bob Jamieson, 
reported leaving, is very happy about his decision. His agent, Stuart Witt, 
says it was Bob's idea not to renew after 18 years at NBC. He will begin 
toiling at ABC's New York bureau in April. 
</P>
<P>
HERE'S WHAT Donald Trump told me when I rang to ask what he thinks of the 
rampant rumor that a local weekly plans to do a story on him and Amanda Burden, 
the beautiful and social stepdaughter of William S. Paley and former wife to 
Steve Ross and Carter Burden. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said: "This would be very unfair to Miss Burden. I haven't seen the lady 
physically in 10 years. I hardly know her. There is absolutely no attraction 
between us. I have said it before -- half the women I am linked to or mentioned 
with are ones I have never even met." 
</P>
<P>
Trump went on to rave about the opening of his Taj Mahal in Atlantic City on 
April 5. His good news? Donald says, "I am fine, and the Taj is virtually 
unprecedented! People thought it would never open! People said nobody could 
build it and finish it, let alone bring it in on budget and open on time!" 
</P>
<P>
I DON'T know what USA Today means when they print a pointless, truncated, 
taken-out-of-context little story under the headline "Liz Smith's Sticky 
Situation." I don't find myself in any sticky situation. I am used to being 
criticized; it happens every day. This time, again, it seems to be for "having 
an uncomfortably cozy relationship with some celebs." Or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
But please, don't panic. I still firmly believe that being given a gossip 
column to write under your own byline means you have the leeway to get as 
uncomfortably cozy with celebrities and names and important people as possible. 
It's part of this particular job and goes with the territory. And sometimes you 
get great stories that way, and sometimes you are stymied and don't. 
</P>
<P>
Another big negative flash for you is the horrid revelation that I use material 
from press agents from time to time. I don't know what people think the gossip 
business is, or what columns they ever read that don't use help. Even the 
President has a press agent, named Marlin Fitzwater. So do the Pentagon, the 
networks, all big business and most publications. It isn't against the law for 
press agents to make a living.
