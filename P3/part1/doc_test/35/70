PEOPLE: LUCIANI TO OPERATE GRIFFIN'S CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Golden Nugget Inc. executive Alfred Luciani has been appointed to run 
Merv Griffin's financially troubled Resorts International Casino Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at the same time disgruntled bondholders were deciding 
whether to file a lawsuit forcing New Jersey's first gaming company into 
involuntary bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin has asked Resorts bondholders to approve a massive restructuring in 
which the company's two classes of bondholders would receive significantly less 
interest and principal in return for cash and stock. However, unsecured 
bondholders are unhappy with the deal and have been rumored poised to file suit 
by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts President David Hanlon named Luciani executive vice president and chief 
operating officer of the 680-room Resorts International Casino Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Al represents a strong addition to our management team," Hanlon said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Luciani held a number of executive positions in the Golden Nugget over an 
eight-year period, including president and chief executive of Golden Nugget Las 
Vegas, where he was responsible for the operation of the 2,000-room casino 
hotel, and executive vice president of Golden Nugget Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Nugget no longer has a casino hotel in Atlantic City. It is now called 
Bally's Grand. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Luciani headed A.L.M. Moonstone Inc., a New Jersey company 
formed to buy the Claridge Hotel Casino. However, after months of elaborate 
negotiations failed to culminate in a deal, Claridge officials in September 
pulled out of the transaction.
