In her small black sunglasses, short black dress and stilettos, a headset
mike fitted around the razor cheekbones, Tania Maria totters on to the stage
like a formidable adversary for Mad Max's Tina Turner. She looks as though
she means business.
The Brazilian singer/pianist's business is hot Latin fusion and on Thursday
it came fast and tight as ever. It was the last night of a European tour
and, according to the salsasavants, she is at her at 'pre-New York best'.
This presumably means that the melodies are uncomplicated and the rhythm,
borne by congas, drums and bass, uncompromising. The carnival fireworks are
in the voice and the streaming wordless vocals and scatting. Or even
whistling (she trilled a complicated 10-minute salsa version of 'Do you
think I'm sexy?').
Whistling jazz fusion and getting away with it is one thing: any singer who
can make a Royal Festival Hall audience dance has spirit. But the steaming
mix of rock and Latin jazz, cranked up by horn and trumpet, was completely
irresistible.
The Maria method can be applied to any number, 'Ce c'est bon', a carnival
stomper fitted in perfectly with an unlikely, but sizzling version of the
Stones' 'Satisfaction', carried off bolero style. 'Hup]' the changes are
signalled as she comes crashing down the keyboard, cheeks sucked into an
impossible pout and out pour the words. She crouches at the keyboards (one
is electric) and telegraphs the cues to her slavish accompanists in between
batting the lyric around with her hands as it tumbles forth. Block chords
are plonked in, when she can restrain her hands, to keep the careering voice
on course.
It did the trick. By the end of the set more than a few of us were doing the
merengue, elbows akimbo, down the gangway to meet the po-faced ushers in
front of the stage. 'I'm very happy - a little homesick - but I think we
done a very good concert,' Tania concluded modestly as she left an RFH
crying out for more.
Three hours earlier singer Cleveland Watkiss was taking the stage in support
of Tania Maria. Showcasing a splendid new album, Blessing in disguise
(Polydor), the young black Londoner has a style and voice which could be
mass marketed to a wider than jazz audience. That seems to be the idea,
anyhow. But a fine Guildhall-trained voice is no guarantee of commercial
success. My feeling is that he is too hard to pin down - and too crafty with
the grooves - to appeal to non-jazzers. Like a junior jazz version of Taj
Mahal, he has absorbed almost the entire range of black music from calypso
and reggae ('Bagah-Orange') to George Bensonesque schmooze ('Memories'). It
is clever stuff alright and the six piece band behind him, led by guitarist
Tony Remy, are spot on. But it is worth noting that the biggest cheers - led
by his mother - were for a straight Motown soul sounding ballad which is
pure Marvin Gaye, 'Be Thankful for what you got'.
