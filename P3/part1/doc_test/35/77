<P>
Councilman Robert A. Curtis was elected the fourth mayor of Mission Viejo 
Monday night, and he pledged to lead the city into a new era of unity. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Curtis said the last three years were marred by a 
"fierce and continuous conflict that shook the very foundation of our fledgling 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Three new council members -- Sharon Cody, Robert Breton and Susan Withrow -- 
were sworn in by U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) during a ceremony at the 
Oso Viejo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis was elected unanimously to serve a one-year term in office. Curtis in 
February defeated a recall effort backed by nearly $500,000 in contributions by 
the Mission Viejo Co. and other real estate interests. Cody, who supported the 
anti-recall campaign and was the top vote-getter in the Nov. 6 election, was 
elected vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Three outgoing council members -- Christian W. Keena, Victoria C. Jaffe and 
Norman P. Murray -- had supported the Curtis recall campaign, arguing that 
Curtis' presence was disruptive to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said Monday that he appreciates what it is to be a political minority, 
and he pledged to respect "differing views" and to protect "dissenting voices." 
</P>
<P>
Outlining his agenda for the 3-year-old city, Curtis said the city should 
reconsider spending $1 million to renovate a building it recently bought for a 
city hall. Curtis has favored an offer by the Mission Viejo Co. to donate 7.2 
acres for a civic center in return for permission to build a 700-housing unit 
development near the eastern boundary of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mission Viejo is to accept its leadership role in South Orange County, then 
surely our seat of government should be a source of pride in keeping with that 
pre-eminent status," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not call for a Taj Mahal, but I do share voters' expectations that we 
exercise foresight and prudent business practices to ensure that our civic 
facilities meet future needs and engender pride among our residents." 
</P>
<P>
The new council, he said, will also ask the city attorney whether it can 
overturn a $15-million refuse hauling franchise awarded to Dewey's Rubbish 
without a competitive bid. DAVAN MAHARAJ
