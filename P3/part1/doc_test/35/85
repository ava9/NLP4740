Donald Trump, who has star billing on Manhattan real estate, New Jersey 
casinos, an airline and a board game, will lend his name to a new TV game show, 
"Trump Card." 
</P>
<P>
The daily syndicated show, the first TV venture for the wealthy developer, was 
unveiled on Tuesday at a press conference here. The show will be produced at 
the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The game show -- which will combine elements of bingo, with viewers playing on 
cards at home -- was created by Lorimar Television and will be distributed by 
Warner Bros. Domestic Television. It is based on a British game show called 
"Full House." 
</P>
<P>
Although Trump might make an appearance on the program, he said that he does 
not expect to play a major creative role in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm involved in the ownership of the show. I'm not creatively involved, except 
somewhat modestly," Trump said. "What attracted me to the show were the 
statistics on its success in England and my confidence in Steve Ross," the 
Time-Warner executive who is a longtime friend of Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Although Trump would not specify the financial arrangements on the show, he 
said any profits from his portion, which he described as a "good, substantial 
stake," would be donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot for "Trump Card" will be produced over the next four to six weeks, 
with the series to be sold to local stations for the fall season next year. 
Intended for the 7-8 p.m. time slot, the series will have among its likely 
competition "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," two long-running game shows 
from Merv Griffin, who has been a rival to Trump in the Atlantic City hotel 
business. (Trump said at the press conference that Griffin was not a factor in 
his own entry into the game-show business.) 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to build a new game show in syndication, without prior exposure 
on a commercial network. But David Salzman, president of Lorimar Television, 
said that the producers are looking to the play-along possibilities of the 
game, plus the recognizability of Trump's name, to win initial stations and 
viewers.
