</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald J. Trump is not known for his modesty. He names a lot of things after 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Trump Plaza &amp; Casino and the Trump Castle &amp; Casino in 
Atlantic City, N.J.; the 68-story Trump Tower office and apartment building, 
the Trump Plaza cooperative and Trump Parc condominiums in Manhattan; the Trump 
Plaza condominiums in Palm Beach, Fla., and his 282-foot Trump Princess, the 
world's largest private yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's got an airline bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Paint Airliners 
</P>
<P>
"I put my name on something when I really feel that it is going to be right," 
he said at a news conference at New York's swank Plaza Hotel -- which he 
acquired a year ago but has not named for himself, presumably because there are 
already too many Trump Plazas. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did not try to hide his jubilation as he talked to reporters Thursday 
hours after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland signed the order allowing 
Eastern Airlines to sell its Northeast shuttle to Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The New York hotel owner and real estate developer said the Trump Shuttle's 21 
airliners will be painted white with black, red and gold stripes. Trump's name 
will be painted on each side of the planes; on the tail there will be a giant 
T. He said he will take over the shuttle from Eastern in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me as much pleasure as buying the Plaza Hotel," he said. "This is 
something that from day one I have said I want to have my name on." 
</P>
<P>
Trump even boasted that his name is what finally won him the shuttle in the 
contest he had been having over it in bankruptcy court with America West 
Airlines. Phoenix-based America West offered more for the shuttle than Trump's 
$365 million but could not come up with the financing to support the bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw one report that said that the biggest disadvantage America West had was 
that it did not have the Trump name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy court, which has been in charge of Eastern's affairs since it 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 9, must approve the sale of any of the 
carrier's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Trump and Bruce Nobles, a man who began his airline career with American 
Airlines 23 years ago as a reservations clerk and is now president of the Trump 
Shuttle, declined to say what specific changes would be made in the shuttle 
service, which links New York with Boston and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They would not say if fares will be cut in an effort to win back some of the 
passengers lost to the Pan Am Shuttle in the last three months. The two 
shuttles each had about half of the traffic before Eastern's machinists went on 
strike March 4. Since then, Eastern's share has slipped to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump Shuttle will employ about 1,000 people, of whom 800 will be former 
Eastern workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planes Are Safe 
</P>
<P>
Trump and Nobles did say that the planes -- all aging Boeing 727s -- will be 
refurbished during the next year and that some new planes will ultimately be 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
But the shuttle's present planes are safe, Trump said. Because of Eastern's 
recent troubles, he added, the airliners have been more closely inspected than 
those of any other carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "We are going to go over them totally, impeccably 
carefully. We will X-ray every part, every inch. They are not only going to be 
the safest planes in the air, they are going to be magnificent to look at."
