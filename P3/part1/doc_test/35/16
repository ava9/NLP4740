Despite what you hear, the high rollers who play in Atlantic City, N.J., aren't 
all flocking to the Taj Mahal casino-hotel, Donald Trump's soon-to-be-opened 
monument to wretched excess. In fact, some of Atlantic City's heaviest action 
involves the property next door to the Taj: Merv Griffin's Resorts 
International casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately for Merv, these players aren't throwing their money around in 
the Resorts casino, where he could make a few bucks off them. Instead, these 
guys are playing in the Resorts bankruptcy, where they're trying to make a few 
bucks off Merv. Not to mention off each other. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the adaptable world of Wall Street. A world in which mergers and 
acquisitions action -- or M&amp;A, as it's known -- has all but collapsed. A 
world in which the new game is to try to make money from failed M&amp;A deals 
because there aren't enough new deals to feed everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the nervous energy that used to be put into M&amp;A has been directed 
into this," quips Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., a bankruptcy veteran who is 
advising Resorts' senior bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Resorts, which was supposed to be a tidy, "prepackaged" 
bankruptcy, has turned into a four-way battle, pitting three big bondholders 
against one another and against Merv: 
</P>
<P>
* First Executive Corp., the giant Los Angeles insurance company top heavy with 
junk bonds, which owns more than $100 million of Resorts' most senior bonds, 
which total $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Sabre Associates, a fund associated with the guys who put together Coniston 
Partners but separately run, which controls $20 million to $30 million of 
Resorts' $200 million of second-most-senior bonds. 
</P>
<P>
* Jay Goldsmith and Harry Freund, two of the biggest talkers in the bankruptcy 
world, who claim to control $150 million of Resorts' $400 million of 
least-senior bonds and who seem to have painted themselves into a corner by 
making threats they can't back up. 
</P>
<P>
* Merv, who as the stockholder of Resorts is at the bottom of the pile but is 
trying to climb out by putting $30 million of new money into the company. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought that you needed mud to have mud wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
None of this would be going on had it not been for Merv, the man who made 
hundreds of millions of dollars by creating the "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"Jeopardy" TV game shows but who has blown $60 million and his reputation as a 
smart businessman on Resorts, now known as the Default Show. 
</P>
<P>
Merv, you remember, "won" Resorts in late 1988 after a widely publicized 
takeover battle with Trump but quickly ran into trouble, defaulted on Resorts' 
bonds last August and put Resorts into bankruptcy in December. 
</P>
<P>
That brought in the bankruptcy players, who live in a world in which you not 
only want to make money but also to beat up the other guy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Resorts battle, in which Merv is offering to fork over the $30 million, 
78% of the stock and some new bonds, the idea is to make such a pest of 
yourself that Merv or other bondholders will give you more than Merv's plan 
calls for. 
</P>
<P>
You do this by threatening to invoke bankruptcy rules, under which no one gets 
anything until all the creditors above him have been paid in full. 
Shareholders, who come below the creditors, are last in line. 
</P>
<P>
In a so-called consensual plan, like this one, bondholders can take less than 
full payment provided that half the bondholders in each class, owning 
two-thirds of the bonds, give their consent. Thus, if you control one-third of 
a class of bonds, you can break up a consensual plan. 
</P>
<P>
The risk you run is that the original bankruptcy rules come back into play and 
the bankrupt company may run out of assets before you get paid in full. That's 
known as being crammed down. 
</P>
<P>
One reason there's a compromise here is that, for arcane legal reasons, what 
appear to be the most-senior Resorts bonds might not be senior at all. It could 
take years to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
This prospect, plus the fact that it would probably show a gain on its bonds if 
the Griffin plan is approved, makes First Executive eager to settle. Merv, for 
obvious reasons, also wants to cut a deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Sabre and the Goldsmith-Freund team are making noises. Sabre, which 
wouldn't talk to me, has told other people that it will cram down Goldsmith and 
Freund, as well as Griffin, unless it gets a better settlement. Goldsmith and 
Freund, who have a carefully cultivated mad-dog image, threaten to blow up the 
whole plan. But, as one adviser to the Griffin forces says, "Harry and Jay are 
being less rabid than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, their position doesn't seem too good. They could get killed here, the 
same way they got killed a few years ago when they tried to cram down the 
stockholders of the bankrupt Global Marine Corp. but were themselves crammed 
down by senior creditors. Goldsmith and Freund had an indicated 90% loss, 
although they claim it was less. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith and Freund wouldn't talk to me but sent a public relations man to 
tell me that they have about as much invested in the senior Resorts bonds as 
they do in the juniors -- a claim that provoked howls of laughter from everyone 
I tried to confirm it with. 
</P>
<P>
What will finally happen, probably, is that when the dust settles, something 
like Griffin's plan will be approved. Until then, the Resorts bankruptcy will 
be a better show than The Donald and the Taj. Stay tuned.
