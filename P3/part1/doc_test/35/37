TRUMP PLANS BIG COMPLEX ON AMBASSADOR HOTEL SITE

Donald J. Trump, the brash and controversial builder from Manhattan, announced 
plans in Los Angeles on Saturday that apparently would lead to the demolition 
of the historic Ambassador Hotel as part of a mammoth commercial and 
residential redevelopment expected to cost more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Trump also confirmed that his plans may include construction of the nation's 
tallest building -- 125 stories -- on the hotel site, nearly 24 acres in the 
mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be Trump's first on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, 43, revealed his plans at a packed news conference at the 69-year-old 
hotel, once an elegant gathering spot for the rich and famous and perhaps best 
known as the site of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in 1968. The hotel 
closed a year ago after decades of decline. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's announcement was only the first step in what promises to be a long 
and grueling process to get the project approved and built. Trump estimated 
that the effort could take as long as five years. 
</P>
<P>
His plans are likely to trigger opposition among preservation groups, who do 
not want the venerable hotel demolished, and Los Angeles education officials, 
who want the site for a 2,000-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
Trump claimed the Ambassador is too run-down to renovate and the property too 
expensive to use for a school. 
</P>
<P>
A news release from Trump's company said: "Buildings of architectural 
distinction and true California style will replace the unsafe and antiquated 
structures." When asked directly if the Ambassador might be saved as part of 
the project, Trump said that was "very unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said Saturday that 
the district remains firm in its resolve to use the site for a school and would 
condemn the property through eminent domain if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the higher cause here is a school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservation group, also probably will oppose 
Trump's plans because of its interest in preserving the Ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel it would be possible to re-use the historic structures as part 
of a new project," conservancy director Jay Rounds said after the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to the Ambassador property is critical to the planned restoration 
of the mid-Wilshire business district, whose importance as a commercial center 
has been overshadowed in recent years by downtown Los Angeles and areas farther 
west on Wilshire Boulevard. The Ambassador site is one of the last large open 
spaces left in urban Los Angeles that is available for large-scale development. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did not detail what his project would contain, saying that he is three 
months away from unveiling specific plans. Several well-known architects are 
now developing plans for the site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did say that the development probably will include a combination of 
apartments, condominiums, a hotel, offices, retail shops and a large ballroom 
known as the Cocoanut Grove, named after the Ambassador's nightclub that was so 
popular in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to a mixed-use project that will have the stature of a 
Rockefeller Center (in New York)," said Scott Malkin, one of Trump's partners. 
The development will cost "well in excess of $1 billion," Malkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, in an interview after the news conference, confirmed that the project 
might include a 125-story office building. The 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago 
is currently the nation's tallest office tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of Los Angeles would like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Tom Bradley and City Councilman Nate Holden, both of whom joined 
Trump for his news conference, oppose that idea, believing a building of that 
size is inappropriate for that location. "I don't think that's a good idea," 
said Holden, in whose district the Ambassador is located. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also declined to pass judgment on Trump's overall plan. In a news 
release, he said, "I have not seen the plans for Mr. Trump's proposed 
development, so I can't comment on the specifics of the project." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's news conference generally was marked by goodwill, with lots of hype 
mixed in. Others attending included City Council President John Ferraro and 
several American and European developers who are Trump's partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to working with you . . . on a mixed-use development that is 
responsive to the needs of all the people," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did it take you so long to get to Los Angeles?" Ferraro quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has acquired an interest in Wilshire Center Partners, which bought the 
hotel property last year for $64 million. The partnership has been renamed 
Trump Wilshire Associates, with Trump as the managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Trump declined to disclose how much he paid for his investment, saying only 
that it was a "substantial amount" that would get larger with time. It is 
believed, however, that he paid between $12 million and $13 million for a 20% 
interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
Trump made his mark on the East Coast during the 1980s with high-profile 
developments in Manhattan and Atlantic City. He currently is building the 
world's most expensive casino hotel, the $1-billion Taj Mahal, at the eastern 
end of the Boardwalk in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
But, sometimes, there is a gulf between what Trump says he wants to do and what 
actually happens. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he has been trying since 1984 to develop a huge parcel of land on 
the upper West Side of Manhattan that is to have apartment towers, shopping 
malls, offices and a 150-story office building. The proposed development 
remains bogged down in controversy and local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Trump has not always been so bullish on Los Angeles. "I'm really 
concerned with the whole earthquake situation in L.A.," he told The Times in 
1988. "I am a tremendous believer that someday Las Vegas may be the West 
Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Trump expressed no such doubts. What about earthquakes and their 
effect on a 125-story building? "It's no problem," he replied, adding that his 
buildings would survive.
