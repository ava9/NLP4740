HOW THE PET PROJECT OF A MAYOR EVENTUALLY BECAME 'FIDO FOUNTAIN'

Local government can be frustrating, and few practitioners of the municipal art 
know that better than Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Geissert spends hours at council meetings listening to angry 
residents berating each other about hillside view obstructions, the roar of 
airplanes or the "Taj Mahal" being built next to someone's basic three-bedroom, 
three-bath tract home. 
</P>
<P>
Among municipal issues, few are more volatile than those involving dogs, whose 
masters take to howling at the slightest hint of further regulation of their 
beloved pets. 
</P>
<P>
But when Dorothy King wrote Torrance City Hall about a canine problem on the 
beach, Geissert saw a chance to get something accomplished -- quickly, cheaply 
and, most unusually, without raising anyone's hackles. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance resident King and her dog take a daily four-mile stroll along the 
beach. Afterward, they sit in Miramar Park, overlooking the ocean. The park has 
a single water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
"People . . . are letting their dogs drink out of this fountain," King 
complained. "The large dogs jump up as their masters turn on the water for 
them. Very upsetting to me, and others, if they knew they were drinking after 
dogs. I myself love my dog . . . but I do not eat or drink after my own dog." 
</P>
<P>
King suggested that the city put in a water fountain at the base of the 
existing fountain. "Something must be done . . . to keep the city of Torrance 
clean health-wise," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounded reasonable to me," the mayor said. "There are not many 
opportunities to serve people that don't cost much money. In rather short 
order, they put in a ground-level basin." 
</P>
<P>
And there, you might think, the tale would end. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty dogs watered, sensibilities preserved. Problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
But back at the park, beach-goers just did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
King wrote again. "Some people do not use their head. . . . Some people are 
using the dog fountain to wash their feet, and the sand is stopping up the 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog lovers," she added, "are talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
And that is how the city of Torrance came to erect a miniature headstone at its 
canine watering spot, "Fido Fountain." 
</P>
<P>
Geissert thinks it may be some sort of first. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is another Fido Fountain around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-observant King again wrote: "I have seen many people stop, read this 
sign, walk away with a smile on their face. . . . I am truly grateful."
