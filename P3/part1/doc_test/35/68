The beggar-girl was enchantingly beautiful. She must have been at least six
years old. 'Give me shampoo]' she pleaded, seemingly close to tears. 'Give
me lipstick, give me soaps,' and she tugged again at our camera-straps.
I reflected that the beggars of Madurai had become more sophisticated since
I was last there: the younger generation was targetting the tourists in
four-star-hotel language, perhaps because it had discovered that foreigners
are now implored by everybody - by guidebooks and travel agents and aid
workers - not to listen to the pleas of India's beggar hordes. Give a cheque
to the charities, they all say: that is the most efficient way you can help.
But the beggars are usually not beautiful. There was an old man hobbling
behind the girl who wanted to show me something revolting on the end of the
stump of his arm. He didn't want shampoo; he was determined on rupees. We
struggled on through the crowd and surrendered our shoes to another old man,
this time for safe- keeping while we entered the Hindu temple, and we were
secretly relieved when our guide dispersed the crowd for a few seconds with
a flurry of gestures and curses.
This is one of the phenomena - one of the eternal truths - of India which
alarms the first-time visitor. How will we cope with the poverty? Is it true
that there are babies dying on the pavements? What are we supposed to do
when we are surrounded by a score of frantic, pleading, ragged and horribly
deformed children?
The question - the problem - can present itself at a higher and moral level.
Here am I, spending a (comparative) fortune on my own pleasure, enjoying the
luxury of sophisticated hotels in order to seek out the glories of a supreme
civilisation, while out there on the street - I glimpse them from my
air-conditioned taxi - my fellow-beings are suffering a misery which is
incomprehensible to, let alone endurable by, a European.
It is a topic which invariably comes up in dinner-party talk. There is no
shortage of people, not just those of excessive sensitivity, whose holiday
has been ruined by the sights they have seen on their very first drive from
Bombay airport to the luxuriance of the Taj Hotel.
Because India, of all the countries and cultures and civilisations of this
world, most deserves the effort, I have a suggestion:
Start off in Goa. It is India made easy.
Goa, unlike India proper, is green, well-fed, clean (up to a point),
accessible, Christian, cosmopolitan. It also has an English-speaking,
efficient and fast-expanding tourist industry. It is picturesque, it has
wonderful beaches, a splendid and unoppressive climate, and it is still
pretty cheap. The local cuisine is delicious and distinctive; it even makes
its own wine (yes, well . . .). No wonder it is in the vanguard of the
Indian government's tourist plans.
Goa has not always been a favoured British destination. Because it was
Portuguese from the early 16th century until the peace-loving Nehru sent in
his army in 1961, it did not figure in the favoured itineraries of the Raj,
like Kashmir, the Taj Mahal, Rajasthan and the Elephanta Caves. All that has
changed, and Goa is certain to continue its charter-driven boom of visitors
from Europe, particularly from Britain.
Most of the tourists come for the beaches, which, to repeat, are wonderful
and not spoiled at all by 'hippy colonies' (much exaggerated) or
never-ending offers from the locals of massage or handicrafts or coconuts.
These locals are not touts in the Mediterranean sense, irritating and
intrusive. I have one happy memory of an enormously fat and good-tempered
Australian under the parasol next to mine, being persuaded by a group of
passing youths to pose with them for a photograph because, they told him,
their village would not otherwise believe that anyone of his size could
exist. They then gave him a bunch of flowers.
The sea and the sand and the climate of Goa are of the best. But Goa is
worth journeying above the high-tide mark. The Portuguese colonial presence
produced an attractive local architectural style as well as a Christian
tradition. These come together most dramatically in the semi-deserted town
of Old Goa, inland through the rice paddies from the present capital of
Panaji. It is an essential excursion even for beach fanatics.
Old Goa boasts, under the dedicated though poverty-stricken guardianship of
the Architectural Survey of India, a collection of remarkable episcopal and
civic buildings that dates from the 16th century. In the mid-19th century
the Portuguese rulers retreated from Old Goa's diseases and moved downstream
to Panaji. Today Old Goa's hottest draw is the mummified and 'miraculously
preserved' body of St Francis Xavier, the Jesuit who arrived in 1542, went
on to continue his mission work in China, and asked to be returned in death
to his beloved Goa. He rests there today, his unravaged face visible through
a glass plate in the Basilica Bom Jesus.
By ancient tradition his body is taken into the cathedral on rare occasions
when the devout - Hindus as well as Roman Catholics, pilgrims from around
the world as well as locals - gather in their millions to venerate him. This
exposition is to happen again this year, apparently for the final time
because the corpse, at long last, is shrinking at an embarrassing rate. It
is going to be an enormous affair and, if you are not one of the
above-mentioned devout, you would be well-advised to steer clear.
Do not assume that you find only an untypical Christian culture in this part
of India. Although Portuguese rule obliged the Hindus to build their temples
inland and on a modest scale, you can get a fascinating introduction to that
religion on a scale less overwhelming and intimidating than in the enormous
temple complexes in the south.
This explosion of tourism must be particularly welcome to the Goans - an
outward-looking people who have traditionally emigrated all over the world -
because they have to face up to the decline of their local iron ore exports.
But the boom carries with it all the usual dangers, so well demonstrated
elsewhere in the world's beautiful places - pollution, falling standards,
ribbon development, crime, environmental destruction and so on. The
encouraging news is that Goa seems to be enforcing planning controls more
rigorously than elsewhere in India, with the prime aim of protecting the
beaches.
This has to be noted, as well as applauded, by the tourist. For example,
when leafing through the travel trade's brochures you need to know that for
some years hoteliers have been required to build several hundred metres
behind the sea-line. This splendid rule means that many of Goa's hotels are
set back from, and out of sight of, the ocean, which is not always clear
from the travel agents' purple prose. Watch out for those give-away phrases
like only five minutes' walk from the sand.
My recommendation is that you consider splashing out on one of the older
(and more expensive) hotels which does have a seashore position, while
consoling yourself with the thought that airfares have become ridiculously
cheap.
For instance, any good travel agent or bucket-shop will get you on to a
charter flight direct to Goa, saving the hassle of transitting through
Bombay or Delhi and the subsequent scrimmage on Indian Airlines. You then
throw away any vouchers for a guest-house on a coconut plantation and set
off at once to a room at - say - the Fort Aguada.
I promise that the Fort Aguada Beach Resort, owned by the Taj Group, is very
good indeed, and I judged it by the highest international standards. It
stands above the sea at one end of the wonderful sweep of Calangute Beach.
After it was built, in 1974, it was unfairly described by the distinguished
British architecture critic, J M Richards, as 'a sadly insensitive group of
buildings in Hollywood-Oriental style.' Today the complex has weathered well
and takes an unobtrusive place in dense tropical foliage against the
headland.
Perhaps in response to Richards' abuse, the Taj management has now built,
next door and sharing facilities, a Taj Village in a strictly Goan style of
low-level cottages surrounded by coconut palms.
Thirdly, and thanks to the Indian government's hosting of the Commonwealth
conference in 1983, there is also The Hermitage, an estate of self-contained
luxury villas up on the hill, very much intended for the FT reader who wants
to escape the crowd and can afford to. You need to book in advance for Lady
Thatcher's bedroom. By Indian standards, the Fort Aguada complex is
expensive. But it works, and it may be worth it.
After acclimatising in Goa, the first-time India-hand will be ready to
venture out into the real world. The best course is to take one of the
regular and long-established itineraries on offer. These are: the
Delhi/Agra/Jaipur triangle; the Rajasthan palaces; the north (Nepal, etc,
and, these days, Ladakh); the Hindu south.
The choice will be influenced by season as well as by local political
factors. For example, Kashmir is a no-go area at present; similarly, there
are problems with some of the Himalayan venues, and a specialist travel
agent will have to advise. The climate is an obvious decider: you won't want
to go to Goa, even, between May and September, while the north is less
attractive after, say, October. None of these things is rigid: the monsoon
does not arrive on the dot.
One good possibility, to mention just one example, would be to venture out
from Goa on the sort of south Indian tour which is available from various
companies. (Private travel is probably best attempted by second-timers or
the young).
The frequent starting point is Madras, on the east coast, which leads
inevitably to the major temples at Madurai (where there is a newly-converted
and delightful Raj-style Taj Group hotel on a hill outside that seething
Hindu town). You then set out over the mountains of pepper and coffee and
tea plantations, via the lakeside game reserve of Periyar (where you might
see elephant), to finish up, weary and triumphant after a bone-shattering
drive from coast to coast, at Cochin.
Thereafter it is either back to Goa or Bombay, or down to Sri Lanka for a
few days, where the tourist industry has been hard-hit by troubles in the
north-east. First-timers need to remember:
that Hindu culture is complex and bewildering (the current exhibition at the
British Museum is a helpful introduction);
that distances are very large and the roads bad. You must be prepared to
travel for many hours between one experience and the next;
that the price of abdominal health is eternal vigilance - and no ice - plus
a bit of luck;
that you must apply for your visa in plenty of time;
that you should take malaria pills and have a tetanus jab;
that the Indian hotel and tourist industry (on these main routes) is highly
experienced and that its standards have improved greatly in recent years;
that, love it or hate it, India - as they always and truthfully say - is
unforgettable.
J M Richards wrote one of the best books on Goa. Although dating from 1982,
it has been reprinted in India (Vikar Publishing House) and can be tracked
down with profit.
J D F Jones travelled for a part of his recent trip with Bales Tours (tel:
0306-885991), one of a number of UK travel companies that specialises in the
sub-continent.
Fort Aguada Beach Resort, London tel: 071-828-5909, or through any agency of
the Taj Hotels group. Typical low-season rates from now until June 12 would
be Dollars 70 plus 35 per cent tax per day for a double room; Dollars 60 per
day plus 35 per cent in the Taj Holiday Village; and Dollars 170 per day
plus 35 per cent in an Aguada Hermitage villa.
