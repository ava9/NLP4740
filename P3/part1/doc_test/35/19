<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Trump may be having a cash crisis, but the high-profile developer has 
nothing but bravura when it comes to talking about his finances. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., is facing a proposed 
reorganization since he missed a $47.3-million interest payment on $675-million 
worth of high-yield junk bonds used to finance the gaming house. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders had threatened to push Trump into bankruptcy proceedings and 
seize control of the casino before a compromise was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, none of this seems to trouble Trump. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark my words," he said in an interview published in Thursday's Wall Street 
Journal. "In 12 months," he said, "I will be worth more than I was two years 
ago."
