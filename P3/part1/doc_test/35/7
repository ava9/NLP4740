aces - Two years ago it looked as if he was down and out. Now Donald Trump
is planning a comeback

Donald Trump is in his headquarters office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower,
a glittering high-rise on New York's Fifth Avenue. Seated on the far side of
one of America's larger executive desks, he has agreed to talk about the the
rise and fall, and rise again, of Donald J. Trump. But time is money, and
his attention span is notoriously short.
Quickly, then, the story so far. Two years ago it looked as though Mr Trump
 -or The Donald, as people call him - might no longer have his desk, his
office, his tower, or any of the rest of the property and casino empire he
built up during the 1980s. Brought to the edge of bankruptcy by a
combination of debt and collapsing asset values, he seemed destined to go
the same way as the Reichmann brothers, Robert Campeau, and other
over-extended victims of the decade of excess.
And yet, he has survived. Helped by the cashflows from his casinos, he has
reorganised or paid off a large part of his debts. His private yacht may
have gone; so has the Trump Shuttle airline (now part of USAir), and a 49
per cent stake in the Plaza Hotel in New York. But the rest of the empire -
the Trump Tower, Trump Parc, Trump Palace and Trump Plaza high-rises in New
York, and the Trump Plaza, Trump's Castle and Trump Taj Mahal casinos in
Atlantic City - is remarkably intact.
Now, at 47, The Donald is making his comeback. Last month he married Marla
Maples, the 30-year-old actress who eight weeks earlier had given birth to
their daughter, Tiffany. Admittedly, the bride's Dollars 2m tiara was
borrowed from a New York jeweller, but the wedding put the Trump name back
in the headlines across the world.
Next, Mr Trump plans to return to the headlines with his business deals. In
a few weeks' time, he hopes to pay off the rest of his personal debt by
floating his Atlantic City casinos on the stock market. He says he is
looking at five or six possible locations for new casinos, or riverboat
casinos, outside Atlantic City. And in New York, he aims to press ahead with
his long-dormant Dollars 3bn project to develop the 75-acre Penn Central
railway yards in Manhattan.
Mr Trump acknowledges that he was in deep trouble at the turn of the decade.
'But it happened to everybody, virtually. The real estate markets were
collapsing throughout the world.' His personal low, he says, came at the
beginning of 1991, when his financial difficulties coincided with the bitter
divorce proceedings that ended his marriage with Ivana Zelnicek.
He also acknowledges that he sacrificed some assets to get himself out of
trouble - but only, he says, unimportant ones. 'A yacht is an easy thing. I
sold the yacht because I never got to use it because I was too busy. I sold
some of the toys, but the big toy, the great toy, is Mar-a-Lago (his
palatial estate in Palm Beach, Florida). I never sold that.'
Times were hard. 'I had a couple of bad years,' says Mr Trump. And the
mauling the media gave him led him to sympathise with others who suffer the
same fate. 'One of the people that I think has gotten a really bad rap -
somebody I know just little bit because he was at my home, Mar-a-Lago - is
Prince Charles, from your country. I think he's a wonderful guy. He's taken
a lot of heat. I think he could get a little better press.'
But on the issue that really matters - the state of the Trump Organisation -
his recurring theme is that the business is stronger than ever. 'The Taj
Mahal (one of the three Atlantic City casinos) has just set an all-time
record - it made a profit of Dollars 135m last year. No casino in history
has ever made that much money.'
While it is true that the casinos are doing well, it is less easy to
determine what The Trump Organisation is worth. In 1992, Business Week, the
US business magazine, calculated that Mr Trump's liabilities exceeded his
assets by Dollars 1.4bn. Mr Trump disputed the figure at the time, and in
any case it is long out of date: but not even The Donald will attempt to put
a value on his business. 'It's a very substantial number,' he says. 'But I
really can't tell you exactly because it's very hard to value what the Taj
Mahal's worth, or what the Trump Plaza's worth, or what the land's worth.'
In one sense, it doesn't much matter: investing in The Trump Organisation
was always an act of faith, and is likely to stay that way. That is how The
Donald says it should be. 'If a person owning bonds in the Taj Mahal didn't
sell their bonds, those bonds would be golden: that investment would be
gold. If they sold them, I can't help them because they weren't loyal. But
the people who were confident in me all came out ahead.'
The hard times taught him a lot about loyalty, he says. Some people he
hadn't much liked turned out to be good friends, and others he trusted let
him down. 'There are a couple of people I trusted who, I'm glad that I
learned, weren't particularly loyal. And now they're coming back to me,
kissing my ass and wanting to get back on the gravy train, and they haven't
got a shot.'
But what drives The Donald to do what he does? A lust for power, or wealth,
or beautiful women? Is it sheer egomania that makes him want to acquire more
and bigger buildings, and put his name on them? Or some displaced desire for
immortality?
'I hate to sound like an overly negative person, but people ask me why I go
forward, and I say it's because I have nothing else to do. Because it's
true. What else am I going to do? Watch television? Read a book? I read
books anyway, but I mean, what else am I going to do? We're here, we're put
on this earth for an average of 72.3 years, and after we've gone, who the
hell knows what happens? And in the meantime, I just like the game.'
The Donald is getting fidgety. Clearly, his attention span has reached its
limit. At some unseen sign, people have started wandering in through the
open door to his office, ready to start the next meeting.
'Come in, Henry,' says The Donald. 'Sit down Henry, just sit down. I'm just
finishing up an interview with the Financial Times. It's going to be a very
negative story, based on the questions. But you know what? Who gives a shit.
I don't even care. One of the things I've learned is that I just don't
care.'
