THE referendum has been an ambiguous and sometimes dangerous weapon for
French presidents throughout the 34 years of the fifth republic.
Few of them have been able to resist the temptation to appeal directly to
the people, for a mixture of reasons: to enforce their own legitimacy,
confound their political enemies or simply to get a firm decision on an
important national issue.
Yesterday's poll was the seventh referendum during the current French
constitution and the second called by Mr Franc'ois Mitterrand. Technically,
it was the least necessary of all of them.
Mr Mitterrand would have been constitutionally entitled to leave it to
parliament to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. Indeed, parliament did ratify
the treaty last June.
Several of the president's government ministers were horrified when he said
he would seek a popular vote. They knew it could backfire and turn into a
vote against the declining popularity of Mr Mitterrand and his party, rather
than a rational decision on Europe. Mr Mitterrand's argument was that French
ratification would be worthless without a public debate.
Previous referendums have made the risks of direct democracy in France only
too clear. Low turnouts have produced distorted results and it has sometimes
proved difficult for the electorate to separate the question from the
questioner.
General de Gaulle is the classic example. He was master of the art, calling
no fewer than five referendums. Most were on issues which already commanded
public support and so appeared a safe way of bolstering his personal
legitimacy. On each occasion, Gen de Gaulle warned the electorate that he
would resign if there was a No vote, in contrast to Mr Mitterrand, who has
kept his options open and begged voters not to use the referendum as a
presidential plebiscite.
In the end, Gen de Gaulle fell into his own trap and resigned after a 1969
vote on decentralisation and reform of the senate, the upper house of
parliament.
Mr Mitterrand has tried to avoid the same fate by asking the electorate to
wait until elections next March to vote on the Socialists' record.
Gen de Gaulle claimed that the referendum was the cleanest and most honest
democratic practice possible, pointing to the 1789 declaration on the rights
of man, which speaks of citizens' rights to take a personal part in the
formation of laws. His critics argued that he used referendums partly to go
over the head of parliament, an institution he never really respected.
Since 1969, French presidents have been more or less keen to use
referendums. Mr Georges Pompidou called a referendum only once, in 1972, to
ratify the entry into the European Community of Britain, Ireland, Denmark
and Norway. (Oslo later withdrew its application, as the result of another
referendum which backfired famously.)
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing steered clear of referendums altogether during
his presidency from 1974 to 1981. It was Mr Mitterrand who reintroduced the
practice, with a poll in 1988 on a new statute for New Caledonia, a French
overseas territory. Not surprisingly, this obscure question produced a bored
response, with a turnout of barely 37 per cent.
Perhaps it was a sign that the French electorate had started to lose the old
feeling that every referendum was a vote for or against the president.
Even so, polls taken during the Maastricht campaign indicate that last
night's result will have been the outcome of a complex mixture of French
feeling about Maastricht, about Europe generally and about Mr Mitterrand
personally.
