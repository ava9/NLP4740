Pensions

Women will have to wait until 65 - the same as men - to receive state
pension benefits by the year 2020, Mr Kenneth Clarke said yesterday.
Equalisation will be phased in over a 10-year period, beginning in 2010, and
no woman aged 44 or over now will be affected by the measure. When the
change is complete, it is expected to save the government Pounds 5bn a year
in social security payments.
The Department of Social Security, which has been considering ways of
equalising men's and women's pension ages for nearly two years, is said to
have strongly favoured the move and argued that given fiscal constraints, no
alternative was possible. However, the government has been loathe to adopt a
policy likely to further alienate older voters.
The pensions industry yesterday generally welcomed the chancellor's
long-awaited announcement, saying that its indecision up until now had
actually made scheme administration more difficult.
'We welcome the fact that the government has finally made a decision,' said
Mr David Morgan, head of parliamentary affairs for the National Association
of Pension Funds, the pension industry trade association.
The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's largest employers' body,
which had earlier criticised government delay on the matter, said: 'We
welcome the long-awaited announcement that the government has decided on
equalising pensions at age 65.'
A landmark ruling from the European Court of Justice in May 1990 required
employers to offer equal pension benefits to men and women. Because
occupational pension benefits are integrated with state benefits through
Guaranteed Minimum Pensions, employers have been unable to equalise private
pension benefits. They fear that failure to equalise benefits completely
could leave them open to substantial claims from former male employees
claiming preferential treatment for women.
The pensions industry now expects Social Security Secretary Mr Peter Lilley
to announce today plans to equalise retirement ages for men and women
receiving GMP and its counterpart, the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme. Also, it is considered likely that he will announce a review of the
financing of both those programmes.
Because so much money can be saved by raising women's pension ages five
years, the pensions industry had little hope that its preferred option - a
flexible pension age for both men and women over 60 - would be adopted.
Nevertheless, some in the industry expressed disappointment.
