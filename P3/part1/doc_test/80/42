  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- New China has brought 
about historic liberation for Chinese women, says the white 
paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women" which is 
published by the Information Office of the State Council here 
today. 
  The white paper says New China effected fundamental 
emancipation for women in all aspects of political, economic, 
cultural, social and family life. This represented a 
significant transformation in the history of contemporary social 
development that China can be proud of and an important 
contribution made by the Chinese revolution to the worldwide 
movement for women's liberation, points out the white paper. 
  In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, women were for a 
long time kept at the bottom of society, notes the white paper. 
It was not until the first half of this century that the 
Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to wage a 
profound national democratic revolution and launched a 
large-scale women's emancipation movement which resulted in the 
historic liberation of Chinese women. 
  The white paper says the impact of the several millennia of 
oppression and devastation imposed by the feudal patriarchal 
system on Chinese women was exceptionally grave. In political, 
economic, cultural, social and family life, women were 
considered inferior to men. They possessed no political rights 
and were completely excluded from social and political life. 
They were economically dependent and were robbed of property 
and inheritance rights and possessed no independent source of 
income. They had no personal dignity or independent status, and 
were deprived of the right to receive an education and take part 
in social activities, according to the white paper. 
  Ever since its birth, says the white paper, the Chinese 
Communist Party has made the achievement of female emancipation 
and equality between men and women one of its goals. 
  For the women of China, the founding of the People's 
Republic 
of China ended the thousands of years of feudal oppression and 
enslavement and the history of being trampled and bullied by 
foreign aggressors, stresses the white paper. With an entirely 
new face, they have stood up and become the masters of New China 
like all citizens of the country, the white paper says. 
  In 1949, the common program, adopted by the First Plenary 
Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference which had the nature of a provisional constitution, 
solemnly declared the toppling of the feudal system which 
fettered women and stated that women enjoyed equal rights with 
men in the political, economic, cultural and educational fields 
and in other aspects of social life. Thus a new era in the 
emancipation of Chinese women was ushered in, the white paper 
points out. 
  The Electoral Law of the People's Republic of China 
promulgated in 1953 also clearly stipulated that women enjoy the 
same rights to vote and stand for election as men. 
  Along with the economic rehabilitation and development, 
there 
appeared a nationwide upsurge of women stepping out of their 
homes to take part in social production. This thoroughly 
transformed the situation in which women were excluded from 
social productive labor, providing them with an independent 
source of income, says the white paper. 
  According to the white paper, in old China, as many as 90 
percent of women were illiterate. In order to raise the 
cultural level of the entire nation, New China launched a 
planned campaign to gradually wipe out illiteracy. Millions of 
women attended the campaign. 
  The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, 
promulgated in 1950, was the first statute enacted by New China. 
It declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system 
characterized by arranged and forced marriage, male superiority 
and female inferiority, and disregard for the interests of 
children. 
  Implementation of the new system was marked by freedom for 
both men and women in marriage, monogamy, sexual equality and 
protection of the legitimate rights of women and children. This 
signified a profound revolution in the patterns of wedded and 
family life that had prevailed for several thousand years in 
Chinese society, states the white paper.
