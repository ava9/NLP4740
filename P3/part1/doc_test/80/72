Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein formally kicked off her campaign 
for governor Monday by advocating a costly package of educational, health, 
housing and public assistance programs she said would be financed by user fees 
and by adjusting spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not proposing an increase in the state income tax. . . . I have no plans 
to raise the sales tax for any of these programs," she told reporters at a 
series of news conferences announcing her candidacy for the Democratic 
nomination for governor in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would also ask the Legislature for "a complete re-evaluation of 
the mandates" that currently control most state spending. But when asked about 
welfare cost-of-living increases, one of the biggest and most frequently 
challenged mandates, Feinstein said only that they "are a difficult issue." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that as governor she would seek a constitutional amendment to 
allow local schools to pass bonds by a simple majority, rather than the current 
two-thirds vote, to help finance what is potentially the most expensive of her 
priorities: the reduction of classroom sizes in California schools. 
</P>
<P>
Her platform also includes new programs to curb domestic violence, train 
welfare mothers and reduce infant mortality, and the creation of a new state 
growth management commission, a new department of ocean resources, a state 
office of children and family and a new post of drug czar. 
</P>
<P>
On environmental issues, Feinstein said, "I will just say no to offshore oil 
drilling." 
</P>
<P>
She also repeated her proposal to create a new "California jump start program 
to provide early childhood education for every 4-year-old who wants it," which 
she said would cost $750 million to $800 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Feinstein outlined new programs totaling several billion dollars 
annually in new spending, but she declined to list specific revenue sources 
except to "take a good look at the lottery and how that money is distributed" 
to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"You all want me to say, 'Yes, I'm going to raise taxes.' What I'm saying is, I 
am going to try to prioritize a government to be able to get the most bang for 
the buck within my priorities. That means some things that exist may have to 
go," she said, declining further questions on how she would pay for her 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she supports Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal on the June 5 
ballot to double the state's gasoline tax from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon 
"because it's a user fee and those are the best" way to finance government 
because voters can see the link between their money and the programs they 
support. 
</P>
<P>
As the first woman to be a major candidate for governor of California, 
Feinstein put special emphasis on the support of women voters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big moment for me, and a historic one for women," she said. "Much 
thought and deliberation preceded this decision. I am a non-incumbent in a race 
against two entrenched statewide figures -- a woman in a field of men." 
</P>
<P>
She also made a strong pitch for support from women voters on the abortion 
issue. Although her two rivals for governor, Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
and Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp are both pro-choice, she said 
that as a woman she is best qualified to protect the right to choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true men can protect women's rights. But it's also true the experiences 
of men and women are different experiences. I very strongly believe . . . with 
a woman who is governor, I know if she believes in choice, she's not going to 
have anything to do with any erosion of that basic optional right," Feinstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing Van de Kamp's qualifications, Feinstein said "there are judgmental 
questions that enter into it -- judgmental questions involving (his failure to 
prosecute) the Hillside Strangler, judgmental questions involving the savings 
and loans, judgmental questions involving the crime victims initiative" that 
Van de Kamp contends could undermine abortion rights.
