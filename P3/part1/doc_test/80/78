The League of Women Voters was very disappointed with the San Diego City 
Council's refusal to place the recommendations of the Charter Review Commission 
before the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
While individual council members may not agree with the commission's proposed 
Charter amendments, the City Council did "declare(s) that all recommendations 
made by the commission shall be placed directly on the ballot without further 
council directive." Shouldn't council members feel obligated to honor that 
promise made in 1988? Perhaps that promise was foolishly given, but it was 
given, and the council should accept the responsibility for that action. 
</P>
<P>
The voters should decide if the city's charter should be changed in accordance 
with the commission's recommendations. The voters decided they wanted district 
elections. Perhaps a majority of voters also believes the time is past due to 
expand the number of districts from eight to 10. Perhaps the voters will decide 
that the nonpartisan nature of electing the mayor and council members will be 
protected by creating a redistricting commission to redraw council districts. 
The League of Women Voters trusts the electorate. We would like to see the City 
Council exhibit trust in the voters also. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council did vote to reconsider the 13 recommendations later this 
summer. Time grows short to meet that commitment.
