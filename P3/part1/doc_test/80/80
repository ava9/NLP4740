Postovoy: "Not a Defendant Before the Voter"] 
  [Text] The Institute of Legislation and Comparative 
Jurisprudence discussed a scientific research plan, which 
defines the concept of development of Russia's legislation, and 
the new problems arising with the refinement of the status of a 
deputy of the Federal Assembly. 
  A very sharp debate was held during the discussion of the 
question concerning the status of a deputy. It brought to light 
the problematic nature of the previously existing imperative 
mandate of a deputy in connection with the adoption of the new 
Constitution. Whereas previously the content of the imperative 
mandate included such elements as the report of a deputy to 
voters, instructions from voters, and the recall of a deputy, 
the Constitution adopted at the referendum rejected all this. 
  Some scientists and deputies believe that the resolution of 
this task can be found in the adoption of laws regulating the 
activity of deputies, while others assume that it is impossible 
to do this, because it is a matter of questions, which are the 
subject of regulation of the Constitution alone. Very likely, 
any of these points of view has the right to existence. 
  The novelty of the suffrage lies in the fact that part of 
the 
deputies of the State Duma are elected in the all-federal 
district from parties and public associations. Who should give 
instructions to deputies and to whom should they report? Should 
all Russia be included in this process, or should such measures 
be implemented in individual territories? How should innovations 
be viewed from the standpoint of citizens' equal rights and 
political stability? The same concerns the problem of the recall 
of deputies elected from the all-federal district. 
  Thus, the imperative mandate affirmed by the laws of past 
years has disappeared together with the old structure of the 
legislative body. It was replaced by the free mandate, which 
denies the legal and other responsibility of a deputy to voters. 
In the opinion of Prof. V.I. Vasilyev, this means that a deputy 
is not bound by instructions from voters and acts in the 
parliament in accordance with his ideas of what is proper and 
his own conscience. 
  However, even with this the possibilities of a certain 
influence on deputies remain. It is easier to accomplish this 
task with regard to deputies elected on the basis of party 
lists. The party, being interested in enhancing its prestige, 
can exert an influence on its deputies through fractions in the 
parliament by making demands in accordance with party 
discipline. Furthermore, it can warn a deputy about not 
including him in the lists of candidates for the next elections. 
  Concerning contacts between deputies and voters it was 
stated 
unequivocally: We must have such a norm in the law. Its 
importance is due to the fact that deputies, communicating with 
voters, will know real life processes to a greater extent and 
will be able to take into account the entire spectrum of public 
opinion during the drafting and adoption of legislative acts. 
Moreover, this will make it possible to overcome the gap among 
various social strata and central authorities. 
  The question of deputies' control functions is no less 
problematic. The Constitution does not provide for such powers 
for deputies. Now they do not have the right to independently 
check enterprises, institutions, and organizations, as was the 
case earlier. Long-term experience has shown the uselessness of 
such an activity. 
  In connection with this the following question arises: Does 
the parliament itself have such a function? Yes, it follows from 
a number of articles of the Constitution. This is expressed in 
the following: 
  --in the right of the chambers to establish bodies for 
control over the fulfillment of the budget and a special 
commission for the preparation of a conclusion on the removal of 
the president from office; 
  --in the right of control over the implementation of 
personnel policy by the president. Both the Council of the 
Federation and the State Duma have levers of effect on personnel 
policy; 
  --in the right of control over the president's activity in 
the area of foreign policy through the adoption of the law on 
the ratification or denunciation of international treaties; 
  --in the right of the Council of the Federation to approve 
or 
not to approve the president's edicts on the imposition of 
martial law and a state of emergency. 
  The parliament's control functions could also find their 
expression in the form of systematic meetings by government 
members with parliament members. During questions and answers, 
which occur naturally in this process, it is always possible to 
isolate the basic tendencies in the government course and to 
give them the appropriate evaluation. 
  It is impossible not to touch upon the course of discussion 
of the question concerning citizens' responsibility for the 
violation of the rights of deputies and their family members. 
The final opinion was reduced to the fact that legal norms 
should be applied to an equal degree and in the same manner to 
all citizens when they commit wrongful acts against whomever it 
may be. They cannot be toughened or softened on the basis of the 
post or the position held. 
  Otherwise, elements of discrimination against citizens' 
rights will arise inevitably.
