  [Text] Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, will 
meet Heung Yee Kuk representatives tomorrow to discuss the New 
Territories inheritance row. 
  Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
will discuss how to introduce Basic Law provisions which 
stipulate protection of the rights and customs of indigenous 
residents in the New Territories, according to sources. His 
meeting will be seen as a gesture of support for the indigenous 
residents locked in a bitter row with the Government over a 
proposal by a legislator, Christine Loh, to give New Territories 
women inheritance rights. 
  It is understood that Lu will discuss internal matters of 
the 
Kuk, the Government's rural advisory body on New Territories' 
affairs. Lu, who last year told members of the Federation of 
Women he supported equal inheritance rights for indigenous 
women, has recently publicly condemned government plans to 
support Loh's amendment. 
  Lu has threatened the New Territories (Land) (Exemption) 
Bill 
would be scrapped in 1997. Yesterday, the vice-chairman of the 
Kuk, Daniel Lam, said he had not yet received confirmation of 
the meeting. Lam said it would be good for the Kuk to have the 
opportunity to meet Lu to put the views of indigenous people. 
  He said if they were to meet Lu, he would want to talk about 
the land exemption bill and the impact of the adoption of the 
United Nations' anti sex-discrimination convention, Cedaw, on 
the indigenous community. The Government is now finalising 
recommendations to the Executive Council on the extension of 
Cedaw to Hong Kong, which are set to affect discriminatory 
practices against New Territories women. A formal announcement 
is expected to be made this month. Women's rights campaigners 
will stage an anti- feudalism rally outside the Kuk offices 
today to protest against objections to grant rural women equal 
rights of inheritance. 
  The protest outside the Kuk headquarters in Kowloon Tong 
will 
be linked to the May 4 movement in China where tens of thousands 
of students marched in Beijing on May 4, 1919 to oppose 
oppressive feudal traditions. Lam said he welcomed the 
opportunity to exchange views with the women's groups and said 
the Kuk supported sexual equality, but said it should not be 
rolled into the inheritance debate.
