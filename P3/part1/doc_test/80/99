FT  19 SEP 92 / Fashion: Women who boldly tread beyond the sex barrier - A
woman in a man's suit? Ugh. But a woman in suiting cut to fit the female
form  ... well that's another matter, as Avril Groom discovers

THEY stride boldly through social history in their trousers, toppers and
boots. They are the great cross-dressers, women who have become famous for,
among other things, recognising the indisputable fashion paradox that
dressing like a man can make you more of a woman.
They are also the role-models for this autumn's definitive fashion image. As
lifestyle models they are more of a problem. Some go rather too far down the
path to androgyny, if the history of Vita Sackville-West is anything to go
by. But cross-dressing is absolutely no indication of sexual proclivity and,
as women such as Marlene Dietrich, Sarah Bernhardt and even Shakespeare's
Rosalind found, it adds a heady amount of feminine allure.
Donning male-inspired garb is, of course, nothing new. In the 15th century
Joan of Arc wore armour which, although her captors complained of her
masculine dress, appears to have been moulded to her female figure. And, in
essence, the rules have not changed since. A woman in a man's suit risks
looking unattractively butch. A woman in men's suiting, cut to follow and
flatter the feminine form, is another matter altogether.
The secret of success is the witty juxtaposition of items traditionally
considered either a male or female preserve. Wearing pinstripe pants with
lace-up brogues is far too literal; this is the first time for ages that
trousers with high heels have been stylistically correct - aficionados
choose a slightly chunky heel and a small platform.
Likewise, why wear a shirt and tie with your grey double-breasted jacket
when you could surprise the chaps with a lace-trimmed 'body'? Hair is
another area for attention, the bigger, softer or more carelessly piled-up
the better. But sport an Eton crop with pinstripes and your intentions could
be misinterpreted. Make-up, too, is a factor - remember Liza Minelli's dark
eyes peering from under her bowler in Cabaret. And cross-dressing need not
even include trousers. The most obvious way to feminise a mannish jacket is
with the new long skirt, provided it is cut sinuously tight across the hips
and lengthily split for ease of movement and for a glimpse of legs that,
after years of the short skirt, most women no longer feel they need to hide.
How these juxtapositions work psychologically is explained by fashion
historian Colin McDowell, whose new book Hats published next month (Pounds
24.95, Thames and Hudson) contains several examples of women highly
glamourised by wearing men's hats. 'Traditional men's dress, and especially
hats, are still symbols of authority and dignity in our society,' he says.
'Add that to the feminine glamour which is the basis of women's sex appeal
and you pack a very powerful punch. Men's styles are usually covered up
which, on a woman, is extremely sexy. Conversely, men in women's clothes
lose their authority and become figures of fun.'
It is tempting to ascribe serious sociological motives to 1992's rash of
cross-dressing. Perhaps women wish to celebrate their increasing power in
the professions by wresting the clothes from men's backs as well as the jobs
from their grasp. The truth, though, is more prosaic, just another turn in
the fashion cycle.
After several years of colourful near-vulgarity and clanking gilt
accessories, spawned by the conspicuously consuming Eighties, what could
look more perfectly new for the restrained Nineties than a plain, grey John
Major-style suit? Inevitably, this is the style which designers and stores
have most taken to heart. Apart from racy Marks and Spencer pinstripes, you
can find this look at every level, from Kookai's budget hairline stripe
polyester/viscose trouser suit at Pounds 108.99 and Alexon's birdseye check
wool at Pounds 198.95, to Jaeger's sleekly-cut grey wool twill suit at
Pounds 378 and Ralph Lauren's feminine, wide-trousered style at Pounds 960.
But there are many other ways to play the man's lady. Designers have let
their fantasies run riot on male stereotypes from the country squire to the
motorcycle courier. Take your pick but bear in mind that the final effect
should always be that of a strictly female male. And if anyone tells you to
walk like a man, ignore them.
