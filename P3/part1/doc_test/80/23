Dear Ms. Klein: 
</P>
<P>
Freaks? Weirdos? Really, Ms. Klein, cyclists are humans, too. By the way, tell 
your husband that I highly recommend the 'Lady Remington.' It provides a close 
shave without any unnecessary bloodshed. 
</P>

Dear Mr. Benner: 
</P>
<P>
 How long have you been in Orange County, Mike? Here, no one bats an eye at 
freaks and weirdos passing themselves off as humans. The human angle, in fact, 
seems to play big with the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you think I was a bit hasty in describing my husband and his fellow 
bicycling enthusiasts in the same vein. I can understand that. It would bother 
me, too. Still, my husband seems to delight in being different. How else to 
describe this shaved-legs ritual? 
</P>
<P>
 But, heck, Mike, to give you an idea of how open-minded I am about alternative 
lifestyles, I want you to know I passed on your Lady Remington suggestion to my 
husband. He even bought one. Right about now, Mike, I'm thinking unnecessary 
bloodshed might not be such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mrs. Klein: 
</P>
<P>
I have been enjoying your comments very much. Yesterday, you got over into my 
territory. You realize that each of those cows you wrote about has four 
stomachs? Never in my 92 years have I found a magnet in any of them. Nails, 
yes. Barbed wire and magnets, no. Autopsies on bovines expiring from hardware 
disease have revealed nails, baling wire and other miscellany, but no magnets. 
The foreign objects always punctured the stomach well before making it through 
the maze of stomachs into the intestine. 
</P>
<P>
Why is barbed wire like a bikini? It protects the property without obstructing 
the view. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Dear Mr. Justus: 
</P>
<P>
 Lord knows I wouldn't presume to argue with your 92 years or the cows in your 
territory. (I, for example, have never been present at a bovine autopsy, 
although it's been on my 'Things to Do' list for years.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, with all due respect, let me point out that if you had found a magnet 
in your cows' stomachs, you might have found any 'nails, baling wire and other 
miscellany' all in one place. You see, farmers these days actually encourage 
their cows to swallow magnets and even go as far as to purchase magnets for 
their cows' enjoyment. The metal particles cling to the magnets, thereby 
greatly reducing the heartbreak of hardware disease. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose one regrettable side effect of this technology would be a reduction 
in the number of bovine autopsies that one gets to attend. But as I'm sure you 
are aware, life is full of such trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know, for example, that barbed wire may soon be replaced by invisible 
electronic fences that encourage animals not to wander by giving them a mild 
jolt? Just think what that could do to your bikini line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dearest Dianne: 
</P>
<P>
Once again, I am caught reading an article of yours that is as poor as your 
knowledge of the subject/subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Your June 20 article makes reference to the totally unfounded and ludicrous 
suggestion that charities in Orange County are hard-pressed due to the 'never 
too loose with our change' mentality. You better get your facts in line to 
support that allegation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, Dianne, we can't give to everything. It's that simple. I ask you -- have 
you honestly given to each and every charity that has ever approached you on 
the street, at your door, in your place of employment, etc., etc., etc.? If 
not, than you have absolutely no right to print such a ridiculous suggestion. 
Why should YOU bite the hand that feeds so many needy organizations around this 
county? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Adams,

<P>
Dearest Mary Ellen, 
</P>
<P>
So nice to hear from you again. But you have me a little concerned. It's not 
like you to admit to being 'caught reading an article' of mine. Since you have 
been that honest with me, however, I'll repay your kindness. Here are some 
statistics that you may find enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has one of the lowest rates of charitable-giving per capita, 
about 40% less than the rest of the nation. This is according to George 
Phillips, the United Way's vice president of community issues. According to 
other studies -- including the 1989 Orange County Annual Survey -- only about 
30% of county residents make any charitable contributions, while the rate 
nationwide is over 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Mary Ellen, you are right. We can't give to everything. I can't. But 
maybe you're different. You certainly do seem to have a lot to share. With me, 
at least. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dear Dianne: 
</P>
<P>
I can't express completely the gratitude I felt when you called yourself a 
feminist in your May 16 column. It's time that women who espouse feminist 
values begin to come out of the closet and use the 'F' word when describing 
themselves. I believe the same mind set which made "liberal" a dirty word is 
also at work with the word 'feminism.' 
</P>
<P>
Go down the line with all the issues which have come to light because of 
hard-working feminists: from obtaining female suffrage to working for equal pay 
and access to higher education and better jobs. Only the most confirmed 
patriarchs will deny these changes have worked for the good of all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I wish I didn't have to say I'm 'grateful' for your admission. Perhaps if more 
women and men would stand up and be counted, feminism would cease to be a 
stigma and instead become a badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>

Dear Valerie, 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your letter. This ought to make you feel even better. I AM A 
FEMINIST! Not that anyone who reads this column regularly ever had any doubts. 
I'm not much for hiding in closets.
