  [Text] United Nations, March 8 (XINHUA) -- By the year 2000 
the world should remove all sex-related differences in adult 
literacy, eliminate sex-biased presentations in text books, and 
eradicate legal illiteracy, a Chinese delegate to the 38th 
session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, said 
today. 
  Wang Shuxian, the Chinese delegate, said particular 
attention 
should be given to the situation of women in rural areas around 
the world. 
  "The U.N. platform for action should show special concern 
for 
them, because they are the most numerous, have bad living and 
medical conditions, low social status and heavy household 
burdens," she said. 
  Wang referred to the fact that there are now 650 million 
rural women living in poverty, which almost doubles the figure 
of 20 years ago. She warned that more women living in rural 
areas would join this group if effective measures are not taken 
soon. 
  She also said that young women should also be given special 
consideration. "They will shoulder the historic responsibility 
of achieving equality between men and women by the 21st 
century," she added. 
  "It is our view that the essence of women's human rights 
lies 
in the right to equality and the removal of discrimination, 
which characterizes the human rights of men," Wang said. 
  The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women is having a 
two-week session which began on March 7. 
  Most participants are discussing recommendations for a 
platform for action to be drafted by the U.N. Secretariat. 
  The platform is expected to be the major outcome of the 
fourth world women's conference to be held next year in Beijing.
