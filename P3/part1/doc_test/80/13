election district is located, data pursuant to Paragraph 
37/A.2., pertaining to persons not entitled to vote, for 
purposes of compiling the register of voters, as follows: 
  a. courts having jurisdiction, or municipal clerks or

authority, regarding the placement of persons under guardianship 
that restricts or rules out their ability to act, or the 
termination of such guardianship; 
  b. the organ maintaining records of criminal offenders, 
regarding persons banned from participating in public affairs 
based on an affirmed judgment of a court; 
  c. penal institutions having jurisdiction, regarding 
persons serving prison sentences, or under compulsory medical 
treatment based on affirmed judgments of courts in criminal

  ``37/A.2. The data to be provided in reports filed pursuant 
to Paragraph 37/A.1. shall be as follows: 
  a. family name and first name, (for women, their maiden
