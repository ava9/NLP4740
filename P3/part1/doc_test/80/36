ONE in four voters in today's Irish referendum on the Maastricht treaty is
still undecided, according to a public opinion poll published yesterday.
The poll, published in the Irish Times, showed that although declared 'yes'
voters outnumber 'no' voters by 49 per cent to 28 per cent, more than half
of those polled believe the government has handled its pro-Maastricht
campaign badly.
Even Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said only that he was
'cautiously encouraged' by the results of the poll.
Campaign managers for the 'yes' vote yesterday complained that some priests
are campaigning against the treaty, in spite of a decision by Catholic
bishops to keep the Church neutral.
The decision by 2.5m Irish voters will not be available until Ireland's
principal returning officer makes a declaration around noon tomorrow.
The result will have a profound impact on the future economic and political
course of the European Community. If the Irish follow the Danes and vote
'no', there seems little doubt that the treaty, which establishes the legal
framework for the creation of a common currency and common citizenship for
some 340m people, will have to be scrapped. If they vote 'yes', there are
hopes that the remaining 10 EC states will ratify the treaty.
As in Denmark, the opinion polls showed a significantly greater proportion
of women than men were undecided. And considerably fewer women (44 per cent)
than men (55 per cent) said they would vote 'yes'.
Both feminists and anti-abortion groups have been campaigning actively for a
'no' vote and should the treaty be defeated in spite of the poll
predictions, women's votes will clearly have been an important factor.
A large sector of the 'no' camp has run a clever campaign, championing
liberal causes such as the environment, neutrality, job promotion and
women's rights. It has argued that ratification of Maastricht will have
adverse effects in all these areas.
In addition many of those who voted positively in previous referendums on
European issues, such as the one in 1987 which approved the Single European
Act, may find themselves divided between an economic decision on the one
hand, and a moral one on the other due to the complication of the abortion
issue.
The overall weakness of the 'yes' campaign, in contrast to the vitality of
its opponents, together with the continuing large number of floating voters
have thus created considerable uncertainty over the outcome.
Mr Michael Gallagher, a political science lecturer at Trinity College in
Dublin, said: 'I have no doubt the polls have been done as accurately and as
professionally as in the past, but no one is too confident in them now since
the recent experiences of Denmark and the UK (election).'
