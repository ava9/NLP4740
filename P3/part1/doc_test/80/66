JOSEPH N. BELL: MEN, WOMEN: CELEBRATE DIFFERENCES

Our favorite shrink dropped by the other Friday afternoon for an 
end-of-the-workweek drink. It was warm enough to sit in our back yard, and the 
talk was as good as the weather. It was mostly about men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was on my mind for several reasons. Two newspaper stories that day 
had caught my attention. One had to do with the deep soup that Executive Editor 
Max Frankel of the New York Times found himself in when he told a symposium on 
"Women and the Media" at the Columbia School of Journalism that it is now 
easier for him to fire women than blacks because there are more women in the 
newsroom these days. 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the politics of the workplace, explaining that "when a 
woman screws up, it is no longer a political act for me to fire her . . . but 
(the newspaper's blacks) are still precious, still hothouse in management." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing predictable brouhaha in which he was scalded by several black 
female reporters and reminded that the New York Times ranks last among major 
newspapers in female bylines, he compounded the felony by adding: "If you are 
covering local teas, you've got more women than if you're the Wall Street 
Journal." 
</P>
<P>
The same day, the subsequently defeated Democratic candidate for governor of 
Massachusetts, John Silber, noted that day care has resulted in a "generation 
of abused children by women who have thought that a third-rate day care center 
was just as good as a first-rate home." Whereupon the head honcho of the 
National Organization for Women allowed as how Silber was the greatest threat 
to local women since the Boston Strangler. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm not about to get into the same deep soup by defending either one of 
these outrageous -- and reasonably stupid -- assertions (although Frankel's 
original comment was probably a simple statement of fact) except to suggest the 
possibility that both of them might have been made with tongue slightly in 
cheek. I wasn't there so I don't know -- but I do know that tongue-in-cheek is 
a posture that gets no points from the more ardent feminists. Humor is not 
their long suit -- especially bad humor, which is regarded as a poor disguise 
for macho sentiments, and probably is. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so men are paying the price for fostering many years of male-female 
inequality in the workplace by having to tread lightly with women in certain 
ways in which men deal with each other routinely. And I think one reason men 
are having difficulty with this is that some feminists seem to want to equalize 
the sexes rather than equalize treatment of the sexes. And that's an enormous 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women are happily, joyfully, delightfully and fundamentally very 
different -- and I'm not talking about the physical differences. They're 
individually different too, of course, but that's another matter. Right now 
I'll stick to the generalizations. 
</P>
<P>
Our psychiatrist friend said that if 10 men and 10 women -- all strangers -- 
were put into a room together, within a few moments the women would be split 
into small groups talking animatedly to one another, while the men would be 
reading or watching television. Within an hour, the women would know a great 
deal about each other while the men would probably still be strangers. 
</P>
<P>
He told an illuminating story about a man who was being pressed to remarry 
several years after a long, failed marriage. The man was resisting and was 
finally asked if he preferred to be alone. He said, no, that wasn't the case at 
all, that he had nothing per se against marriage, then added plaintively: "I 
don't want to be alone. I just want to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
This distinction eludes a lot of women who tend to be naturally gregarious and 
are therefore baffled and frequently irritated by men who aren't. 
</P>
<P>
My wife has an absolutely uncanny facility for bursting into my sanctum during 
the final 30 seconds of a close football game or the bottom of the ninth inning 
of a crucial baseball game I'm watching on TV. She will plant her feet and 
announce firmly: "There are some things we need to talk over." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves me three options. I can turn off the game, which is not acceptable. 
I can pretend to listen to her while covertly watching the game, which usually 
results in delivering some obviously wrong answers and irritates the hell out 
of her. Or I can explain that the game is almost over, that this moment is 
crucial, and can we delay the conversation briefly. 
</P>
<P>
At which point, she says, "I know how long it takes to play the last 30 seconds 
of a football game" -- a sage observation based on experience -- and stalks out 
of the room to resolve the crisis unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably that crisis might involve an impending divorce or the dog being 
eaten by our neighborhood opossum or a just-launched nuclear attack, but the 
odds of that are long, and I think I would detect such an imperative note in 
her voice. She is much more likely to be referring to a conflict in social 
engagements three weeks hence or who is going to pick up my stepson at one of 
his myriad extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Under similar circumstances, a man would never behave in this way. He would 
recognize and respect the other person's involvement and withdraw quietly 
unless something cataclysmic was at hand. Which, I suppose, goes back to that 
roomful of 20 people and the disparate behavior of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches become cliches because in the beginning they have a core of truth. 
That's why most of the cliches about the emotional and temperamental 
differences between men and women -- with which our shrink friend generally 
agreed -- are more or less true. 
</P>
<P>
Women tend to be more open, impulsive, honest with their feelings, ready and 
able to talk rather than duke out problems. Men are more reserved, deliberate 
in judgment, internal and -- when pushed too hard -- willing to get physical. 
All of which, it seems to me, adds up to the fact that, in general, women are 
better suited to certain types of activities than men -- and vice versa. Which 
is no big deal, something to celebrate rather than deplore. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we seem to be forever trying to fuzz those differences. A recent Oprah 
Winfrey show devoted itself to the mysteries of male involvement in spectator 
sports. One of the women panelists offered a solution. Why not, she said, get 
involved with your man's sports mania? "If you just learn a little bit at a 
time, a passion will follow. Men aren't born with this genetic blueprint. . . . 
They learned it, just like we can." 
</P>
<P>
I think she's wrong on every count. A great many men probably were born with 
this genetic blueprint, and I don't think the most dedicated devotion to 
learning it on the part of women will ever produce passion. And passion is 
essential. Besides that, I can't think of anything worse than watching football 
on TV with a wife who is determined to share this experience with me. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just celebrate the differences.
