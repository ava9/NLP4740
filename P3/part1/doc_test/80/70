FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Equal pay for women
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A bold move for the Equal Opportunities Commission to take the British
government to the European authorities over Britain's alleged failure to
implement an effective equal pay law.
If it wins, the commission, whose members are appointed by the government,
will have scored a decisive victory for its long campaign against what it
sees as half-hearted mechanisms for enforcing the principle of equal pay for
work of equal value, regardless of gender. If it loses, the commission will
suffer a serious, perhaps terminal, loss of influence. There has been talk
in recent years about rationalising the equal opportunities agencies,
possibly bringing together the EOC and the Commission for Racial Equality.
The commission's case is that in spite of the fact that the principle of
equal pay for equal work is enshrined both in the Treaty of Rome and
Britain's Equal Pay Act, it is not working well. Proceedings under the act,
dealt with by industrial tribunals, are complex and lengthy - taking an
average of two and a half years. As a result, there have been only 23
successful claims in almost 10 years. Since 1990, the commission has urged
amendments to the Equal Pay Act without success. The final straw appears to
have been the government's decision to ignore equal pay in its most recent
trade union bill, while abolishing wages councils, which provide, in effect,
a minimum wage in low-paid industries, such as catering, where many women
work.
It is certainly true that the forces driving the narrowing of pay
differentials between British men and women have waned in recent years. In
1970, when the Equal Pay Act was passed, the average hourly female wage was
60 per cent of the male. By 1975, when the act came into force, the ratio
was 75 per cent. Since then, the figure has only crept up to 80 per cent. It
is difficult to be sure how this compares with other EC countries, since
comparative figures are judged to be unreliable.
The other side of the coin, however, is that in the 1980s, women found it
easier than men to get jobs in all advanced economies. This is partly a
result of the shift from the manufacturing to the service sector, but also
in part because many women are prepared to accept part-time or more flexible
working arrangements in return for lower financial rewards. In Britain
during the 1980s, female employment grew at about 2 per cent a year, while
male employment was static. British women may hold down a lot of low-paid
and often part-time jobs, but at least they have got into the workforce. In
1992, 64.5 per cent of British women had jobs, a significantly higher figure
than in Germany, France or Italy, although lower than in Scandinavia or
North America, themselves polar opposites in their approach to labour market
issues.
This suggests a picture more complex than advocates either of extreme
deregulation or tougher laws are inclined to acknowledge, especially at a
time when the whole EC is rightly shifting priorities in favour of job
creation rather than further regulation of labour markets.
It is not clear that the EOC has adequately recognised this context. Nor is
it evident that its most ambitious demand, that individual equal pay awards
should in effect be applied as class actions to groups of employees, is
practical. One long-running British equal pay case involves a claim by a
health service speech therapist (a predominantly female profession) for pay
equality with colleagues who are pharmacists (a predominantly male
occupation). In a highly competitive world, employers are perhaps also
entitled to ask why the process of equalising pay between men and women
should necessarily involve raising the remuneration of the latter.
It is ironic that this confrontation should be occurring just when Mr David
Hunt is establishing himself in the role of employment secretary. Mr Hunt
is, by instinct, more sympathetic to the EOC's starting point than was his
predecessor. He should now seek urgently to persuade the EOC that he is
serious about speeding up tribunal procedures; if he does this, the EOC
should negotiate rather than litigate.
