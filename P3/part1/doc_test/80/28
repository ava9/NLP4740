candidates who face a run-off in the presidential election

Judging by the outcome of Sunday's first round of voting in the presidential
election, Finns are seeking new faces to lead them out of the gloom that has
enveloped the country for the past three years.
Confronted with 11 candidates on Sunday, the electorate plumped for the two
who clearly offered a break from the political conventions of the past. Mr
Martti Ahtisaari, who won the first round of voting, is a United Nations
diplomat who based his candidacy on his non-political background (although
he represents the Social Democratic party) and his lack of any
responsibility for the crippling recession of the 1990s that has pushed
unemployment in Finland to approaching 20 per cent of the workforce.
But he may yet be undone by Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, who swept from nowhere a
month ago to take second place. Excluding postal votes which were cast
earlier, Mrs Rehn won more votes on Sunday than Mr Ahtisaari. The two will
meet in a second vote on February 6.
Although a member - as defence minister - of the unpopular centre-right
coalition of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, Mrs Rehn has presented herself
as a breath of fresh air in Finland's stul-tified politics with spectacular
success.
As a member of the small Swedish-speaking minority, she is a genuine
outsider. But it is as a plain-speaking woman, with a disarming sense of
humour, that she has captured the imagination, especially of women and young
voters.
When she jokes about the over-inclination of Finnish men to make policy in
the sauna, she raises a laugh - but also strikes a chord with voters fed up
with what they see as a cliquey political establishment.
Nor is she afraid to be optimistic. 'Finns are a little bit masochistic  -
we have been concentrating on how bad things have been. But there are signs
of light,' she says.
Both Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn admitted on Sunday night that they were
broadly in agreement on the foreign policy issues that are the main concerns
of the president.
Both are keen advocates of Finland's application to join the European Union
and say they will not remain neutral when the issue is put to a referendum,
probably in the autumn.
Both lay great emphasis on maintaining neutral Finland's security, a highly
sensitive issue for a country with a long border and a history of military
conflict with Russia.
Mrs Rehn gives nothing away on this to the internationally-experienced Mr
Ahtisaari as she has been a well-respected defence minister.
Wary of upsetting Moscow, Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn avoid making specific
commitments on how Finland's strategic stance may develop in the wake of the
collapse of the Soviet Union, beyond the application to join the EU.
However, options such as moving within the Nato sphere are left open.
Where the two candidates differ most is on the economy - the most important
election issue and the one on which Mrs Rehn is most vulnerable.
She has not shied away from supporting the government's tough fiscal
policies which, although to the long-term benefit of the health of the
public finances, have added to the pain imposed by the long recession.
Mr Ahtisaari believes in more public investment and less stringent spending
cuts.
In fact, the outlook is much brighter this year than it has been since the
the economy began to contract three years ago. Due largely to a powerful
export boom - itself fuelled by a crash in the value of the Finnish markka -
gross domestic product is set to grow by up to 2 per cent this year,
compared with a fall of around 2.5 per cent in 1993.
Inflation, currently running at less than 1.5 per cent despite the
devaluation, is under control and the government was encouraged last autumn
by a series of pay agreements with the traditionally tough trade unions
which led to wage cuts in the public sector.
The finance ministry talks of 'buoyant growth' in 1995.
But even the most optimistic forecasts see unemployment remaining high for
the rest of the decade, probably staying in double figures at least until
1998.
'We should not settle for this,' insists Mr Ahtisaari.
Mrs Rehn, now the favoured candidate of the political right, may find her
new-found popularity dented in the economic debate.
However, as she remarked on Sunday night, the presidential election, the
first by universal suffrage, is turning out to be as much about personality
as issues.
And on that score Mrs Rehn is a winner.
