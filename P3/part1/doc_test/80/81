  [Text] Any change to the law on land inheritance in the 
New Territories will be reversed after the 1997 handover, a 
senior Chinese official in Beijing told EASTERN EXPRESS last 
night. He was responding to the row over proposals initiated by 
a legislative councillor, Christine Loh, to give women the right 
to inherit property in the New Territories. 
  "Article 40 of the Basic Law stipulates that the lawful 
traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants 
of the New Territories shall be protected," the Chinese official 
said. "Loh's amendment to the laws governing indigenous 
inheritance right is supported by the Hong Hong government. It 
is intended to be divisive, instigating internal struggle among 
Hong Kong people. Loh's amendment undermines Hong Kong's 
stability. It is deceptive as it calls for sexual equality. 
The future Hong Kong government will act in accordance with the 
Basic Law but not follow things set out by them (Loh and the 
Government)." 
  A senior Hong Kong government official criticised the 
warning. "Nobody has the right to prejudge the SAR [special 
administrative region] legislature," he said. "It is a part of 
autonomy enjoyed by the future SAR under the Joint Declaration. 
Chairman Mao Zedong said: `Women hold up half the sky'." 
  Simon Li, a retired high court judge and former member of 
the 
Basic Law drafting committee and current Preliminary Working 
Committee member, said the rights of the New Territories' 
indigenous people were secured by the Joint Declaration and 
"nothing in this world is equal". Li said Loh's visit to the 
New Territories villages was undemocratic. "In the old days, 
when Emperor Chin visited a place, he used to be escorted by a 
hundred carriages," Li said. "Now some democratic legislators 
have to be protected by 400 policemen." 
  Heung Yee Kuk members agreed to form a "Headquarters for the 
Struggle to Protect Home and Tribe" after a meeting yesterday 
discussing Loh's amendment to the New Territories Land 
(Exemption) Bill. Members vowed to pursue their campaign by 
peaceful means. 
  Attention has focused on the Fanling village of Lung Yeuk 
Tau 
and the Sha Tin village of Kak Tin in preparation for today's 
visit by Loh's subcommittee on women's affairs to exchange views 
with villagers on inheritance laws and women's rights. Earlier 
this week nearly 1,000 villagers rallied outside Legco [the 
Legislative Council] to protest against Loh's proposal. A 
United Democrats legislator, Lee Wing-tat, was assaulted and 
demonstrators supporting the amendment reported being attacked. 
Loh was the target of verbal fury, with some saying that she 
would be "raped and buried" if she set foot in the New 
Territories. Police declined to confirm rumours that hundreds 
of uniformed officers will be deployed to maintain order during 
the visit.
