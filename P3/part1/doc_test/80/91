FT  05 MAY 94 / EU judgment deals blow to hopes over women's pensions

Women in Britain hoping European Union law would help them secure a full
pension at 60 suffered a setback yesterday.
The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice said EU law did not
prevent an employer raising a woman's pension age to 65, the same as a man.
The court usually confirms the advocate-general's opinions.
The case being considered by the court involves 78 women who work for Avdel
Systems, a Bedford company. They had planned to retire at 60 on full pension
but were told by their employer in July 1991 that unless they continued to
work until they were 65 their total pension entitlement would be cut by 20
per cent.
'We are obviously disappointed for the women,' Ms Kamlesh Bahl, chairwoman
of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said. 'They have lost substantial
pension rights as a result of the change and feel it is wrong that in the
name of equality those rights have been taken away.'
Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at Sedgwick Nobles Lowndes, employee
benefits consultants, said: 'The opinion goes further than general practice
in this country, as few employers are equalising pension ages for service up
to May 1990.
'But it is unlikely employers will take full advantage of it. Not only will
it complicate the administration of their pension schemes, but the changes
it will bring would be harsh on their female employees.'
The European Court's Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange ruling in 1990 found
that pensions were part of pay, so men and women had to be treated equally.
Occupational pension schemes had to remove sex discrimination from their
rules - including the different ages at which pensions begin.
Yesterday's opinion, if confirmed, would mean employers could set the
retirement age and would not, under European law, have to preserve any
previous advantage held by women.
They would still have to ensure, however, full equality of pension
entitlement for service after May 17 1990, the date of the Barber ruling.
Under a European court ruling last October employers are not obliged to pay
equal pensions to men and women for service before May 1990.
