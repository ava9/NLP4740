MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST DECISION TO ADMIT MEN IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Although I am slightly Victorian in my dealings with women, I am certainly no 
chauvinist. I see nothing wrong with opening a door, helping a lady on with her 
coat, etc. 
</P>
<P>
I do not disagree with the Equal Rights Amendment women have been pursuing for 
the past however many years. 
</P>
<P>
Are they entitled to a double standard? Is anyone? I think not -- and that is 
why I was so appalled by Carol Tavris' position in "Boys Trample Girls' Turf" 
(Commentary, May 7). 
</P>
<P>
How dare she (and the protesting females at Mills College) take up arms against 
admitting men to the school in an era when the world is moving inexorably 
towards the equality women have sought and deserve. 
</P>
<P>
I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in its last year of being an 
all-male engineering facility and was most disappointed that after four 
grueling years of studying college-level aeronautical engineering, that I had 
just missed the opportunity to have interacted with female students in my 
socially formative teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, it seems wholly appropriate that Ms. Tavris would base her 
tenuous position on convoluted research that was conducted on and relates to 
girls between the ages of 3 and 5 years -- not on mature, rational college-age 
women whose voices are surely being drowned out by arrogant feminists who are 
clearly embracing a double standard on this non-issue.
