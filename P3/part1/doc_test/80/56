  [Text] Tallinn, June 07, BNS -- The Estonian parliament, 
with votes 63 for, nine against and three abstentions, today 
passed the law on general elections. The new law stipulates 
that members of parliament are elected by ballot in free 
elections by universal, equal and direct suffrage. 
  Estonian citizens who on election day are at least 18 years 
old have the right to vote, and citizens of at least 21 years of 
age may run for parliament. Legally incompetent citizens are 
deprived of the right to vote. 
  Under the Constitution, both regular and extraordinary 
parliamentary elections are declared by the president. Regular 
elections must be announced at least three months in advance. 
Extraordinary elections are to be announced within three days of 
when the need for them arises. 
  General elections will be financed from the national budget. 
The election campaigns of political parties, election 
coalitions and single candidates will get no funds from the 
state or local budgets. 
  The national election commission will register the 
candidates 
elected to the parliament and publish the final election returns 
with a complete list of persons elected not later than on the 
10th post-election day. Parliament members will assume their 
duties on the day the election returns are published.
