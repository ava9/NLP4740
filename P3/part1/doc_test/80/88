FT  26 JAN 93 / Battle of the sexes moves on to pensions front: Employers
are anxiously watching today's proceedings at the European Court of Justice

MEN and women may have been created equal, but their pensions have not, as
the European Court of Justice is about to hear. Today, three cases, one each
from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, come before it, and the decision
will spell out for employers all over Europe exactly how they are to
equalise men's and women's pensions.
The court took a landmark decision in May 1990, broadly saying men and women
must receive equal pensions because these are a form of pay, and sex may not
be used to determine pay. But many issues remain outstanding. Since the
second world war most European employers have set a lower retirement age for
women, effectively giving them more generous pensions than their male
counterparts. An entire framework of state, occupational and personal
pensions has grown up around that concept, which lasted until the court
ruled it violated the anti-discrimination statutes of the Treaty of Rome.
The British case, to be presented by Sir Nicholas Lyell, UK
attorney-general, pits the male and female pension scheme members of
Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings group, against each other, with
each arguing for different interpretations of equality, to get the maximum
share of the fixed funds available. The German case, Meroni v Collor, asks
to decide the issue of retrospection (how far back in time higher pension
payments to men will have to be made), while the Dutch case, known as
TenOever, asks if it is fair to offer pensions to members' widows but not
their widowers.
The cases address two basic issues: first, since the court only decided
differential pensions are illegal in May 1990, what about pension benefits
accrued or paid before then? The EC commissioned a survey which concluded
that if pensions in payment had to be equalised retrospectively, it could
cost British and German employers up to Pounds 50bn each, with somewhat more
modest sums for employers in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
That sobering assessment led EC member states to tack a protocol on the
Maastricht treaty declaring retrospectivity in occupational pension payments
should only apply to service after May 1990, the date of the court judgment.
With the fate of the Maastricht treaty in the air, European employers are
anxiously watching the court proceedings.
Lawyers familiar with the proceedings say the European Commission has filed
a brief in support of the narrowest definition of retrospection. This will
weigh considerably with the court, but is not definitive, thus reducing the
chances employers will be saddled with a hefty bill for retrospective
pension payments.
The court must also decide on an issue which will have great significance
for the nascent personal pensions industry throughout Europe. If men and
women must receive equal pension benefits, what happens in so-called money
purchase schemes which take into account the average longer life spans of
women?
In these, employers provide a lump sum on retirement to buy an annuity from
a life insurer. But a woman investing the same sum as a man at the same age
will receive lower monthly payments since she is expected to live longer. To
provide equal monthly payments, employers would have to give larger lump
sums to women, or insurers would have to adopt unisex rates.
Mr John Cunliffe, partner at solicitors McKenna and Co, one of the firms
presenting the British case to the court said: 'In money purchase schemes,
do you take into account that women live longer than men? That's it in a
nutshell.'
Mr Cunliffe cites Denmark where employers are allowed either to pay higher
premiums for women so they can buy the same level of benefit as men on
retirement or insurance companies are allowed to pay lower benefits for the
same premium. In the US, the Supreme Court has ruled differential insurance
benefits based on sex are illegal. 'They ruled that while on average women
live longer than men, it cannot be proven any one woman will live longer
than any man. Thus, you have to offer the same benefits for the same
premium.'
