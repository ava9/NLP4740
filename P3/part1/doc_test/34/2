When Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, President Eisenhower was serving his 
first term, a Cadillac cost less than $3,000 and a new word entered the 
language: Mouseketeers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mickey Mouse Club" premiered Oct. 3, 1955, and immediately enthralled 
millions of children. The ABC hit children's series ran until 1959, was re-ran 
from 1961 to 1965, and gave birth to a second version of "The New Mickey Mouse 
Club" from 1975 to 1977 and from 1983 to 1989 on the Disney Channel. A third 
spinoff of the show is in its third season. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Mouseketeers lasted from the first day of filming to the last: Annette, 
Tommy, Karen, Cubby, Doreen, Bobby, Darlene, Sharon, and me -- Lonnie. There 
were three adults -- Jimmy Dodd, Roy Williams, and Bob Amsberry -- as well as 
39 kids during the original show's four-year life. 
</P>
<P>
The adults have since died, as has Mouseketeer Mike Smith. Sherry Alberoni and 
Cheryl Holdridge were highly identifiable even though they were on the series 
for only two years. Two other alumni went on to star in "The Rifleman" (Johnny 
Crawford) and "My Three Sons" (Don Grady). 
</P>
<P>
Why did a fairly simple kids' TV show capture the imagination of millions of 
children and quite a few adults, become a spontaneous hit and last for 35 years 
in one form or another? 
</P>
<P>
The Mouseketeers and their show appeared at the same time as television was 
also growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Children had been on TV almost from its inception but they were always child 
actors playing roles or kids as audience members (the peanut gallery on "Howdy 
Doody") or interviewees (Art Linkletter's "House Party"). The Mouseketeers 
were, at Walt Disney's insistence, almost all amateurs as opposed to show 
business kids. Only Sharon Baird and I had credits as child actor/dancers and 
managed to sneak by Walt and his producers. So the Mouseketeers were real kids 
growing up with whom other real kids viewing the show could identify. Walt made 
it very clear that everyone who watched the show was a member of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Given the schedule of five 15-minute episodes a week plus cartoon introductions 
and other chores, it is not surprising that some of the Mouseketeers made 
mistakes -- which made us seem very human. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of the show was a very important factor. The Mouseketeers changed 
their show every day: Monday was "Fun With Music Day," Tuesday "Guest Star 
Day," Wednesday "Anything Can Happen Day," Thursday "Circus Day," and Friday 
"Talent Roundup." 
</P>
<P>
The Mouseketeers' singing and dancing was followed by a children's serial such 
as "Spin and Marty" or "The Hardy Boys." The next segment presented short films 
on children in other countries, wildlife, growing up on a farm or the American 
Indians. Millions of kids learned to spell encyclopedia from a cricket. The 
fourth part of the hour was a Disney cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some unassuming kids known as the Mouseketeers became the link between 
Walt Disney's characters -- Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Donald Duck -- and real 
kids. There was nothing slick or hip about the Mouseketeers. We were real kids 
who grew up and enjoyed ourselves in front of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a trick for Disney to put on those five hours a week in 1955. One 
could criticize the production values of the show, the repetitive musical 
numbers and the innocuous dialogue. But kids never seem to care about these 
criticisms: The "Mickey Mouse Club" was a seminal entertainment that 
communicated directly to children. 
</P>
<P>
There were faults in the America of the '50s, and faults with "The Mickey Mouse 
Club." An obvious example would be that although there were two Latinos on the 
Club, blacks only appeared as guests. This was a reflection of the age and 
nearly all TV programming at the time. Naturally, the second version of the 
Mouse Club in the '70s and the third show in the '80s were both fully 
integrated. 
</P>
<P>
In their small way, the Mouseketeers and "The Mickey Mouse Club" symbolize for 
millions a lost American innocence. It is wonderful to be a very tiny part of 
entertainment history that makes people smile when it is recalled.
