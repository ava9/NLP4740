"Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow, you're only a day away." 
</P>
<P>
That's the chorus that charmed audiences left the original version of the 
musical "Annie" singing for the seven years the hit show played on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
But now the producers of the $7-million sequel to that successful show, "Annie 
2," are praying that there will be a tomorrow someday for the production that 
closes its Washington D.C., run Saturday in the wake of negative reviews and an 
equally negative response from the public. 
</P>
<P>
The producers have announced that "Annie 2" will not be coming to Broadway to 
begin previews Feb. 5 and open on March 1 as planned. Instead they said they 
plan to bring a revival of the original Tony Award-winning musical which opened 
on Broadway on April 21, 1977 and ran for 2,377 performances until it closed on 
Jan 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The show's spokesman, David Powers, said here that director Martin Charnin 
expects to use much of the same cast in the revival that he used in "Annie 2," 
as well as the same scenery and costumes. "Annie 2" features Dorothy Loudon as 
Miss Hannigan, Harve Presnell in the role of Daddy Warbucks and 11-year-old 
Danielle Findley in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Annie 2," that sequel which will have 36 performances before its 
Washington run ends Saturday, will be presented in a revised version sometime 
over the summer at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., where 
"Annie" originated in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Annie 2" features a score by Martin Charnin and Charles Strouse and a book by 
Thomas Meehan, the same team that mounted the original show, but as soon as the 
critics saw the sequel, the production at the Opera House at Washington's 
Kennedy Center, appeared to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post theater critic, David Richards, wrote that " 'Annie' was a 
musical to take to your heart but you'll want to take a paddle to 'Annie 2'." 
Richards called the plot "preposterous" and the score "dull" even after seeing 
a streamlined version which had shed 30 minutes from what had been a 
three-and-a-half-hour running time. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, as co-producers Roger S. Berlind and Lewis Allen met around 
the clock, calculating how the show could be transformed in Washington, Berlind 
declined to discuss the production's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright and Dramatists Guild president Peter Stone, a Broadway veteran, also 
chose not to give his opinions on the musical's flaws, but Stone did say that 
"Annie 2" producers had asked him, director Tommy Tune and director/producer 
Mike Nichols to see the show and offer their advice. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the three had gone to Washington "as friends" of the "Annie 2" team 
and that they had discussed the production, but he said none of them would be 
involved in creating a new version of the sequel. Stone said any opinion he 
might offer publicly would only add to the misfortune of the show's producers 
who he said were "fighting for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
"Annie 2's" producers are quick to point out that the original "Annie" did not 
become a hit without its own struggle for survival. That show almost closed at 
the Goodspeed Opera House in 1976, but it was turned around by Mike Nichols, 
who signed on as a producer at Martin Charnin's invitation. Nichols helped 
oversee changes in the book, characters, sets and choreography as well as the 
addition of several songs. 
</P>
<P>
The highly advertised and now orphaned "Annie 2," which had accumulated $3.6 
million in advance sales, had forced the successful musical "Me and My Girl" 
out of the Marquis Theater on Broadway. That show closed on Jan. 1 to make way 
for the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
The show's producers were reportedly considering the Marquis as an ideal 
location for the revival of "Annie," but the Nederlander Organization, which 
owns the theater, is said to have sensed that the sequel's abrupt closing might 
well haunt the revival and rejected that maneuver. Nederlander has insisted 
that the lease at the Marquis was for "Annie 2," not for "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
A press spokesman of the show said that the lease is still under negotiation. 
If an agreement is reached to put the revival of "Annie" in the Marquis, the 
spokesman said, rehearsals for the revival could begin as soon as Feb. 5, the 
day "Annie 2" was to start its New York previews. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for "Annie 2" also confirmed reports that co-producer Berlind had 
offered to return 25%-30% of the production's costs to its investors in the 
hope that the investors would then put that money into the revival of "Annie."
