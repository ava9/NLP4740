SPOTTING FAVORITES IN A LITERARY ZOO

<P>
The State of the Language edited by Christopher Ricks and Leonard Michaels 
(University of California Press, 531 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Opening this book is like opening the zoo gates to an impatient crowd. 
Sixty-two writers tumble in, each invited to put down thoughts about some 
aspect -- any aspect -- of the English language at the start of our century's 
last decade. Naturally they scatter, each to his favorite species, though the 
insectivorursus (bugbear) seems most popular. 
</P>
<P>
Each to his? Each to her? Each to his/her? Each to their? Predictably, 
language's conquests and casualties in the gender wars are a prominent theme. 
So is the language used to speak or write about AIDS. So are questions of 
language and race, language and class, language and the nature of reality. 
Literary reality, that is, and also real reality. 
</P>
<P>
These are the most political topics -- language as power -- and I will get back 
to them. But to get to them risks getting swallowed up by them -- this is an 
open zoo -- so before doing so, let me give an idea of the range and variety of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second "State of the Language." The first was edited 10 years ago by 
Christopher Ricks and Leonard Michaels, English writers and English teachers 
at, respectively, Boston University and Berkeley. It was a flaming success -- 
we seem as fascinated to know we are speaking English as Moliere's M. Jourdain 
was to know he was speaking prose -- and this new volume by 60 new writers is 
the result. Ricks and Michaels are repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
There are pieces, for example, on Australian English and graffiti English and 
one by Michael Bawtree suggesting that if the English opera tradition is 
relatively weak, it is in part because Shakespeare and others gave such glory 
to theater words that they refused subsequently to lie down and let the music 
upstage them. 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the contributions of Variety newspaper to the language: 
palooka, corny, blockbuster, deejay, among others. There is a piece on swear 
words by an Oxford don that has this reviewer trying to choose between "jocular 
ponderousness" and "ponderous jocularity." 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the use of pidgin in advertising in the South Seas. There 
are Wall Street folk terms for particular stocks: Kellogg is cornflakes; 
MacDonald's, we are told, is murderburger, and Simmons Mattress is American 
playground. I don't know if I believe this 100%, but I 100% want to. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pieces wander freely. M.F.K. Fisher writes of a pornography ring at 
her boarding school and Ted Hughes contributes a poem. An essay on poets' 
letters tells us that Anne Sexton, taken aback when a monk she was 
corresponding with said he was leaving the monastery and wanted to meet her, 
replied: "I feel I have somehow deceived you into thinking this is really a 
human relationship. It is a letter relationship between humans . . . " 
</P>
<P>
If words can deceive us into passion, they can also help us out of it. Ricks 
tells of smashing a window years ago in a marital dispute. A constable, 
summoned to the scene, was politely sympathetic: "We got a phone call, sir, 
telling us that someone has gone beresk." Suddenly, Ricks' misery lifted. That 
beresk got him well out of life and back in literature with Shakespeare's 
malaprop Dogberry. 
</P>
<P>
On to language as power. Our disputes about ideas and issues tend to become 
disputes about terminology. Like Humpty Dumpty we want the mastery over words 
in order to gain mastery over their meaning. As Michaels writes in his 
foreword, it is not so much a question of using language as of being used by 
it: 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, it was considered very good luck to be used by English . . . 
There are now quite a few Englishes, and formerly colonized people may well 
prefer to get free of them and be used by their own language." 
</P>
<P>
David Dabydeen writes convincingly of the need for black writers in England to 
use their own kind of speech. A literary tradition in which an 18th-Century 
English poet was able to refer to plantation overseers as Master Swains, and to 
slaves as assistant planters clearly needs help. He gives a splendid quote from 
the Creole poet John Agard: 
</P>
<P>
"Dem accuse me of assault/on de Oxford dictionary/imagine a concise peaceful 
man like me," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ent serving no jail sentence/I slashing suffix in self-defense/I bashing 
future wit present tense." 
</P>
<P>
Bashing the future with the present tense describes him perfectly. Several 
pieces refer to the terminology of AIDS. One writer notes the controversy over 
the term "AIDS victims." "People with AIDS" is preferred by many, as tending 
less to segregate the sufferers. Others object to this as linguistic cottage 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The feminist movement has provided the liveliest disputes. What does one do 
about the relative pronoun? The writer who sticks up for . . . his . . . her . 
. . their . . . his/her . . . convictions is to do what? Half a dozen essayists 
weigh in, none comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Anne Doody is spirited, in any case, when she objects to line-by-line 
combing-out of church hymnals. Taking out references to king and His risks 
turning the hymns to mush. Better to omit particularly objectionable stanzas, 
she argues, than to do so much rewriting that "we are invited to forget that 
our Christian forefathers and foremothers ever said anything that poses a 
problem."
