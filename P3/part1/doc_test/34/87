Folk singer Judy Collins, who had big hits with her recordings of "Both Sides 
Now" and "Send In the Clowns," is looking for another hit with her new line of 
cosmetics. Called Judy Collins Harmonics, they're what the singer calls a 
"natural alternative to cosmetic surgery." She'll debut her new venture on 
Financial News Network's "Telshop" video-shopping service from February through 
April.

A Name With a Nice Ring 
</P>
<P>
We ran into jewelry designer Lee Brevard, who said he's just finished an 
assignment for Farrah Fawcett. "She wanted a cross, something designed 
especially for her. She didn't ask for anything specific, but she gave me a 
sapphire ring that she hoped I could use and another ring that she said I could 
perhaps melt down." Brevard's final design is of silver and gold with Fawcett's 
original green sapphire in the center and five star sapphires in different 
colors surrounding it. All the edges are rounded and smooth, Brevard says, and 
it's a combination of shiny and matte finishes. But Brevard's favorite jewel is 
Fawcett herself. "She's a wonderful, kind, intelligent and patient person," he 
said. And she had to be, because Brevard was so busy, he was four months late 
with her cross.

Eyes in L.A.

Sheena Easton is one of many who have bought "the silver Bombay," the hot new 
spec shape at L.A. Eyeworks. The shop's Lou Gaez tells us Easton was in for the 
semi-rectangular aluminum frame, and she turned it into her own signature style 
by ordering mirrored lenses. "She really has a special knack," Gaez says. 
Rocker Brad X (his last name is Xavier), ordered "Jimmy Jacks with clips," a 
round, John Lennon style of sunglasses with clip-on sunglasses attached, so he 
gets a double dose of protection. And Marlee Matlin's choice was "brown 
Priscilla frames," which Gaez says are "very classy and sophisticated."

A Dressy Showcase 
</P>
<P>
You thought Melanie Griffith looked great at the Golden Globe Awards in her 
off-the-shoulder, black chiffon dress? We did too. So we phoned around and 
found that the dress is by Giorgio Armani, that it is from the designer's 
spring-summer collection and that it was purchased by Griffith at the Armani 
shop in New York. Furthermore, an Armani representative tells us, Griffith 
chose that dress because the low neckline would be best for showing off the new 
diamond necklace she had just gotten from her past and future husband, Don 
Johnson. She also wore the necklace at the awards.

A Wonderful Model 
</P>

The recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies in New York brought out an 
impressive number of music greats, including Stevie Wonder. He attended the 
event, as an honored guest, in a Go-Silk cream silk suit and black silk 
T-shirt, all purchased at Fred Segal on Melrose just days before. Listen hears 
that bandleader Paul Shaffer, who was also at the music tributes, came back 
from New York and into Fred Segal to buy a few Go-Silk shirts for his nightly 
appearances on "Late Night With David Letterman."

Real Women Getting Ahead 
</P>
<P>
The long line of Breck Girls who, since 1946, have been the heart of the 
shampoo company's ad campaigns, has included Christie Brinkley, Jaclyn Smith, 
Cybill Shepherd, Brooke Shields, Cheryl Tiegs and Kim Basinger. But last year 
the Breck Girl became a Breck Woman, due to what a company spokeswoman calls "a 
shift in marketing." Part of that shift includes a new focus "not on fashion 
models, but on real women." So this year, candidates for the title will be 
chosen by a TV audience, not by the company executives. The candidates will all 
appear on ABC-TV's "Home Show" starting Monday. On Thursday, viewers will be 
asked to choose the winner via a special phone-in number. And next Friday, the 
winner will be announced. That's democracy in action -- except that real women 
often have to work and can't watch noontime TV.
