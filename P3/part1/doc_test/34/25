"Floyd Jackson is the only person who knows what it's like to be in my shoes," 
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC, once joked. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, since he opened his shoeshine business at NBC studios in Burbank 
in 1951, Jackson has worked on a lot of big shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to shine Bob Hope, Flip Wilson and Dinah Shore," said Jackson, who over 
the years has decorated the walls of his shoeshine stand with pictures of some 
of his most famous customers. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 50 years of shining for the stars, Jackson himself has become 
something of a celebrity. "Floyd's Place" is a regular stop on the NBC tour, 
and a booklet chronicling Jackson's career at NBC is available at the studio 
gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
His regular clientele includes most of the guests who appear on "The Tonight 
Show" as well as the show's star, Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in 1930s 
</P>
<P>
Now 80, Jackson started shining shoes in the early 1930s at the swank Rice 
Hotel in Houston. Among his first celebrity customers was John Wayne. But many 
were Texas millionaires, such as former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. 
Jones. Or oilman Glenn McCarthy, whose life inspired the best-selling novel 
"Giant" and the 1965 movie of the same title starring James Dean, Elizabeth 
Taylor and Rock Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
It was McCarthy, Jackson said, who in 1947 offered to bring him to Los Angeles 
aboard his private airplane. The "King of the Wildcatters," as McCarthy was 
known, had just built the $21-million, 18-story Shamrock Hotel in Houston and 
was coming to Hollywood to arrange for several movie stars to appear at the 
hotel's grand opening, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn was one of the biggest fellas in Houston," Jackson said. "He liked me to 
be around him because I had a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he and his family had been planning to move to the West Coast for 
awhile, and soon after arriving he sent for his wife, Corine, whose mother 
lived in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For a few years, Jackson carried a portable shoeshine stand all over Hollywood 
hunting down business. "I used to go around to all the studios -- Warner Bros., 
MGM, Universal Studios, ABC and NBC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also moonlighted as a custodian at Universal, a job he kept until 1971. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stand at NBC 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he saved enough money to buy a regular shine stand, which NBC 
allowed him to set up rent-free on the loading dock of the company's old 
studios at Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
When NBC moved from Hollywood to Burbank in 1951, Jackson went along. Today, 
Floyd's Place is located outside Studio One, where "The Tonight Show" is taped. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things Floyd is famous for is shining the shoes of all the people 
who appear on the 'Tonight Show,' " said NBC spokeswoman Pat Schultz. "It's 
become a good luck gesture for guests to have their shoes shined by Floyd 
before appearing on the show." 
</P>
<P>
The late night talk show's entire cast, including Carson, are frequent 
customers, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny never comes out and gets his shine on the stand," Jackson said. 
"Sometimes he'll be in makeup, and I'll come in and he'll talk to me. Or I'll 
go down and pick up his shoes in his dressing room and he'll say, 'Howdy.' He's 
a good man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100 Tip 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's most famous customers have included former President Ronald Reagan 
and Frank Sinatra, who several years ago gave the shoeshine operator his first 
$100 tip. His second came last week -- from blues guitarist B. B. King. 
</P>
<P>
One of Jackson's favorite stories is about the $99 tip he got from Spanish 
tenor Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting a shine, and an NBC tour came by and told about Frank giving me 
a $100," Jackson said. "When Placido got off the stand, he said, 'Floyd, give 
me a dollar.' So I gave him a dollar, and he handed me a $100 bill." 
</P>
<P>
The singer explained to Jackson: "Me and Frank are very good friends, and I 
don't want to out-tip Frank." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said his worst tipper was former President Richard Nixon, who as vice 
president told his Secret Service escort to tip Jackson 50 cents. But Jackson 
said he doesn't blame Nixon. "I knew the vice president never carries money 
with him," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Jackson himself has appeared on television. He said he has been 
on "Laugh-In," "Real People" and "David Letterman," as well as "The Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stargazer 
</P>
<P>
In light of those experiences, Jackson said he is long past the stargazing 
stage and doesn't get excited at meeting celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a warm place in his heart for those in the entertainment business. 
"Show people are the greatest people on earth," Jackson said. "I just love 
them." 
</P>
<P>
NBC executives say that over the years Jackson's joviality has brightened the 
lives of studio employees. "Floyd's an institution," said Donald Zachary, vice 
president of NBC's West Coast operations. "He's always got a smile and a good 
word for everybody. He's well loved." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zachary said, "NBC executives have the shiniest shoes in town." 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired officially last year, Jackson said he has had a hard time 
finding a reliable replacement. He works whenever he feels like it. 
</P>
<P>
NBC officials have promised Jackson that when he leaves, "Floyd's Place" will 
remain a regular stop on the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it, and you know I never heard of a shine man being a star," 
Jackson said. "I'm not bragging about it, but I made my own self a star."
