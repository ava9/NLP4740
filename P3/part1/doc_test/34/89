The Nashville Network is not MTV for country-music fans. TNN's mission is to be 
broader than MTV-to be the source in country music, entertainment and 
information and provide programs that reflect a country lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
For all you city slickers, country music is "taking a big breath of fresh Rocky 
Mountain air and fishing along the stream," said C. Paul Corbin, TNN director 
of programming. "If you listen to the music and lyrics in country music you 
will find pretty well what a country lifestyle is. We want to make sure our 
programs are not the same that are available on the other networks." 
</P>
<P>
While MTV's schedule still mainly consists of videos, TNN has 39 series, 
including flagship show "Nashville Now," a live weeknight music-talk program 
hosted by Ralph Emery and a puppet named Shotgun Red. The show is celebrating 
its seventh anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Other series include: "Grand Ole Opry Live"; "A Conversation with Dinah," a 
talk show hosted by Dinah Shore; "VideoPM," a three-hour weeknight music video 
show; the how-to series "Backyard America"; "Cookin' U.S.A."; "Country Kitchen" 
with Florence Henderson; and a celebrity interview series, "Crook and Chase." 
</P>
<P>
Sports fanatics can catch more than 18 hours of auto racing, rodeos and fishing 
and hunting programs on Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to potential criticism from animal-rights activists, TNN general 
manager David Hall insists no animals are killed on-screen on the "The 
Outdoorsmen" and "Celebrity Outdoors" hunting series. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't kill Bambi," Hall said. "We show the technique and theory (of 
hunting). I have a real thing about that. If they are on a hunting expedition 
and they kill a great elk, it's already (happened) by the time the camera gets 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Based on viewers' reaction, Hall said, "You can kill all the fish you want, but 
you can't kill Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
TNN is a division of Opryland U.S.A. Inc. of Nashville. The network began seven 
years ago as an 18-hour-a-day ad-supported cable service. 
</P>
<P>
"We own the Grand Ole Opry," Hall said. "Long before MTV, we had a good feeling 
for the loyalty and size of the country music audience and fans. We thought 
there was a large enough audience to support a cable TV network." 
</P>
<P>
TNN kicked off with a five-hour live music show from seven cities and came back 
the next morning with a game show, a sitcom, a concert music series and a live 
talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, TNN provides 3,600 hours of original programming, including more 
than 1,100 live hours. 
</P>
<P>
"People love live television," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who does a live variety show every month," Corbin said . " 
'Nashville Now' is a phenomenal program. Our country artists can come and sing 
and Grandma and the kids can watch it without being embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
To get a large viewer base, TNN was originally offered to cable systems for 
free for the first three years and was broadcast to 7 million households. Today 
TNN is the sixth-largest basic system with a subscriber base of 52 million 
households; it's in more than 210 markets and in every state. According to 
Hall, the network is turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
TNN viewers generally are 25 or older, Corbin said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a youngster, you may reject country music and go to rock music," he said, 
"but in your late teens and early 20s, you take a look at life and your goals 
and your objectives and then all of a sudden, country music means something to 
you. After you reach the age of 25, you are back into country, and it speaks to 
day to day emotions and frankly it deals with life and the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
TNN, he said, has helped boost the popularity of country music. 
</P>
<P>
"Country record sales are just soaring," he said. "This year there were 33 
country albums which have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum. 
Particularly with new artists they are succeeding because they get exposure on 
TNN." 
</P>
<P>
"I look on TNN very positively," said Gene Bridges, program director for Los 
Angeles country station KLAC-AM (540). "I don't sit and watch record sales, but 
probably record sales have improved by exposure on TNN. I personally see it as 
a country music partner, helping us spread our message about country music. 
It's my perception that country music is being accepted rapidly all over the 
world, particularly in the United States, and I think that TNN has helped do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
TNN tries to be a homespun cable service. "We really are very much in tune with 
our audience," Corbin said. "We really care about phone calls and letters. We 
respond to each and every letter. Sometimes they write back and we become pen 
pals. It is our way of doing things. We respect this audience and really admire 
them for their involvement."
