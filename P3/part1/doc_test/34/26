Retired plasterer Walter Swan doesn't fit the image of a hot author. He wears 
denim coveralls and a black cowboy hat. At 15, he dropped out of the eighth 
grade after spending so much time there he had carved his initials in almost 
every desk in the school. By his own admission he can't write or spell. In his 
Bisbee, Ariz., bookstore, he proudly displays one of his report cards from 1932 
-- straight Fs in spelling and straight Ds in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know nothin' about writing," says the gregarious 73-year-old. "I don't 
even know what adjectives and vowels and things like that are. But I know 
plastering. I could plaster your house up one side and down the other." 
</P>
<P>
But his book, "me 'n Henry," a collection of down-home stories about Swan and 
his brother, Henry, growing up in Cochise County, is gaining widespread 
attention. He got a brief mention in Erma Bombeck's column, and he's been 
interviewed on radio talk shows in Salt Lake City and Boston. Several 
newspapers and TV stations in Arizona have sent reporters to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
Now the publicity is going national. "CBS This Morning" traveled to Bisbee to 
tape a spot on Swan and the "Tonight Show" is also trying to line him up for an 
appearance. And a man strolled into Swan's store and announced, "I'm with the 
Walt Disney Co. Have you sold the movie rights to that book yet?" Swan keeps 
the Disney fellow's phone number on a crumpled slip of paper in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going all over the country and I can't stop it," Swan says, amazed at his 
brush with fame. "But it ain't my fault. I just wrote a book." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers have no trouble finding Swan to place an order. After the Boston 
interview, he got more than 80 letters from people requesting copies. They were 
addressed to the One-Book Bookstore in Bisbee. That's right -- one book. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated that ordinary bookstores wouldn't stock "me 'n Henry," a 
self-published work marked by lousy grammar and a distinct lack of literary 
style, Swan plunked down $100 to rent a storefront cubicle along Main Street in 
this old copper mining town of 7,000. He hung a couple of crude signs on the 
front window, taped his report card to the wall, set up some folding chairs and 
a couple of tables piled high with the store's only book -- "me 'n Henry." 
</P>
<P>
Since his grand opening last year, he has sold 3,000 books. Counting the ones 
he sold before opening the store, Swan has moved 6,000 copies -- at $21.35 
each, including tax. "Fifteen minutes after I got in here I sold enough books 
to make my rent," Swan says. "I can't exaggerate how good it's going. At least 
10 times a day people come in and tell me what a hilarious book it is." 
</P>
<P>
The book is a collection of stories Swan told to his eight children as they 
were growing up. It is written like he talks, with sentences such as, "I was in 
the third grade a going to the Frontier School." At the encouragement of his 
wife, Deloris, he wrote the stories in longhand over a 30-year period. By the 
late '70s, when the Swans began searching for a publisher, there were enough 
stories to fill an apple crate. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years of disappointment followed, during which the couple racked up 14 
rejections from New York publishers. Not to be deterred, the Swans bought a 
computer and laser printer, and Deloris, then 66, taught herself how to use 
them. In September, 1988, they paid a Tucson printer $6,750 to publish 1,000 
hardback copies. They sold out within three weeks. Thus far, they've had four 
printings. 
</P>
<P>
Swan's initial sales strategy was to pack boxes of "me 'n Henry" into the trunk 
of his car and drive to autographing sessions at bookstores, gift shops and 
libraries around southern Arizona. Wherever he went, however, store owners took 
40% of the profits. And response to the book was so positive that Swan figured 
he could successfully set out on his own with the One-Book Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Swan's outgoing personality and tireless promotion are big reasons for the 
book's success. He talks up "me 'n Henry" wherever he goes. "You bought a book 
yet, Wayne?" he calls to a patron at a Bisbee lunch counter. As he strolls the 
sloping sidewalks of this hill town, passers-by say hello and Swan starts in on 
them, sizing them up for a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Swan argues that his literary style is important, too. He describes it this 
way: "I try to write so folks don't have a headache when they're done." But 
there is more to it than that: "It's all true stories," Swan says. "Second, 
there's no filth. And the clincher is there's no big words. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to like the one (story) about me gettin' my finger stuck in the 
Model-T car," says Swan. "Or the time the billy goat et my first-grade reader. 
But the funniest is my father accidentally drinkin' a pitcher full of my 
polliwogs." 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Swans' bookstore brought in almost $7,000. Swan has also taken 
out a subscription to Publisher's Weekly. "I want to get a line on the 
bestsellers and such," he says. And Deloris answers the couple's home phone 
with a cheerful "Swan Enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises include plans for four more self-published books -- "Me and 
Moma and How We Raised Eight Kids and Survived," "Cornbread, Milk, and Honey," 
"How to Be a Better Me" and "Uncle Walt's Bedtime Stories." 
</P>
<P>
But even if he hits it big, Swan doesn't plan any major purchases. He says 
he'll give some money to the Mormon Church for its missionary effort, and with 
the remainder he'll buy "two of the finest hogs I can find, some good bees, and 
some racing pigeons." 
</P>
<P>
As he awaits the next development in his remarkable good fortune, Swan 
continues to greet customers and curious tourists with a big howdy, and 
poo-poos the idea that he is becoming a celebrity. "All I am is Walter Swan," 
he says, "Never been nothin' else." 
</P>
<P>
That includes a good speller. A customer named Mike recently asked Swan to 
autograph a copy of "me 'n Henry." Swan thumbed back his black cowboy hat and 
happily obliged. But he spelled the man's name M-I-K.
