Many of Los Angeles' Japanese immigrants love TV shows from back home so much 
that they can't wait for them to be aired here on TV or cable. They go instead 
where they can find them faster: at their local gray-market video store. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread practice of renting and selling taped TV shows from Japan is 
accepted by a community hungry for the latest episodes. Older customers and 
middle-aged women head straight for the Japanese soap operas. Middle-aged men 
like drama or ninja-type movies. And the younger crowd goes for suspense, quiz 
and action shows, according to one video store operator. Customers don't seem 
to be bothered by lack of proper licensing -- or even by low-quality 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
A Little Tokyo video store owner whose shelves were stuffed with Japanese TV 
shows taped off the air -- and who didn't want himself or his shop identified 
-- said his customers include many homesick for their native country, college 
exchange students here for three months and Japanese women married to Caucasian 
men for 15-20 years who still don't understand English well enough to feel 
comfortable here. 
</P>
<P>
The owner has a contact in Japan who tapes TV shows off the air and sends the 
"master" to a tape-duplicating service in Los Angeles. Customers can see the 
programs within two weeks of broadcast in Japan -- a much shorter delay for 
viewers who would otherwise have to wait as long as six months to see those 
same shows here on only a few channels and in limited time periods. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Toyomitsu, manager of the Cinema Club-L.A. video store in Gardena, 
however, refuses to go along with this practice. He claims that his is the only 
store in the mainland United States that doesn't rent taped Japanese TV shows. 
He rents and sells only Japanese and Japanese-subtitled movies -- all authentic 
copies from the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Why not handle TV shows, which would unquestionably boost profits? "For one 
thing," he says with a laugh, "it is illegal. Everybody knows that it is." 
Toyomitsu, 33, who immigrated to the United States when he was 11, opened his 
shop late last year and now carries about 3,000 tapes, including many films 
from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
When he first started his business here, he didn't know what kinds of tapes 
would be popular. "So we took what was popular in Japan and just brought (the 
equivalent of a typical Japanese video) store into the United States." But 
Toyomitsu soon found that tastes here are a little different. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, for instance, he estimates that American movie titles out-rent 
Japanese ones, 8-to-1. Here, it's about 50-50. Gore titles, popular in Japan, 
didn't do well here, and they are now among many of his red-tag specials. He 
researches which titles are popular in Japan and tries to bring them here 
within a month after their release in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his customers keep abreast of new releases through return trips to 
Japan and imported Japanese magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking for it before I even have it in the store," Toyomitsu said. "By 
word of mouth, they find out what movies are really hot in Japan right now. But 
most of the time, they're asking for the American movies like 'The Last 
Emperor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cinema Club's 1,200 members (mainly Japanese businessmen and their families who 
have come for a temporary stay of two to three years) pay $4 to rent each title 
for one day. Toyomitsu said he only sells about one or two tapes per month (the 
average cost is about $80). 
</P>
<P>
He also said he copies Japanese movies but doesn't dare rent pirated copies of 
American ones -- his customers know the quality of his tapes won't be as good 
as the originals, but "they don't mind. The customer understands. The customer 
just wants to see the (movie)."
