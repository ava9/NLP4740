THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Jones is always adventuring into areas where no other explorer dares to 
go, so it's fitting that "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" represented a 
video-industry first when it was released Thursday. The Steven Spielberg film 
is the first to be released simultaneously in seven versions: regular VHS, 
Beta, pan-and-scan LaserDisc, letterbox LaserDisc, Super-VHS, 8mm, and 
Spanish-subtitled VHS. 
</P>
<P>
That is especially good news for anyone who has laid out big bucks for a 
Super-VHS VCR, only to find that pre-recorded material in the improved-image 
format is almost non-existent. The news gets even better: The Super-VHS version 
of the 1989 summer blockbuster is the lowest-priced S-VHS movie-on-tape yet -- 
only $39.95 -- and it's in the letterbox configuration (wide screen, with black 
bands at top and bottom). 
</P>
<P>
"Last Crusade" is the first S-VHS release from Paramount Home Video, offering 
hope that other S-VHS tapes will be coming from this major and others in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are even lower for the other versions -- $29.95 for each of the 
LaserDisc versions and $24.95 for all others. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Ford is back as Indy, with Sean Connery on hand as his father. Also 
starring Denholm Elliott, River Phoenix, John Rhys-Davies and Alison Doody, 
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" is MPAA-rated PG-13. 
</P>
<P>
Other new movies-on-tape: 
</P>
<P>
"High Hopes" (Academy, $89.95, not MPAA rated). Critically acclaimed 1989 
British comedy-drama from director Mike Leigh about the class system in 
Thatcher-era Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fastest Guitar Alive" (MGM/UA, $19.95). Did you know that singer Roy 
Orbison starred in a Civil War drama back in 1968? He did, and here it is -- 
though this tame movie will be of interest only to curiosity seekers. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat a Bowl of Tea" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). Comedy set in New York 
City's Chinatown, circa the 1940's. Directed by Wayne Wang ("Slamdance"). 
</P>
<P>
"Night Visitor" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R). No one believes a compulsive liar when he 
reports a gruesome murder. This 1989 film with Elliot Gould shouldn't be 
confused with 1970's "The Night Visitor," which starred Max von Sydow and Liv 
Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
"Time Trackers" (MGM/UA, $79.95, PG). Weak time-travel comedy that gets waylaid 
in medieval England too long. Ned Beatty, Kathleen Beller. 
</P>
<P>
"Another Chance" (Republic, $89.95, R). Obscure 1988 romantic comedy with Bruce 
Greenwood, Vanessa Angel and Anne Ramsey about a playboy who suddenly has to be 
faithful to one woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse James Rides Again" and "G-Men vs. the Black Dragon" (Republic, $29.95 
each). Two double-cassette packages compiling 1940s serials. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT WEEK: "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Wired" (both Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
They're baa-ack. Those masters of mayhem, the Three Stooges, wreak havoc in six 
more videos containing three shorts each. Volumes 27 through 31 feature Larry, 
Moe and Curly; Volumes 26 and 31 have Larry, Moe and Shemp. The tapes are 
$14.95 each from RCA/Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Another sort of mayhem is on view in "Rolling Stone Presents 20 Years of Rock 
&amp; Roll" (MGM/UA, $19.95), a 97-minute retrospective featuring performers 
ranging from the Beatles to Madonna. TERRY ATKINSON
