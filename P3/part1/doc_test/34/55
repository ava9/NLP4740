FANS OF THE '80S STILL GO BANANAS OVER THE MONKEES 
</P>

Hey, hey, they're the Monkees. And, believe it or not, they've still got a lot 
of fans. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three years after television gave birth to the group, the Monkees 
managed to attract several hundred fans -- some reportedly from as far away as 
Japan -- to a three-day convention and nostalgia-fest in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
And in what is certainly a tribute to (or indictment of) the power of 
television, many of these fans were too young to have been alive when the show 
originally aired. They have come to know the goofy quartet, whose members 
specialized as much in slapstick as in music, through MTV, reruns and a much 
ballyhooed reunion and tour that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's session, in a ballroom of the Sheraton Universal, the crowd watched 
Monkee videotapes. They squealed as each Monkee appeared on the big-screen TV 
and sang along to the group's theme song. Most wore Monkees T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the Monkees -- Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and Davy Jones -- reunited in 
1986 and have been touring. Michael Nesmith has stayed away from the fun but 
joined the others in concert at the Universal Amphitheatre on Sunday night, an 
event that organizer Marla Martinez called "historic." 
</P>

'Once-in-a-Lifetime' 
</P>
<P>
Dana Porter, 15, said she and her mother, who live in North Muskegon, Mich., 
have traveled nationwide to Monkees events. They came here this week because 
the Monkees are being honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," the high school student said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana says she learned about the Monkees from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother tapes them (reruns) and we watch them together," Dana said. "They're 
a real great group of guys. They're spunky and energetic. They make the show 
fun." 
</P>

Monkees Over Beatles 
</P>
<P>
Michael Macaluso, 39, a Woodland Hills T-shirt merchandiser, confided that the 
Monkees aren't his favorites; he grew up a Beatles' fan. But he has collected 
enough Monkee memorabilia to work conventions in five cities in the last two 
years. The Monkees' following is small, he said, but dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Macaluso's children, however, would take the Monkees over the Beatles any day. 
The Beatles, 7-year-old Leah said, are "so stupid. They don't even have a (TV) 
show!" 
</P>
<P>
For Monkee memorabilia collectors, the convention had a lot to offer: For $8 
you could buy a T-shirt, with the trademark MONKEES in psychedelic letters 
shaped into a guitar; the "official" Monkees jigsaw puzzle (some pieces 
missing) for $30; old albums ranging in price from $8 to $25; a Monkees Thermos 
for $40, and for just $185, an original, 1967 box of Monkees bubble gum cards. 
</P>
<P>
For a really special souvenir, however, you could buy a dollar raffle ticket 
for a piece of Monkees clothing: Dolenz's silver silk trousers, for example, or 
Nesmith's embroidered cowboy shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Diltz, 50, has been photographing the Monkees since 1967, and he says 
their old pictures are still his biggest sellers. He displayed some from the 
late '60s, with the Monkees in love beads and long hair, and more recent photos 
that showed them on the Pat Sajak show or playing polo. 
</P>
<P>
Diltz, like others, attributed the Monkees' longevity to television. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 4-year-old son who watches the shows," Diltz said. "He loves it. He 
doesn't know they're reruns. He doesn't know it's 20 years old."
