Forget Martinique. If Orange County's hectic lifestyle is a gettin' you down, 
pack up the chillun and escape to Dogpatch, U.S.A., a town that moves slower 
than maple syrup a-slidin' down a stack of hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Dogpatch comes to Brea's Curtis Theatre via "Li'l Abner," a 
"Hee-Haw"-style family musical presented by the Brea Youth Theatre under the 
direction of Gregory and Kysa Cohen. Closing performances are scheduled 
Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1956 by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, the stage version of "Li'l 
Abner" is based on Al Capp's syndicated comic strip of the same name, which 
premiered in 1934 and ran a whopping 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much in Dogpatch. Daisy Mae is still mooning over Abner, 
Mammy Yokum still runs the roost and "most everybody else can still be found 
lazin' around the fishin' hole and moochin' a little moonshine." 
</P>
<P>
But, there's trouble a-brewin'. It seems the worthy Senator Phogbound has 
proclaimed Dogpatch to be the "most worthless town in the whole U.S. of A.," 
earning it the right to be blown off the map in an A-bomb test. This would be 
just fine with the residents, if it didn't interfere with the annual Sadie 
Hawkins Day race, in which members of the fairer sex (and in Dogpatch, you use 
that term loosely) nab unwilling husbands. 
</P>
<P>
The search for something -- anything -- to make Dogpatch worthwhile turns up 
Yokumberry tonic, the secret elixir that has made Abner the strapping youth he 
is. Government types whisk the boy and the brew off to Washington for extensive 
testing, setting the stage for lots of jolly jabs at Big Business and dimwitted 
politicians. (There's a not-too-subtle irony in that this "Abner" plays inside 
Brea's slick Civic and Cultural Center, just a stone's throw from the city's 
seat of power.) 
</P>
<P>
"Abner" features a 36-member cast of area youngsters, ages 8 to 17. The kids 
have varying degrees of theatrical and vocal expertise, but all put out equal 
shares of energy and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Kristyn Jenkins, 10, is the real standout as the sassy Mammy Yokum, hobbling 
madly about the stage, barking orders between puffs on her corncob pipe. Doug 
Book, 17, falls short as a singer, but his portrayal of the loveable country 
hunk Abner is larger than life. Wendy See, 15, is slim, blond and has a sweet 
soprano, making her a winsome Daisy Mae. And Roger Alan Ross, 15, is a slippery 
Marryin' Sam, a fast-talking huckster with more dee-lux wedding packages up his 
sleeve than a Vegas chapel. Eric Bleau, 14, plays Earthquake McGoon, a solid 
block wall of a man with an intellect to match. 
</P>
<P>
The opening number, "It's a Typical Day," is meant to introduce several of the 
minor roles, but the overamplified background music made it tough to make out 
the lyrics. Additionally, the program lists the cast alphabetically, instead of 
in order of appearance, making it harder to identify cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Musically speaking, however, things do improve later in the show. "Jubilation 
T. Cornpone" and "The Country's in the Very Best of Hands" are a couple of 
rousing numbers highlighted with some surprisingly tight dancing. And "Love in 
a Home" is a tender duet between Abner and Daisy Mae that shows off See's 
honeyed voice. 
</P>
<P>
Sets and lighting by Trent Nelson are serviceable and allow the large cast 
plenty of room to whoop it up on the theater's expansive stage. Annie 
McQuitty's costumes ape Capp's original drawings, down to Abner's single-strap 
overalls and Daisy's polka-dot blouse (See chose to wear hers a little more 
modestly than the comic strip's original, amply-endowed Daisy); and Senator 
Phogbound's 40-gallon Uncle Sam hat was a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
According to program director D. Scott Riordan, the Brea Youth Theatre has 
operated under various names and directors for the last six years, presenting 
one family musical each summer in the Curtis Theatre. The city took over the 
program in 1988, bringing in local directors, designers and choreographers to 
stage each show. Participation is open to any student in the county, but the 
bulk of the casts are made up of children from the Brea, Yorba Linda and 
Fullerton areas.
