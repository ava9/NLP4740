LOS ANGELES is kaput, they say. The quality of life has gone to the dogs. In 
the city that was for so long the fastest-growing in the world, you can hear 
natives talk about moving out, to Portland or Seattle or somewhere. The Golden 
Age of L.A. was the decade of "the good war," followed by the optimistic '50s. 
And now all the good times are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Every age romanticizes the past, of course -- usually the age before the last 
because memories have had longer to mellow. We're right to hold a vision of the 
past: It steadies our views on life. Still, it should be an accurate vision. In 
these harried times we need some detailed nostalgia, a closer look at the 
Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '40s, I had no idea I even lived in Los Angeles. My home was a 
little farm town called Van Nuys, and so far as I could tell, it was the dusty, 
ragtag, tail end of the world. Everything on the radio was happening somewhere 
else, like the war in the South Pacific, or whatever it was that went on in a 
mysterious land called Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Though the San Fernando Valley was all about to change beyond recognition, my 
street was still full of chicken and turkey ranches, and there were commercial 
cornfields within a mile or two. Whatever else they might have done, everybody 
on my street raised a couple of acres of walnuts. Every fall, a family of 
braceros would come and shake down our walnuts with long pruning hooks and camp 
out in the orchard at nightfall. These were the only non-Anglos we ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, my world practically ended at the Southern Pacific tracks a few 
hundred yards from our orchard. Beyond the tracks, there seemed to be nothing 
but dirt roads and an occasional sunburnt paved road patched with tar, all in a 
vast sea of orange groves. For years, oranges were so important that when a 
frost was expected, the weatherman would tell orange growers to light heaters 
called smudge pots in their groves. 
</P>
<P>
We were so remote that the mailman made only one pass down our street a day, so 
all the mailboxes had to be on the same side of the street. That's the way a 
lot of our neighbors liked it, the Midwesterners who had achieved the great 
'30s dream of retiring in California and raising chickens. There was a strong 
Midwestern flavor to Los Angeles in those days, even some lingering dry 
sentiment. One local supermarket chain didn't start selling beer and wine until 
well into the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I remember Van Nuys as dusty and ragtag because it was dusty and ragtag. 
After all, there was a war going on. All the cars were old, and the tires were 
worn down to fabric because of the rubber shortage. I remember my mother making 
soap from bacon drippings. 
</P>
<P>
She was sturdily patriotic about the war, and whenever she was asked to spell 
Van Nuys, she'd begin, "V, as in victory." However, she hated rationing as much 
as anybody and sometimes bought black-market hamburger meat in North Hollywood. 
Needless to say, it was injected with water to increase the weight, and when 
you put it in the pan, boiling droplets would skid everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The war was actually changing Los Angeles in ways I couldn't see. It brought a 
lot of people, many of them black and Mexican, from out of state to work in the 
war industries. And they were just the beginning of the boom. After the war, 
there was a popular song titled "I'm Gonna Make the San Fernando Valley My 
Home." I couldn't believe my ears; a song about this old place? I almost 
blushed. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out people had started moving to L.A., and particularly to the 
Valley, in unbelievable numbers. There were whole industries catering to the 
newcomers. At Christmas, a company called Mission Pak would send boxes of 
exotic California fruit to your friends and relatives back East -- gloating 
souvenirs from the land without snow. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, there was a terrific housing shortage, and at one time an 
estimated 162,000 families were living in tents, garages and other makeshift 
dwellings. A poor family whose kids always had the sniffles moved into a 
converted chicken coop down the block from us. The city lumbered into action 
and maintained some Quonset huts left over from the war as cheap public 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem solved itself with amazing speed. Instead of going into a 
tailspin, as experts had predicted, L.A. started building houses at a dazzling 
pace. To me, the smell of the late '40s is a combination of pine, gravel and 
plaster. And what strange houses they were! One-story stucco houses without 
fireplaces, the kitchen counters topped with Formica in a peculiar pattern of 
tiny boomerangs. And all these little tract houses were advertised as "estates" 
or "ranchos" or "villas." 
</P>
<P>
For years on end, we were told the Valley was the fastest-growing place on 
earth. The flood of newcomers diluted the rural quality of Van Nuys. By the 
time I was in junior high, it was considered a stylish insult to call somebody 
a "dumb farmer." Even so, in the late '50s, Van Nuys High School still made a 
great fuss over its senior classes, a tradition from the days when few, if any, 
of its graduates went on to college. 
</P>
<P>
There was an industrial boom, too. Overnight, there were businesses everywhere, 
at first small, hopeful, undercapitalized places, and then major manufacturing. 
The words prices slightly higher west of the Rockies started disappearing from 
advertisements. The vacant land north of the Southern Pacific tracks, where my 
sister and I used to pick cattails, became the General Motors plant and called 
into being a place called Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Television finished off the isolated quality of the Valley. The big year was 
1949, when the number of TV sets in Los Angeles went from 80,000 to 354,000. By 
1951, when I was 10, if your family didn't have a set, you really couldn't get 
away with the excuse "we're waiting for color," and your parents finally had to 
buy one. This introduced you to the ordeal of doing without TV whenever your 
set was being repaired; there were no transistors yet, and a tube would blow 
every couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't any satellite transmission, of course, so apart from some fuzzy 
recordings from New York called kinescopes, most of the programming originated 
locally. We were shocked when we finally saw "Howdy Doody," the New York 
children's show. How lame and patronizing it was compared with our own "Time 
for Beanie," the work of a bunch of hotshots straight from the Warner Bros. 
cartoon factory! I figured New Yorkers must be a bunch of dumb farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, television undermined Hollywood's position as the center of the 
universe by siphoning off the general-interest audience that had been the 
mainstay of the old studios. Of course, by that time, Hollywood was already 
deglamorized for us -- it was just that place over Cahuenga Pass, and we 
accepted the presence of show people in our midst quite casually. Across the 
street from the Crystal Plunge, where if you went swimming too often your hair 
would turn green from the chlorine in the water, lived the comic cowboy actor 
Andy Devine, the "unofficial mayor of Van Nuys"; his son went to public schools 
with us. Jane Russell's family lived down at the end of my street, and later 
on, band leader Frank DeVol lived there, too. His daughter went to Fulton 
Junior High, so he wrote the school song for it. 
</P>
<P>
Even after TV, we went to the movies a couple of times a week, either to the 
Fox or the Bijou (I forget which one we called the Flea Bag). We were pretty 
blase about them, though. I had a friend whose father worked for a cartoon 
studio, and he would loftily critique the animation in the "Superman" serial as 
we watched. After a while, his family suddenly disappeared from sight, and we 
heard they'd been found out as Communists. 
</P>
<P>
My father worked downtown, which meant about an hour's commute for him. Then 
came the freeways; for years we saw maps with dotted lines that indicated where 
freeways were going to go. First came a short patch over Cahuenga Pass, and 
then, in spurts, the Ventura and San Diego freeways. Now my father could go to 
work without having to mess with surface streets, but it was still about an 
hour's commute. Everybody knowingly said the freeways were all obsolete as soon 
as they were built. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors Fletcher Bowron and Norris Poulson, who both looked like school 
principals to me, presided over a pretty placid time. Nearly all the issues 
revolved around the city's growth. The freeways: They were never built fast 
enough and were always too expensive. The Dodgers: Why, my father demanded, did 
he have to pay extra taxes to bring them here when he never watched baseball? 
</P>
<P>
And smog, which was much worse than it is today: Once or twice a year it was so 
bad that the schools would be closed. In the '50s, the County Air Pollution 
Control District didn't issue smog alerts, but it did measure what was in the 
air, and on the smoggiest day of 1955, it found an ozone level of 0.69. These 
days, they call a third-stage smog alert if the level ever gets above 0.50, 
something that hasn't happened in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, nobody was sure what caused smog. On Oct. 1, 1957, burning 
trash in a home incinerator became a crime, and everybody had to get an extra 
trash can just for non-combustible rubbish. The smog didn't go away, though 
particulate matter, which had sometimes been so bad that I saw strings of soot 
trailing from goldfish gills, got a lot better. At least the incinerator ban 
showed that the automobile was the chief culprit. 
</P>
<P>
The California car culture had been in bloom since the '40s. I remember my 
older brothers customizing a Model A Ford, tearing off the fenders and 
blowtorching the springs to lower the rear so that the car seemed to be leaping 
out of the road. By the '50s, cars were a full-fledged life style, and we all 
knew the cars to customize were old Mercs and '39 or '40 Fords. 
</P>
<P>
We '50s kids were more polished than the '40s kids with their wolf-whistle 
horns and loud "Hollywood" exhausts. We were into gorgeousness. We painted cars 
with flame designs or the fine outline patterns of a car painter named Von 
Dutch (both styles have long since been reduced to decals you can just stick 
on). We went to Tijuana to get plush "tuck and roll" upholstery. You had to 
remember to bring stout American thread for the workmen, or your upholstery job 
would come out after a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
By now, it was a teen-ager's right to spend most of his non-sleeping and 
non-school hours in his car. A lot of kids' social lives revolved around 
cruising Van Nuys Boulevard and hanging out at Bob's Big Boy or Curry's ice 
cream shop. The hope was that two guys in customized hot rods would challenge 
each other to a drag race. 
</P>
<P>
To many grown-ups, this obsession with cars and rock 'n' roll smelled of 
juvenile delinquency. There certainly were young hoods around, but their 
criminality was pretty mild. They weren't on drugs, and their most fearsome 
weapons were the switch-blade knife and occasionally a primitive, homemade zip 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Cars also made it possible for us to hit the beaches, where we discovered the 
car culture paralleled the surf culture, which was already a total way of life 
but as yet unknown to the rest of the country. A filmmaker named Bruce Brown 
was showing his home movies of surfing up and down the beach towns -- for 
instance, in the public shower room at San Clemente State Park. Eventually, 
he'd make feature films that would create a nationwide surf craze. My cousin 
was one of a number of Valley boys who thought of becoming professional 
surfboard makers. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the '50s, it was obvious that things were going to change even 
more. The first low-rise apartment building arose on my street. One of my 
teachers at Van Nuys High predicted commercial jet airplane flights, and 
another told about an amazing drug he'd tried, under doctor's orders, called 
LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this growth, we lost a lot of things, of course. Much of what we lost was 
what every small town loses when it becomes a city: a ready neighborliness and 
a certain amount of innocence. By the '60s, you'd have to have been crazy to 
leave your house or your car unlocked for very long, or to accept anybody's 
check without ID. We also lost a certain small-town attitude of local pride. 
For a long time, there was a famous rivalry between L.A. and San Francisco, but 
only San Francisco is interested in keeping it up. 
</P>
<P>
But nostalgia for that time is not for everybody. The population of Los Angeles 
today is five times what it was in 1940, and that means there are about 6 
million people living here to whom the '40s are dim or blank. Old-timers always 
tend to glamorize the past, too. The Red Car trolleys, for instance; I remember 
them as scary. You had to stand out in the middle of traffic to catch them, and 
sometimes people got hit. And Red Cars didn't go everywhere. If you were near 
one of the stops, they were a pretty good deal, but if you weren't, you really 
wanted a car. 
</P>
<P>
And while some things may not have changed -- GTE was notorious for bad service 
even 40 years ago; it's nickname was "Drip, Drip and Tinkle" -- much has 
improved. The people who complain that the Los Angeles River is a "cement scar 
in the landscape" just don't know what it was like before our waterways were 
tamed. Every time there was a big rain, the Pacoima Wash would overflow and 
stores on Van Nuys Boulevard would have to be sandbagged. 
</P>
<P>
This is the bottom line: I don't remember a single bookstore in Van Nuys in the 
'50s, and at the same time there was a restaurant that used the slogan "Tough 
Steaks and Dull Knives." Altogether, with all its faults, I prefer the present.
