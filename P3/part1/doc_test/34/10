<P>
Perhaps it is just coincidence that the simple title of "The Duane Michals 
Show" seems more fitting for a comedy hour than a 30-year museum retrospective 
of a noted New York photographer. 
</P>
<P>
But images of, say, Howdy Doody persist when faced with a blow-up self-portrait 
of Michals using his head and hands to make a shadow image of a duck on the 
wall behind him at the entrance to his show at the Museum of Photographic Arts 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Guileless and often goofy, Michals seems content to leave a first impression of 
himself as an entertainer in this first American survey of his work. But, as 
the wide selection of more than 200 black-and-white photographs quickly shows, 
Michals is much more. A mix of portraits and multi-image narratives with short 
written texts, this wonderful show combines humor with nostalgia, religious 
commentary, astute social observation and personal fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
A bluntness and modesty pervades this work, a simplicity that encourages each 
viewer to go further beyond the surface. To project and extrapolate. To be 
swept up in the nostalgia, without being trapped in sweetness. To keep an eye 
on the gimmick inherent to the medium, while still appreciating its enormous 
power. 
</P>
<P>
An early work sets the tone of surrealist quasi-religious symbolism and 
photographic manipulation that remains consistent throughout. "The Illuminated 
Man," 1968, shows a shadowy man whose head has been transformed into a 
featureless, glowing flash of light. "I Met God in the Subway," 1990 -- the 
latest here -- takes the same theme further: a man is shown riding the New York 
subway, his head lit from behind to look like a halo. Just below, the artist 
has written: "I met God in the subway/He looked like you and me/I asked which 
train went to Heaven/He said take number three./When I got off in Heaven/It 
looked like Union Square/Seems when you go to Heaven/You don't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Constantly questioning reality in art and in life, in both of these works 
Michals plays the mysterious powers of manipulation available to the 
photographer against the mysticism of religion. Calling himself a "lapsed 
Catholic," Michals has spoken often of his devoutly religious childhood. A 
sense of paradise lost governs much of his work, imbued with a nostalgia for 
the transcendent visions that can come through faith. 
</P>
<P>
There is a slightly mocking tone to such quasi-religious work, but it is dryly 
mixed with the possibility of optimism. That Heaven and Earth are equal, that 
death does not transcend life. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1932 in blue-collar McKeesport, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb that was also 
the birthplace of Andy Warhol, Michals has made many works that appear directly 
autobiographical. His unresolved relationship with his father is often a 
subject, among these one of the most subtle yet most poignant is the 1978 "Self 
Portrait Shaking Hands with My Father." 
</P>
<P>
In a barren room, the two men shake hands at the extreme right side of the 
photo, and the contrast between them is striking. The older man, slightly bent 
from age, wears a somewhat rumpled suit, a mark of formality that hides the 
fact that he is a retired factory worker. The younger Michals wears a dark 
turtleneck, casually formal as would befit an artist. In their handshake is the 
symbol of resolution, across what appears to be significant distance. An open 
door at the left of the picture appears as an escape route from these powerful 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Death comes up often in Michals' work, too, with a sense both of sorrow and 
curiosity yet never morbidity. Hamlet's Yorick, for example, is remembered in a 
memento mori picture of a young man holding a skull. Scrawled below in the 
artist's rough hand is a short poem "All things Mellow in the Mind . . ." about 
the brevity of life. "So Let's hold tight, and touch and feel," Michals wrote, 
"For this quick instant we are real." 
</P>
<P>
There are lighter moments, too, belying Michals's Pop background and his links 
to a post-modern real-life metaphysic that is similar to the work of artists 
such as John Baldessari and Edward Ruscha, among others. 
</P>
<P>
A group of exquisite celebrity portraits -- many of them originally commercial 
work done for magazines -- starts the show. Some are of well-known artists, 
including a rare pair of portraits of Joseph Cornell, as well as images of 
Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and Rene Magritte. Others are of movie and arts stars: 
Dennis Hopper lounging on the floor in a cigarette-smoke-filled room, Joe 
Dallesandro as a gargoyle on a New York rooftop, and a beautiful but apparently 
narcissistic Russian ballerina Ludmila Tscherina, who is shown just in the 
circular frame of a hand-held mirror in a photograph from 1964. 
</P>
<P>
And the narrative can be both sweet and borderline cute, like children's book 
illustrations: One well-known work shows a child who looks up at a coat and hat 
hanging on a rack, then falls asleep and dreams the bogey man has come to life. 
</P>
<P>
A series of forays into painting shows the artist painting on top of vintage 
photographs, obliterating the precious images of photographic masters with 
colorful childlike imagery. Here, Michals exhibits a bad-boy daring reminiscent 
of when Robert Rauchenberg erased a Willem DeKooning drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Michals's 1989 work, too, takes a tongue-in-cheek jab at the pretentions of 
photography: "There Are Nine Mistakes in This Photograph" shows a man reading 
an upside-down newspaper with an upside-down top hat on his head, sitting 
across a breakfast table from a blindfolded girl eating cake, among other 
foolishness. "Can you find them?" the picture teases. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, all of Michals' art seems immediately accessible. A renegade 
from the seriousness of both fine-art photography and photojournalism, Michals 
makes it all seem easy. But, again, there is more than meets the eye. Lighting 
and darkroom techniques often add enormous subtlety to the beauty of the 
prints. And the exact precision of the artist's language belies the labor 
behind both the poetry and the prose. 
</P>
<P>
And Michals is hardly blind to the potential impact of his work. "Someone Left 
a Message for You," 1974, shows a hand writing backward on a sheet of paper; 
the scrawled text revealed progressively over four photographs says "As you 
read this I am entering your mind." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding.
