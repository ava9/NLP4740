The Museum of Broadcasting's television festival at the County Museum of Art, 
which is about to have its sixth running, has become an important annual 
fixture. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's artful blending of past and present, nostalgia and current 
celebration, would be a hit in Syracuse or Minneapolis, but it goes down 
particularly well here, where a good deal of the product originated and where 
many of its creators live and can be persuaded to come along, take a bow and 
explain how the magic happened. 
</P>
<P>
This year's offerings begin on March 1 with a tribute to the television version 
of Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple," with its long-running stars Tony Randall and 
Jack Klugman on hand along with producer-director Garry Marshall and Harvey 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The festival ends on March 23 with an evening honoring Loretta Young and 
presenting two dramas from her anthology series, "The Pearl" and "The Prettiest 
Girl in Town." 
</P>
<P>
The rarities -- treasures amid the treasures -- include Stephen Sondheim's only 
original work for television, "Evening Primrose," a musical starring Anthony 
Perkins and set in a department store. It was broadcast in 1966 and has not 
been shown since. It's being presented on March 2 and introduced by Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Elliott and Audrey Meadows will host an evening of the splendidly foolish 
television work of Bob and Ray (March 9). Partner Ray Goulding, sadly, is 
seriously ailing and unable to attend. While the team and their innumerable 
voices were most at home on radio, their TV work had a wonderful innocent 
silliness, like Ray's cookery lessons as Mary Margaret McGoon, featuring 
recipes for half-baked Indian pudding and quince and kumquat jelly. 
</P>
<P>
The other archival treats include the Mary Martin "Annie Get Your Gun" from 
1957, to be introduced by her co-star, John Raitt, and the young Dennis Hopper 
in "The Last Summer," a Studio One drama from the '50s, with Hopper present. It 
screens March 17. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a tribute to "The Waltons" on March 10, with its creator Earl 
Hamner Jr. and many of the cast, Ellen Corby, Michael Learned and Richard 
Thomas among them, on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lemmon talks about his early life in television on March 18, and will 
present a Ford Theater production, "Marriageable Male," in which he co-starred 
with Ida Lupino. 
</P>
<P>
It's 35 years since Steve Allen invented -- or gave an enduring style to -- 
"The Tonight Show," and thereby established insomnia as a national trait. Allen 
and two of the show's vocalists -- Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme -- along with 
producers Bill Harbach, Dwight Hemion and Nick Vanoff and announcer Gene 
Rayburn will reminisce about those remarkable nights on March 3. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be three late-night offerings -- well, 10 p.m., not too late -- on 
March 4, 11 and 18, consisting of excerpts from the early television writing 
and performing of Woody Allen. One of the pleasures is a Kraft Theater Music 
Hall special called "Woody Allen Looks at 1967." 
</P>
<P>
The present-day series to be honored are equally interesting, and range from 
"The Wonder Years" (March 4) to "Family Ties" (March 22). Michael J. Fox and 
most of the other principals will be present, along with creator Gary David 
Goldberg, for that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Stephen J. Cannell will host an evening with "Wiseguy" on March 11. 
All the Golden Girls are scheduled to attend an evening devoted to their show 
on March 15. Garry Shandling will present two episodes of his show the next 
evening (Mar. 16), and Candice Bergen and a large number of the creators and 
co-stars of "Murphy Brown" will appear on March 21. It's the newest of the 
television offerings to be honored. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Broadcasting has become an important and accessible archive of 
the radio and television past. What it does at its year-round presentations in 
New York and at the festival here is offer reminders that there were always a 
goodly number of oases in the wasteland, and that, like any art form, 
television has gained subtlety, sophistication and strength as time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
What is also true to say is that the museum rescues television from the curse 
of its own terrible transience. Out of sight is not out of mind and, for 
another evening at least, the delights are back in sight.
