Captains and Clowns: Captain Kangaroo has a new command. Bob Keeshan, who has 
played the role of the captain for 35 years, will serve as honorary chairman of 
the Clown Hall of Fame and Research Center in its drive to raise $250,000 for a 
new headquarters in Delavan, Wis. Keeshan joined Red Skelton, Emmett Kelly Sr. 
and Larry Harmon, creator of Bozo the Clown, earlier this year when he was 
inducted into the Hall of Fame for his work as the original Clarabell the Clown 
on "Howdy Doody." CLAUDIA PUIG
