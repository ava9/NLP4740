HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE FAMILY THAT WATCHES TOGETHER . . . ;

He sank into the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Jerzy Kosinski describes the protagonist in "Being There," his 
novel about the darkly humorous rise in stature of a dull-witted, illiterate 
man named Chance who spends half his time gardening, the other half watching 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Less a couch potato than a couch sponge, Chance absorbs everything on the 
screen, becoming whatever is before him, changing himself by changing channels. 
His brain contains no thoughts, only impressions. For Chance: 
</P>
<P>
"The set created its own light, its own color, its own time. It did not follow 
the law of gravity that forever bent all plants downward. Everything on TV was 
tangled and mixed and yet smoothed out: night and day, big and small, tough and 
brittle, soft and rough, hot and cold, far and near." 
</P>
<P>
Chance is not us, not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is something ominously familiar about him, for as we enter the 
'90s, we can honestly say that just about all of America is sinking into the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
The A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates that Americans average four hours daily -- 
perhaps two-thirds of their leisure time, not counting weekends -- in front of 
the TV set. And with the coming global expansion of cable, the rest of the 
world may soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Just what this means we may not know until it's too late to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some dark implications in "Avalon," Barry Levinson's 
just-released semi-autobiographical movie about his family and upbringing in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
This is not his first movie to touch on TV. There are comic references to TV in 
both "Diner" and "Tin Men," each in a small way suggesting the intimacy of the 
medium and the way it weaves itself through our lives, becoming our common 
folkore. And the severely autistic Raymond in "Rain Man" simply cannot get 
through a day without watching "People's Court," indicating that TV can be 
experienced without really being experienced. 
</P>
<P>
For a grimmer view, however, try "Avalon." It's not only an intriguing story 
about the dissolution of a family, but an instructive one for those Americans 
-- now the majority -- whose entire lives are spanned by TV. Just how much has 
TV changed our lives? 
</P>
<P>
Levinson provides a before and after. 
</P>
<P>
Although the movie's cultural and generational conflicts flow from the 1914 
arrival in America of a character based on Levinson's Russian-immigrant 
grandfather, "Avalon" takes place mostly in the 1950s, evolving simultaneously 
with the evolution of TV. Although this heartfelt homage to Levinson's 
childhood is hardly about TV, he uses TV as a roadmap and makes it responsible, 
along with suburbia, for breaking up this eclectic clan of Krichinskys. 
</P>
<P>
At first the references are humorous. 
</P>
<P>
There is that day all families of the era recall: The first TV set is purchased 
and positioned against a living room wall where it can be revered. The occasion 
of The First Set is so epic for the Krichinskys that the entire extended family 
squeezes together in front of the brown console and stares vacantly at a 
black-and-white test pattern, as if waiting for a curtain to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, the flickering pictures and sounds from TV -- from Howdy Doody to 
"Studio One" to ancient movie cartoons shifted to the small screen -- become 
the family's constant background buzz. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately moving to the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
At one point a squabble ends abruptly when everyone flies to the set upon 
hearing the familiar opening for Milton Berle's "Texaco Star Theatre": "Oh, 
we're the men of Texaco, we work from Maine to Mexico. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
TV now looms larger and larger. 
</P>
<P>
The Krichinsky family that ate together had always talked together. These 
weren't profound discussions about literature, politics or the great issues of 
the day. But at the very least this circle of chattering and bickering was a 
way of communicating, what the grandfather terms "dinner talk." 
</P>
<P>
However, "dinner talk" vanishes as the years go by, and later we see the family 
silently taking their meals on TV tables, glazed eyes fixed on the screen, 
chattering and bickering now coming only from the set. 
</P>
<P>
An especially devastating metaphor comes still later, when someone is seated in 
a darkened room, seemingly unaware that off to the side a TV set is turned on 
and that the picture is mostly static. More of the constant buzz. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather in "Avalon" is an oral historian, mesmerizing children with 
stories of earlier times, of coming to America on the Fourth of July and being 
dazzled by the fireworks, of meeting his wife and making his way in Baltimore 
with his brothers in the paperhanging business, of living in the old 
neighborhood, of trying to assimilate into a culture he never fully 
understands. 
</P>
<P>
One generation learning from another. But in an age when TV fractures the 
attention spans of its viewers, few children have the time or patience for such 
stories of family history. Now it's TV that mesmerizes them.
