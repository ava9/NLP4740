A year ago DIC Enterprises-a major producer of children's programming- ran an 
ad in the Hollywood Reporter headlined "Open Letter to the Acting Community." 
DIC and the Turner Broadcasting System were looking for major celebrities to do 
the voices and live-action tags for Ted Turner's new animated environmental 
action-adventure series, "Captain Planet and the Planeteers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of an open invitation," said co-creator and co-executive producer 
Barbara Y.E. Pyle, vice president of environmental policy at TBS SuperStation. 
"The first person to pop out was Tom Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
But when Cruise's "Days of Thunder" schedule conflicted with "Captain Planet," 
the actor popped out. But other performers-including Sting, Whoopi Goldberg, 
Meg Ryan, Tim Curry, Ed Asner, Dean Stockwell and James Coburn-found the time 
to commit to the series, which premieres Sept. 15 on KTTV at 10 a.m. and Sept. 
16 on TBS at 5:35 a.m. and 2:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain Planet" isn't the only star-studded fall series geared for the 2- to 
11-year-old crowd. Steven Spielberg, Roseanne Barr, Robert Klein, Howie Mandel, 
New Kids on the Block, George Carlin and Rick Moranis are just a few of the 
many personalities working on new children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
John Ratzenberger, mailman Cliff on "Cheers," is the voice of polluter Rigger 
on "Captain Planet." He answered the ad the day it ran. "I started being an 
environmentalist in 1967," he said. "I lived in Connecticut and wrote an angry 
letter to my congressman about pollution and wondered why I couldn't swim in 
the same river my father and grandfather had." Ratzenberger has seen the first 
two episodes of the series. "My son just loves 'Captain Planet,' " he said. "He 
doesn't know I am in it; he's only 3. But he's really interested in it." 
</P>
<P>
"The show is remarkable because it does challenge children," said LeVar Burton, 
whose voice is Kwame, one of the Planeteers. "The children are going to be 
responsible for the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg is the voice of Gaia-Mother Earth. "It's important to me that 
children are given interesting information in an entertaining fashion," she 
said. "I want kids to know that they can make a difference-regardless of race, 
creed or color." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg also is set to do two specials for cable's Nickelodeon. The first, 
"Hot Rod Brown, Class Clown," airs in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big fan of Nickelodeon's programming," she said. "They've given me three 
'Kid's Choice' awards, which means a lot because it comes from kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Whoopi wanted to meet us," said Geoffrey Darby, senior vice president of 
programming for Nickelodeon. "She likes what we do on the air. Her idea is 
develop (the specials) into 'Tales from the Whoop' and introduce them." David 
Lynch's Propaganda Films also has found a home at Nick. Last month Nick aired 
its "Salute Your Shorts," a live-action comedy special set in a summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the people at Nickelodeon) are very much on the edge," said Matt Loze, 
executive producer at Propaganda. "They are willing to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Duvall, who produced Showtime's "Faerie Tale Theatre," is producing 
three specials for Nick called "Stories from Growing Up." Celebrities will take 
part in a re-enactment of a special moment in their lives. For example, 
Roseanne Barr's first date; Billy Crystal's bar mitzvah. . The first is set to 
air in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do children's programming the entire family can enjoy," said Duvall. 
"Programming that doesn't condescend." 
</P>
<P>
Barr created ABC's "Little Rosey," premiering Saturday at 11 a.m., which 
chronicles the adventures of a 10-year-old Roseanne Barr, she said, because a 
lot of her fans are kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it for them," she said. "I love animation still. It's the most 
compelling thing to watch. Being a mom, I wanted to do a show about 
imagination." Though Barr is overseeing the scripts, she is not doing the voice 
of Rosey. 
</P>
<P>
"She came to us sometime last October," said Jennie Trias, vice president of 
children's programming at ABC Entertainment. "We were happy with the concept." 
Carol Rosen, director of original programming at HBO, approached comedian 
Robert Klein to kick off its new series "HBO Storybook Musicals," premiering 
Sept. 10 at 7 p.m. He adapted, narrates and sings the classic "Mike Mulligan 
and His Steam Shovel." 
</P>
<P>
"He is a wonderful storyteller and a lovely singer," said Rosen. "(He) has a 
young boy, and I asked him if he would like to see this book made into a 
program for children." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the idea," said Klein. "I read the book to my son. I adapted it along 
with animator (and producer) Michael Sporn. I think having a child makes me 
more interested in doing this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Loesch, president of Fox children's programming, gave the green light 
to "Bobby's World," an animated series based on "Baby Bobby," a 4-year-old 
character in comic Howie Mandel's act. The series, which premieres Saturday at 
7 a.m., will look at the world through little Bobby's eyes. "He's a very 
talented guy and has this vision," said Loesch of Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
"I will do the voice of Bobby and will play his father in live-action," said 
Mandel, who did voices for "The Muppet Babies" and "Gremlins." "My two kids can 
be with dad (on Saturday mornings) and I don't even have to get up (to watch TV 
with them)." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg is the mastermind behind Warner Bros.' new weekday syndicated 
cartoon series "Tiny Toon Adventures," premiering the week of Sept. 17 on KTTV. 
"We wanted to create a new group of characters that reflected the essence of 
the old Warners characters," said Jean MacCurdy, general vice president and 
general manager of Warner Bros. animation. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg isn't just lending his name to the project. He is extremely involved 
in his role as executive producer. "Steven has been reading all the scripts and 
going to the storyboard meetings and has looked at all the rough cuts" 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities are being used for children's shows because of the competition for 
their attention: regular TV, cable, home video and video games. 
</P>
<P>
"(Those media are) taking an audience already shrinking and dividing it up in a 
number of different ways," said Phyllis Tucker Vinson, vice president of 
children and family programming for NBC. "We go to (celebrities) and convince 
them to get involved. Rick Moranis (whose voice and image appear in "Rick 
Moranis in Gravedale High") is a good example. He has proven to be popular with 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Familiar movie titles also help lure young viewers. CBS is adding the animated 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," premiering Sept. 15 at 8 a.m., to its lineup, 
as well as an animated version of the 1989 hit film "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventure," beginning Sept. 15 at 10 a.m. Fox has animated the cult film 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," which kicks off Saturday at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Price, vice president of children's programs and daytime specials at CBS 
Entertainment, said she insisted to the producers that Keanu Reeves, Alex 
Winter and George Carlin reprise their roles in "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventures." 
</P>
<P>
"They bring a whole degree of credibility to the project," she said. Fox also 
called on John Astin to repeat his movie role of the evil Dr. Gangrene in 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Many years ago in New York, I did voices and cartoons," he said. "As my career 
developed I sort of dropped that part of my work. I kind of re-oiled those 
gears to do the voice. I am having a great time."
