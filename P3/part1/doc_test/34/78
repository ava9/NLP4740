Looking for something different this Halloween? You can probably find it on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, dog owners have a chance today to take the pooch out on the town 
and show him (or her) off in the Rude Dog Halloween Contest at Odyssey Video in 
Venice. Those rude dogs bold enough to enter will be judged on personality, 
costume and tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rude is an attitude," said Kim Sakaguchi of Odyssey Video, explaining what 
judges will be looking for. "A Rude Dog means it's cool, radical and totally 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Sakaguchi said judges for the Rude Dog costume contest will include actors who 
provide voices for characters on the "Rude Dog" TV cartoon show. The 
first-place prize will be a large, stuffed Rude Dog, with hats and cups among a 
host of other prizes. A $5 entry fee is required for the contest, which will 
take place from 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For those looking for something for the whole family, a pumpkin-carving session 
and reading of scary stories will take place at the Westside Arts Center from 
3:30 to 6 p.m. today. Professional storyteller Kathleen Zundell will use 
puppets and musical instruments to tell children ages 3-6 some slightly scary 
stories. She will then entertain the older crowd with a few really scary tales. 
</P>
<P>
The center has 250 pumpkins to share and is hoping for a big turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a free-for-all," said Jane Greenberg, assistant program director. "There 
is no prize because we're not into the competitive side of creating art, but 
older kids should like it." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, those sophisticated mavericks searching for an 
out-of-the-ordinary Halloween experience can find the "Phantom" of the Marina 
Market Place filling the night air with organ music. The mysterious Phantom 
will perform haunting classical melodies by Bach from 5 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at the Villa Marina Center, Elvira, Jason and Freddy Kreuger 
look-alikes will be be handing out Halloween bags of goodies along with safety 
tips and coloring books from 3 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza will celebrate its second annual Safe 
Halloween Party from 5 to 8 p.m. in the Bradley Court. Other events on 
Wednesday include a host of carnivals at various recreation centers. 
</P>
<P>
Penmar Recreation Center will have a haunted house and carnival from 6 to 9 
p.m. Prizes will be awarded for a costume contest for children ages 5-8. 
Various games also will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood Recreation Center hosts a carnival and costume contest from 4 to 7 p.m. 
for ages 6-12. Food and prizes will be available. And for children 14 and 
under, there is a carnival from 5:30 to 9 p.m. at Santa Monica Airport in the 
Barker Hangar. The Santa Monica Cultural and Recreation Services Department
