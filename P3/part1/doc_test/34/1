If NBC is successful, the old "Howdy Doody Show" will be resurrected -- with 
David Letterman involved. No, the late-night TV host -- who bears something of 
a resemblance to the gap-toothed cowboy marionette of TV legend -- would not 
play Howdy. 
</P>
<P>
He's been approached to take over the role of host from Buffalo Bob Smith, NBC 
chief Brandon Tartikoff tells us. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had several conversations with David Letterman and his production 
staff about doing a new version of 'Howdy Doody' for Saturday mornings," 
Tartikoff says. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions are only at the talking stage; Letterman's representatives 
aren't commenting. 
</P>
<P>
If Letterman agrees, the network is considering the show for fall, 1991. The 
original show ran 1947 to 1960 on NBC, then was syndicated briefly in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "Howdy Doody" revival is part of Tartikoff's plan to beef up 
Saturday mornings at a time when network cartoon programs are steadily losing 
viewers to offerings from cable and independent stations. From Sharon Bernstein
