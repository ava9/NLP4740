"Do you believe? Oh please, please believe. If you believe, wherever you are, 
clap your hands and she'll hear you. Clap! Don't let Tink die. Clap! She's 
getting better. Clap! Clap! She's getting stronger. Oh, she's all well now. Oh 
thank you, thank you, thank you. . . ."

<P>
 -- From "Peter Pan" 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, a New York advertising executive and two NBC vice 
presidents have been doing a lot of believing, and a lot of hopeful clapping. 
</P>
<P>
What they wanted to bring back to life wasn't just Tinker Bell, but the 1960 
production of the musical "Peter Pan" starring Mary Martin which has not been 
televised for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like most children's stories, this one has a happy ending -- "Peter Pan" will 
fly again Friday on NBC (8-10 p.m.). But making it happen was a long, involved 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
When this production of "Peter Pan" first aired as a "spectacular," as specials 
were called in those days, it seemed a natural to become a TV perennial, like 
"The Wizard of Oz" and the traditional holiday classics. But after three more 
airings (1963, 1966 and 1973), it vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the general public perception was that perhaps the tape had 
been erased, or that if a tape did exist, it probably had deteriorated and was 
no longer of broadcast quality. The real reason, it turns out, was that "Peter 
Pan" was encumbered by a very complex set of copyrights, contracts and options 
that kept it off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Riesenberg, president of Maltese Productions/Maltese Video in New York 
City, became the prime mover in getting "Peter Pan" back on NBC after he took 
his wife and 3-year-old son to a screening of the show at a Museum of 
Broadcasting TV festival in New York in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The magic was still there," he said the other day, fondly remembering the show 
from his boyhood. "There were a lot of kids in the audience and they loved it. 
They were laughing and yelling, and I came out exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Riesenberg, who at the time was senior vice president, program 
development for the advertising agency BBDO, got on the telephone. He called 
his client, Campbell Soup Co., and received an OK to go after the rights. He 
called London and found that for the first time in many years, the rights were 
available. (Sir James M. Barrie left "Peter Pan" to a children's hospital so 
that profits from the story would benefit generations of children.) 
</P>
<P>
And he called Susan Beckett, vice president, business affairs, NBC Productions, 
and found "she too felt passionate about getting 'Peter Pan' shown again." 
Together, they started shepherding the complicated process of clearing up all 
the rights. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, NBC's "Peter Pan" tapes were unearthed from the network's 
storage vaults in the East and sent to NBC Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people here had to determine if the tapes were of broadcast quality," said 
Carl Meyer, vice president, West Coast and special program sales for NBC-TV, 
who had become the third player with Riesenberg and Beckett in the plan to 
rescue "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
"That was an important consideration before anybody started running down the 
track. We decided they were and that we could be very confident about putting 
the show on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Riesenberg, meanwhile, was in a legal morass because the rights and contracts 
seemed to be spread everywhere: composers, lyricists, director, talent, film 
studios, past advertisers, the children's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, it was as much a problem of sorting out who didn't have the 
rights as who did," Riesenberg said. "I soon saw that this was going to be a 
long and maybe expensive proposition, but Campbell said stick with it." 
(Campbell Soup has a one-quarter sponsorship of the telecast, with the balance 
picked up by others companies.) 
</P>
<P>
Some rights-holders had died, which meant estates and heirs had to be tracked 
down, further slowing the process and getting even more lawyers involved. 
Generally, Riesenberg said, everyone was cooperative and wanted "Peter Pan" to 
be shown again . . . "as long as it was handled correctly. Everyone was very 
protective of the show because it was very special to them." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
While the legal entanglements were being unraveled, Ed Ancona, then director of 
film and tape post production at NBC Burbank, was put to work on bringing the 
old tapes up to today's broadcasting standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two copies of the show which appeared to be dupes from the original 
master tape," Ancona related. However, they were on 2-inch tape, the dimension 
for TV in that era (now it's 1-inch and moving to 1/2-inch) and that posed 
another problem -- NBC no longer has a machine to play 2-inch tape. 
</P>
<P>
So Ancona, who has since retired, looked around "for someone who knew how to 
tickle and tune and massage an old 2-inch tape machine to get the best out of 
the 'Peter Pan' tapes." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Image Transform and Compact Video, the 2-inch tapes were 
transferred to one-inch and the new copy was put through a highly sophisticated 
digital device to correct the color balance and reduce snowy-picture noise. 
</P>
<P>
In viewing the old tapes, Ancona had noticed a dark bar on the left side of the 
picture caused by an old camera used for the telecast. "We were able to blow up 
the picture slightly to get rid of that. The old tapes also had a blue shadow, 
but we made it a much more neutral, shaper image. One way or another, it 
amounted to quite a housecleaning." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mary Martin, the original cockeyed optimist, she has always believed 
"Peter Pan" would come back. "I have wanted it, always," she said recently at 
her home in Rancho Mirage. "I like to think the world still has a Neverland 
somewhere that makes people want to be loved and have joy." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years of her career, Martin had often thought of playing "Peter Pan" 
but pretty much gave up on the idea after her friend, Jean Arthur, starred as 
"Peter" on Broadway in 1950. "I figured Jean's done it, and that's that," said 
Martin, who was in "South Pacific" at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwin Lester, director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, also had long 
dreamed of producing "Peter Pan" -- with Martin -- and in 1954 signed her to 
star in a new musical version that would be directed and choreographed by 
Jerome Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her we'd play 10 weeks in California (split between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco) and then it would be her option to take it to New York afterward," 
recalled Lester, who is now 94 and still maintains an office at the Music 
Center. (On his office wall is a painting of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by 
Martin, rimmed with tiny figures of the roles she played for Lester over the 
years, including "Peter Pan," "South Pacific" and "Annie Get Your Gun.") 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Pan" did go on to Broadway in October, 1954, after its run at the 
Philharmonic Auditorium here. Not long after its New York opening, Lester 
recalled, NBC contacted Martin's husband, producer Richard Halliday, proposing 
that it be shown on television -- the first time a stage hit was moved intact 
from Broadway to TV. 
</P>
<P>
A record-breaking 65 million viewers watched that live black-and-white telecast 
on March 7, 1955, and it was so acclaimed that Martin played Peter again for 
NBC the following January. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, while she was starring in "The Sound of Music" on Broadway, she was 
asked to perform "Peter Pan" on television for the third time. In an interview 
printed in The Times that year, she talked about the backbreaking schedule of 
doing those two shows simultaneously: "It's hard work, but it is sheer joy. 
Since we last did 'Peter Pan' on television in 1956, the mail has never stopped 
coming in asking that we do it again. Now that it is being put on tape, it will 
be a permanent treasure and I hope it will be shown every year." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is 1989, and 29 years have passed since she did the telecast that she 
hoped would be on each year. On a recent Saturday afternoon, dressed head to 
toe in "Peter Pan" green and sitting in the comfortable living room of her 
home, Martin, now 75 and looking every bit as youthful as "Peter Pan," said the 
mail is still coming in after all these years. People she meets everywhere 
still remember how she taught them to crow and made them want to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who ever read the Barrie play is a fan," she said. "Barrie had this 
dream of perpetual childhood. He didn't want anyone to grow up, and that 
intrigues certain kinds of people . . . I happen to be one of them. I'm still 
not real grown up," she said with a bit of a Texas drawl and smiling brightly. 
</P>
<P>
So now that Riesenberg (himself once one of the Lost Boys in a junior high 
school production of "Peter Pan" -- "Wendy was my first date") along with 
Beckett and Meyer have rescued "Peter Pan," will it become a perennial? What 
kind of rating must it attract for NBC to order more airings? 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't put a projected rating on this," Meyer said. "We have to wait and 
see the overall reaction . . . from the public, from the television press. 
We're all so prejudiced about the production. . . . The mechanics are in place 
for subsequent airings. We would just follow through if reaction warrants it." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, echoed that answer: "It's 
not a pure numbers thing. We want to get a sense of how appreciated it is by 
the audience from people who write and call." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff added some thoughts on why no one tried to get "Peter Pan" back on 
the air before this. "A 1970s version with Mia Farrow did not perform very well 
and there was no impetus to show 'Peter Pan' again at that time," he said. "But 
now we're at the end of the '80s and we realize what a nugget we have" in the 
Mary Martin production. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the show as a child. And for me, it's a real joy to use this job to 
bring back to TV what I remember as a magical experience." 
</P>
<P>
In Meyer's view, the long months involved in getting the show on the air 
represent "a labor of love for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riesenberg: "This has been an obsession. It's the parents -- all of us 
that remember it -- who want our kids to see it so badly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beckett: "For years, my kids thought all I did at NBC was work on 'Peter 
Pan.' I'm finally vindicated."
