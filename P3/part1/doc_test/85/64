  [Excerpt] A team comprising five U.S. experts is currently 
visiting Islamabad. These experts are the representatives of 
the U.S. agency which oversees arms control and nuclear 
nonproliferation matters. Their duties include, among other 
things, providing necessary information and advice to the U.S. 
secretary of state. During its talks with the Pakistani 
authorities, the U.S. team will discuss when and how the next 
step for rolling back Pakistan's nuclear program will be taken 
and what method needs to be adopted to verify Pakistan's 
compliance with the commitment it will make in this context. 
Pakistan's former caretaker Prime Minister Dr. Moin Qureshi 
announced on 24 September 1993 that Islamabad had frozen its 
nuclear program. After this announcement, the U.S. State 
Department issued a statement, saying that Washington is 
strongly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and 
the governments of the South Asian countries have been asked to 
halt their nuclear programs forthwith and eventually destroy all 
their weapons of mass annihilation. The U.S. Government also 
wants to settle all stages of rolling back Pakistan's nuclear 
program in a manner which could ensure the continued 
verification of the fact that Islamabad is winding up its 
nuclear program. The aforementioned U.S. experts, currently in 
Islamabad, would probably also like to know and see how far 
Washington's instructions have been complied with, when and how 
the next steps will be taken, and in what ways Washington can 
feel assured in this regard. 
  A U.S. aircraft has remained parked at the Chaklala airport 
in Rawalpindi since 5 January 1994. This is the plane that 
brought to Pakistan a troop of 150 U.S. military commandos who 
have apparently been sent to conduct joint exercises with the 
Pakistani Army commandos. Most of these exercises have been 
held in the Cherat region, where the headquarters of the 
Pakistani Army commandos is located. Recently, a letter was 
published in a Pakistani daily, in which the writer stated that 
the geographical features of Cherat region are largely similar 
to those of the Kahuta area, where Pakistan's nuclear laboratory 
is located, and which the U.S. has been eyeing. The writer of 
that letter had asked whether the U.S. commandos' exercise in 
the Cherat region is not a prelude to preparations for action 
against the Kahuta laboratory. The U.S. plane now standing at 
the Chaklala airport is called MC130-H in air force jargon and 
is equipped with very sensitive equipment for photography. This 
equipment includes the capability of carrying out the most 
sophisticated spying work. With the help of this equipment, the 
aircraft can prepare any maps that are desired and freeze a 
radar system. Even total darkness cannot hamper its work. 
According to a published report, this U.S. reconnaissance plane 
has flown several times over Pakistan's northern areas, 
especially over Chitral, Swat, Chilas, Gilgit, Skardu, and 
Deosai, since 5 January 1994. The U.S. possesses only four 
planes of this type. The cost of each of these aircraft is 
stated to be $96 million. During the rule of late President 
Field Marshal Ayub Khan, the United States was allowed to 
establish a base at (Badaber) near Peshawar to carry out aerial 
espionage against the former Soviet Union. The U.S. U-2 spy 
planes used to fly from this Pakistani base into the Soviet 
airspace. The Russians shot down one of these U-2 spy planes. 
After his arrest, the U.S. pilot of that spy plane confirmed the 
presence of a U.S. espionage base on Pakistani soil. Durrani, a 
managing director of the Pakistan International Airlines [PIA], 
was accused of cooperating with the United States in installing 
spying equipment on a PIA plane that used to fly over the 
People's Republic of China. That incident took place during the 
rule of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. During the regime of President 
General Mohammad Ziaul Haq, the U.S.' CIA was given the facility 
to set up a base in Pakistan's northern areas to fight with the 
Soviet Union in Afghanistan and in that way Pakistan was turned 
into the biggest CIA base. Now, the presence of the 
aforementioned U.S. spy plane at Chaklala airport in Rawalpindi 
and its activities tend to indicate that the U.S. has been given 
a free hand to use Pakistani soil to carry out spying on 
Pakistan itself, and the valiant United States has been making 
full use of this freedom. [passage omitted on Kashmir-related
