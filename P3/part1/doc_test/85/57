  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has said 
Pakistan and the United States are entering a new phase of their 
relationship. Inaugurating a seminar on Pakistan's Foreign 
Policy Achievements in Islamabad today, the foreign minister 
said Pakistan-U.S. relations were marred due to the unjust 
Pressler Amendment. Both Pakistan and the United States have 
recognized Pressler Amendment as a bad law. He said the United 
States is not attempting to roll back Pakistan's nuclear program 
on a unilateral basis. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said soon after 
the assumption of office, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, embarked upon a program to end Pakistan's diplomatic 
isolation. She undertook measures to restore Pakistan's image 
as a modern, democratic, and forward-looking state committed to 
promotion and protection of human rights and desirous of 
building tension-free relations with all countries, especially 
its neighbors.
