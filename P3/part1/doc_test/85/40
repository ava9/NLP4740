  [Text] Pakistan has decided to temporarily recall all 
diplomatic and other personnel from its embassy in Kabul. The 
decision was made after miscreants attacked Pakistan's embassy 
in the Afghan capital on 23 February. The Pakistani consulates 
at Mazar-e Sharif, Qandahar, and Jalalabad will continue to 
function as usual. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan told a 
Radio Pakistan representative in Islamabad last night that 
Pakistani diplomatic and other personnel have already left Kabul 
for home. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who made a brief 
visit to Kabul to hold meetings with Afghan leaders on the 
establishment of peace in Afghanistan, met President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani yesterday. He apprised the Afghan president of 
Pakistan's decision to temporarily recall its diplomatic 
personnel. The Afghan president was told that the embassy 
building is now unfit for use, and the diplomatic staff can only 
fulfill their duties when arrangements are made for a suitable 
building and their security is guaranteed. 
  Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, who is actually in control of 
Kabul, has expressed his deep grief and anguish over the 
incident. 
  Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has expressed his 
regret 
over the attack on the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul by some 
irresponsible people. In a message to President Farooq Ahmad 
Khan Leghari, he said the attack was probably the work of vested 
interests that want to harm the brotherly relations between the 
two countries. President Rabbani said these relations have been 
further strengthened by the assistance extended by Pakistan 
during the Afghan war against foreign aggression. He 
particularly thanked Pakistan for providing shelter to hundreds 
of thousands of Afghans during this period. Meanwhile, speaking 
to APP in Kabul, the Afghan president said he has ordered an 
inquiry into the incident, adding that those responsible will be 
punished. 
  Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, accompanied by the Pakistani 
foreign minister, visited the Pakistani Embassy to assess the 
damage. Meanwhile, seven rockets landed in the Afghan capital of 
Kabul yesterday. At least six people were reported killed and 
10 injured.
