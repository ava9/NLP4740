  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto have greeted President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar on the occasion 
of the Islamic Revolution Day of Afghanistan. The president in 
his message said the people of Pakistan are proud that they 
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their Afghan brethren in the 
difficult time of jihad. They are, however, deeply saddened that 
the fighting in Afghanistan continues. He appealed to the 
Afghan president to jointly take appropriate steps with other 
Afghan leaders so that a cease-fire is enforced immediately and 
the process of conciliation restarted. 
  The prime minister in her message to Engineer Golboddin 
Hekmatyar said that the people of Pakistan are concerned with 
the continued fighting in Afghanistan, which is depriving them 
of the fruits of jihad. She called on the Afghan prime minister 
and other Afghan leaders to settle their differences politically 
by being flexible in approach and contemplation so that peace 
and stability are restored. She assured Pakistan's total support 
and cooperation in this respect.
