  [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
has declared India the greatest democracy in the world while 
paying tribute to India. He said that it is the leader of this 
region because of its democratic traditions, size, and 
stability. He said that India is the strongest candidate to 
become a member of the UN Security Council. Mr. Talbott was 
addressing a press conference on Friday in Delhi after talking 
with the Indian government. Mr. Talbott assured the Indian 
government that F-16 fighter planes will be supplied to Pakistan 
only after Pakistan stops production of nuclear weapons and 
provides assurance to freeze its nuclear program. He said that 
both India and Pakistan are suspicious of American efforts and 
are refusing to sign the NPT. He said that the Kashmir issue 
could ignite a destructive war between the two countries and 
that is why the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
was getting most of U.S. attention. He said that both countries 
should resolve the Kashmir issue by holding bilateral talks 
according to the Shimla pact. He made it clear that the United 
States was not favoring Pakistan. 
  Mr. Strobe Talbott is not only the deputy secretary of 
state, 
he is also an expert on policies on weapons reduction. He was 
not very successful in his mission in India because India 
refused to cooperate in any plan for weapons reduction or 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. After several days talks 
with the ministers and the prime minister, the U.S. deputy 
secretary of state has unilaterally put the whole pressure on 
Pakistan. However, the Pakistan Air Force has already lost 
interest in F-16 fighter planes and is busy looking at fighter 
planes in other countries. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has 
hinted that Pakistan does not need F-16 planes. Both the 
president and the prime minister have loudly declared that 
Pakistan's nuclear program will not be frozen. The Pakistani 
government let this stand be known when Mr. Talbott was holding 
his press conference in New Delhi. This was a psychological 
pressure and the Pakistani government neutralized it. The U.S. 
deputy secretary's announcement about getting a certificate from 
Pakistani government promising to cap its nuclear program is 
equivalent to our opening up our nuclear installations for 
inspection. Since Pakistan has announced that it is not 
interested in F-16 fighter planes, the demand for inspecting the 
nuclear installations has become ineffective. However, Mr. 
Talbott continued to increase this psychological pressure and 
announced the desire to make India a member of the Security 
Council. He advocated inclusion of Germany and Japan in the 
Security Council in his press conference and declared India to 
be the best candidate for membership to the Security Council. 
Mr. Talbott's has tried to create a soft spot for the United 
States in the Indian mind. As the result of it, the Indian prime 
minister has accepted the U.S. invitation to visit the United 
States. At the same time, the United States has used this 
strategy to put additional pressure on Pakistan. The goal of all 
this is to make India the "police inspector" of South Asia and 
to stop Pakistan from its defense preparations. 
  Pakistan should not take time to understand what is hidden 
in 
this new U.S. strategy because India's inclusion in the Security 
Council is absolutely dangerous for Pakistan. The United States 
used this psychological weapon against Pakistan. However, 
Pakistan should not forget the fact that if the United States 
wants to appoint India the custodian of its interests in this 
region, Pakistan will not change its policies even when it 
accepts all U.S. conditions with its eyes closed. Even if the 
United States has said this is just to placate India, its 
pressure on Pakistan's policies will continue. These lines are 
being written at a time when two U.S. deputy secretaries of 
state--Mr. Talbott and Ms. Raphel--are busy in negotiations in 
Islamabad. General Abdul Waheed, Pakistan army chief, has 
returned to London after his talks in Washington and is on his 
way home. During the last few months, there have been several 
rounds of talks on security of this region. However, the present 
talks are being called final. It is important to mention here 
that before the recent round of talks between Pakistan and the 
United States, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President 
Farooq Leghari have expressed the government's definite stand 
that neither our nuclear program will be capped nor our national 
interests will be compromised. The government has dropped its 
unusual interest in acquiring F-16 fighter planes. Despite this 
all, the Pakistani government should keep a close eye on the new 
changes that have occurred in relations among Pakistan, India, 
and the United States.
