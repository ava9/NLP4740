  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
Pakistan's relations with the United States are not confined to 
one direction, but covered a large area and must be viewed in 
their full complexity. Talking to APP [Associated Press of 
Pakistan] in London before his departure for the United States, 
he denied that relations between Pakistan and America have 
suffered any setback. He said some people viewed relations only 
in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. Pakistan, in this 
context, has made it clear that it supported the principle of 
ban on nuclear proliferation in the entire world, including the 
South Asian region. To say that only Pakistan should do it and 
India should not do it, is not acceptable to Pakistan. 
  Referring to his visit to the United States, he said he 
would 
hold talks at various levels covering foreign affairs, economy, 
and national security. He said he would also hold talks with 
officials of the IMF, exchange views with Congress House and 
Senate Committees, and a think tank on foreign affairs, besides 
meeting media organizations. 
  The president was seen off at the Heathrow Airport by a 
representative of the queen; the acting Pakistan high 
commissioner, Mr. Moeen Jan Nayim; officials at the High 
Commission; and members of Pakistan community.
