  [Text] Ms. Robin Raphael, the U. S. assistant secretary for 
South Asian affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to start 
negotiations with Pakistani government officials and political 
leaders. On her arrival in Pakistan on Sunday, she met with the 
acting President Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. Ms. Raphael's 
meeting with Benazir Bhutto is considered very important, and U. 
S. Ambassador John Minjo and Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Sheharyar Khan were also present at the meeting. It was learned 
that these talks began with discussion of India-Pakistan 
relations and the Kashmir problem. The United States had assured 
that it would support efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in 
the United Nations. Ms. Raphael said that the Kashmir issue 
would be resolved according to the UN resolutions. The United 
States had advised that the nuclear programs in South Asian 
countries be frozen, rolled back, and then destroyed. It was 
assured that no pressure would be put on any country 
unilaterally to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If 
what Ms. Raphael has said represents the Clinton 
administration's policy, then we should understand that U. S. 
policy on Pakistan is changing. 
  Pakistan and America have very old relations, and Pakistan 
still desires good relations. However, we cannot deny that it 
was the United States that brought about the coolness in the 
bilateral relations. It has always tried to take advantage of 
Pakistan's friendships through some agreements, and has never 
considered Pakistan's needs and interests. It is especially true 
when we had problems with India, and during trying times, the 
United States not only left Pakistan alone, but also took steps 
to benefit India. 
  In the context of the nuclear program, the U. S. policy 
seems 
to want to make India a powerful country in this region. Under 
the Pressler Amendment, military and economic aid to Pakistan 
has remained suspended. A few months ago, the United States 
threatened that it would declare Pakistan a terrorist nation 
just to please India. Therefore, believing that the United 
States has changed its policy over Kashmir's nuclear program and 
other issues could be premature. Since the United States itself 
is responsible for the tension and cool relations between the 
two countries, it should take the initiative in improving this 
relationship, and must provide facts to support its intentions.
