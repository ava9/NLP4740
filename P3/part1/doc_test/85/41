<F P=106> [Editorial: "Linking Kashmir and the Nuclear Issue"] </F>
  [Text] President Farooq Leghari, currently on a visit to 
the United States, has in an interview with Cable News Network 
(CNN) urged the U.S. to play a key role in resolving the Kashmir 
issue. He has, at the same time, sought to establish a linkage 
between Kashmir and the nuclear issue, which remains high on the 
U.S. agenda. However, the problem is that current U.S. policy 
favours dealing with the two issues separately. This was fairly 
evident from the observations of the U.S. deputy secretary of 
state after his recent visit to the subcontinent. 
  Kashmir, as far as the U.S. is concerned, is to be dealt 
with 
by India and Pakistan, bilaterally, under the terms of the Simla 
Agreement. This, of course, suits India which has successfully 
managed to avoid meaningful bilateral negotiations with Pakistan 
on the Kashmir issue for over two decades. At the same time, 
India has consistently turned down proposals for involving any 
third party in the matter and asserted, at times with a touch of 
the indignant, that the two neighbours were perfectly capable of 
resolving their own problems. However, it is clear that Pakistan 
now sees a third party role as unavoidable if India is to be 
pushed into addressing the Kashmir issue seriously and put an 
end to its efforts to resolve it through sheer brute force. 
Such a role would be far from unprecedented in the context of 
settling matters between the two countries. As President 
Leghari pointed out at another forum, the Indus Basin Treaty and 
the Runn of Kutch award were agreements reached on difficult 
issues only after third party intercession. 
  As for the nuclear issue, not only is the U.S. unwilling to 
link it with Kashmir, it also seems to be giving way to India's 
contention that the nuclear programmes of India and Pakistan 
cannot be treated on a par and should be dealt with separately 
by the United States. In effect, this means that the U.S. should 
continue to pressurise Pakistan through various means, such as 
the Pressler Amendment, while India continues developing its 
nuclear potential as well as missile technology. It may well be 
in this context that President Leghari has struck a tough note 
on the issue of inspection, of any kind, of nuclear sites. 
While a recent statement of the foreign minister made it seem 
as if Pakistan was willing to consider on merits a U.S. proposal 
for non-intrusive inspection, the president has now pointedly 
emphasised the aspect of linkage by asserting that Pakistan will 
accept inspection or verification regimes only in the context of 
a regional solution involving India. The U.S. may have logical 
grounds for believing that certain major issues pertaining to 
the subcontinent are more amenable to a solution, when dealt 
with separately, but if such a mode is seen to work to the 
advantage of only one party the other is bound to see linkage, 
at least in some areas, as unavoidable.
