  [Text] Describing his visit to the United States as 
satisfactory, the president [Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari] said it 
was timely and significant. The president, who returned to 
Islamabad today after this two-week visit to the United States 
and France was addressing a news conference at the Aiwan-i-Sadar 
[President House] this evening. 
  [Begin Leghari recording] I would like to reiterate my 
satisfaction with the outcome of the visit which was timely and 
significant. At this stage of flux in international political 
and economic relations, the U.S. Administration and corporate 
America are considering the future directions of their policies 
toward our region. My visit was a crucial opportunity to 
present our viewpoints, try, and influence these decisions. It 
must be recognized, however, that building a new relationship 
with the U.S. in the post cold war era will be a poser. It 
cannot be realized in one visit or at one time. My visit to the 
U.S., I hope, will be judged by history as having promoted 
Pakistan's security and prosperity and as forming a bridge 
between our post cold war ties with the U.S. and the new 
relationship which is responsive to the challenges and 
opportunities of the emerging era in international affairs. 
[end recording] 
  President Farooq Leghari said during his stay in the United 
States, he met with the Vice President Al Gore. The U.S. 
Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, and Deputy Secretary 
of State Mr. Talbott called on him and he held a series of 
meetings with other American officials and legislators as well 
as IMF and World Bank leaders and heads of various financial 
institutions. He said in his talks with the U.S. leaders it was 
agreed that the two countries would try to overcome the hurdle 
posed by the Pressler Amendment through a process of diplomatic 
consultation. The first round of such consultations was held in 
Washington by Pakistan and American officials on 26th and 27th 
May. These discussions were constructive and will continue. 
The president said Pakistan was also assured that the United 
States will remain fully engaged in promoting security in South 
Asia. Washington, he added, is well aware of the danger of the 
missile race, if India continues the development of its missile 
program and in particular, if it goes ahead with the deployment 
of the short range Prithvi. The president said he pointed out 
that the Agni with a range of 2400 km will pose a threat to a 
number of countries in our region. President Leghari said the 
United States acknowledged that Kashmir remains a threat to 
regional and international peace. Pakistan, he added, has 
conveyed its willingness to resume talks with India on Kashmir 
and other subjects once New Delhi takes some steps to create 
propitious conditions for such talks. 
  Pakistan and the United States also agreed to promote 
conventional arms control and more effective confidence-building 
measures by India and Pakistan. The president said the most 
exciting possibilities for future relations between Pakistan and 
the United States lie in areas of investment and business 
collaboration. In his meeting, he said there was clear 
recognition that Pakistan has now achieved both political and 
macroeconomic stability. The coming of age of democracy in 
Pakistan accompanied by the steps of the present government in 
reducing the budget deficit, in lowering inflation, and in 
deepening the economic reforms program has created a most 
propitious climate for both domestic and foreign investment in 
Pakistan's economy. The president said the IMF, the World Bank, 
and IFC [International Finance Corporation] have indicated 
clearly that Pakistan's economic environment is appropriate for 
investment, particularly in the energy sector. He said, in his 
opinion, Pakistan is likely to attract investment of over $2 
billion annually in the coming years. 
  The president said on his way back, he made a stopover in 
Paris where he met President Mitterrand. During the course of 
the meeting, various steps to promote bilateral relations 
between the two countries were discussed. 
  Replying to a number of questions about the allegations 
leveled by the leader of the opposition implicating Mr. Leghari 
in the Mehran Bank scandal, the president rejected all the 
charges as preposterous and without an iota of truth. His 
political life is like an open book and the question of his 
involvement in any scandal does not arise at all. I have never 
been associated with any of the scandals, he asserted. The 
president said he will initiate legal proceedings against all 
those who are resorting to a campaign of character assassination 
against him. He said the fact of the matter is that he and 
other members of his family have sold 531 acres of ancestral 
land to six individuals belonging to Karachi. The payment of 
this land was made through Mehran Bank. He said those who are 
hurling allegations against him may not be aware of the fact. 
Mr. Farooq Ahmad Leghari said it cannot be justified to level 
baseless charges against the president of Pakistan. 
  Replying to another question, the president said there is a 
consensus on issues like Kashmir, nuclear program, security of 
the country and basic economic policies. However, he said, it 
is unfortunate that certain elements are out to tell the world 
that no consensus exists on these issues.
