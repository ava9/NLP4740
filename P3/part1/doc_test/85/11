<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Leghari's Visit and Pakistan-U.S. </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that 
the nation is unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and no 
government can make any decision ignoring this consensus. He 
said that Pakistan will not tolerate any unilateral pressure or 
discriminatory treatment over its nuclear program. The 
president was addressing a gathering of Pakistani 
representatives of professional institutions of North America 
and Canada in Rochester, New York. The president said that 
Pakistan-U.S. relations are not confined to a single dimension; 
they are multidimensional. He said that his talks with U.S. 
authorities will cover all aspects. 
  Pakistan has been spelling out its position on the nuclear 
program for years, especially since the U.S. Government stopped 
economic and military aid four years ago on the pretext of the 
Pressler Amendment and refused to deliver the F-16 planes which 
were purchased by Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan tried to 
convince the United States about the peaceful nature of its 
nuclear program and clarified its stand at various levels that 
not only is Pakistan's nuclear program peaceful, but the nation 
is unanimous about it also. Moreover, Pakistan is ready to 
implement any proposal on declaring the South Asian region a 
nuclear-free zone which is also acceptable to India. 
  Despite these clarifications, Pakistan has so far failed to 
persuade the U.S. Administration to stop enforcing the Pressler 
Amendment. Of course, the success it has achieved is that the 
United States is not pressuring Pakistan now to roll back its 
nuclear program unilaterally. This is an important and positive 
change in the U.S. attitude. However, the United States should 
also admit that the Pressler Amendment cannot bring an end to 
the arms race and halt attempts to manufacture nuclear weapons 
in South Asia. Neither did implementing the law against Pakistan 
prove helpful nor did it conform to the requirements of justice. 
Similarly, the United States should also realize that the 
people and various sections and circles in parliament are 
unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and it is therefore 
impossible to terminate the program by exerting pressure on the 
government. 
  During his current visit, President Farooq Ahmad Leghari is 
scheduled to hold extensive talks with U.S. authorities on a 
number of issues other than Pakistan's nuclear program. It is 
expected that our position will become clearer to the U.S. 
Government as a result of these talks. We also hope that the 
U.S. president will review the situation as a result of the 
Pakistani president's talks and not only supply the F-16 planes, 
but also stop making unjust and inequitable demands concerning 
the nuclear program issue. 
  Our position is that our nuclear program is peaceful and is 
presently in a frozen state. The United States is free to 
verify if it wants, using technical means provided it does not 
affect Pakistan's proclaimed nuclear program. It is hoped that 
President Leghari's visit will enable Pakistan and the United 
States to come closer to each other, boost the process of 
understanding, and help remove the prevailing misunderstanding. 
We also hope that the opposition will not become a victim of 
unjustified misunderstanding, nor will it create an impression 
which is contrary to reality. 
  As President Leghari has stated in recent interviews with 
"JANG" and "THE NEWS," all centers of power in Pakistan are 
sending the same hints and identical signals to the outside 
world and it is clear that Pakistan's stand is being devised by 
all centers of power jointly. Therefore, no one should have a 
misunderstanding or apprehension that any particular individual 
or circle can adopt or declare a unilateral stand on the nuclear 
issue. The whole nation should remain satisfied that any 
decision will be made with the consensus of all centers of power 
and nothing will be accepted which is not in the national 
interests.
