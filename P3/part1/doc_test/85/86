<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Relations Between Russia and the </F>
United States Are Experiencing the Most Serious Crisis of Recent 
Years. Kozyrev and Christopher Face Difficult Conversation in 
Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] The Vladivostok meeting between the Russian foreign 
minister and the U.S. secretary of state scheduled for 14 March 
comes at a time of coolness in relations between Moscow and 
Washington, which not so long ago appeared cloudless. 
  There are several reasons for this. The first is the 
December elections, which brought victory for the 
national-communists and reminded the Americans that 
unpredictable Russia remains a potential enemy of the West and a 
threat to security in the world. Second, Washington cannot fail 
to be concerned by the changes which have appeared of late in 
Kremlin policy: the proclamation of the former USSR republics 
to be a zone of Russia's special interests, the unwillingness to 
withdraw troops from Latvia and Estonia, and resolute support 
for the Bosnian Serbs. "After defeat at the elections, the 
Russian authorities decided to adopt the opposition's slogans. 
For a while it has been difficult to determine to whom certain 
remarks in the sphere of foreign policy should be attributed -- 
Kozyrev or Zyuganov," a Western diplomat accredited in Moscow 
noted. 
  The third factor provoking the crisis between Russia and the 
United States is the success of Russian diplomacy in the 
Balkans. Having secured concessions from the Serbs and thereby 
averted military action by NATO, Moscow has proclaimed its 
status as a great power with whose opinion the West has to 
contend. The situation in Bosnia will be one of the main 
questions on the agenda of the Vladivostok meeting. "If Moscow 
and Washington manage to work out a joint stance, substantial 
progress can be expected over a Bosnian settlement given the 
influence which we have over the Serbs and which the Americans 
have over the Croats and the Muslims," a Russian diplomat 
dealing with the Balkans believes. 
  The subject of the Arab-Israeli conflict will probably arise 
in Vladivostok too. Kozyrev's sensational visit to Tunisia and 
Israel testifies to the seriousness of Russian diplomacy's 
intentions in the Near East. For two years everybody forgot 
that the Madrid conference on a Near East settlement had another 
cochairman apart from the United States -- Russia. Washington 
has borne the full burden of mediation between the Jews and the 
Arabs, and suddenly -- like a bolt from the blue -- Moscow comes 
forward with the unexpected idea of holding a new peace 
conference. 
  To all appearances, Christopher will use the meeting with 
his 
Russian colleague to make it clear to him that the United States 
will tolerate the revival of Moscow's old ambitions on the 
territory of the former USSR and even, to a certain extent, in 
the Balkans, but it by no means follows from this that it is 
prepared to accept a return by the Kremlin to its traditional 
role of defending the Arabs and fighting against Zionism in a 
region which Washington considers to be a zone of its own vital 
interests. 
  The participants in the Vladivostok talks will not let 
ex-President Richard Nixon's scandal-dogged trip to Moscow pass 
unnoticed. The Foreign Ministry came down firmly on the side of 
Boris Yeltsin, who reacted angrily to the former White House 
chief's contacts with the diehard opposition. "Nixon would have 
gone on to meet with Anpilov, Barkashov, and Vasilyev from 
'Pamyat,' and then ask for an audience with the Russian 
president.... Yeltsin's reaction was quite proper. We are 
entitled to expect respect," a high-ranking Russian diplomat 
said. 
  Moscow will also demand respect for its interests in "the 
near abroad." And although the United States has long since 
defined its approach in respect of the Baltic countries and is 
unlikely to yield to pressure from Moscow, Washington's plans in 
the sphere of Ukraine are not entirely clear. Kozyrev will try 
to clarify how far the reports that the United States intends to 
look upon Kiev as a counterweight to the increasing influence of 
Moscow correspond to reality. 
  Despite the abundance of delicate topics, the Russian 
Foreign 
Ministry will strive to avoid confrontation with Washington. In 
Vladivostok Kozyrev is unlikely to focus attention on 
differences of opinion, and he expects the same of Christopher. 
"There are no major reasons for exacerbating relations between 
Russia and the United States. The policy of strategic 
partnership proclaimed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton remains 
in force," IZVESTIYA was assured by an informed source on 
Smolenskaya Square.
