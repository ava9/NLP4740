  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
during his stay in the United States he will hold talks at 
various levels on political issues, foreign affairs, economic 
matters and national security. Talking to APP in London prior 
to his departure for the United States, he said that he will 
also exchange views with IMF authorities and hold talks with 
officials of Congress and Senate committees. 
  The president refuted the impression that Pakistan-U.S. 
relations have suffered any jolt. He said that Pakistan's 
relations with the United States are not limited to only one 
dimension; rather, they are wide-ranging. The president said 
that some people view these relations only in the context of 
nuclear nonproliferation, which is not a correct approach. 
Pakistan has categorically said in this regard that on 
principle it favors restrictions on nuclear weapons, and to say 
that Pakistan should do this and India should not do this is not 
acceptable to Pakistan. The president was seen off at Heathrow 
Airport by a representative of the Queen of England, acting 
Pakistani High Commissioner (Naim Jan Naim), high commission 
officials, and Pakistani residents. Later, the president 
arrived in Rochester, beginning his private visit to the United 
States. He was received at the airport by Pakistani Ambassador 
Dr. Maliha Lodhi, senior officials of the Pakistani Embassy, and 
Pakistanis residing in the city. During this stay, the 
president will be given an honorary LLD degree by University of 
Rochester. The president will leave for Washington on 23 May, 
where he will have a very busy time and hold some important 
meetings.
