  [Text] Pakistan and India meet in Islamabad on Sunday in a 
bid to resolve the Kashmir issue. The foreign secretaries of 
the two countries will have two days of parleys to negotiate 
comprehensively on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir issue, 
besides other bilateral matters. The Indian foreign secretary 
is reaching Islamabad tomorrow. Pakistan Television diplomatic 
correspondent says this is for the first time that India has 
explicitly agreed to place the Kashmir issue on the agenda of 
talks. Pakistan on its part has always been raising the Kashmir 
issue during previous high-level talks between the two 
countries, while India always tried to avoid the question. 
  In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has said the 
forthcoming talks with India will be the final round of formal 
dialogue between the two countries if New Delhi shows no 
flexibility on the Kashmir dispute. He told reporters yesterday 
that there will be no more formal talks on bilateral relations 
if the Indians fail to come with concrete proposals on Kashmir. 
Pakistan, the spokesman said, is willing to discuss nuclear and 
other issues with India only if it shows serious interest in 
resolving the dispute over the occupied valley. Kashmir, he 
added, is the flash point and there can be no peace in the 
region if it is not resolved. While agreeing on the forthcoming 
talks, Pakistan had asked India to end the siege of Hazratbal 
Shrine and stop human rights violations in occupied Kashmir to 
make the secretaries-level talks meaningful. Our correspondent 
says though the siege of Hazratbal Shrine was lifted on the 16th 
of last month, the flagrant human right violations have been 
continuing unabated. 
  Foreign Office sources say Pakistan wishes to reiterate that 
continuing escalation of repression by the Indian troops and 
paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir is a source of most 
serious concern and anguish for the people and the government of 
Pakistan. During the talks, the sources said, the Pakistani side 
would urge India to concede to the wishes of the people of 
Kashmir and grant them their inalienable right of 
self-determination -- a promise it had made but denied to them 
since 1947. 
  The Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan will find it 
extremely difficult to continue this sterile process of dialogue 
if India fails to respond to the aspirations of the people of 
Kashmir. If there is no progress, Pakistan would take the 
matter before the international community and tell the world to 
resolve the explosive situation, the spokesman added. 
  In the light of the secretary-level talks between Pakistan 
and India on Kashmir, the members of the Kashmir Committee of 
the National Assembly and prominent Kashmiri leaders were 
briefed about the government's position. Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told the committee members that Pakistan's 
stand on Kashmir had always been clear. It supports Kashmiris' 
right to self-determination and their ongoing struggle for this 
inalienable right. Pakistan wants the implementation of the UN 
resolutions on Kashmir because it understands that peace in the 
region will remain elusive unless this dispute is resolved. The 
chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan; the president and prime minister of AJK [Azad 
Jammu and Kashmir]; president of the People's Party of AJK; 
President of Muslim League of AJK; President of Liberation 
League of AJK; and acting president of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Liberation Front attended the briefing. 
  President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has described the 
Pakistan-India foreign secretary-level talks scheduled on Sunday 
in Islamabad as a step to find out a political and amicable 
solution to the decades-long Kashmir issue. Talking to newsmen 
in Akora Khattak, the president said this is a political forum 
available to us and we want to use it. Pakistan wants that the 
Kashmiris should be given their birthright of self-determination 
in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations. Pakistan has always condemned Indian brutalities 
against the innocent Kashmiris and it would continue to extend 
moral and political support to them. President Leghari regretted 
that Indian atrocities have reached their peak and there is no 
precedence of such brutalities in the entire history of mankind. 
He said the strength of the Indian forces has crossed the 
figure of 500,000 in occupied Kashmir. The president said the 
world pressure on India for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir 
issue is also building up.
