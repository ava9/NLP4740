  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
held talks with the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren 
Christopher, in Washington last night. In a statement before 
the talks, the president said efforts should continue for the 
solution of problems created by the Pressler Amendment. He said 
the issue could only be settled by pursuing the principles of 
(?nondiscrimination) and equality. He said Pakistan was trying 
to improve relations in all such spheres as did not come under 
the jurisdiction of Pressler Amendment. [sentence as heard] 
President Leghari said both Pakistan and the United States 
agreed to revive bilateral relations and friendship during the 
visit of the U.S. Under Secretary of State [title as heard], Mr. 
Strobe Talbott, to Pakistan earlier this year. 
  Mr. Christopher also made a brief statement before the talks 
and referred to shared concern of the two countries on issues 
like elimination of weapons of mass destruction, regional peace 
and security, and economic reforms. 
  Later, when Mr. Christopher left the venue after concluding 
his talks, the Assistant Secretary of State [title as heard], 
Mr. Talbott, remained there and continued deliberations with the 
president of Pakistan.
