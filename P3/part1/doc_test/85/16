  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that 
Pakistan and India can live in an atmosphere of complete peace 
and harmony if the Kashmir issue is resolved. Addressing a 
dinner hosted by the Association of Pakistan Professionals in 
New York last night, he said the security situation in the South 
Asian region has further worsened due to the Indian plan to 
deploy Prithvi missiles. He said that the only target of these 
missiles is Pakistan and this has aggravated further the tension 
which has been caused by the Kashmir problem. 
  President Leghari said that contrary to the India-U.S. 
secret 
talks in London, Pakistan's silent diplomacy with the United 
States is continuing and it is not secret. The diplomacy is 
aimed at resolving the issue of the Pressler Amendment in the 
context of the efforts to realize the goal of nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia. 
  President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that Pakistan 
welcomes all reasonable proposals. It, however, will not accept 
any unilateral restriction on its peaceful nuclear program. On 
narcotics control, the president said that the Government of 
Pakistan has recently taken speedy steps to eradicate the 
operations of the drug mafia and also enacted stringent laws to 
root out drug trafficking. On the privatization of the power 
production projects of [word indistinct], the president said 
that progress in this regard has been halted due to lack of 
appropriate legal regulations. He said that the whole process of 
privatization will be very transparent and in conformity with 
the law. In future, thermal power production will be entrusted 
only to the private sector, while the government will take care 
of hydroelectric power production.
