  [Text] Within the first week of February, senior officials 
of the American State Department have come out with policy 
statements regarding South Asia which provide some insights into 
the Clinton Administration's emerging view of a region that has 
assumed great strategic importance in the post-cold War world. 
  There were two statements by Assistant Secretary of State 
for 
South Asian Affairs, Robin Raphel, the first on February 4 
before the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on 
Near-Eastern and South Asian Affairs and her second was an 
address to the Asia Society. The other was a statement from the 
US Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, 
Lynn Davis, who said on February 7 that in regards the nuclear 
issue, the United States "will be looking at India and Pakistan 
equally and together as we seek to craft a non-proliferation 
strategy" for South Asia, thereby publicly accepting that 
American policy cannot be selective or discriminatory. 
  Robin Raphel's two statements are the first from her as 
public policy pronouncements regarding American perceptions of 
South Asia. Three aspects of the American view of South Asia are 
instructive. First there is acceptance by the United States of 
the reality that both major South Asian countries, India and 
Pakistan, are "nuclear capable and each is also apparently 
intent on acquiring ballistic missiles." There is a greater and 
more realistic view of security perceptions in South Asia when 
Robin Raphel stated before the Asia society that "large 
constituencies in both countries firmly believe that their 
nation's security is best assured through a nuclear capability." 
The American official also recognises in the statement that 
neither India nor Pakistan can be "easily persuaded" to forego 
the nuclear option. 
  The second major tenet of American policy towards South Asia 
pertains to the announced objective of "launching a multilateral 
process to promote arms control non-proliferation and regional 
security" and in this regard, the American official discloses 
that "both India and Pakistan already accept the mulitlateral 
approach in principle but details must be worked out." 
  The third important aspect of the Raphel policy statement 
was 
in equating what she described as the "civil war in Afghanistan" 
and the "insurgency in Kashmir." In equating the two, a civil 
war with a genuine liberation movement whose problem requires 
resolution under a United Nations administered plebiscite to 
which America is also formally committed at least to the extent 
that it is a party to those resolutions, the United States is 
viewing both Afghanistan and Kashmir as sources of instability 
and violence that need to be defused and contained rather than 
Kashmir as a dispute requiring resolution under universally 
acknowledged principles of self- determination. This 
distinction is important because the approach of the United 
States will then be different since containing a problem and 
resolving a problem are two different sets of machanisms. 
  The American policy statement also is specific in the 
context 
of Pakistan, particularly since it is the first public official 
Washington view of this country following the October 1993 
elections. Some insights into the American perspectives on 
Pakistan as enunciated by the US top policy-maker on South Asia. 
  -- There is sigh of relief that the "forces of moderation 
continue to prevail" since expectations before the elections 
about the "triumph of extremism" or that Islamic fundamentalist 
parties were predicting big gains have been proven wrong. 
  -- The October 1993 elections are handled as "the first and 
fairest in many years and it is specifically cited that these 
elections were "closely supervised by the military under Chief 
of Army Staff Waheed" thereby acknowledging the Pakistan Army's 
"honest broker" role in national politics. 
  -- Without saying so in so many words, the American official 
seems to be enclosing the ending of "a period of divided 
government in Pakistan" with Presidency going to Farooq Leghari 
a PPP [Pakistan People's Party] leader who in her words. "was 
selected to be President". 
  -- There is a word of advice to the PPP government with the 
formulation that "we are hopeful that the new leadership will be 
able to work with the Opposition led by former Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif to overcome political gridlock". 
  -- As was to be expected, the American State Department 
official lauded Moin Qureshi as providing "an excellent example 
of statesmanship and dedication of good government for the 
region and the world". 
  Interestingly, on India the accent of the policy statement 
is more on economic ties than a strategic military connection 
which was what the Indians were expecting and desperately 
wanting after the end of the Cold War. For instance, the US 
official stated that "there was more investment by American 
companies in India in 1993 than in all the years since 
independence, 20 per cent of all Indian exports come to the 
United States, the US is the largest source of foreign 
investment and commercial technology for India and the US 
Commerce Department has designated India as one of the 10 major 
emerging markets in the world to receive special attention as US 
formulates its worldwide strategy". Robin Raphel also cited an 
important fact that major American corporations have recently 
launched an "India Interest Group," which means that despite 
Pakistan being the economic leader of South Asia in 1991 when 
the reform process began in the region, today, India has easily 
overtaken Pakistan as the country in South Asia which is the 
primary and perhaps the sole recipient of American economic 
interest and investment. 
  Three strategic realities define these emerging American 
objectives in South Asia in the post-Cold War world. First, 
American political influence is more extensive and more 
pervasive in South Asia than at any time before, more so because 
it is no longer confined to Pakistan and it encompasses India as 
well. As Robin Raphel told the American Senate, "with the 
ending of the Cold War, South Asians recognised that the United 
States is now the outside power best building to assist them." 
There is no competing influence from Russia now. Interestingly 
for the first time, the United States is trying to build a new 
intimacy with the Pakistan Army on the basis of America's 
political clout without any tangible expression of support via 
military hardware or financial grants, as was the case during 
the Cold War years in the 50s and the 60s or the Afghanistan 
period in the 80s. But the problem is that on certain core 
issues for Pakistan like the nuclear programme, Kashmir and 
relations with China, American policy is at variance with 
Pakistani objectives. Hence the foundations of any new special 
relationship between the two sides or their respective 
militaries will be lacking. 
  The second basic reality defining American interest in South 
Asia is the China factor, with the Peoples Republic of China 
emerging as the area on which American strategic pressure is 
bound to be felt till the end of the century. China is all 
emerging economic giant with military power and political will 
to assess an independent posture in world affairs and although 
it is not interest in filling any vacuum created by the demise 
of the Soviet Union, China certainly is no pliant country 
acquiescing to American hegemony. It is thus no accident that 
the United States as well as the West generally are cultivating 
all of China's neighbours from Korea to Kyrgyzstan with the 
Americans talking to Pyongyang and normalising ties with Vietnam 
as well. With the British putting pressure on Hong Kong close 
to its unification with the mainland in 1997, the Americans are 
interested in the South Asian region as as a potential area to 
monitor and pressurise China, especially its minority provinces 
like Tibet and Xinjiang which border India and Pakistan 
respectively. 
  South Asia and Pakistan particularly, are also the gateway 
to 
Central Asia and hence Pakistan is also able to influence 
developments in neighboring Afghanistan which, in turn, impinge 
on Cental Asia, hence the Americans view South Asia and Pakistan 
in particular, as an extension of the Central Asian region, a 
fact acknowledged in Raphel's statement to the Asia Society when 
she said that "we must also recognise the importance of outside 
factors-- concerns about China, developments in Central Asia and 
Russia--in the South Asia security equation." 
  However, the American stated and unstated agenda for South 
Asia-- preventing tensions and conflict between India and 
Pakistan, focussing on India as a large market for American 
goods and technology, and Pakistan as a potential observation 
post for china, Iran and Cental Asia--present serious problems 
given the fact that on key areas vital to Pakistan's national 
security like Kashmir and the nuclear issue there is still no 
real fresh and radical departure from long-standing American 
policy. US policy can no longer keep pace with either the 
ground realities in Kashmir or the fact that Pakistan has long 
embarked on the path of nuclear independence which cannot be 
rolled back either under foreign pressures or pliable 
governments. As long as this reality gap is not bridged on 
vital issues, with American policy still far removed from the 
ground reality on the Kashmir and nuclear questions, American 
policy making will be reduced to an adhoc, reactive, 
moment-to-moment approach rather than a strategic perspective 
what is required in these troubled times.
