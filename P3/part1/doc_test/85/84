  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 17--Apprehending resumption of U.S. 
military aid to Pakistan, members at today's meeting of the 
Parliamentary Consultative Committee on External Affairs 
criticised the proposal to amend the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act. 
  The meeting focussed on the current state of Indo-U.S. 
relations and inquired into the reasons which led to 
postponement of the G-15 summit. 
  In the absence of the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh 
Singh, who was attending the Congress Parliamentary Party 
meeting, the Consultative Committee meeting was jointly chaired 
by the two Ministers of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. 
Bhatia and Mr. Salman Khurshid. 
  Drawing attention to the proposed changes in the Foreign 
Assistance Act, members felt the legislation will dilute the 
restrictions on the passage of military and economic aid to 
Pakistan, currently in force under the Pressler Amendment. 
  Targeted against Pakistan, the Pressler Amendment pins 
military aid to Pakistan to a certification by the U.S. 
President that Islamabad does not possess a nuclear weapon. 
  The new element in the proposed legislation is that in 
exceptional circumstances, the U.S. President can exercise 
discretionary powers to release military and economic aid even 
to those countries whose non-proliferation record is suspect. 
  Referring to the proposal, members said that it made India 
also a potential target of U.S. aid restrictions. 
  Responding to members' remarks on the nuclear issue, Mr. 
Bhatia said there would be no change in India's position on 
non-proliferation as it was based on "sound and fundamental 
principles." Earlier, members said that though every effort 
should be made to maintain good relations with the United 
States, this should not deter India from "frankly" stating its 
stand on issues including non-proliferation and human rights. 
  Focussing on the recent remarks of the U.S. official, Ms. 
Robin Raphael, questioning Kashmir's accession to India, members 
felt that there was a shift in U.S. policy on India. The change 
was particularly pronounced on the Kashmir question, they felt. 
  Rejecting the U.S. position that Kashmir was a "disputed 
territory," members emphasised that "the legal situation was 
that the dispute on Kashmir related to Pakistan Occupied 
Kashmir, which was Indian territory illegally occupied by 
Pakistan." 
  Simla Accord relevant: Countering Ms. Raphael's 
reference to Simla Accord as a "non-functional," Mr. Bhatia said 
the relevance of the agreement was evident for it had been 
instrumental in maintaining peace for more than 20 years. India 
continued to stand by it, he asserted. Mr. Bhatia made these 
remarks in the wake of the "surprise" expressed by members at 
Ms. Raphael's statement. 
  Denying allegations of the Indian security forces poor 
observance of human rights. Mr, Bhatia drew attention to the 
Bill introduced in Parliament to form a Human Rights Commission. 
  Referring to Washington's decision not to declare Pakistan a 
terrorist State, Mr. Bhatia said the United States had not taken 
"the final step for its own reasons." All requisite evidence 
that India possessed had been passed on to the United States, he 
said. 
  Focussing on Pakistan's abetment of terrorism and admission 
by Islamabad that it had a nuclear weapon programme, members 
said they found it difficult to comprehend why despite the 
admission the United States chose to impose pressure on India. 
  On the postponement of the G-15 summit on account of lack of 
quorum, Mr. Salman Khurshid cited "unfortunate set of 
coincidences, relating to domestic compulsions of different 
kinds," which had kept a large number of heads away. Heads from 
11 countries had confirmed participation till December 4, Mr. 
Khurshid said. 
  According to a member, it was admitted that Rs. 6 crores had 
been spent on the preparations for the summit. Citing changes in 
the global environment, a member questioned the relevance of 
G-15 in the wake of the emergence of trade blocs such as NAFTA 
[North American Free Trade Agreement] and APEC [Asian-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] .
