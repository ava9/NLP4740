President Bush's chief spokesman today held out the possibility of direct talks 
with Iran over the hostages under certain conditions, but cautioned, "We're 
nowhere near that." 
</P>
<P>
Among the preconditions toward any such direct dialogue with the new leaders of 
Tehran, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, would be a clear sign from 
authoritative Iranian officials that they are willing to enter such talks. 
</P>
<P>
A published report in Tehran said indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on the hostages 
will open within a few days, conducted through a third country, probably 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said it is "premature" to expect direct talks with Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman indicated, however, that indirect contacts will continue. He said 
the United States is likely to take advantage of Pakistani Foreign Minister 
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan's visit to Iran next week to send the Tehran government 
another message. 
</P>
<P>
Khan met with Vice President Dan Quayle last week and Quayle urged Pakistan to 
"become involved in helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to 
reveal information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation," Quayle 
spokesman David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had said Wednesday that he did not want to miss any signal from the Middle 
East that might lead to freedom for the eight American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said the United States and Israel are being "forthcoming" with 
each other about efforts to free their hostages in Lebanon but were not 
coordinating their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials had claimed that Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday night to coordinate 
efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeli prisoners held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are doing, and they have 
been forthcoming with what they're doing. However, I would not characterize it 
as coordination," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial today that indirect 
talks between Iran and the United States on the hostage crisis will begin 
within days. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the United States is "encouraging talks of every kind."
