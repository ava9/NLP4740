  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said the Pressler Amendment plays highly discriminatory and 
harsh sanctions against Pakistan while the Indian missile 
program was posing security threat to the South Asian region. 
He was speaking at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 
Washington. During the intense session, the president made a 
comprehensive presentation of a wide range of political, 
economic, and strategic issues involving Pakistan-U.S. 
relations. He, however, emphasized that relations between the 
two countries should not be allowed to become hostage to the 
Pressler Amendement. Speaking of nuclear nonproliferation, the 
president said Pakistan cannot sign the treaty unilaterally in 
the face of security threat posed by India's military build up 
in the region and its hegemonic ambition. President Leghari 
dilated in detail on the Kashmir issue and highlighted the human 
rights violations being committed by Indian troops in the held 
valley. The president earlier had a similar meeting with the 
House Foreign Relations Committee headed by Mr. Lee Hamilton. 
  Addressing the influential Middle East Forum of the Council 
of Foreign Relations, the president said the threat to regional 
and global peace arises from the Kashmir dispute, New Delhi's 
arms build up against Pakistan, and India's pursuit of a nuclear 
weapons and missile program. He said security in South Asia 
will improve dramatically if the core issue of Kashmir is 
resolved peacefully. On Afghanistan, the president said Pakistan 
sided with the Afghan resistance at a great cost and peril to 
itself. Thus it contributed in small measure to the demise of 
the cold war.
