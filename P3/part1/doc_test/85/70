THE MEDITERRANEAN SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
LAST SUMMIT AT SEA LED TO ATLANTIC CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The last time an American President met at sea with a world-renowned foreign 
leader was in August, 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt conferred with 
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard a British warship in Placenta 
Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which ended Aug. 12, was held during Britain's darkest 
hours in World War II. It also came four months before the United States 
entered the conflict, but the discussions left little doubt that America would 
soon be involved. 
</P>
<P>
The shipboard conference's most notable achievement was a joint proclamation 
setting down "certain common principles" of Britain and the United States in 
what became known as the Atlantic Charter. Among its eight points were an 
affirmation of the right to self-determination, a vow that the United States 
and Britain would seek no new territory or territorial changes without the 
consent of the people involved, rejection of the use of force to settle 
conflicts, free trade and joint economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The charter's main impact was as a morale-booster for democratic nations at a 
time of pessimism and discouragement. Endorsed by other democratic states, it 
became one of the building blocks in the creation of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt and Churchill had brought their senior military advisers to the 
shipboard conference. And although the United States was still formally 
neutral, the meeting gave the British and American staffs an opportunity to 
meet and develop contacts that would become useful after the United States 
entered the war.
