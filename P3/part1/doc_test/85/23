  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said the Kashmir resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission 
has greatly helped in internationalizing the issue and in 
molding the international opinion in support of the Kashmiris' 
cause. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, he said the 
resolution on violations of human rights in occupied Kashmir was 
moved by Pakistan at an international forum after a long time 
and it helped in highlighting the Kashmir issue. He was sure 
that its results would be positive in future. The president 
said the Kashmir freedom struggle has been going on since long, 
which the people of the occupied state are waging against Indian 
oppression and occupation [sentence as heard]. He said Pakistan 
is extending all the political, moral, and diplomatic support to 
them. 
  In reply to a question, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari 
said 
it will be his effort and endeavor that on all matters which 
pertain to Pakistan's security interests, national interests, 
and other vital interests, including Kashmir, there must be a 
bipartisan approach. He said in the interest of the Kashmiri 
struggle, there should be a consensus on the Kashmir policy. He 
said that he has tried in the past and will do so in future to 
create better coordination between the government and the 
opposition. To a question, he said as the president of 
Pakistan, all political parties are to equal to him.
