About half a billion dollars a year in U.S. military and economic aid to 
Pakistan has been frozen and payments cannot be resumed until the Islamabad 
government curtails programs that seem to be intended to produce nuclear 
weapons, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush Administration is 
reviewing Pakistan's nuclear program, and Capitol Hill sources said it is 
almost inconceivable that Congress would allow the aid to resume unless major 
changes occur. 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. law, no aid can be sent to Pakistan unless the President certifies 
each year that Islamabad is not trying to acquire nuclear weapons. For the 
first time since the requirement was imposed in 1985, President Bush declined 
to make such a certification this year, forcing a suspension of aid with the 
start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the Reagan and Bush administrations have issued the needed 
certification, despite accusations in Congress that Pakistan was trying to 
develop and test a nuclear device to match one exploded by India in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were reluctant to take any action that would damage the 
longstanding U.S.-Pakistan relationship, especially at a time when covert 
American assistance to anti-government guerrillas in Afghanistan was being 
channeled through Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had requested $564 million in combined economic and military 
assistance to Pakistan for 1991. For fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30, the 
combined total was $581 million. The aid program for Pakistan has been the U.S. 
government's third-largest, following the packages for Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III informed Pakistani 
Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan that U.S. law will not allow continuation 
of the aid programs under current circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary reiterated our view of the need for a comprehensive approach to 
dealing with nonproliferation issues in the region," Tutwiler said. "The 
Pakistani nuclear program remains under review." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler, who sat in on the meeting Tuesday between Baker and Yaqub Khan, 
provided few details. But she left little doubt that Yaqub Khan provided no 
assurances that would allow Bush to lift the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
When Tutwiler was asked why the Administration had not provided more public 
evidence of its concern with the Pakistani program, she said: "Well, how about 
the evidence that the certification wasn't (made) on Oct. 1?" 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is in a better tactical position to deal firmly with 
Pakistan than in the past because the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan has reduced the importance of the Islamabad government as a bridge 
between the United States and the Afghan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
On a related matter, Tutwiler said the State Department has never received an 
application for an export license to sell to Pakistan high-temperature furnaces 
needed for the manufacture of nuclear arms. The Washington Post reported 
Wednesday that Pakistan had tried, without success, to obtain such equipment 
from an American company.
