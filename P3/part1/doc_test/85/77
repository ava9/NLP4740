  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that 
Pakistan is ready to consider any proposal, which is aimed at 
verifying without interference, that its nuclear program is not 
weapons-oriented. Talking to newsmen at the Foreign Office in 
Islamabad yesterday, he said that Pakistan has repeatedly made 
it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and 
the United States has accepted the Pakistani position. He said 
that Pakistan will not relinquish its principled stand on the 
nuclear issue, but is ready to consider any proposal aimed at 
nonintrusive verification. 
  The foreign minister said that although Pakistan does have 
the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon, a political 
decision has been taken that it will not be manufactured. He 
said the decision has nothing to do with the United States or 
anyone else. 
  Answering a question, the foreign minister said that 
Pakistan 
is not engaged in any secret diplomacy with the United States 
and it will not compromise on the nuclear issue. He regretted 
that India rejected every aspect of the U.S. proposal on making 
South Asia a nuclear-free zone.
