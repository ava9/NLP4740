  [Text] The president, Mr. Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
has called upon the opposition to end its boycott and join the 
proceedings of the National Assembly. He was talking to newsmen 
in Islamabad this morning after laying the foundation stone of 
the National Police Academy. The president said boycott is a 
constitutional right of the opposition, but it is high time that 
politicians must play their due role to defuse tension and end 
polarization in the national body politic. He said even 
otherwise there is no justification for the opposition to resort 
to boycott at this moment. 
  Replying to various questions, the president said he has 
done 
nothing unconstitutional as far as the NWFP [Northwest Frontier 
Province] is concerned. He said that Syed Sabir Shah, after 
losing majority in the Provincial Assembly, adopted improper 
tactics to sustain his government. He said it is a democratic 
norm that when one loses majority, he should step aside.
