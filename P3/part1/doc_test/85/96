  [Text] Although the United States has dropped Pakistan 
from the list of those countries being watched for their support 
to transborder terrorism for it what it calls lack of evidence, 
there are countries besides India who have been suffering 
because of Islamabad's post-Zia policy to support religious 
fundamentalist militancy to subvert stable governments and 
systems in other countries. Among the victims of this policy 
have been even the Muslim countries. Afghanistan is one of 
them. Pak-supported religious fundamentalists did not allow any 
government to survive in that country. The victory of these 
fundamentalist forces there has brought about a never ending 
nightmare for the innocent Afghan population. The Afghan 
president twice protested against Pakistan's support to 
fundamentalist forces led by Hekmatyar Khan. But these protests 
have been replied with only economic aid. 
  Egypt is another country which openly accused Pakistan of 
supporting those elements who wanted to destabilize the present 
government there. During his visit to Washington early last 
year, President Husni Mubarak had told President Clinton of the 
threat his government faced from fundamentalists trained in 
terrorist activities in Pakistan. The USA at that time was 
supposed to be keeping Pakistan under watch. It is not known 
what assurance Mr. Clinton gave to Mr. Mubarak. What we know, 
that after some months Pakistan was removed from the list of 
terrorism supporting countries. We also know that after the 
prime minister of Egypt, 'Atif Sidqi, escaped an attempt on his 
life last November made by a person who keeps on visiting 
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The name of this person is Mohammad 
(Makavi) who confessed to the FRONTIER POST of Peshawar last 
month that he was behind the attack on Mr. Sidqi's life. 
(Makavi) confessed that he has been fully involved in the war 
in Afghanistan and that he is a supporter of Hekmatyar Khan and 
opponent of President Borhanoddin Rabbani. His confession is 
vital, inasmuch as it clearly reveals that religious 
fundamentalists do not keep their activities confined to their 
own countries. This is something India has started facing in 
Kashmir. 
  Like Egypt, Algeria, too, is faced with the threat to its 
stability from Pakistan-trained militants. The Algerian prime 
minister, Redha Malek, recently told newsmen that 
anti-government Algerians were getting training in Afghan-Arab 
camps in Pakistan. They were receiving money from external 
sources and that money was used for buying weapons in Western 
countries to be transported to Algeria for terrorist activities. 
Mr. Mubarak [name as heard] condemned both Pakistan and Sudan 
for their support to these elements and pleaded with Western 
countries not to allow these elements to use their soil for 
anti-Algeria activities. What some Muslim countries are facing 
at the hands of Pakistan today has been the experience of India. 
And what is happening in Kashmir is terrorism and human rights 
violation at the hands of these foreign- trained elements.
