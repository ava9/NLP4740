  [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Friday [18 March] proclaimed a sovereign kingdom 
in kwaZulu/Natal and said his subjects would defend it at all 
costs. "We are here today to proclaim before the world, our 
freedom and sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at 
all costs," he told several thousand Zulus at a gathering in 
Ulundi. 
  The king's proclamation follows the opening of the 1994 
session of the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]. Speculation 
was rife in Ulundi that the KLA would formally proclaim an 
independent sovereign Zulu kingdom encompassing the entire 
kwaZulu/Natal region during the current session. 
  A senior kwaZulu government source said the king's 
announcement on Friday could be interpreted as a forerunner to 
an official proclamation. 
  King Zwelithini warned State President F. W. de Klerk 
earlier 
this year that he was preparing to promulgate a constitution for 
kwaZulu/Natal, unless his demands for recognition of his 
kingdom's sovereignty were met. KwaZulu Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi usually delivers a lengthy policy speech 
during the KLA session and the source said a formal proclamation 
could emerge during this speech, which begins on Monday. 
  In his address outside the KLA building, the king called on 
all Zulus to unite and defend their freedom, saying elections 
under the present constitution would deny the Zulu nation its 
claim to sovereignty and self-determination. He reiterated he 
could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the 
April election. 
  "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the kingdom of 
kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to 
defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern Africa 
who dares to challenge it." 
  He alleged Mr de Klerk's "contingency plans" for the 
Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of security forces 
"to clamp down on my people should they choose not to 
participate in the elections". 
  Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate 
denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination". "I 
find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my subjects 
who are loyal to the throne should participate in the 
forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu 
kingdom) is settled." 
  He revealed that recent discussions between himself and Mr 
de 
Klerk on the Zulu king's claims had made little progress, adding 
the South African Government had denied sovereignty to the Zulu 
nation and would not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom. 
"Under the terms of a final proposal of the South African 
Government, the Zulu nation and the kingdom of kwaZulu are left 
at the mercy of the unitary state established by the 1993 
constitution. We have reached the end of a road and we are 
faced with the harsh reality that the SA Government cannot and 
will not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of 
kwaZulu." 
  Zulus were faced with an historical dilemma of either 
succumbing and forever relinquishing their sovereignty or to 
take it upon themselves "and bring into existence what is ours, 
what belonged to our fathers and what belongs to our children". 
  The king alleged Mr de Klerk had threatened to deploy his 
security forces if Zulus did not vote in the April poll. "I 
protest for the betrayals that the Zulu nation have suffered 
from President de Klerk again and again."
