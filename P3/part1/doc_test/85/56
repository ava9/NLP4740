President Bush signed a proclamation declaring today National Day in Support of 
Freedom and Human Rights in memory of those killed in Communist China last year 
while demonstrating in support of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which harshly criticized Bush for refusing to impose stiff economic 
and diplomatic measures against China in response to the bloody crackdown, 
passed a resolution Friday urging the President to sign the proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
In the proclamation signed Saturday, Bush noted that last spring millions of 
people in China marched peacefully for democracy, and "tragically . . . lethal 
force was used to crush the demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
"Steps have been taken in recent months that have resulted in some 
improvements," including the release of prisoners and the lifting of martial 
law, he said. "The United States hopes that these steps will be followed by 
others that will demonstrate China's return to the path of reform." 
</P>
<P>
Bush must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's "most favored nation" trade 
status. There is a push in Congress to revoke that status. 
</P>
<P>
China is eager to mend fences with the United States as such action could cost 
billions of dollars in exports. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Yang Shangkun leaves today on a five-nation Latin America 
trip that some diplomats say is designed to polish his image and smooth U.S. 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat said Mexico might be the most important stop for Yang. "I 
think maybe the Chinese hope Mexico will act as a bridge to the United States," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yang will also visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.
