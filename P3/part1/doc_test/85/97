  [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- The World Federation of 
Trade Unions and foreign public figures denounced the anti-DPRK 
campaign of the United States and its followers. 
  Jaroldo Rima, chief of the group of the communist members of 
the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, in his speech at a session of 
the National Congress on May 17 said that the United States is 
scheming to take sanctions against the DPRK through the UN 
Security Council, clinging to military means under an 
unreasonable pretext. "This is an open attack on the socialist 
system of Korea," he added. "We denounce the U.S. imperialist 
policy and express solidarity with the government and people of 
the DPRK in their struggle to defend the sovereignty of the 
country and the dignity of the nation," he stated. He demanded 
that the government of Brazil maintain an independent and fair 
stand towards the situation prevailing in the Korean peninsula. 
  The World Federation of Trade Unions in a statement on May 
18 
hoped that the row over "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK and 
the aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula by the 
United States and South Korean authorities would be terminated. 
"The workers and trade unions of the world would fight to this 
end," it declared. 
  Abdul Malik, secretary general of the Karachi branch of the 
Pakistan-Korea Friendship Association, said in his writing 
addressed to the U.S. President, the U.N. secretary-general, the 
general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
puppet president of South Korea, political and public figures of 
Pakistan and diplomats of different countries in Pakistan on May 
22: "The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter to be 
resolved between Korea and the United States because it was 
caused by the United States." 
  He stressed that the United States should act with 
discretion, though belatedly.
