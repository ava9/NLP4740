PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's cabinet was completed yesterday when the Senate
unanimously approved the nomination of Ms Janet Reno to be the first woman
attorney-general of the US.
She will be sworn into office within the next day or two.
The 54-year-old state prosecutor from Miami, Florida, had sailed through two
days of hearings without controversy, but also diplomatically revealing
little about her views on some of the difficult questions confronting the
justice department.
These range from deciding whether to retain Judge William Sessions as head
of the FBI to the continued use of special prosecutors in such cases as
Iran-Contra.
She satisfied Democrats by her commitment to civil rights, environmental
protection and gun control, and pleased Republicans with her tough approach
to control of crime.
