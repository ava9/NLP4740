Mattel Sues Cult Leader: The Hawthorne-based toy maker sued religious cult 
leader Tony Alamo and two of his companies, claiming that they have damaged the 
images of Mattel and Barbie. The breach-of-contract case, filed in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, said Alamo Designs in early 1989 obtained two licenses to make 
and sell denim jackets, T-shirts and jeans decorated with rhinestones and the 
name and likeness of Barbie and Nostalgic Barbie.

The suit said the agreements were violated because Alamo, among other things, 
marketed an unapproved T-shirt with a "religious symbol," called Pope John Paul 
II a "Nazi war criminal" and has been evading arrest for felony child abuse. 
The suit seeks more than $75,000 and an order barring Alamo from using Barbie 
images or trademarks. (Filed June 21, 1990. Case No. BC004015)
