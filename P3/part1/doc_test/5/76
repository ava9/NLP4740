Cuban refugees risks repeating Haiti policy failure

Two years ago, when he was still a candidate for the White House, President
Bill Clinton backed the Cuba Democracy Act which toughened the US embargo
against the government of President Fidel Castro.
Today, the embargo has done its work, greatly abetted by the disappearance
of the Soviet Union as an economic support. But the immediate consequence -
a stream of refugees crossing the Straits of Florida on precarious rafts -
is not to the Clinton administration's liking.
The memory of President Jimmy Carter, helpless before the Mariel Boatlift of
1980, is still a painful one for many Democrats. Mr Clinton appears
determined not to be caught in the same trap.
'We have gone through that once. . . It was wrong then and it's wrong now,
and I'm not going to let it happen again,' Mr Clinton said yesterday at a
news conference to explain the new refugee policy.
The new policy places Cubans essentially on a par with their Caribbean
neighbours in Haiti: they may apply for legal immigration status inside
their own country, but if they strike out on their own across the sea, they
will be put in a detention camp.
That causes wry satisfaction to some who have been arguing for refugee
status for Haitians. In terms of beatings and killings, there is a much
clearer case for political repression in Haiti than there is in Cuba.
'This parity would never have been achieved were it not for Castro,' said Mr
Larry Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy
group.
Unlike the Haitians, however, the Cubans are protected by the 1966 Cuban
Adjustment Act from being deported back to their home country.
But Mr Clinton has already learnt how difficult it is to frame a policy to
deal with the Haitian boat people. He has changed tune repeatedly, and still
had little success in stemming the exodus.
There is little likelihood that the new policy will have any greater success
at stopping Cuban emigration than it has been at stopping Haitian
emigration.
Ms Janet Reno, who as attorney general has overall responsibility for the
immigration services, argued yesterday that the US must not allow Mr Castro
a safety valve for his economic and political troubles.
'The problems of Cuba have got to be solved there by democratic reform, and
we must not let this be used as a safety valve to keep the pressure off
him,' she said.
But she acknowledged that the new policy was only a short-term palliative,
and admitted that it had not yet even been decided what would be done with
the detainees.
Because the Cuban Adjustment Act prevents repatriation, Cubans who reach the
US and are placed in detention camps will eventually have to be given some
kind of asylum, unless another country can be persuaded to take them in or
unless the administration is willing to contemplate long-term internment.
'We'll address those issues down the line. The most important point right
now is not to play into Castro's game,' Ms Reno said. She fervently hopes
that Cubans will remember that they can apply for political asylum at the US
mission in Havana, as around 3,000 people a year do successfully.
For the time being, the Pentagon is busily setting up tents for around
10,000 at Guantanamo, the US military enclave on the coast of Cuba, on top
of the 14,700 Haitians who are already there. Guantanamo should at least
shorten the journey for some Cuban emigrants. The camp perimeter is still
mined, so Cubans cannot simply walk through the gates, but senior defence
officials said they will be taken in if they swim around the point and into
Guantanamo harbour.
That leaves US policy towards Cuba pulling in contradictory directions. The
embargo is intended to bring the Castro government to its knees, but the
fear of a flood of refugees leaves some wishing it had been less effective.
Could the refugee crisis reach such proportions that the US is obliged to
reconsider its visceral loathing of Mr Castro, and embark on a policy
somewhat closer to constructive engagement as a way of opening up Cuba to
democracy and free markets?
'If the US can have a dialogue with North Korea and Vietnam, why not talk to
Castro?' wonders Mr Birns.
Such a switch would, however, be difficult. Doubts have been raised in
recent years over whether the fiercely anti-Castro Cuban American National
Foundation speaks for the entire Cuban-American community, but it remains
the loudest and most politically effective voice.
Nor is it likely that the Republican opposition, or even most of Mr
Clinton's own Democratic party, would welcome such a shift.
In the meantime, however, Mr Clinton is left to confront Mr Castro with much
the same general policy with which he faces the military leaders in Haiti:
watching, and hoping that they will go away of their own accord.
