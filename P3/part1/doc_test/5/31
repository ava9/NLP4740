MR William Sessions' six-month battle to hold on to his job as director of
the US Federal Bureau of Investigation is expected to end this week with his
dismissal by President Bill Clinton.
Mr Sessions, under fire since a Justice Department investigation in January
accused him of misusing FBI perks and personnel, has so far refused to
resign, maintaining that all the charges against him are answerable.
But after a meeting on Saturday with Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, it
appeared that if Mr Sessions would not go gently, Mr Clinton was at last
prepared to dismiss him.
Mr Clinton on Friday met Mr Louis Freeh, a federal judge in Manhattan who is
viewed as the leading candidate to head the FBI. Mr Freeh is himself a
former FBI agent and federal prosecutor.
The wrangle over Mr Sessions' alleged ethical lapses has obscured a more
profound struggle within the FBI, and the new director will have a hard task
reasserting control over an agency which some critics say has disintegrated
into a number of feuding fiefdoms and has failed to grapple with some of the
US's most pressing crime problems.
One of Mr Sessions' demands has been that he should remain in office until
his successor is confirmed by the Senate, thus denying the chance to serve
as acting director to a deputy with whom he has been at loggerheads.
Some White House officials are sympathetic to Mr Sessions' denial of the
charges against him, which include personal use of government cars and
aircraft, and this may explain why Mr Clinton has been willing to wait so
long to allow him the chance for a more or less graceful exit.
Whatever the truth behind the ethical charges, it has become clear that Mr
Sessions' ability to serve as director has been considerably impaired.
Mr Sessions, originally appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, is half
way through a 10-year term of office, but can be dismissed by the president.
