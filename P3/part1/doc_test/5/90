A U.S. investigator in Texas said he suspected that the leader of a 
drug-smuggling and satanic cult could have faked his death to fool police into 
ending their hunt for perpetrators of 15 ritual murders near the U.S.-Mexico 
border. But Mexican authorities maintained that Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo had 
been positively identified by his fingerprints and U.S. passport. Cult member 
Alvaro de Leon has said he killed Constanzo and a bodyguard in a Mexico City 
apartment on the leader's orders. But Armando Ramirez, resident agent of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration in Brownsville, said the bodies were too badly 
shot up to be positively identified.
