THESE cannot have been the happiest days in the life of Ms Lani Guinier. She
spent most of Wednesday talking to leading newspapers and appearing on
television making an articulate case for her qualifications as the new
assistant attorney-general in charge of civil rights. She woke up yesterday
to a united media chorus proclaiming that President Bill Clinton had
concluded that her nomination would have to be withdrawn.
Mr Clinton, who badly needs to win some battles, seems to have come round to
the view that her nomination had put him in a 'lose-lose' position and it
was merely a matter of settling on the least bad political option. Either
way, his White House is again under fire for bad judgment and political
mismanagement.
A series of recent actions, exemplified by the recruitment to the White
House of Mr David Gergen, the former adviser to Republican presidents,
suggest a shift back to the political centre. But sacrificing well-known
beliefs, including a very progressive record on civil rights, has an awful
air of expediency about it.
There is also a personal element to the controversy. Ms Guinier went to Yale
Law School with the president and his wife and became quite close to Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton. They attended her small private wedding in 1986.
Their general commitment to civil rights certainly matched hers, if not, as
Mr Clinton insists, down to the fine print of all her writings.
It is hard to argue against the proposition that Ms Guinier was left out to
dry by the White House. There were plenty of early warnings in the
conservative media, especially Wall Street Journal editorials, that her long
academic paper trail was stirring up opposition, with accusations that she
was a 'quota queen' intent on abandoning the principles of majority rule for
complex proportional formulae.
Comparisons were freely made between her case and that of Mr Robert Bork,
the conservative academic denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate in 1987.
In both instances opponents have targeted their real or imagined radicalism
and ignored their intellectual qualities.
Yet the White House did not press her cause, as the Reagan administration
did Mr Bork's, until the bitter end. It did not smooth her path by arranging
necessary preliminary meetings with swing senators. Perhaps too conscious of
the controversy surrounding the recent confirmation to the housing
department of Ms Roberta Achtenberg, who is openly lesbian, it allowed Ms
Guinier's critics, who scented blood, to call the tune.
Mr Clinton himself came close to pulling the rug on Wednesday with the most
tepid of endorsements. Yet earlier in the week, Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, had typically stood solidly behind Ms Guinier as 'a superb
choice'. Not for the first time, communications between the White House and
Justice Department seemed lacking.
Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of a finely divided judiciary committee, is
known to have been worried that another black woman would be subject to the
sort of public trial visited on Professor Anita Hill in the hearings on the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
But Ms Guinier insisted on Wednesday that, like Mr Bork, she at least should
be given the congressional forum to explain herself.
She maintained, with some force, that the often dense and theoretical nature
of academic writing was no foolproof guide to the practical implementation
of the laws of the land, with which, as a past legal counsel to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), she also had
considerable familiarity.
But the painful choice for Mr Clinton has come down to this: to abandon Ms
Guinier, offending his liberal political supporters and fostering the
impression that he backs down in the heat of battle, but hoping that Ms
Guinier, like Ms Zoe Baird, the first attorney-general nominee, is quickly
forgotten; or to stick with her, as a friend whose views on civil rights are
not far from his own, but thus risk a bruising public debate at precisely
the time he needs to focus on winning the backing of the centre for an
acceptable budget package.
