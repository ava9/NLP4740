FT  21 APR 93 / Davidians cult survivors arrested after fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Branch Davidian cult survivors of the fire which destroyed their
compound in Waco, Texas, are led away under arrest yesterday. US president
Bill Clinton said he did not intend to ask attorney general Janet Reno to
resign over the disastrous ending to the 51-day siege. He said he accepted
full responsibility for the events which culminated in the deaths of about
80 members of the religious cult when the FBI advanced on their stronghold.
