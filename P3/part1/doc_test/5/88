FT  06 OCT 94 / World News in Brief: Cult link seen as 48 people die in
Swiss villages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty-eight people, believed to be members of a cult which originated in
Canada, died in a suspected collective suicide in Switzerland. Police found
the bodies in a barn basement at Cheiry, near Fribourg, and in three
burned-out ski chalets at Granges-sur-Salvan, 160km away. It is believed the
fires may have been triggered automatically. The cult, known in Canada as
the Order of the Solar Temple, is headed by Luc Jouret (above), a
46-year-old homeopathic doctor, whose whereabouts were not known yesterday.
In Quebec police said they believed the deaths in Switzerland were linked to
an arson fire that killed two people in a house next to one owned by Jouret
north of Montreal.
