Wacoal, the Japanese group that is the world's largest lingerie producer, plans 
to open a production plant in France. 
</P>
<P>
The company is investing in a production plant on a 23,000-square-yard site at 
Ernee in France. The plant, which is scheduled to come on stream in the spring 
of next year, will be the company's first venture in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Wacoal, based in Kyoto, has dominated the Japanese lingerie market for decades. 
A few years ago it moved into North America. 
</P>
<P>
Wacoal's arrival in the European market has important implications for 
established lingerie producers. At present the market is dominated by Triumph 
of Switzerland, together with Playtex and Warnaco of the United States.
