MR LOUIS FREEH was yesterday sworn in as the fifth director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Freeh, 43, a former FBI agent who later served as a federal prosecutor
and judge in New York City, was nominated by President Bill Clinton in July
to replace Mr William Sessions, who had been appointed by former President
George Bush. Mr Sessions was fired by Mr Clinton for weak leadership and
abusing the privileges of his office.
Mr Clinton said he hoped the FBI in the 1990s would become best known for
cracking down on drug lords and terrorists.
