PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, twice frustrated in his search for an attorney
general, last night nominated Ms Janet Reno, a criminal lawyer from Miami,
to run his Justice Department.
Ms Reno, 54, has an Ivy League education (Cornell and Harvard Law School)
and has been state prosecutor for Dade County, Florida, for 15 years.
Introducing her in the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr Clinton praised
her legal and administrative experience. He described her as 'a tough crime
fighter and a caring public servant'.
He insisted he had 'somewhat, but not entirely' wanted to appoint the first
woman attorney general but in this latest search had given 'very serious
consideration' to four male candidates before settling on Ms Reno.
She is unmarried and childless and enjoys a 'squeaky clean' reputation in
Miami. In response to the inevitable question, she asserted that she had
never hired illegal immigrants and had paid all appropriate taxes.
Ms Zoe Baird, first nominated by Mr Clinton, withdrew after disclosing she
had broken the law in employing two illegal immigrants as household help.
Judge Kimba Wood, top of the president's next short list but not nominated,
also backed out because of controversy over her nanny.
Ms Reno appears to bring to bear some qualifications lacked by both Ms
Baird, predominantly a corporate lawyer with no trial experience, and Judge
Wood, appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan and best known for
presiding over the trial of Mr Michael Milken, the Wall Street financier.
She has been, by all accounts, an extremely successful court attorney, with
a number of notable criminal convictions under her belt in cases involving
child abuse, sexual harassment and racial discrimination. She said yesterday
that she was 'personally opposed' to capital punishment, which Mr Clinton
supports, but had sought the death penalty in some of the cases she had
prosecuted.
She runs a 900-strong department in Miami, handling, Mr Clinton said,
120,000 cases a year, and thus has the administrative experience less
evident in the other two. She has also been active in various local drug
prevention programmes. These qualities should appeal to the Senate judiciary
committee when it considers her nomination.
Her political connections also seem far stronger than those of Ms Baird and
Judge Wood, both largely unknown to the Democratic party.
