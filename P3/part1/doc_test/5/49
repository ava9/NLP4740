A judge Friday sentenced religious cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren to death 
for killing a five-member family belonging to his cult. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks, in issuing the sentence, followed the 
recommendation of a Lake County jury. 
</P>
<P>
The other option was life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer pleaded Thursday for the judge to spare 
Lundgren's life, saying the Independence, Mo., native believed he was following 
God's will when he shot the Dennis Avery family, which included children ages 
15, 13 and 6, to death. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, 40, a one-time lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, was convicted on Aug. 29 of aggravated murder for the 
1989 killings. 
</P>
<P>
The murders were committed in April, 1989, but the bodies were not uncovered 
until early January this year, after a member of Lundgren's former cult went to 
authorities in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The cult had broken up in December. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing a possible death sentence is Jeffrey Lundgren's 19-year-old son, 
Damon Lundgren. He was convicted of four counts of aggravated murder last week.
