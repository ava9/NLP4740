</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the dirt road that wound through the sorghum fields, the dilapidated shack 
bore no sign of the evil within. 
</P>
<P>
This is where police said the ring of drug smugglers had ritualistically killed 
their victims. Close by was a large iron pot with blood and human brain matter, 
the parts of dead animals, oddities like horseshoes and coins, and a rusted 
machete. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, 12 of the bodies had already been found and the digging would 
begin soon for more. Some of them had been skinned. Others had been 
decapitated. Still others had limbs hacked off and body parts mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Became Victim 
</P>
<P>
One of the bodies found Tuesday, hours after four men had confessed to taking 
part in the mass murders, was that of Mark Kilroy, a University of Texas 
student. He had disappeared March 14 during a rowdy evening in this border city 
while celebrating his school's spring break. 
</P>
<P>
His father, James, told a press conference Wednesday in Brownsville, Tex., just 
across the border, that he was not worried about his son any longer, because 
"our father in heaven loves him even more than we could." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law enforcement officials said the suspected ringleader of the cult and 
marijuana smuggling operation was a Cuban, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, who was 
believed to have fled into the United States. They said his nickname was "The 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the one who directed that these people be picked up and sacrificed," 
said Oran Neck Jr., the resident agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Three other suspects are being sought, including two men and Sara Villareal 
Adrete, a 24-year-old Matamoros woman whose house was searched Tuesday night. 
Mexican police found a blood spattered sacrificial altar, blood stained 
children's clothing and a variety of voodoo paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
At the remote ranch where the bodies were found, Cameron County Sheriff Alex 
Perez said cult members removed some victims' vertebrae to use them for 
necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
"Very clearly they believe the human sacrifices and the animal sacrifices put a 
magical shield around them that protected them from evil or harm, even up to 
bullets," said Texas Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kilroy, the dead included a Matamoros policeman, a Mexican 
federal police volunteer and a 16-year-old. As many as three of the dead may be 
American. 
</P>
<P>
The four men already in custody "didn't demonstrate any remorse at all," said 
Neck. "They were laughing and giggling." 
</P>
<P>
The quartet was paraded onto a second floor balcony Wednesday at the Matamoros 
headquarters of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police, while more than 100 
reporters from both sides of the border stood on the overgrown lawn below and 
shouted questions. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Martinez, 23, told the crowd that yes, he was guilty of kidnaping 
Kilroy. 
</P>
<P>
Serafin Hernandez Garcia, 22, an American from Brownsville, said that he was 
part of the kidnaping team. He, unlike the others, spoke in English. "We took 
him to the ranch," he said. "I didn't do nothing, but the other ones, they 
killed him. They killed him with a machete." 
</P>
<P>
Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22, whose father owns the ranch, said that some of the 
killings were out of vengeance, but others "we killed for protection." He said 
he shot and killed one victim and decapitated another. 
</P>
<P>
David Serna Valdez, 22, said they had to give chase to Kilroy, after he tried 
to escape. Why Kilroy? "No reason, he just happened to be there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican police said they had arrested a fifth suspect, but he was not brought 
forward. Mattox estimated that the ring smuggled about 1,000 pounds of 
marijuana a week into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
James Kilroy said his son "was afraid of narcotics but it was narcotics that 
killed Mark. Marijuana was what killed Mark."
