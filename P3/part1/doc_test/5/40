battles and media intrusion, has Bill Clinton learnt the ropes as US
president?

Thirty years ago, in John Kennedy's time, about three-quarters of the
American public had an underlying faith in their national government to get
things broadly right. Today that proportion is barely more than one-fifth.
Cynicism has even grown over the past year. When Bill Clinton became the
42nd president of the United States, over 70 per cent were confident that he
could bring about at least some of his promised 'change' to the governance
of the country. After one of the busiest and most legislatively successful
first years in two generations of presidents, only a little over half could
say they had seen 'change'.
If public opinion was all that mattered - and it does matter a lot to a
president with sensitive populist antennae - then Mr Clinton would, at best,
be enjoying a mixed Christmas. His own ratings have been rising again on the
back of an improving economy and big victories in Congress such as on Nafta,
but are still modest enough by historical standards. Just when it seems the
country is becoming more comfortable with him, he is dogged by stories, many
of them old, wild and politically motivated, that his private and financial
life has been less than pristine. The convenient silence that masked what
presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy did in their spare time has been replaced
by an inquisitive public cacophony.
For the record, these charges, by state troopers and old political enemies
in Arkansas, are that sexual liaisons were arranged for him while he was
governor, and possibly afterwards; that his wife, Hillary, had an affair
with Vincent Foster, her Little Rock law partner and later White House legal
counsel who committed suicide last summer; that a real estate investment in
the mid-1980s by the Clintons in partnership with the former chief executive
of a now defunct Arkansas savings and loan institution may have involved the
improper diversion of funds for political purposes, of which Mr Foster may
have been aware. The Clintons have denied all the allegations.
In part Mr Clinton is the victim of circumstances beyond his considerable
abilities to control. Having used the proliferating new media well to get
elected, he is now the invariable target of an ubiquitous punditocracy
making instant judgments on everything that moves. It is simply no longer
possible for a president to command the heights of network television and
establishment newspapers, as Ronald Reagan could a decade ago, now that news
and opinion flash instantly across a melange of cable stations, computer
screens and talk shows.
Political Washington has also refused to go down on bended knee to a
president demanding that it end gridlock. Party discipline has ceased to
mean much, unless the Republicans coalesce to resist tax increases or dig in
over gun control. On the deficit-cutting budget act and Nafta, defeat for
either of which would have been disastrous for his presidency, Mr Clinton
won the support of only 27 out of 53 Democratic senators and 78 of 258
Democratic members of the House.
With the Democrats often unwilling to act like a 'presidential' party, each
legislative battle has to be approached anew to put together a perennially
shifting, but winning, coalition. How healthcare fares next year is anyone's
guess as mid-term elections approach. Many Democrats, aware that they have
lost the six biggest state and mayoral elections since Mr Clinton won in
November last year, consider too close an association with him a political
liability.
In these circumstances, it is a minor miracle that he has achieved so much.
As he reflected in one of many year-end interviews, 'my biggest surprise in
a negative sense - one I shouldn't have been surprised by - is that there
really is a Washington culture that needs to be changed but has to be dealt
with if you want to get anything done'.
In that dealing, however, Mr Clinton and his team have not always been
adept. They got off to a bad start when two women, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood,
were disqualified from serving as attorney general because of 'nannygate'
problems (indeed, the pace of appointments to senior government positions
remains disappointingly slow, with the White House to blame as much as
Congress). Redeeming a campaign promise to force the military to end its ban
on homosexuals proved a protracted distraction. There was a badly handled
scandal in the White House travel office. The Republicans sandbagged the
Dollars 17bn mini-stimulus package and the economy took time to pick up.
Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia all brought foreign policy grief. Relations
between the White House and a critical media reached a nadir.
Three factors lay behind the mid-summer turnround. David Gergen, denizen of
past Republican administrations, was recruited as chief spin doctor, at
which he is an artist, with George Stephanopoulos moved to his proper place
as a policy adviser. Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be a popular choice to
fill Mr Clinton's first vacancy on the Supreme Court (the first Democratic
appointee in 26 years). And, after a strenuous and bitter debate, the budget
act prevailed - by precisely one vote in the House.
The budget victory proved particularly important because it demonstrated
that Mr Clinton, suspected of being a softie, could exert political muscle.
Some earlier successes in Congress (such as the family leave bill
guaranteeing employment rights) were long in the legislative pipeline,
blocked only by President George Bush's vetoes. But the next battle, Nafta,
was one in which it appeared that Mr Clinton, off to a late start, might
lose. Not only did he win with some ease in the end, but his trade
negotiators delivered a generally applauded Uruguay Round agreement.
Capping the year, the Brady bill was passed after seven years of failure
under Republican administrations, with the promise of more gun control
proposals next year. More than that, he responded to public angst over the
crime wave with a series of hardheaded speeches, one to the Reverend Martin
Luther King's old church in Memphis, on the need for individuals to assume
responsibility for the safety of their own communities.
But even this record leaves Washington and the wider public wondering if the
president and his administration have learnt the ropes. This brings to mind
a prescient comment last year by James Carville, his campaign manager. Mr
Clinton, he said, 'is a man blessed - or cursed - with the ability to make
connections' in policy terms.
Being smart and curious he compartmentalises very little, though even some
friends think he has some difficulty differentiating between the merely
interesting (because everything is interesting) and the truly important. One
small indication was his FT interview in July when he digressed at length on
the contrasts in structural unemployment between France, Germany and Japan -
not the US. He knew his stuff but your correspondent was accustomed to
hearing such detailed views from an assistant secretary of state or the
Treasury - not from a man with as much on his plate as the president.
Thus his administration has come to resemble not a Reagan or Bush pyramid,
when only the most important subjects ever reached the presidential desk,
but a wheel in which all spokes point to the Oval Office. As a result of
this, combined with his insistence on collegiality, few of his cabinet can
be said really to have emerged as forces in their own right. Bruce Babbitt
at interior and Henry Cisneros at housing have, as did Janet Reno, the
attorney general, after the Waco debacle but before the sophisticated
Washington scalpels were turned in the direction of this plain-speaking
daughter of a Florida alligator wrestler. Even a conspicuously effective
Treasury operates very much as part of the team and its secretary, Lloyd
Bentsen, is said to be contemplating retirement within a year.
No part of his government has taken more of a public pummelling than the
foreign policy team, which is a problem for a president who came to office
with a keen intellectual interest in external affairs but needing
experienced guidance through the thicket. Mr Clinton had deliberately
emphasised his domestic priorities by breaking with tradition a year ago in
naming first his economic and social policy cabinet, and its first departure
proved to be Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, because he had lost his
president's confidence. Mr Clinton only left the country on an extended trip
once this year - pegged to a Group of Seven summit in Tokyo that required
his attendance.
The main complaint is the lack of a conceptual framework and coherent
strategies for grappling with the complex post-cold war world. Some
criticisms may not be entirely fair; none of the trilogy of Bosnia, Somalia
and Haiti is exactly central to US national interests and all were inherited
and intractable problems. Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, may be
no visionary - as yesterday's appointment of Mr Strobe Talbott as his new
deputy implicitly recognises - but he thinks his way through issues and his
caution means the US is unlikely to rush into some quagmire from which it
extricates itself only with great pain.
Still, initial pledges of a new multilateralism have proved an on-again
off-again experience, with growing distrust of the United Nations apparatus.
Relations with western Europe, rocked over Bosnia, could be improved.
Constancy has been displayed in putting economic security on the front
burner of foreign policy, in backing Middle East peace negotiations and in
supporting reform in Russia, though that confidence has now been dented by
this month's elections. Mr Clinton has at least five big foreign trips on
his new year itinerary, four to Europe, one to Asia with diversions, for
example, to the Middle East, always possible, but this may only mean even
more spokes of the administration wheel pointing to his overcrowded desk.
Yet, the ups and downs of the first year notwithstanding, there has been a
sense of exhilaration and innovation in Washington unlike any other western
capital, even if their impact is still not measurable on Gallup's Richter
scale. And most of them flow from the president and, in important social
policy respects, from his wife. His first year might not be entirely as he
would have wished but, as a start, it was, on balance, impressive. A senior
member of the Bush administration has taken to warning that Mr Clinton might
get re-elected in 1996. Clearly he must be doing something right.
