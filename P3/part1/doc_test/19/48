FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (13): Do winners
succeed in the real world? - It is one thing to win prizes for ingenious
engineering. It is another for bright ideas to gain serious commercial
application. Clive Cookson examines the subsequent fate of some celebrated
UK award winners / Prizes for Innovation

Britain's premier prize for engineering innovation, the Royal Academy of
Engineering's Pounds 50,000 MacRobert Award, celebrates its 25th anniversary
this year. The roll of past winners demonstrates that the UK has continued
to display engineering skills in strength and breadth, through a quarter
century of decline in most of the country's manufacturing industries.
The MacRobert winners have been so diverse in their objectives that it is
impossible to lay down any general criteria for success or failure. But an
impressionistic analysis of the track record of the 29 innovations
recognised so far (a few years have had joint winners) shows that only two
or three failed completely to live up to the promise seen when they won the
award. Of the remainder, about half became unqualified successes and half
have enjoyed more limited but still significant success.
The inaugural award in 1969 was shared between Freeman, Fox and Partners for
the Severn Bridge - still considered a significant international innovation
in the design of suspension bridges - and Rolls Royce for the Pegasus jet
engine - still operating successfully on Harrier vertical take-off aircraft.
The 1970 winner is an example of an innovation which became a huge success
while remaining virtually unknown to the general public, because it involves
a process far removed from any consumer product. Three BP geophysicists won
the award for developing techniques for surveying accurately in Alaska
through arctic permafrost (permanently frozen ground). Their techniques
enabled BP to discover Alaskan oilfields worth billions of dollars.
BP was to win the award again in 1992 for another innovation that was
invisible to the public but worth a fortune to the company: hydraulic
fracturing technology that allowed oil and gas reserves to be exploited more
efficiently. BP estimated that this had saved Pounds 275m by the end of
1991.
The Gas Council (now British Gas) won the 1971 award for processes to
convert naphtha, the main petrochemical feedstock, to town gas. This was a
good example of an innovation that did not live up to its commercial promise
 -not because of any intrinsic failure but because external events did not
turn out as expected. The discovery of plentiful natural gas in the North
Sea and elsewhere made the processes for manufacturing town gas unnecessary.
The 1972 prize went to Sir Godfrey Hounsfield and EMI for inventing a new
type of X-ray scanner for diagnosing brain disease. Computerised tomography,
as it was called, was a stunning technical success, for which Sir Godfrey
won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1979. Unfortunately EMI itself failed to
capitalise on the initial innovation  - a classic lost opportunity for
British business - but medical equipment manufacturers overseas put CT
scanners into production and the technology has benefited patients
worldwide.
The 1973 winner was a more comprehensive failure: Dunlop's Denovo run-flat
tyre. It was not exploited by Dunlop or by anyone else in the motor
industry.
After making risky choices in the two previous years, the MacRobert
evaluation committee played safe in 1974 and awarded the prize to ICI for a
system that was already a proven commercial success in industrial chemistry:
high activity catalysts for making methanol. These have earned ICI
substantial royalties from overseas licences.
There was a double award again in 1975. Westland won the prize for
innovations on the Lynx helicopter (the semi-rigid rotor and conformal
gearing); the Lynx has turned out to be one of Westland's most successful
models.
The other 1975 winner was British Rail for developments in railway vehicle
suspensions. Part of this project led to one of BR's most ignominious
failures, the Advanced Passenger Train, but the work was not a total
disaster. It also led to improved suspension systems in other, more
successful trains.
The next year, 1976, was the only one so far in which the MacRobert
evaluation committee judged that none of the candidates was worthy of an
award.
The 1977 prize went to the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment and Malvern
Instruments for their joint development of an electro-optical instrument,
the Malvern Correlator, which uses laser scattering to measure the flow of
particles in a fluid. It has been applied widely in the chemical and
aerospace industries. The Correlator is a good example of something that
still happens too rarely in Britain - successful transfer of know-how from
defence research to civil industry.
Pilkington won the 1978 prize for its high-strength Ten-Twenty laminated
windscreen. This illustrates the unpredictable commercial consequences of
industrial innovation.
Although Pilkington had expected the main application of Ten-Twenty to be in
cars, the automotive manufacturers took little interest in it; they were
happy to continue with cheaper, lower performance windscreens. Instead, it
enjoyed commercial success in aircraft cockpits. The 1979 prize was the
first awarded for computer software. It went to Post Office
Telecommunications (now BT) for the Prestel viewdata system, which enabled
subscribers to call up written information over the telephone lines.
Although the system was technically a world leader - and was sold to five
other countries - Prestel did not take off on the grand scale its inventors
had envisaged.
On the other hand the 1980 winner, Johnson Matthey's catalytic system for
reducing vehicle exhaust emissions, has been an unqualified long-term
success. The company has remained the world's leading supplier of auto
catalysts.
The 1981 winner, the Microjector developed by Lucas as a miniature fuel
injector for diesel engines, was also aimed at the automotive industry. Its
initial export sales in the US were astonishing; in the first two years
Lucas shipped 2.5m Microjectors to Oldsmobile alone. But then Detroit turned
against diesel cars and the Microjector's commercial success faded away.
This article focuses on the first half of the MacRobert Award's track record
because enough time has passed to see the successes and failures in
long-term perspective.
The jury is still out on some of the more recent winners although a few,
such as Oxford Instruments' superconducting magnets for body scanners (1986
prize), are obvious long-term successes.
When the MacRobert Trust first established the award in the late 1960s, it
was worth Pounds 25,000 - more than a Nobel Prize at the time. But while the
Nobels kept pace with inflation, the MacRobert stuck at Pounds 25,000 until
last year when its value was doubled to Pounds 50,000.
In the world of engineering, the biggest award is now the Dollars 375,000
Charles Stark Draper Prize established by the US National Academy of
Engineering in 1988. In contrast to the MacRobert, which recognises recent
or current work in the UK, the perspective of the Draper prize is both
historical and global - in 1991 it went to Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain
for their work 50 years earlier developing jet engines in Britain and
Germany respectively. The greatest accolade for a MacRobert Award winner
would be to pick up a Draper Prize a few decades later.
