  [Text] Cape Town March 23 SAPA -- Former US Secretary of 
State and Nobel Peace Laureate Henry Kissinger and British 
Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington will serve on a mediation 
commission to settle the kwaZulu/Natal constitutional dispute. 
  Senior negotiation sources confirmed on Wednesday [23 March] 
that Mr Kissinger would head the commission which must decide on 
the federalist content of the new transitional constitution. It 
is understood that the commission would comprise four men, the 
other two being from the USA and India. 
  The same sources said that agreement had been reached 
between 
the two disputing parties -- the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and 
ANC [African National Congress] -- that they would abide by the 
decision of the mediators. 
  It was also agreed that if the mediators ruled in favour of 
the IFP, it could lead to a postponement of the April 27 
election. 
  The ANC and IFP agreed to mediation on the issue of 
federalism which the IFP claims is not present in the interim 
constitution. It is demanding more regional powers for the 
provinces and a greater measure of independence from the central 
government. 
  Mr Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his north 
Vietnamese negotiation counterpart for securing the agreement 
for the US withdrawal from Vietnam, thus ending the Vietnam War. 
Lord Carrington was the central mediator in the Lancaster House 
negotiations which brought about the end of Rhodesian UDI 
[Unilateral Declaration of Independence] and the war for the 
liberation of Zimbabwe.
