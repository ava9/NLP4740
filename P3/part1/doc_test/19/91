PRESIDENT Jorge Serrano of Guatemala was ousted yesterday by a combination
of military and opposition leaders.
General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, defence minister, took over temporarily
but a government communique later said Vice-President Gustavo Espina
Salguero would assume presidential duties until a new election. It also said
Congress and the Supreme Court would remain dissolved.
Congressman Fernando Linares Beltranena and other congressmen said the
military was meeting legislators to prepare for an extraordinary session of
Congress today and to elect a provisional successor. But, after the
communique, it was not clear whether the session would occur.
Mr Linares said that, although Gen Garca had taken charge, he believed the
military 'wants to keep aloof' and that there would be a civilian successor
to Mr Serrano.
The presidency in a general's hands could mean a return to the full military
rule which Guatemala knows well.
A government statement said the president's departure had arisen from a
consensus but Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan indigenous leader who won
the Nobel Peace Prize last year, called it a military coup 'with a civilian
facade' and walked out of talks about the succession. A group of union
leaders went with her.
Early yesterday members of Guatemala's Congress were summoned to the
presidential palace. Hundreds of people outside the palace were shouting
pro-democracy slogans as the Congress members began to arrive. 'Serrano has
fallen, Serrano has fallen,' they cheered as they let off fireworks.
The Mexican television station ECO reported from Guatemala City that Gen
Garca had asked Mr Serrano, who snatched authoritarian powers last week when
he suspended Congress and the Supreme Court, to step down. Business and
labour groups were also pressing for the president to quit and there had
been much unrest in Guatemala City during the past week over declining
living standards.
Business had jitters about losing trading benefits under the generalised
system of preferences - a possibility raised by the US State Department -
which could affect Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of exports. The US, the
European Community and Japan blocked tens of millions of dollars in aid to
Guatemala.
Mr Serrano was elected in 1990 to a five-year term which he began in January
1991.
