  [Text] Guatemala City, 10 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Today 
Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Indian who won the Nobel Peace 
Prize, turned down the Zapatista National Liberation Army's 
(EZLN) invitation to mediate in an effort to end the armed 
insurrection which this group started against the Mexican 
Government in Chiapas State. 
  "It would be controversial to play a role in a neighboring 
state's problem when I have not done it in my own country," 
Menchu said at a news conference, where she deplored the fact 
that the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have not asked her to mediate. 
  Menchu said she was expressing her view on this matter 
because of the expectations that had been raised concerning the 
EZLN proposal, although, she stressed, the request to mediate 
was not made officially in a written document.
