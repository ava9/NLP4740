NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

In response to Cal Thomas' "Reagan's Doing, Gorbachev's Glory" (Commentary, 
Oct. 19): 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Peace Prize for Reagan, not Gorbachev? Sour grapes! While Gorbachev 
was disengaging Leonid Brezhnev's army from Afghanistan, Reagan had resumed 
U.S. military aid to nuclear Iraq, reversing the embargo Jimmy Carter had begun 
in response to Saddam Hussein's atrocities -- crimes that both Reagan and Bush 
have chosen to ignore until recently when an excuse was needed to prepare for 
war over oil. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev would have reformed the Soviet Union regardless of who was President 
of the United States; but the Berlin Wall would still be standing today if the 
Soviet conservative were still in power. Reagan deserves some credit for 
neutralizing the American war lobby over the issue of cooperating with our 
former enemies, but compared to the magnitude of Gorbachev's challenges to the 
conservative rottenness of his own political party, Reagan's contribution is 
minor.
