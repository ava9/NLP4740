A kidnapped Israeli soldier, three of his Islamic extremist captors and one
would-be rescuer were killed last night in a failed rescue mission in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The kidnappers shot their hostage while he was bound, the Israelis said.
The bloody end to Israel's kidnap crisis - which began six days ago when
Hamas extremists seized 19-year-old Corporal Nachshon Waxman - leaves the
Middle East peace process in doubt, and overshadowed the award of the Nobel
peace prize yesterday to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, Mr Yassir
Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and Mr Shimon
Peres, Israeli foreign minister.
Israeli officials said a crack army unit had stormed the house where Cpl
Waxman was being held in a village between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the West
Bank commercial centre.
The raid happened just hours after Hamas had extended by 24 hours
yesterday's deadline to kill Cpl Waxman unless the Israeli government
released 200 Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
group's spiritual leader.
The shootings will widen the gulf between Hamas, which opposes peace with
Israel and wants to destroy the Jewish state, and the Israeli and
Palestinian officials seeking to consolidate their fragile peace process.
Israel suspended peace talks after the kidnapping and told Mr Arafat he
would have to choose between dealing with Hamas and peace with Israel.
Mr Arafat made strenuous efforts to secure the release of Cpl Waxman,
rounding up more than 200 Hamas activists in Gaza and seeking to negotiate
the soldier's release.
As Cpl Waxman was found in the West Bank area still controlled by the
Israeli army and not, as Mr Rabin had earlier insisted, in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza, Mr Arafat will be able to argue that once he
takes over all the West Bank from Israel he will be able to police Hamas
better.
But many senior Israeli officials believe Mr Arafat has yet to take the
decisions necessary to deal with Hamas. They will use last night's tragedy
to pile pressure on Mr Rabin to force Mr Arafat into a head-on confrontation
with Hamas.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who met Mr Arafat in Egypt
yesterday, told the PLO leader to 'confront the reign of terror imposed by
Hamas'.
Hamas, outraged at the wide scale arrests of its activists, has also
demanded that Mr Arafat choose - between Hamas and the peace process. In a
thinly veiled threat of internal Palestinian conflict Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a
leading Hamas activist in Gaza, warned that Mr Arafat would 'suffer the
consequences' if he continued his clampdown.
Mr Arafat's aides have cautioned against making demands for an all-out
confrontation with Hamas, saying the peace deal is still too fragile to
guarantee that the pro-peace forces would win. They warn that such a
confrontation could erupt into civil war.
