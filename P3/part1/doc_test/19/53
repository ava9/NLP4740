This week's demobilization of the Nicaraguan rebel army included a powerful act 
of symbolism for all Central America. When the Contras' weapons, last fired 
only weeks ago, were sliced in half by blowtorches, it proved the power of 
words over the roar of cannons. It was words -- dialogue, peace negotiations -- 
that convinced both sides in the Nicaraguan conflict to hold elections, to 
accept the outcome and, finally, to beat their swords into plowshares. 
</P>
<P>
Not once in the eight years of the civil war did military pressure bring the 
Sandinista government and the Contra leadership face to face. Superpower 
posturing didn't lead to solutions, either. The conflict simply exhausted 
Nicaraguans, who were more concerned with putting food on the table and keeping 
sons out of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the Iran-Contra scandal left Washington with a Central American 
policy vacuum did Nicaragua's political agenda revert to the region's leaders: 
Most notably former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won a Nobel Peace 
Prize for authoring the peace plan that led to Nicaragua's elections. And only 
after U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off did they finally sit down to 
seriously negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
United States policy-makers, in particular, must understand the value that 
simple dialogue played in bringing this long war to an end. Negotiations must 
also be pushed in nearby El Salvador, where a shorter but bloodier civil war 
still rages with U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for the government side. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, must scramble to forge 
national unity among those who have spent a decade doing battle with one 
another. And she must salvage her country's economy, shattered after years of 
war. That's where U.S. policy-makers must focus their efforts to help Nicaragua 
now. And they must do so with all the zeal they showed while supporting the 
Contras for far too long.
