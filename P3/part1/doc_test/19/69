The five presidents of Central America apparently have agreed to hold a 
long-delayed regional peace summit Feb. 8-9 in El Salvador, Nicaraguan 
officials said. A senior Foreign Ministry official said the summit, postponed 
four times since last August, "is almost a sure thing". A government statement 
said Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega telephoned the leaders of Guatemala and 
Costa Rica to confirm the dates. President Oscar Arnulfo Arias of Costa Rica, 
who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his regional peace plan, had asked that 
a meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 be postponed until President-elect Bush takes 
office today.
