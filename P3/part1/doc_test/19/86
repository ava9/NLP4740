  [Text] Gurupur (Mysore), Dec. 24--The Nobel peace prize 
winner and religious head, the Dalai Lama, has expressed deep 
concern over the cultural genocide, human rights violation and 
environmental degradation taking place in Chinese-occupied 
Tibet, and said that "all these events will have a direct, 
long-term bearing on India's security." 
  He told reporters here that he noticed a change in the 
perceptions of the politicians in the country on the Tibet issue 
over a period of time, and attributed this to the decline in 
"moral spirit, self-confidence and courage" among politicians of 
the post-independence era. 
  However, he said, more stronger feeling and seriousness was 
being witnessed among the Indian intellectuals and the student 
community on the sovereignty of Tibet. 
  Referring to India's policy on China in regard to Tibet, the 
Dalai Lama said India was "over-cautious." He said India 
accepting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet was a "mistaken 
commitment." 
  "At least India should describe Tibet as an "autonomous 
region" of China, like the British, he felt and disclosed that 
Indian legal experts on various occasions had questioned and 
confronted the stand of the Indian government in this connection. 
  The Dalai Lama appeared apologetic towards the Indian 
government's predicament and said "It is not easy for a big 
nation like India to effect change in policy on an international 
issue as it involves various factors and aspects." 
  On the collapse of the eastern bloc, the spiritual head said 
the collapse of communism had both positive and negative effects 
on the Tibetan issue and their fight for freedom. 
  When asked about the opinion on Tibet in western countries 
and America, the Dalai Lama replied that several western 
nations, including America, had confirmed the fact that Tibet 
was an "occupied land" and both the houses of the United States 
had accepted this. 
  He expressed his deep gratitude to the government of India, 
and especially the government of Karnataka, for their support to 
the Tibetan refugees settled in the state. "The Tibetans in 
India have preserved their culture and spirituality, all because 
of positive help rendered by the state and Union government," he 
said.
