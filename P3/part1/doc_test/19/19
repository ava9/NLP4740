<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been renominated for the 1990 Nobel 
Peace Prize, a source at the Nobel Institute said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has been proposed," said the source at the Norwegian Nobel 
Institute, which traditionally declines to confirm or deny the names of the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader was nominated in 1988 and 1989, but the prize went to the 
U.N. peacekeeping forces and Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Both times Gorbachev shared the nomination with former President Ronald Reagan 
for their signing of an intermediate-range nuclear forces agreement. The source 
said the institute had received no nomination for Reagan.
