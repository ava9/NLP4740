Lech Walesa, whose Solidarity trade union helped force the Polish government to 
adopt sweeping democratic reforms, said he is considering running for the newly 
created office of president of Poland. "I'm being strongly pressed. Different 
people are pressing me and I am thinking about being a candidate to the highest 
(post) that is going to be in Poland," Walesa said at a news conference in his 
home city of Gdansk. However, he ruled out running for the newly created 
100-member Senate, which will be the East Bloc's first freely elected 
legislative chamber, or the existing 460-member Sejm, where the opposition can 
run for 35% of the seats. The two bodies meet later this year to elect a new 
president, and the post is expected to go to Communist Party First Secretary 
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski due to the majority still guaranteed to the Community 
Party and its allies in the larger Sejm. If that happens, Walesa said he will 
probably run in the next presidential election six years from now. "I am a man 
of big interests," said Walesa, an electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize 
for founding the East Bloc's first independent trade union during a 1980 strike 
at the Gdansk shipyard. The opposition and communist authorities reached a 
historic agreement April 5 to restore the union's legal status and allow 
independent candidates to run for parliament in June.

 -- A feisty German shepherd proved conclusively to his young master that a dog 
is a boy's best friend. The pooch, aptly named Buddy, saved 5-year-old Brandon 
Rodriguez from a vicious pit bulldog that attacked him as the boy played in the 
front yard of his Fresno home. The pit bull bit Brandon's leg, and Brandon ran 
to the house with the dog hanging on. When he opened the door, Buddy rushed out 
and forced the pit bull away from Brandon. As the two dogs fought, Brandon's 
brother, Jerry Myers, 19, killed the pit bull with two shotgun blasts. Brandon 
was treated at a hospital for three puncture wounds, and Buddy was treated for 
bites to two paws and minor injuries from two shotgun pellets. Buddy's reward, 
in addition to Brandon's everlasting devotion: a steak breakfast.

 -- A 5-year-old Mt. Healthy, Ohio, girl who fell an estimated 25 feet from a 
Ferris wheel when it stopped abruptly was saved from serious injury or death 
when she fell into her father's arms. The ride operator had just unfastened the 
safety bar across the laps of Rachel McAdams and her sister Margot, 6, when the 
Ferris wheel inexplicably started up. When it abruptly stopped, Rachel lost her 
balance and fell. She glanced off another of the cars and then her father, 
Mack, caught her for an instant before she hit the ground. She suffered head 
bruises and a broken tooth. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN
