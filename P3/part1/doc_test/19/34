Czech playwright Vaclav Havel plans to donate a $13,000 literary award to the 
West German book trade to help banned Eastern Bloc authors get their works 
published. Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident and a 1989 Nobel 
Peace Prize nominee, was not allowed to travel to Frankfurt to accept an annual 
peace prize awarded by the book trade. His acceptance speech announcing his 
donation was read by Swiss actor Maximilian Schell. STEVE WEINSTEIN
