<F P=106> [Article signed MJ; SH: "NPC President Visits Geneva; Qiao </F>
Shi Welcomed at CERN by Chinese Nobel Prize Winner"; as released 
by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Excerpt] Geneva, 25 Jan (ATSA) -- Qiao Shi, president of 
the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC], was received on 
Tuesday [25 January] by the authorities of the Geneva Canton and 
municipality. He previously had visited the Castle at Chillon 
and the European Organization of Nuclear Research [CERN], the 
only stops in the French-speaking part during his four-day visit 
to Switzerland, which he will conclude on Wednesday in Zurich. 
  The third highest-ranking Chinese was received early Tuesday 
afternoon by Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith, new director 
general of the organization, and by Professor Samuel C.C. Ting, 
Chinese scientist and Nobel Peace Prize winner for physics. The 
spokesperson of the CERN press service indicated that Mr. Qiao, 
accompanied by 60 persons, visited the LEP [Large Electron 
Positron Collider] where Mr. Ting works. 
  CERN is an intergovernmental organization grouping 19 
countries. It employs 3,000 persons and works with some 6,000 
scientists, of whom about 100 are Chinese. For 1993, its global 
budget nears 1 billion Swiss francs. The principal financial 
backers are, in decreasing order, Germany, Italy, France, and 
the United Kingdom. 
  After his visit to CERN, which is situated on the 
Swiss-French border, the NPC president was received at Geneva's 
city hall. [passage omitted]
