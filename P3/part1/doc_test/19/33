The Chinese press lashed out at the choice of the Dalai Lama for the Nobel 
Peace Prize, charging that the choice was politically motivated and instigated 
by "some Western countries" to pressure China. The exiled spiritual leader of 
Tibet's Buddhists accepted the award in Norway two days ago. The Dalai Lama 
fled the Himalayan country in 1959 after an abortive uprising put down by 
Chinese troops. The Chinese government portrays him as a separatist who incites 
anti-Chinese sentiment in Tibet.
