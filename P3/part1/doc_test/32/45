All this little piggy wants to do is stay in Burbank. But city officials say 
Arnold, a miniature pig with a bulging belly, belongs on a farm, not in Robert 
Ridenour's suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour was cited last month for keeping Arnold, a Vietnamese potbellied pig, 
at his house on Grinnell Drive. Ridenour, however, is challenging the citation, 
claiming that his foot-high, 45-pound pig is a far cry from the 800-pound 
oinkers that win blue ribbons at the county fair and that city ordinances were 
intended to prohibit. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold is the victim of prejudice and misunderstanding, Ridenour said. The 
citation, which would require Ridenour to get rid of his pet, is on hold 
pending a review by the Burbank City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The pig was given to Ridenour's roommate by Jackie Stallone, Sylvester's 
mother. She reportedly bought it as a birthday gift for one of her sons, but 
the surprise was not well received and she gave Arnold to Ridenour and Steve 
Erhardt to watch until a permanent home could be found. 
</P>
<P>
That was three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ridenour and Erhardt have decided to keep Arnold, who they say is 
cleaner and smarter than their dog, Oki. The housebroken pig has been trained 
to come when called, sit on command and climb up stepladders. 
</P>
<P>
Miniature Vietnamese pigs are short and black with round bellies that nearly 
drag on the ground. They have become chic pets since they were introduced in 
this country four years ago, with females selling for as much as $3,500, said 
Phyllis Frisbey, founder of the Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Frisbey estimated that several hundred Southern California residents own the 
pigs but are reluctant to go public because they are illegal in many cities, 
including Los Angeles. "Some people are pig prejudiced," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ridenour nor Burbank animal control authorities were certain Monday who 
squealed about Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
The National Animal Disease Center, a branch of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, has said Vietnamese pigs pose less of a health threat to humans 
than cats or dogs and, when cared for properly, are cleaner than other domestic 
pets. Even so, many cities refuse to allow the pigs as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burbank officials acknowledge that the pigs may make good pets, they 
still are illegal under the Burbank Municipal Code. A pig is a pig and a pig is 
illegal, according to Section 6-301, which outlaws more than 90 animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an ordinance that says no pigs. It's as simple as that," said Fred 
DeLange, superintendent of the Burbank Animal Shelter. "It doesn't say anything 
about Vietnamese potbellied pigs. It just says no pigs." 
</P>
<P>
The same ordinance also prohibits lions, tigers and bears. Horses are allowed 
in some neighborhoods that have appropriate zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles prohibits farm animals except on land zoned for agriculture, but 
Frisbey said her 60-member association is trying to persuade the City Council 
to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Monterey Park became the first city in the county to allow 
residents to keep the pigs as pets, one per household. "We found that they made 
pretty good pets," Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have not been so flexible. In La Habra Heights, for example, a 
couple said they would rather move than give up their two pigs, Elmer and Miss 
Piggy. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour said that if the City Council does not allow the miniature pigs to 
live in Burbank, he will challenge the ordinance in court.
