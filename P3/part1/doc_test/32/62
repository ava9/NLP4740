FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Decision on piggy-back freight ridiculous

Sir, It is ridiculous that there will be no upgrading of rail lines to take
'ro-ro' piggy-back lorries and freight from tho continent on British tracks
('Rail switch for channel ruled out', October 28).
This association was instrumental some years ago in putting forward evidence
to the government that it would be preferable to have a twin-bored tunnel
link with a sufficient bore to take such freight transport - and that this
would be better than the proposed BR 'mouse-hole' with a single tunnel
passenger train facility. This was in October 1980. Now, after 12 years, a
main raison d'etre of the tunnel has been taken away at a stoke.
There are reasons why lorry drivers may prefer ferries - mainly because it
provides a rest period on the tachograph. The knock-on effect, however, will
be to restrict benefits of the tunnel being expanded to areas of the country
away from the metropolis and from the south-east; particularly economic help
to the north-east, north-west, Tyneside, etc. Apart from unnecessary delays
in decisions and their implementation, this news must be the last straw for
many businesses which will now either move to north-east France or not move
to our development areas, as the case may be.
There are other reasons for transfer of freight to rail transport -
particularly environmental ones such as preservation of fossil fuels.
The tunnel links in all forms have been subject to short termism. We feel
that the authorities should now look ahead over 20 and 30 years and more and
look to a proper infrastructure. All this at a time when within two months
the first train will be run through the tunnel.
