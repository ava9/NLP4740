CLERIHEW-composing can easily become an addictive occupation, as many
competitors confessed. 'Once one has started,' said Christopher Mylne, 'it
is difficult to stop thinking up silly rhymes to fit - though I admit to
being defeated by Tchaikovsky. . .'
The task, you will recall, was to make up new clerihews about composers and
musicians. Mr C. Thwaites reminded me of 'an oldie but goodie' - Jules
Massenet/ Never wrote /A Mass/ In A. And Mary Holtby remembered from
childhood another vintage item - Palestrina/ Wrote a concerto for the
concertina/ Which Monteverdi/ Orchestrated for the hurdy-gurdy.
No one thought of including any of my music critic friends on the lines of
this one, c1930: 'Next week', said Ernest Newman,/ 'It will be Schumann'./
But when next week came/ It was Wagner just the same.
I had to stop counting the number of times conductors such as Henry Wood or
Andre Previn or George Solti (another difficult rhyme) sat on/ the baton; or
the occasions when Maria Callas/ sang in Dallas; or when some poor composer
could not hold a candle/ to Handel. Pavarotti was frequently grotty, and
quite often dotty, and there were unkind observations as to the size of his
botty. Nigel Kennedy was more often than not discovered playing a threnody
with the aggressive termination from Freda Smithson of an over-ripe tomato/
interrupting his pizzicato.
Johann Sebastian Bach/ always got up with the lark (Dian Shervinton), or if
not, he sat in the dark (W. Roll) but that - as more than one entry pointed
out - did not curtail his procreative prowess. In contrast, Mahler sat in
the parlour (E Gifford) whereas Bizet/ sat on a bidet (Garbis Haddad),
Scriabin/ made an awful din (Graham Green), Souza was/ a bit of a boozer
(Andrew Stark) and Liszt was frequently hissed (B. Miller) and often, of
course, kissed, and on at least one occasion pissed (Ranald Boyle).
No cookie was shrewder, rhymed Eve Turner neatly, than Buxtehude. Sir Arnold
Bax Had no FAX (Brian Capon) (they had not been invented); Placido Domingo,
was said by Henry Moxon, to be always lucky at bingo, but, added Anthony
Brown, of that game Kiri/ Is weary. Hugo Wolf/ played golf (Peter J
Andrews), Humperdinck/ had rum to drink (Robin Fuller) and Schumann was only
human (Bernard McGinley).
Over fondness for pasta seemed to be the main affliction of Italian
musicians. Donizetti was addicted to spaghetti (OVS Heath), Boccherini to
fetuccini and tortellini (James Robertson) and Stefan Grapelli to
tagliatelli (Steven Berry). Puccini, however, suffered from baby marrows and
threw away his zucchini (Simon Hubbard-Ford).
Duke Ellington's penchant was somewhat implausibly for wellingtons
(Catherine Presswood), but Shirley Bassey had, more realistically, an
eloquent chassis (Sylvia Trump) and one that is classy (Eric Pearce).
Several people had James Galway either leaving or not leaving his flute in
the hallway. D. Rhys-Williams envisaged Neil Kinnock in a dispute over Early
Music with Trevor Pinnock. And Isobel Baillie/ Raised high notes gaily (WID
Scott).
It was Peter Read who, when he switched on the Beeb/, ingeniously listened
to the strains of Delibes. George Formby, we are assured by John Adams, once
passed through the village of Quarmby.
No one found a convincing rhyme for Kanawa. Nor for Rameau, who was
learnedly celebrated by William and Jo Godfree (though this year is not, as
they seemed to think, the 300th anniversary of his birth in 1683). Brahms
appeared to be a favourite with the Thane of Glamis and also to have qualms/
When Joachim/ offered to have a go at him (Sir Toby Weaver).
Monica G Ribon voiced a universal dilemma when she asked Does Turandot/
Rhyme with 'forgot'/ Or is it Turandot/ As in 'I don't know'? Chopin was
hopin' (ouch]) to play with one hand/ on George Sand (Katie Mallett) and
Tristan told Isolde/ 'You don't look a day older' . . . (David Hussey). Both
Eve Turner and Prudence Raper had musicians taking Valium before embarking
on Spem in Alium.
The problem in many cases was the second couplet. So often a brilliant
beginning had crashed into bathos by line four. It is much more difficult to
compose a memorable clerihew than it looks. Perhaps the trick is not to try
too hard for your punch-line but just let it come naturally of its own
accord. Anyway, Pounds 30 each to all those whose clerihews are printed
below. They are the joint winners.
CLERIHEWS CON BRIO
Pergolesi
Doesn't send me crazy
But he's a better composer
Than Cimarosa.
(Ambrose Streatfeild
Harriet with icy look
Told Berlioz to sling his hook.
He then composed the Symphonie Fantastique
In utter pique.
(Rick Watson)
Benjamin Britten
Liked to have his ears bitten
By Peter Pears.
Poor old dears.
(B I Straton-Ferrier)
The future of jazz got darker
With Charlie Parker.
It finally sunk
With Thelonius Monk.
(Philip Skelsey)
Beniamono Gigli
If he were feeling cigli
Sometimes went a bit wobile
When singing La donna e mobile.
(Mrs Jean Platt)
Elton John
Goes on and on
He's not so funny,
But oh] the money.
(Donald Lloyd)
Maria Callas
First signed for Crystal Palace
But they let her go
To Milano.
(Ken Turner)
Peter Cornelius
Was only a three quarters genius,
But his Barber of Bagdad
Wasn't half bad.
(Garfield Black)
de Sylva, Brown and Henderson
With only their suspenders on
Danced in the street for joy
At writing Sonny Boy.
(Peter Marks)
Julian Bream
Dreamed a dream . . .
Lute stolen in Cuba
Replaced by a tuba.
(Alastair Norton)
FOR our second competition you were asked to send an extract from the
obituary of any fictional character. The deadpan style of the obituarist -
often skating on some pretty thin ice - is not difficult to mimic. Many of
the many attempts managed it all too convincingly.
Subjects for burial began with legendary and biblical figures such as the
Devil, Methusaleh (' . . . born into one of the oldest families on record .
. . was just at the peak of his career' - Marius Szafianski) Achilles,
Jonah, Grendel's Mother, the Ancient Mariner (' . . . although suffering
from a withered arm, his eyes never lost their glittering power' - J E
Smith).
King Arthur, Ulysses, Don Quixote, Brunnhilde ('Following her husband's
tragic death in a mugging incident, her name was romantically linked to that
of Gunther the Gibichung.' - Anthony Lyman-Dixon), Gandalf, The Pied Piper
('In an inspired career move, he became a pest control officer for the Weser
valley' - Mrs H. C Lee), The Wife of Bath ('It is heartening to think that
our sister's long battle with the Orthodontists is now over' - J McCormick),
were popular obituarees.
There were contemporaries such as Adrian Mole ('Although only in his 14th
year, Mole's perceptive analyses of family life and the strains implicit in
modern marriage, minutely chronicled as part of his daily observations, will
be immensely valued by future researchers' - D A Prince), Horace Rumpole and
Lord Dixon of Bushy Park ('Populary known as 'Lucky Jim' he made a
significant contribution to the dissemination of higher education' - Peter
Knight).
Characters from crime fiction were also popular candidates with Sherlock
Holmes, hotly pursued gravewards by Moriarty, Miss Marple, Poirot, Peter
Wimsey, and several James Bonds.
Shakespeare was a prime source. Lady Macbeth 'was a legendary hostess.
Dinner parties at Forres, begun with a sonorous knocking on the South
Chamber door, were eagerly attended by luminaries from every shade of the
political spectrum' (Guy Thomas).
Evelyn I Stark told us that: 'Financial circles were shocked to learn
yesterday of the murder of Polonius in what appears to have been a case of
mistaken identity. His 'Neither a borrower nor a lender be' speech, known as
the 'Elsinore Document' . . . has recently been adopted by many treasury
officials and advocates tight control of the money supply.'
S L Valdez chronicled the last days of King Lear: 'After fierce arguments
with his daughters, the king declared himself homeless and applied to
Berkshire County Council for assistance on the grounds of former residence
in Windsor. When this was turned down, the king joined fellow subjects in
Windsor Great Park's 'cardboard city' during the worst of the winter storms
and later collapsed'.
Dickens also inspired some brave efforts - Oliver Twist, for example: 'From
the earliest he scandalised devoted carers by his excessive gluttony; then
in his first employment, not only bullied his fellow workers, but left
without heeding statutory notice requirements' - Ken Turner.
There were several shots at Heathcliff with a noble attempt at his family
tree from John Rosselli. Then we had Bloom; Stephen Dedalus - ' . . . blown
up and killed by a terrorist bomb which he was about to plant in the lobby
of the Gresham Hotel in Dublin' - Shedden Alexander; Goldfinger; Anna
Karenina; Mr Collins ' . . . distinguished by his opposition to women's
ordination' - Mrs Patricia C Atkinson; both Dr and Mrs Proudie; Albertine in
one massive Proustian sentence (Alan Leslie) and many Bertie Woosters and
Billy Bunters (see the example below).
Even more persistent were figures from nursery rhyme and children's
literature with the death of Cock Robin way ahead at the top followed by
Snow White, Peter Pan, Peter Rabbit, BB Wolf, Miss Piggy, Noddy, Humpty
Dumpty - 'he was a good egg' (passim).
In fact, there was such a wealth of talent that the task of choosing the
eventual winners was even more fraught than usual. However here goes -
Pounds 50 each to those whose entries are printed below. They are
joint-winners, and thanks to everyone for a splendid record-breaking entry.
R I P
SHYLOCK Shylock was perhaps the most innovative financier of his time, and
his influence put Venetian capital markets on a more regulated footing. In
an era of speculative excess, when venture capital was frequently provided
on an 'old boy' basis, Shylock, a relative outsider, introduced loan
financing by way of the fixed-interest bond. His creative flair, however,
was seen to most effect in his novel penalty clauses, which gave the
bond-holder an exceptionally strong incentive to redeem the bond at the due
date. These instruments became known as 'funk bonds'.
His career ended controversially, in the so-called 'Balthazar Affair' (named
after the famous disappearing barrister), when Shylock's commercial logic
proved stronger meat than the business community of the day could stomach.
There are many, however, who believe that his trial verdict was unsafe.
(Noel Petty) CAPULET / MONTAGUE The dangers of drug abuse have been
highlighted this week by the tragic deaths of teenagers Juliet Capulet and
Romeo Montague. Fourteen-year-old Juliet had apparently undegone a form of
marriage to Montague against her father's wishes and she went into a coma as
a result of a strong barbiturate, taken deliberately to feign death. Young
Montague was unaware of her action and took an overdose. Upon waking from
the coma Juliet took her own life. The role of the church in this sorry
affair is somewhat dubious as it seem the drugs were supplied by churchmen.
The Vatican has promised a full inquiry.
(Mrs A D Woodhouse) MR DORIAN GRAY The death has been reported of Mr Dorian
Gray of Mayfair, the well-known bon vivant and patron of the arts. He was
discovered by servants at home, apparently having suffered fatal injuries
whilst attempting to repair a previously unknown portrait of a young man,
possibly a relative. Although Mr Gray was well known in his role of
aficionado of the theatre, opera and the art world, little was known about
his background. Even his age was closely guarded secret.
(C E Hurst) SIR WILLIAM BUNTER, KBE, MP The death of the former Chancellor,
Sir William Bunter, has shocked everyone, especially a surprising number who
enjoyed a friendship going back to Oxford and even Greyfriars.
Throughout his comparatively short life he remained irrepressibly
optimistic, whether over an expected postal order or the green shoots of
economic recovery.
Sir William's career was not without controversy, both trivial, involving
tuck-shops and off-licenses, and of more moment concerning the acquisition
of public funds for private use, for example, when his probity was
questioned, but always he contrived to extricate himself from a situation
that might well, to a lesser mortal, have spelt disgrace.
(RG Snoxell) CHRISTIAN Our neighbour Christian will come no more amongst us.
Owing to a burden on his back, he had some frenzy-distemper which drove him
to seek a Kingdom where he would have a Crown of Glory and be clothed with
Immortality.
We saw him afar fall into a slough, but he dragged himself out and passed
through a wicket-gate. There were lions in the path, a foul fiend, Apollyon,
a Fair wherein were many vain persons, and he in danger of execution,
Death's shadowy Vale and Giant Despair's Doubting Castle . . .
After so vile a journey he crossed a deep river and thence came to a city
filled with Trumpets and Harps and Streets of Gold. But he that hath told us
of the Pilgrimage hath lately confessed ''Twas but a dream'. Christian is
surely lying beneath those waters whither we have no stomach to follow him.
(KP Hopkinson) MR S. GRUNDY The premature death of Solomon Grundy was widely
mourned by his many relatives and friends. His rapid and brilliant
maturation was due to diet - a lesson to us all.
He was born on Monday, christened on Tuesday and remained a life-long
Anglican. At an unusually early age, he was married on Wednesday. This was
an enduringly happy union, despite adverse comment from some sections of the
press.
An obscure disease overtook him on Thursday. His condition worsened on
Friday. Every effort was made to save him, but he died on Saturday. Full of
honours, he was buried on Sunday.
He is survived by his childless widow.
Beatification is in progress.
