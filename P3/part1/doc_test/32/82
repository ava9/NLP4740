FT  26 MAR 92 / People: My Little Pony lassoes licences across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Licensing Group (ELG), in charge of licensing characters from
the Ninja Turtles to My Little Pony across the Continent from Portugal to
Latvia, has chosen Robert Watson from US toy manufacturer Hasbro as its new
managing director. His predecessor Oliver Reid was killed in a traffic
accident in January at the age of 54, shortly after taking up his
assignment.
ELG is a joint venture, trading since January, between Copyright Promotions,
the UK's largest character licensing operation and part of Mosaic
Investments, and Merchandising Munchen, part of the German media empire
belonging to entrepreneur Leo Kirch. It is located in Amsterdam and aims to
break down the barriers of European-wide licensing.
David Cardwell, joint managing director of Copyright, says Englishman Bob
Watson, 43, latterly vice-president of international licensing at Hasbro
International in London, 'knows the licensing business inside out' and
speaks fluent French, German and Italian; 'He was the person we reported to
at Hasbro,' in transactions connected with licences for My Little Pony,
Playschool and many others. Cardwell points out that
Watson also understands third party licensing, where Hasbro would buy in for
its own purposes licences from Disney, or the rights to Turtles from
Copyright.
He will be in charge of 16 countries - including a series of offices just
opened in eastern Europe and the Russian Republics, which are starting to
license characters such as the Turtles, Pink Panther, and, shortly, Indiana
Jones. 'Oliver did a tremendous job setting it up,' says Cardwell. 'Bob will
be there to keep the monster under control.'

When the Euro Disney park opens outside Paris on April 12, Peter Woodhead
will be counting on the publicity to give a boost to such ageless characters
as Mickey Mouse and Goofy.
Woodhead's job is to ensure that the British have Disney characters for
breakfast, lunch and dinner. Appointed managing director of Disney Consumer
Products in the UK, Woodhead, 41, will continue Disney's activities in the
granting of licences to clothing manufacturers, retailers and publishers,
but he also sees a great future for Disney characters in food products.
One of his most important tasks, however, will be to take advantage of a
recently-concluded pan-European licensing agreement between Disney and
Nestle, the Swiss food giant. Lined up for UK consumers, says Woodhead, are
more Disney characters on yoghurt cartons; Easter eggs with Disney themes;
and, he hopes, pasta in the shapes of Disney characters.
Before joining Disney, Woodhead worked on the licensing of products based on
Mattel's Barbie doll. He also helped ATV to license the Muppets and Pink
Panther.
