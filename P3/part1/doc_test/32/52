Pirouettes by the million. Stars by the score. Enough emotion to float a
battle-cruiser. The great, the good, the generous, from ballet and theatre.
An audience ready to rejoice, and in the process to help the charity
CRUSAID. And the spirit of Rudolf Nureyev to unite us all. Thus Sunday
night's gala, in which something of Nureyev's unique and uniquely potent
presence was again to hold a packed theatre in thrall.
Derek Deane, to whom all praise, masterminded a show that sought - and
successfully found - a way to say something about Nureyev's life and work.
So such eminent figures as Vanessa Redgrave and Nigel Hawthorne, Alan Bates,
John Schlesinger, Jayne Torvill, Stephen Fry; such dance colleagues as
Sibley and Dowell, Lynn Seymour and David Wall, Dame Beryl Grey and Sir
Peter Wright - among many others - spoke of him, and introduced, with
miraculous brevity, dancers from around the world in works which reflected
Nureyev's attainments or his tastes.
Any commentary on a gala inevitably reads like a laundry list. I simply note
certain high-lights in an evening that went with exemplary smoothness,
astonishing speed (ah, memories of those galas that seemed to take place
during a go-slow by time itself), and enormous good humour. There was Irek
Mukhamedov to frame Nureyev's career in the West: appearing first in an
evocation of the Poeme tragique in which Nureyev raced into our lives, and
closing the show with Liz Robertson in 'Shall we dance' from The King and I,
and making us want to see him in the entire thing.
The Paris Opera paid grand homage to its erstwhile director, with Elisabeth
Platel impeccable in La Bayadere, partnered by the prodigious Nicolas Le
Riche, making his London debut. Also from the Opera, Charles Jude, looking
hauntingly like Nureyev, in a solo to Beethoven; Isabelle Guerin and Laurent
Hilaire very dashing in Sleeping Beauty; and Elizabeth Maurin leading in
triumph a group of young dancers who fizzed and whizzed, spun and spun
again. They were angels all, with Johan Kobborg, Yat Seng Chang, Giuseppe
Picone flying in the face of gravity, and Ambra Vallo and Marta Barahona
sparkling alongside them.
Darcey Bussell was thrilling in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux; Igor
Zelensky (from St. Petersburg) was truly Balanchine's Apollo - serious,
powerful - and Evelyn Hart and Rex Harrington from Canada were all emotion
in Kylian's Nuages, a duet admired by Nureyev. Makarova found herself
high-kicking with Kermit the Frog (and Miss Piggy, not the least of
Nureyev's partners, we recall, in buoyant attendance), and Nureyev's Romeo
and Juliet was touchingly evoked by Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur in the
balcony duet. His tremendous appearances in the Corsaire duet were
remembered through Tetsuya Kumakawa and Miyako Yoshida on transcendental
form.
There was more. And more. Stephen Fry confessed that he didn't think he
could ever have been a dancer - describing his possible dance-self as
looking like 'a bin-liner filled with yoghurt'. I must point out,
encouraging as always, that this is the ideal physique sought by some
post-modern troupes. Alan Bates was a sensitive guide to the one
heart-tearing moment of the evening - a collage of film clips showing
Fonteyn and Nureyev. We all wiped the eye.
But it was, in essence, a celebration of Nureyev's work and art, and as
audiences knew throughout the world during his career, we left the theatre
exhilarated by him, and by his influence on dancing. The programme book for
the evening was most handsome, and a worthy reminder of him. And for anyone
wishing to help CRUSAID's work, in memory of Nureyev's contribution to their
joy in the theatre, contributions please to CRUSAID at 1 Walcott Street,
London SW1P 2NG.
