PLEASURE IN THEIR COMPANY

Nothing tells us so much about ourselves as the things in which we take 
pleasure. But, relentless categorizers that we are, we classify even these: 
Some we call harmless; others, guilty pleasures.

A few are more special yet. Wednesday, two men died who have given us pleasures 
of that latter sort -- the sort in which we can take pride.

Sammy Davis Jr., who was 64, described himself as "a saloon entertainer," who 
had earned his audience's respect "because people say . . . 'he's always going 
to give you your money's worth.' " But, quintessential song-and-dance man 
though he was, he gave something more. He tirelessly brought his enormous gifts 
to bear on the struggle to force the American conscience to come to grips with 
the indignity and dishonor of racial discrimination. If that's the sort of 
entertainment to be had in saloons, make ours a double.

Jim Henson, who was 53, took an ancient diversion, puppeteering, and turned it 
into an expressive art made wholly new by its wit and warmth. Since their debut 
in 1969, the characters he created for "Sesame Street" have fanned out across 
the globe to instruct and delight children in 80 countries. Henson's 
sensibility married a child's heart and an adult's conscience. His puppets' 
appeal transcended generations because they reminded us of the children we once 
were, and suggested to our children what they might hope to be.
