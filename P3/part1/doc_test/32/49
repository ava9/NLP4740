The prosecutor in the racketeering trial of former Philippines First Lady 
Imelda Marcos said today the former beauty queen plundered her country and used 
its main bank as a "personal piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements in the trial, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Livingston said the case involves $140 million of stolen money illegally 
brought to the United States to buy four Manhattan buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of theft, fraud and deceit on an incredible scale," Livingston 
told a packed U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said Marcos, whose late husband, Ferdinand, ruled the Philippines 
before being ousted in a popular revolution, used the New York branch of the 
Philippine National Bank as "her own personal piggy bank. She cracked it open 
and had bundles of cash delivered to her so that she could buy artworks and 
jewels." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, dressed in black, clutched a rosary to her bosom and at times looked 
near tears as the prosecutor outlined the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi also is charged in the case.
