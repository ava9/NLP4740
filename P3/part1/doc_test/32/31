RECENTLY, I said David Geffen, the Wunderkind of Hollywood, is ready to bring 
Broadway's hit "Dreamgirls" to the screen. It was noted then that Spike Lee had 
been rumored as a possible director. But here is who will actually direct 
"Dreamgirls" -- none other than Frank Oz, the voice of Miss Piggy on "The 
Muppets." Oz will also take a crack at writing the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that Michael Peters, who shared the 1982 Tony Award 
with the late Michael Bennett for the musical's stage choreography, may do the 
dances for the film.

ANN-MARGRET is wowing Chicago now with her dazzling song-and-dance act. But she 
meets this weekend with producer Linda Yellen to talk about starring in 
"Hiroshima Maidens." This is a true story, based on the book by Rodney Barker. 
It tells how a Connecticut matron took in three of the "maidens," victims of 
the U.S. atomic attack on Japan which ended World War II. The story tells of 
the effect this gesture had on the woman, her community and the scarred young 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If the beautiful Swede says yes, then Yellen will produce this remarkable tale 
for Aaron Spelling Productions. And John Erman, who guided Ann-Margret through 
recent TV hits -- "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" -- 
will probably direct.

A BIG drum roll, hot rockets and a swirl of fanfare for Peter Martins. His new 
ballet, "Fearful Symmetries," made its New York City Ballet debut at Lincoln 
Center this week and is an utter triumph! 
</P>
<P>
What a relief -- this great cultural institution, founded by Georges Balanchine 
and Lincoln Kirstein, and carried on brilliantly by Jerome Robbins, has -- in 
recent years -- been under siege. There have been attacks by the New Yorker and 
Vanity Fair magazines, and behind-the-scenes "civil wars." But thanks to Peter 
Martins and the unflagging support of many important and dedicated benefactors, 
the City Ballet has regained its beautiful "legs." 
</P>
<P>
"Fearful Symmetries" is just super, one of the best experiences I've enjoyed at 
ballet in years. It is set to fabulous music by California's John Adams and is 
being danced by a wonderful group -- Heather Watts, Merrill Ashley, Alexandre 
Proia, Jock Soto, Margaret Tracey, Jeffrey Edwards and the corps de ballet. The 
scarlet, mauve and burnt-orange costumes by Steven Rubin are dramatic 
eye-catchers. 
</P>
<P>
I NOTE that the production was made possible by a generous gift from Carolyne 
and Henry Kravis. Well, dance mavens are in their debt. It was hard to believe 
during this exciting benefit evening in the New York State Theater that the 
night's two blond chairwomen-dynamos, Anne Bass and Ivana Trump, were "women 
scorned." They both looked so glamorous, jolly and carefree that even though 
they've been dragged through the tabloids by the defections of their respective 
husbands, they appear to be "anything but." 
</P>
<P>
ALMOST EVERY great name in theater will hit the Plaza in New York today at noon 
for the Drama League's 56th Annual Distinguished Performance Awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
I'll be there presenting to the fabled Texas tornado Tommy Tune.
