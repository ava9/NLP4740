HOWARD ROSENBERG: MEDIUM MISSES THE MESSAGE IN '50 YEARS OF TV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As always, the very look of Walter Cronkite and the sound of his voice impart 
the wisdom and credibility of a modern Moses leading his flock from a wasteland 
of ignorance to a promised land of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the way it is," America's anchorman emeritus and icon of trust 
assures us, like old times, near the end of Sunday night's "Fifty Years of 
Television: A Golden Celebration" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, that's not the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
For this, we can mostly thank TV's partiality not only for fact-twisting 
docudramas, but also, now, for re-created contemporary news events that fuzz 
truth and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Fifty Years of Television" itself -- an entertainment special airing 
at 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8 -- is not the way it is, or was. Not entirely, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it frames the medium narrowly and uncritically, omitting such 
prominent recent footnotes, for example, as those controversial dramatic 
re-creations favored by some syndicated tabloids and such network offerings as 
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS, and NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and 
"Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Even when properly labeled, these truth-like simulations of actual events rank 
among the most dangerous and destructive booby traps of modern TV, invariably 
exploding in our faces and bringing blindness instead of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News seemed to be acknowledging that when it announced this week that 
simulation-laden "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" -- a news magazine that 
aired three times last summer -- was being transfered to the network's 
entertainment division. The news division earlier produced a fourth episode 
that will air next week. 
</P>
<P>
Said NBC News president Michael Gartner about re-creations: "We have determined 
that the practice can result in confusion to the viewer. Our primary 
responsibility at NBC News is to convey information clearly. If viewers are 
confused, the solution is simple: abandon re-creations in news programming." 
</P>
<P>
Uh . . . wait a minute. Confusion is not for NBC News, but it's acceptable for 
NBC's entertainment division to confuse viewers? What else can you infer from 
Gartner's statement? 
</P>
<P>
Will re-creations on "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" be much less confusing 
merely because the show is switching bosses and no longer will be fronted by 
news anchors? Gartner is right about a news division's responsibility to 
"convey information clearly." Yet doesn't an entertainment division have the 
same obligation? 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't think so judging by the CBS entertainment division's "golden 
celebration" of TV on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it's entertaining all right, essentially a merry-go-round of archival clips 
-- many of them quite wonderful -- bridged by commentary from TV stars ranging 
from Cronkite to Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, a fusion somehow epitomizing 
TV's merging realms of news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The program is fun, among its treasures being excerpts from such ancient TV 
productions as "Marty," with Rod Steiger as the story's self-deprecating pudgy 
hero who isn't interested in making a fashion statement: "The blue suit, the 
gray suit, I'm a fat little man." 
</P>
<P>
But understand "Fifty Years of Television" for what it is, two euphemistic 
hours that distort through narrowness. In a sense, the show is its own 
re-creation, flowing from Cronkite's misleading assertion that TV "was 
introduced at the New York World's Fair" in 1939, when in fact the British were 
already regularly telecasting by that time. 
</P>
<P>
Even more fundamentally, a program that celebrates TV by excluding much of TV 
-- and while also leaving out the warts -- is a celebration of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cronkite's presence, "Fifty Years of Television" sort of slips TV news 
in through the back door. Much worse, it doesn't even mention sports programs, 
daytime programs, children's programs or syndicated programs. Also missing, 
incredibly, are not only local TV and public TV, but also the blazing 
technologies of cable, VCRs and videos that have helped alter the TV landscape. 
The cable omission is especially ironic because the show's executive producers, 
John Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee, have had their greatest recent success in 
creating HBO's "Not Necessarily the News." 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Not Necessarily Television. 
</P>
<P>
Covering half a century of TV in two hours minus commercials just barely beats 
trying to squeeze an 800-pound gorilla into a matchbox. Thus, "Fifty Years of 
Television" offers hardly any reflection or interpretation, no Geiger counter 
to locate the medium's common denominators, both positive and negative. 
</P>
<P>
It's as selective as our own memories, a highlight reel of prime-time clips not 
from TV's vast transparent ooze, but from mostly impact shows, making TV look 
far more exhilarating -- and bold -- than it was or is. 
</P>
<P>
We see Edward R. Murrow's famous denunciation of notorious Red-hunting 
demagogue Joseph McCarthy, for example, but nothing about the cowardly networks 
cooperating in censoring programs and going along with the black-listing of 
allegedly Communist-leaning writers, producers, directors and actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Productions have continued to address the vital issues of our times," Jane 
Seymour says Sunday. Yes, such as those wall-to-wall rape stories that have 
cluttered the November ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
As if hauling out a token black member of an otherwise all-white country club, 
Seymour dutifully cites the classic "Roots" as an example of TV's greatness in 
drama. Fair enough. Yet unmentioned is that the expected post-"Roots" flowering 
of black dramatic opportunities never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Surely something more cosmic is demanded of a retrospective of American TV. No, 
you can't get enough of Sid Caesar's genius, or of "I Love Lucy," Mary Tyler 
Moore, Jack Benny, Ernie Kovacs and clips of those primitive early days, when, 
in contrast to today, TV's talent was more advanced than its technology. 
</P>
<P>
When you think of what TV has recently imprinted on our minds, however -- 
pictures of the eroding Berlin Wall, of 200,000 Czechs demonstrating for reform 
in Prague, of terrified Salvadorans caught in a crossfire of bullets and 
politics -- it's evident just how weak and soft Sunday's program is. 
</P>
<P>
This is television, not a fat little man.
