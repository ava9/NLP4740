NEXT, THE WORLD: During an otherwise routine meeting in Anaheim Tuesday of the 
Walt Disney Co. (D5), Italian language Disney comics were displayed, as were 
possible Mickey Mouse magazines in Russian, Polish and Hungarian. . . . 
Shareholders also heard Miss Piggy singing "Some Day My Prince Will Come" in 
French for a Christmas special on European TV. . . . That happy tune wasn't 
being sung at the park, however, by performers in Disneyland's Golden Horseshoe 
Revue, who are out of work, at least for now (F2). Dana Parsons and Kristina 
Lindgren
