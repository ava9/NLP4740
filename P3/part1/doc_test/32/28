Hollywood's plan to send Bugs Bunny and his friends into the fight against 
drugs won applause from Congress today but also a request for more than just 
the cartoon special set to air on national television Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion activity in which we 
finally hear from Hollywood and this is the last shot," said Rep. John Conyers 
Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
"Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's 
going to use drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee watched a sample of the 30-minute 
special, "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue" and applauded the effort to reach 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The most powerful weapon that we know in politics is the cartoon and we hope 
that the cartoon will be the most powerful tool to educate our children," said 
committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
The program, a unique collaboration of animation studios, tells the story of 
Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is saved with help from Bugs Bunny, the 
Chipmunks, Daffy Duck, Garfield, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss 
Piggy, Slimer, the Smurfs, Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo and 
Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
He is also saved from Smoke, a sinister, drug-pushing apparition whose voice 
was provided by actor George C. Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presentation, funded by Ronald 
McDonald Children's Charities and McDonald's restaurant, is set to air at 10:30 
a.m. Saturday. The cartoon will be aired on ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and numerous 
independent stations and cable outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Disney, vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co. and head of its animation 
department, was executive producer of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about long-range plans, Disney Studios President Richard Frank said the 
studios have been working so hard "to get this particular special out that we 
really haven't had time to sit down and plan other ones." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, only 15 minutes of the production were shown to the lawmakers and 
some of the music as well as all of the sound effects were missing. "What 
you're going to see is minus those embellishments," Disney explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm going to be doing Saturday morning," Biden said after the 
screening. "I want to hear the music."
