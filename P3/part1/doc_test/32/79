BIG BIRD, BARKLEY THE DOG VISIT JAPAN AND GET LOST

Big Bird and his friend, Barkley the Dog, are separated from their tour bus in 
Tokyo -- and they don't speak Japanese. How will they get back to Sesame Street 
? 
</P>
<P>
"Big Bird in Japan" (tonight, Channels 28 and 15 at 8 p.m.) answers this 
question in a way that introduces children to Japanese culture without being 
didactic about it. It also indulges in a bit of delicate, fairy-tale-style 
fantasy that should engage children's imaginations without too much strain. 
</P>
<P>
A co-production of the Children's Television Workshop and the Japanese network 
Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), this "Big Bird" was shot on several beautiful 
Japanese locations by director-writer Jon Stone. It features Maiko Kawakami as 
a mysterious woman who comes to the aid of the stranded Big Bird and Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is Kawakami's barely passable singing voice. Her solos might 
make a few youngsters restless. But the simple musical score -- by Dick Lieb, 
Tony Geiss and Carol Hall -- generally enhances the storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
The picture of Japan here is strictly tourist board-approved, so much so that 
children might confront their parents with a sudden demand for foreign travel. 
</P>
<P>
So take them to Little Tokyo. DON SHIRLEY
