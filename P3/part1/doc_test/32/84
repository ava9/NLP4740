With its exhilarating action sequences, Walt Disney Pictures' "The Rescuers 
Down Under" challenges the adventure films of Spielberg and Lucas and confirms 
the special power of animation to present extravagant fantasies on screen. 
</P>
<P>
The first sequel in the studio's history and its 29th feature-length cartoon, 
"Rescuers Down Under" (citywide and suitable for all ages) suggests a new 
direction for Disney animation. With the exception of the forgotten wartime 
propaganda piece "Victory Through Air Power," all the previous Disney cartoon 
features have been musicals; a fast-paced, straightforward adventure story with 
no songs, "Rescuers" is closer in tone to the sci-fi epics of Japanese 
animation than to "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard and Miss Bianca (voices by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor), the plucky mice 
from the Rescue Aid Society who charmed audiences in Disney's 1977 hit, "The 
Rescuers," are back on a new mission. Cody (Adam Ryen), a young Australian boy, 
has been kidnaped while trying to protect Marahute, a giant golden eagle, from 
the villainous poacher Percival McLeach (George C. Scott). 
</P>
<P>
The human rangers think Cody fell into a crocodile-infested river and have 
given up the search. Only Bernard and Bianca can save him -- which they do with 
the help of a variety of animal allies, including Jake, a dashing, Paul 
Hogan-esque kangaroo mouse (Tristan Rogers), and Wilbur, a befuddled albatross 
(John Candy, overplaying wonderfully). 
</P>
<P>
First-time directors Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel faced the unenviable task of 
competing with recent live-action adventure films and trying to match the 
polished work of "The Rescuers." The pair successfully meets both challenges, 
an impressive achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bianca is still the adventurous gamin who blithely dazzles every male she 
encounters. Bernard remains the worrisome adventurer in spite of himself, and 
the sequence in which he summons up his courage and subdues a huge razorback 
hog represents a delightful blend of animation and voice acting. Wilbur the 
albatross looks like Orville from the first film (they're supposed to be 
brothers), but moves in ways that expresses his very different personality. 
</P>
<P>
Human characters have always presented a special challenge for animators, 
because the audience can easily recognize any mistakes in the way they move. 
McLeach is an extraordinarily vivid character. The animation and Scott's vocal 
performance convey a very real sense of menace. 
</P>
<P>
When Cody is thrown into an abandoned opal mine with the animals McLeach has 
illegally trapped, he meets a hysterical frilled lizard who cries, "We'll never 
leave this place!" A sardonic koala reveals the extent of McLeach's villainy in 
his reply, "Oh no, you'll leave -- as a purse, a nice lady's purse." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of offering a pallid copy of the Spielberg/Lucas live-action 
adventures, as the recent "Ducktales: The Movie: The Secret of the Lost Lamp" 
did, Butoy, Gabriel and their story crew went back to the childhood dreams that 
inspired those fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-generated backgrounds enable Butoy and Gabriel to heighten the sense 
of fantasy in ways that were previously impossible in animation, like having 
the camera follow Wilbur's breakneck flights amid the skyscrapers of New York 
and Sydney. But the real magic occurs when Marahute stretches her vast wings 
and carries Cody through the skies. The scenes of them gliding over massive 
banks of clouds, diving off a waterfall and soaring into the starry Australian 
night embody the fantasy of every child who dreamed of having a special animal 
friend/protector. It's a bravura piece of animation. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, Cody emerges as a brave and resourceful boy, but he's rather 
one-dimensional. He never has to deal with the conflicting emotions that make 
Pinocchio seem so human, even when he's a puppet. Nor is it clear if the 
animals McLeach had imprisoned are ever rescued, although it's assumed Cody 
would go back for them after the villain has met his richly deserved end. But 
these are minor flaws in an otherwise exceptional film. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding "The Rescuers Down Under," on a sort of double bill, is "The Prince 
and the Pauper," a film in the traditional Disney musical comedy format. Mark 
Twain's classic tale of exchanging identities has been turned into a 22-minute 
comic vehicle for Mickey Mouse (in the double title role), Donald Duck, Pluto, 
Goofy, Horace Horsecollar, Black Pete and the Weasels from "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's appearance has changed many times over the years, and the artists 
chose the appealing Mickey of the late '30s -- the era of "Brave Little Tailor" 
and "Fantasia" -- as their model for "Prince and Pauper." The polished 
animation, especially in the mime sequences, reminds audiences why the 
character became so popular: Mickey hasn't looked this good or moved this well 
in decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince and the Pauper" is certainly entertaining, but it goes by awfully 
fast. It's really just the beginning and end of a story, with the middle 
compressed into a few quick scenes. Expanding the film into a feature would 
have given the artists more of a chance to explore the reactions of the Prince 
and the Pauper to their new identities. As it stands, neither character has 
much time to realize he's better off being who he really is.
