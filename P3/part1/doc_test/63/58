for Democrats and Republicans in today's New Hampshire primary

ALL EYES turn to New Hampshire today as the granite state, so often the
graveyard of presidential ambitions, holds the first primary election of the
1992 campaign. The results of the Democratic and Republican races are
eagerly expected, not just because voters will deliver their verdict on
President George Bush's three years in office.
In a broader sense, New Hampshire marks the start of a landmark election -
the first of the post-Cold War era, now that anti-communism, which has
defined the political terrain in every US election since 1948, has seen its
enemy vanquished in its own citadel.
Domestic issues - primarily whether the US economy can produce a higher
standard of living for future generations of Americans - have become
paramount. Thus the performance of each candidate will show how voters rate
their prescriptions on matters ranging from trade, industrial policy, tax
cuts and health care.
For Mr Bush, the stakes are high. Having looked invincible six months ago,
he has appeared defensive, waiting like Mr Micawber for something to turn up
to suggest an economic recovery.
In New Hampshire, where voters are more conservative than elsewhere in the
US, the president faces an unpredictable challenge from Mr Patrick Buchanan,
the right-wing television commentator and former speech writer for
presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. A strong showing by Mr Buchanan
would increase the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable, if not beatable,
in the November general election.
New Hampshire should be fertile ground for a protest vote.
In three years, the state has gone from boom to bust: unemployment has
tripled; bankruptcies have increased five-fold; the empty shopping malls
which line the highways are a testimony to the over-building and speculation
which characterised the 1980s.
Mr Buchanan is counting on holding the president's support to something less
than 60 per cent of the Republican vote, with his own candidacy locking on
to more than 33 per cent.
'Anything less than a 2-1 margin for Bush is a win for us,' says Mr Frank
Luntz, the young, bearded, Oxford-educated pollster for Mr Buchanan. 'It
will allow us to raise the money to fight on in the south.'
This prospect of civil war within the Republican party may not match the
historic split forced by right-wing Senator Barry Goldwater when he took on
liberal governor Mr Nelson Rockefeller of New York in the early 1960s. But
it may herald the crack-up of the coalition forged by Mr Richard Nixon and
Mr Ronald Reagan which led to five Republican victories in the last six
presidential elections.
The question is whether the current crop of Democratic candidates can
present a credible alternative to Mr Bush, making a national leader who
could appeal to the blue-collar workers and suburban middle-class voters who
deserted the Democratic party in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period it
was dominated by liberal factions more interested in catering to minorities
and heavy public spending.
On Sunday night, all five Democratic contenders showed off their wares in a
strangely subdued debate. Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, the
front-runner, sounded more like a Republican with his proposals for relaxing
anti-trust law, and support of free trade and a capital gains tax cut.
But Mr Tsongas is a little too pious and self-conscious about his rise from
obscurity. 'Anti-charisma only gets you so far,' says Mr Michael Barone, a
political commentator. Mr Tongas has benefited from Governor Bill Clinton's
troubles.
Mercifully, the Arkansas governor was not asked about charges of draft
dodging during the Vietnam war; but he needs at least a good second place in
New Hampshire to carry on the fight in his native south.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the Japan-bashing liberal, would cut the US
defence budget by 50 per cent in the next 10 years and introduce a Franklin
Roosevelt-style public works programme.
Whether voters buy the meeker version produced on Sunday night will depend
on his closest rival for third place, or better, Senator Robert Kerrey of
Nebraska.
Mr Kerrey, Mr Harkin and their fellow Democratic candidate, California's
Governor Jerry Brown, were yesterday criss-crossing the state, hoping for a
last-minute shift in their favour and vowing that no matter what happened on
Tuesday, they were in the race until the end.
Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic party, says he expects the
Democratic presidential nominee to emerge from the present field and plays
down the chance of a late entry by an outsider such as Governor Mario Cuomo
of New York. Judging by the thinly-attended 'draft Cuomo' event on Sunday
night in Manchester he may be right.
The risk is that New Hampshire will not offer a decisive result for the
Democrats. But there are signs that the candidates are starting a coherent
attack on the past 11 years of Republican control of the White House, when
the US tripled its national debt, turned from being the world's largest
creditor nation to the largest debtor, and saw its schools, inner cities and
infrastructure crumble.
However different their prescriptions, both Mr Buchanan and the Democratic
candidates believe they can make a good case against Mr Bush, the guardian
of the status quo. New Hampshire will offer the first clue as to whether
they are correct, or whether the powers of incumbency will prove too
formidable.
