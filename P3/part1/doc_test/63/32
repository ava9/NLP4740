THE White House is on the defensive about reports of an operational
'gridlock' over President George Bush's agenda and of rushing to publicise a
Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) international aid programme for Russia for
domestic political reasons before details of the package had been agreed.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, has denied a story in the
Washington Post that frustration with a sluggish White House bureaucracy has
driven him to the brink of resignation.
He praised the 'strong management team' put in place by Mr Sam Skinner, Mr
Bush's chief of staff.
However, the Post and other press reports are describing a White House
hampered by 'mini-bureaucracy' which has been unable to bridge differences
with campaign officials to fashion themes for the president's re-election
campaign.
One political achievement - the Russian aid package - is now being
criticised in Japan, where officials said the programme announced was larger
than had been agreed. Canadian officials also seemed confused about the
numbers, and the US State and Treasury Departments have each had different
estimates of the American contribution.
This has raised suspicions, denied by the White House, that the
administration rushed through the announcement of the aid before details had
been agreed by the Group of Seven industrial nations. Governor Mario Cuomo
of New York said Mr Bill Clinton was likely to be the Democratic nominee for
president, whether or not he wins the New York primary tomorrow. He urged
the governor to meet congressional leaders to draw up a plan for the
economy.
