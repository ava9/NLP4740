MR Ron Brown, the commerce secretary-nominee for the Clinton administration,
yesterday moved quickly to assert his predominance over US trade policy and
promised to become 'a forceful advocate' for US technology and economic
development.
The man who, as chairman of the Democratic party, paved the way for the
election of a Democratic president, went on to demonstrate mastery of the
many trade and industrial issues.
Mr Brown is the first Clinton nominee to come up for confirmation hearings.
He said that his department would be 'the lead agency on trade policy,' by
implication defining the role of Mr Mickey Kantor, the nominee for US trade
representative, as the official who simply 'negotiates agreements'.
Unlike his Republican predecessors, Mr Brown clearly will not allow
ideological restraints to enfeeble him.
The department will fund 'targeted, innovative programmes' to spur
technology development, and he hopes to play 'a large role' in defence
conversion.
'The question before us is how best to design trade, technology and
development policies, not theoretical arguments about whether we ought to
have those policies,' he said. 'Action, not ideology, will be my watchword.'
He had tough words for trade law enforcement. 'I think we have to stop
getting rolled.'
In another departure from the Republican administration, he promised to back
barter 'as a vehicle for improving our ability to trade,' particularly with
Russia and other countries which have little hard currency.
More like his predecessors, he talked about a private-sector-led partnership
between industry and government, but he seemed to have the will and the
wiles to achieve this goal.
Mr Brown smoothly confronted questions about his career as a Washington
lobbyist, when his clients included American subsidiaries of Japanese
electronics companies and the government of Haiti.
Senator Trent Lott, the member designated by Republicans to make Democratic
nominees uncomfortable, asked Mr Brown if his work for 'special interests'
and his insider status did not 'perhaps send the wrong message as we begin
with this. . . administration?'
'I think it sends the right message,' Mr Brown shot back. 'I think it sends
the message that I'm someone who is a good advocate and gets things done.'
