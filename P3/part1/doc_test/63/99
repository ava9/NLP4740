October talk about the Democratic Party having one foot -- its presidential 
foot -- in the grave is hitting levels unmatched since the late 1920s, 
exceeding even the morbidity following Walter F. Mondale's 1984 defeat. And the 
odor of embalming fluid is all the stronger because so much of it is coming 
from Democrats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But do they really understand their current circumstances? Part of the national 
Democratic malaise is a familiar myopia displayed by previous Democrats during 
similar Republican economic boom years of the Roaring '20s and the Gilded Age 
of the late-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The current Democratic case of the tactical and philosophic shakes has to do 
with the cumulative loss of skills and confidence over the last two decades of 
national politics. Unlike the famous Confederate general, Bedford Forrest, who 
got there "fustest with the mostest," latter-day Democrats have gotten there 
latest with the leastest. 
</P>
<P>
These disadvantages, then, suggest that perhaps we should pay less attention to 
Democrats' own self-analysis and more to where they stand amid the evolution of 
the GOP issues and stratagems that, save for Watergate, have been the winning 
national dynamic for almost a quarter-century. In some ways Democrats are 
probably worse off than they think, but other aspects of their predicament have 
a chronological silver lining of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' central problem is that their national tide went out 21 years 
ago in a 1968 presidential election that now stacks up alongside America's 
prior national political watersheds. The enormous scope of the collapse was 
decisive -- the Democrats' share of the presidential vote dropped from 61% in 
1964 to 43% in 1968 (and then to 39% in 1972 as party fortunes soured further 
and George Wallace's 1968 third-party support lined up with Richard M. Nixon 
and the GOP). Then there is the subsequent Republican domination of the White 
House, which by January, 1993, will have run 24 years with only a four-year 
interruption. Such lopsided White House control has occurred after each past 
watershed, and has come no other way. What made the partisan upheaval confusing 
at first, of course, was the temporary 1970s dislocation of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
But for Democratic strategists, confronting this reality is still only the 
beginning of comprehension. Their decline has, in fact, happened in stages. 
</P>
<P>
The disastrous national losses of 1968-72 were largely rooted in racial, social 
and patriotic issues -- the sort of Democratic thematic vulnerabilities 
Republicans still enjoy resurrecting with campaigns against flag-desecration 
and TV commercials about furloughed murderers. More than anything else, these 
GOP themes and Democratic failures destroyed the old New Deal coalition on the 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
Stage two came in the late 1970s, when inflation, fanned by Lyndon B. Johnson's 
1960s "borrow, don't tax" Vietnam War buildup, began to roar. All three of 
20th-Century America's big inflation waves -- during and after World Wars I, II 
and Vietnam -- originated under Democratic regimes. Worse still, they rode in 
tandem with excessive growth of government and bureaucracy, increased taxes and 
bracket creep. Attacks on the inflationary state scored heavily for 
conservatives in the 1980 elections, stoking tax-revolt fires and piling more 
wood on the funeral pyre of New Deal ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Big government's embarrassment was the private sector's opportunity under 
Ronald Reagan; tax reduction and market economics went into overdrive. Within a 
few years, converging deregulation, Horatio Alger entrepreneurialism, 
disinflation, tax cuts and soaring stock markets brought stage three, more or 
less replicating the go-go spirit and success of the two previous Republican 
capitalist heydays -- the late-19th Century and the 1920s. This threw the final 
kerosene on fires burning away the old economic and ideological self-confidence 
among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The result hasn't been impressive. Despite conservatives' glum assessments of 
periods like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Johnson's half-baked "Great 
Society," the Democratic Party -- certainly no left or socialist party -- is 
not even a reliably liberal party. On the contrary, it is middle-class and 
capitalist enough that in times of great Republican prosperity, the Democrats 
become conformist, even me-tooish, in their intermittent courtship of business 
and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is such a far cry from the Democrats' activist role under the 
Andrew Jacksons, William Jennings Bryans and Franklin D. Roosevelts, the party 
seems at these moments to have lost its soul, wandering aimlessly (and not 
quite acceptably) in the waiting rooms of Rotary clubs and stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 19th Century, the sole Democratic President, Grover Cleveland, 
was as conservative as his GOP predecessors, and the pattern held nearly as 
well in the 1920s. No Democratic Presidents sat in the Oval Office, but 
congressional Democrats -- just as in the 1980s -- often tried to outdo 
Republicans in proposing tax cuts for business and finance, causing cynical 
chuckles in GOP circles. 
</P>
<P>
To review these 1920s episodes after watching 1980s Democrats is to experience 
deja vu. Last year, Michael S. Dukakis proclaimed to the Democratic Convention 
that the election was about "competence, not ideology," in part because his 
chief fund-raiser, a former Republican, was collecting record sums of money in 
business and financial circles. 
</P>
<P>
That fund-raiser, Robert A. Farmer, now Democratic Party treasurer, recently 
supported giving ambassadorships to campaign contributors because, he said, a 
U.S. ambassador's secondary job is to promote U.S. business interests. And 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) was quoted in 
one 1988 bestseller as saying, "What atmosphere do I ever expect to live in 
when I leave Congress? I want to mingle in this community of business 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
This attitude may have promoted the economy at times, and as a Democratic 
survival posture it has also displayed elements of realism. Historically, 
however, such periods have been Democratic low points, eras of lost 
philosophical moorings when even sympathizers begin to wonder if the party 
still has a future. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, that is where the Democrats are today -- enmeshed in much of the 
same me-tooism they often displayed during the 1920s. If anything, the party's 
continuing control of Congress has only strengthened its general conformity to 
the mood of the decade. The better news for the Democrats is that me-tooism has 
often characterized the darkness before the dawn. Calvin Coolidge-era 
Democrats, as well as Republicans during their own beaten, me-tooist Nelson 
Rockefeller progressive period in the mid-1960s, were actually on the threshold 
of major event-driven revivals. The mea culpas and funeral notices turned out, 
in later hindsight, to be auspicious contrarian indicators. 
</P>
<P>
The further irony is that today's national Democratic disarray may not be 
critical. If Democrats truly had to deserve national power to win it, they'd be 
in trouble; but that isn't the American way. The great watershed changes of 
U.S. national politics have been largely event-driven. After a generation or 
so, the existing presidential majority runs out of cohesion, and events -- from 
Civil War to a stock market crash and a depression -- serve to unravel the old 
coalition and force the creation of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, economic weakness has been the historic Achilles' heel. A 
strong Democrat might have won by tapping national nervousness in 1988 -- even 
Dukakis carried four dozen Midwestern counties that hadn't voted Democratic 
since 1964 -- and the volatile stock markets of the last 10 days serve to 
remind that 1992 or 1996 could be an opportunity in the historic Democratic 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Democrats who remember better and prouder days won't want to 
look in the mirror too often. It's not a flattering sight.
