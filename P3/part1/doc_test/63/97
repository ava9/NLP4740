to deal with an aggressive Buchanan in Georgia

DEMOCRATIC and Republican presidential candidates embarked yesterday on a
last day of whirlwind campaigning before today's round of primary and caucus
voting.
Seven states will cast their votes today in the Democratic nomination race,
and five in the Republican race, promising the first significant indication
of the breadth of support for the rival candidates.
On the Republican side, Mr Patrick Buchanan, the outspoken right-wing
television commentator, renewed his attack on incumbent President George
Bush.
The president sorely needs to beat off Mr Buchanan's challenge by defeating
him roundly in Georgia, but must contend with Mr Buchanan's overt appeal to
white racism in the state.
Among the Democrats, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas fought to preserve their lead over their
rivals Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former
Governor Jerry Brown of California.
Until now, the nomination battle has been fought step by step in four states
that rank among the smallest and most atypical in the US.
Together, Iowa, New Hampshire, Maine and South Dakota account for only 3 per
cent of the delegates to the Democratic party's nominating convention, and
fewer than 4 per cent of the Republican party's delegates.
They also number among the most ethnically homogeneous states in the nation,
with a black population ranking below 1 per cent.
Today's seven state contest, dubbed 'Junior Tuesday,' will decide another 10
per cent of convention delegates, and mark a shift from the retail politics
of New Hampshire to a different kind of political mass marketing.
Most of the attention is focused on Maryland, Georgia and Colorado, which
along with Utah for the Democrats hold primaries, since these secret ballots
provide more of a plebiscite for candidates.
Senator Tsongas and Governor Clinton are battling for the lead among the
Democrats in these states, with the former ahead in Maryland and Colorado
and the latter comfortably in the lead in Georgia.
For the Republicans, the battle has been concentrated in Georgia, since Mr
Buchanan has been unable to get his name on the ballot in many states.
But candidates can also boost their campaigns in states which allot their
delegates in closed party caucus meetings - especially Minnesota, where
Senator Harkin is mounting a strong bid with substantial backing among trade
unionists and party activists who take part in such caucuses.
Another four states vote on Saturday, followed by March 10's Super Tuesday
contest, when eleven states will vote. They include Texas and Florida -
after California and New York the two most populous states in the nation -
and between them account for 20 per cent of the Democrats' convention
delegates and 23 per cent of the Republicans.
By March 17, when primaries Michigan, two heavily populated Midwestern
states, nearly half the delegates to the Democrats' July convention in New
York and to the Republicans' August gathering in Houston will have been
decided.
Some political analysts believe it is possible that no clear Democratic
nominee will have emerged by then. Yet all the Democratic campaigns are
running low on funds and badly need the impetus of a victory today and over
the next two weeks.
Mr Clinton, whose campaign has been the best financed and organised among
the Democrats, is in some ways the best placed to persevere. His bid will,
however, be severely weakened if he cannot demonstrate a capacity to win
heavily in the southern states which dominate the next two weeks' voting and
which are viewed as his home turf.
By winning in either Colorado or Maryland, Mr Tsongas could gain enough
momentum to carry him forward from his New Hampshire victory.
Mr Tsongas has touted his 'electability' as a candidate who can draw
alienated Republican voters. 'There are lots of Republicans out there who
will come to us if we give them a home,' he said in a debate with his rivals
on Sunday.
This tactic may be less productive in Maryland, whose local rules allow only
registered Democratic voters to take part in the Democratic primary.
Mr Clinton renewed his attack on Mr Tsongas's economic policies as 'the
1980s style approach' as he campaigned in Maryland yesterday. He appears to
have gained ground there in the last few days, though Mr Tsongas is still
expected to win the state.
Mr Kerrey could be weakened if he fails to win a single state today, while
Mr Harkin is so short of money that he may not be able to sustain his
campaign, even if he wins delegates in Minnesota.
Mr Brown, after winning less than 10 per cent of the vote in two consecutive
primaries, risks losing the federal funding which matches campaign
contributions unless he can score higher than 20 per cent in a subsequent
primary. Democratic party officials, however, fear that his populist
campaign will be able to survive on a shoestring budget.
On the Republican side, the battle is not so much over this year's
nomination, which President Bush is expected to win overwhelmingly, as over
the party's direction into the 1990s.
Mr Buchanan claims that his performance in New Hampshire, where his losing
score of 37 per cent to Mr Bush's 53 per cent was hailed as a moral victory,
has pushed the president's campaign to the brink of disaster.
'I think one more New Hampshire-type victory down here in Georgia and the
whole thing could collapse like a house of cards. Now, that is not our
expectation, but it is our hope,' he said yesterday.
All the same, Mr Buchanan is reckoned to stand little chance of winning even
a single state against the Republican party establishment. Even
right-wingers critical of some of Mr Bush's policies have rallied round the
president.
