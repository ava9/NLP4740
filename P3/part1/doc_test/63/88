WRITE-IN BID THREATENED IN 52ND DISTRICT RACE 
</P>

<P>
The disgruntled runner-up in the 52nd Assembly District Republican primary is 
threatening to wage a write-in campaign in November, buoying the hopes of the 
underdog Democratic nominee and raising the specter of a divided Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Manning, who lost by 72 votes in the final primary count, said he is 
considering a write-in campaign because the Republican winner, Diamond Bar 
Councilman Paul V. Horcher, is not conservative enough to satisfy voters in the 
predominantly GOP district. 
</P>
<P>
He also accused Horcher of running a dirty campaign. Horcher denied that charge 
and said his political views are nearly as conservative as Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
The chief beneficiary of a write-in effort could be Democratic nominee Gary 
Neely, a 40-year-old marketing consultant from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, who labels himself a conservative Democrat, said his candidacy is 
picking up support from Republican voters dissatisfied with the primary outcome 
for the vacant Assembly seat. In an unusually fractured eight-candidate race, 
Horcher won the primary with slightly less than 18% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said he thinks he has a chance to upset Horcher whether or not Manning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Neely and Horcher, a 38-year-old attorney, are stressing their conservative 
credentials. Manning disagrees. "From my perspective, we have two candidates 
who are moderates. The conservatives don't have anybody to vote for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs, Manning will be the only anti-abortion candidate. Neely and Horcher 
favor abortion rights, although Horcher is opposed to government funding of 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who lives in Hacienda Heights, said he will decide on a write-in 
campaign in the next few weeks. He says he would have plenty of support from 
local Republicans but is not sure he could raise enough money -- $100,000 or 
more, by his estimation -- to run a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said he also may ask for a recount. The county registrar-recorder last 
week reported a final but still unofficial count that showed Horcher defeating 
Manning by 72 votes, 5,041 to 4,969. The county will certify the results 
Tuesday, and Manning will have until July 2 to ask for a recount at his own 
expense, with the cost refunded if the result is changed in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial returns on election night had Horcher 64 votes ahead of Wil 
Baca, a Hacienda Heights environmentalist, and 166 ahead of Manning. In the 
final unofficial tally, Manning surged past Baca, who wound up third with 4,956 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he doubts that Manning, 37, a construction contractor and member 
of the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District board, will carry out his 
threat to run as a write-in candidate. Such a campaign would be futile and 
would damage Manning's standing in the Republican Party, Horcher said. "It 
would create more difficulties for him (than me)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher pointed out that Manning in April had signed a fair campaign pledge 
that included this statement: "I will support the Republican nominee after the 
primary election." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a solemn oath," Horcher said. 
</P>
<P>
But Manning said his promise is not binding because most of the other 
candidates, including Horcher, refused to sign the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said Manning will be making a mistake if he undertakes a write-in 
campaign. "I think supporting the party is more important than playing a 
spoiled brat," he said. During the campaign, Baca said, Manning stressed his 
loyalty to the party and his long service to the Republican cause. It is odd, 
Baca said, for a candidate who "claimed he was a Republican since he was in 
diapers to be putting his own ambitions before the interests of the party." 
</P>
<P>
Neely ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and tallied 18,010 votes, almost 
13,000 more than Horcher in the splintered GOP race. 
</P>
<P>
But the 52nd Assembly District, which stretches from La Mirada and Whittier to 
the San Gabriel Valley, taking in Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, 
Diamond Bar and part of West Covina, is decidedly Republican. There are 74,029 
registered Republicans, 65,722 Democrats and 15,450 who are unaffiliated or 
belong to minor parties. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not undertake a write-in campaign, Manning said, he believes that 
some of his supporters will vote Democratic. He said Neely is "as conservative 
as Paul Horcher and he's a much more likeable guy." 
</P>
<P>
Manning added: "Paul Horcher is in trouble in this district. He has some real 
work to do to convince people that he has ethics." 
</P>
<P>
Manning attributed his primary loss to a smear campaign. He said Horcher 
unfairly attacked his record as a school trustee in mailers by distorting his 
school district's dropout rate. In addition, he said, someone ran a telephone 
campaign telling residents that Manning was the subject of a corruption 
investigation and had used drugs, both of which Manning denies. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he did not run a telephone campaign smearing Manning and is not 
convinced that there was such a campaign. He said his mailers attacked 
Manning's record in office, using information from published reports. "I ran a 
hard campaign," he said. "I ran the campaign to win. I didn't do anything 
unethical or shady." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mautino, a Whittier attorney who finished sixth in the primary with 3,846 
votes, said he was repelled by Horcher's campaign. He said Horcher "was the 
only one who engaged in negative campaigning" and he is uncertain whether he 
will support him in November. "I'm hesitant to endorse a candidate who would 
use those tactics," Mautino said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baca said: "I didn't think it was a particularly dirty campaign. The hit 
pieces (Horcher) put out were what you would normally expect." 
</P>
<P>
Baca said he has not yet endorsed Horcher, but added, "I don't see any 
impediment to helping him as long as he recognizes the message that my campaign 
sent." 
</P>
<P>
Running as a moderate and an urban environmentalist, Baca promised to deal with 
traffic congestion, smog, water pollution and toxic waste. Baca said Horcher's 
victory and his own strong showing were a defeat for ultraconservatives. "If 
the Republican Party is going to be the majority party in California, it's 
going to have to move away from the right and toward the middle," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
But Horcher, whose primary campaign stressed his moderate stance -- in favor of 
abortion rights and sensitive to women's and minority issues -- said in a 
telephone interview last week: "I'm as conservative as Ken Manning." Later in 
the interview, he modified that to say that his political views were somewhere 
between Baca's and Manning's but probably closer to Manning's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a liberal Republican," he emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said his Assembly votes probably would not differ much from those of 
conservative Whittier Republican Frank Hill, who gave up the Assembly seat 
after winning election to the state Senate earlier this year. Hill endorsed 
Horcher a week before the election.
