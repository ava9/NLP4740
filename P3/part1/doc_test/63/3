A political doctor responds to a patient's questions.
Q: Doctor, where are we now on the American presidential election?
A: Where we are is that George Bush will be the Republican nominee, Bill
Clinton the Democratic nominee and Ross Perot will probably run as an
independent. That is the only safe clinical observation to make. Previous
diagnoses suggesting an internal eruption of the Democratic party emanating
from the capital of New York state or outer space may now be discarded.
Does this competition imply health in the body politic?
The body politic is not healthy. How could it be with trillions of dollars'
debt, Dollars 400bn of deficits, the second-largest city in flames, and the
great Red corpuscle threat now into convertible roubles?
Is President Bush himself as healthy as he was after his operation in the
desert last year?
Obviously not; the domestic climate does not suit him and the global warming
of the cold war takes him out of his element. His planned trip to Rio de
Janeiro next month should carry a severe health warning and his cure in the
economic waters of Munich in July offers no panacea. The president is
suffering from a severe case of political dyslexia, unable to translate what
he reads and thinks into action, or possibly vice versa. I am not saying it
is terminal but the prognosis must be very guarded. I recommend external
electric shock treatment, say an invasion of Peru, which would have the
double dose of saving democracy and bashing a Japanese (President Fujimori)
in one fell stroke.
What do the White House physicians say?
They speak with many tongues, which is part of the problem. Doctors Quayle
and Fitzwater keep reminding him to stay with the course of conservative
prescriptions which worked well for him in the 1980s. Dr Kemp wants a more
radical approach and now has him visiting clinics in most cities in the
country. Drs Baker and Cheney, experts in tropical medicine, seem to have
been taken off the case.
What about Governor Clinton? I thought his case was terminal.
He is still not well. All the early spring maladies are still coursing
around his system. He has a good mind and a strong constitution, which
primary micro-surgery has improved, but he could easily catch another severe
bout of the ague. Republican researchers, specialists in Horton's disease,
are confident they can unearth further viral complications, but it is not
clear if these will be fatal.
Mr Perot seems pretty vigorous these days. Is this attributable to the Texas
air?
Possibly. His health owes much to not living in Washington which is
notoriously claustrophobic (the politico-medical term is Beltway Bursitis
which afflicts the body's moving parts when decisions have to be taken).
Normally, phenomena like Mr Perot are ephemeral, particularly if, as in his
case, close investigation, using the latest media probes, reveals skeletons
(Nixon and North) rattling round inside. But his ability to buy the best
medical care available, regardless of the cost, could bring a degree of
longer-lasting immunity, as could his refusal to answer questions about the
specific nature of his complaints.
Is there a universal medicine which could help all of them?
A very difficult question; what is needed is a cure for disaffectitis.
Classically the best results can be achieved through an accommodating media,
without which it is impossible to understand what the candidates are saying
or complaining about. However, all diagnosis in this medium must last no
longer than 10 seconds, unless it be about the Northern Spotted Owl, which
is not running for anything except possibly from chainsaws.
Picking up from that, would you say that politicians themselves are an
endangered species?
Well, they certainly must be very careful these days. The body of Congress
is losing healthy members by the dozen - some to talk show programmes where
they think they have more influence.
What about amendments to the constitution? They have been useful in the
past, haven't they?
Sometimes; certainly it was thought prohibition would make the body politic
less paralytic. Just last week the states ratified a 200-year-old amendment
stopping Congress giving itself pay raises and Congress itself is about to
pass an amendment prohibiting the federal government from spending more than
it takes in. However, money, like alcohol, is a narcotic from which there is
no easy withdrawal, which explains why I am charging you Dollars 500 an hour
for this consultation, claimable, of course, on your medical insurance
policy.
I had better stop then. What is your prognosis for this election?
A political doctor, when not spinning, can only stick to the facts. The only
medical certainty this year is that all three presidential candidates will
be left-handed. This is unprecedented. Can you wonder the country is
disturbed?
