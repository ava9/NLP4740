midwest grain barons - A look at Mike Espy's credentials for the agriculture
secretaryship

MR MIKE Espy, the presidential nominee for the US agriculture secretaryship,
is one of the new breed Clinton Democrats, an articulate moderate, who
straddles the centre on the Democratic party's ideological spectrum and
promotes catfish farming as readily as grains, rice and cotton.
The free traders at the American Farm Bureau hailed his nomination by
President-elect Bill Clinton on the grounds that Mr Espy 'stood up for
agriculture against excessive environmental restrictions during his six
years in Congress.' They view it as a good sign that he attended the Uruguay
Round negotiations in Geneva, journeyed to Mexico to discuss the North
American free trade agreement, supported a balanced budget amendment, and
opposed grazing fee increases.
At the same time, Mr Espy won a 90 per cent rating for his support of
liberal farm programmes from the American Agriculture Movement. His
nomination - as the first black agriculture secretary in more than a century
 -was greeted with glee on the left, which considers the department he will
head as one of the most racist in the government for its dealings with both
black farmers and its own employees.
Ms Kathy Ozer, a spokesman for the National Family Farm Coalition, praised
Mr Espy's efforts to raise farm prices and shift the sector into
'sustainable agriculture'. Although he supported an extension of the
president's 'fast-track' authority to continue negotiations on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement -
which many liberal farm groups opposed - he also voted for their amendment,
declaring that no trade pacts would be accepted by Congress unless they were
in the interest of workers, farmers and the environment.
Any grumbling about the appointment has been muted. But midwesterners, who
have come to regard the US Department of Agriculture as their own, are
seriously worried about the nominee's commitment to grains. One aide to a
north-western senator said the crops grown in the US south - like peanuts,
cotton, tobacco and rice - were among the most protected by the entrenched
southern senators and congressmen and needed the advantage of a sympathetic
agriculture secretary the least.
Agribusiness interests are concerned about Mr Espy's lack of experience with
export-oriented agriculture. Aside from catfish and family farms, 'he has no
track record in agriculture', says Mr Daniel Basse, an Illinois grain
analyst and farm consultant.' He's an unknown. . . The farm community
doesn't know what he will do for farm income and farm exports.'
The fiercest of Mr Espy's critics in the midwestern agribusiness community
are gossiping that he might be eliminated in the confirmation process,
eagerly offering off-the-record comments about his personal life. Having few
allies in large-scale agriculture and facing Senate republicans who might
pounce on the rumours as revenge for the rejection of Senator John Tower,
President Bush's first nominee for the defence secretaryship, on the grounds
of his personal conduct, Mr Espy may face an uphill confirmation battle. One
farm consultant said: 'If the republicans are going to derail anyone, they
might well try Espy, but the Democratic majority is strong enough to
withstand anything but a major attack'.
Mr Garland West, spokesman for Cargill, the Minnesota-based agribusiness
conglomerate, said midwesterners were waiting to see other USDA appointments
before making judgments about Mr Espy's impact. 'The USDA is a bureaucracy,
and we expect there will be a strong cast of supporting players,' Mr West
said. 'Everyone in agriculture is waiting to see the whole picture, which
you don't get from one appointment.'
Mr Espy, 39, from the Mississippi Delta, has represented one of the poorest
regions in the country in the House of Representatives. His family was
prominent and comparatively wealthy, and, as he said in his acceptance
statement, his father, 'fresh out of college with a degree in agriculture',
served as an USDA extension agent in Arkansas.
He has had little to say about the most controversial issues in US
agriculture - the desirability of high farm supports, export subsidies and
agricultural trade liberalisation within Gatt. But he has noted that with
new technologies, globalisation of trade and economies of scale in farm
operations, 'things never will really be the same down on the farm'.
The USDA bureaucracy has grown, while the number of farmers has dropped, he
said. It 'frustrates' rather than 'advocates'. Its factual information must
be improved and its priorities shifted towards the eradication of hunger and
finding new overseas markets for 'our incredible agricultural production'.
Although increased farm exports will be a goal under Mr Espy, he shares Mr
Clinton's passion for new ideas.
He intends to work for the development of community development banks in
rural areas, to encourage more crop diversification and to promote more
value-added production in the US.
