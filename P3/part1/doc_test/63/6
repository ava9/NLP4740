PRESIDENT George Bush's struggling re-election campaign was hit by more bad
news from the west and from the right yesterday.
A Field Poll in the state of California found Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas, the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by 62 per cent to 28 per
cent. In the survey's 45-year history, this is the largest margin at this
late stage of a presidential race. In previous hypothetical match-ups, Mr
Bush usually held a comfortable edge over Mr Clinton, though both trailed Mr
Ross Perot before he pulled out.
Republican candidates have carried California in five of the last six
presidential elections. The rest of the west, where Mr Clinton has been
campaigning hard in the past few days, has been less solid. It now looks
even more fragile if another state poll, in Washington, is any guide. It
found Mr Clinton ahead by 56 to 32 per cent.
The discontent from the right, already patent, came yesterday in the shape
of a newspaper column by George Will, probably the country's best known
conservative pundit, whose fulminations against Mr Bush have been growing
ever more thunderous.
Calling Mr Bush 'a figure of genuine pathos' and his administration 'tired
and arrogant', Mr Will in effect called on the president to give up the
re-election ghost.
'For Republicans,' he wrote, 'the grim paradox is that the reason he should
not run is the reason he will. He should not, because he has no reason to,
other than an ambition eerily disconnected from any agenda. But he will run
because he regards a public purpose as ornamental, as a mere filigree on a
quest for office.'
If Mr Bush pulled out, Mr Will went on from his Washington pulpit, 'two
things would happen. The intellectual claustrophobia of this city and the
Republican party will be instantly dissipated. And the Clinton-Gore
bandwagon would be eclipsed until after the Republican convention ends on
August 20.'
Mr Will did not say who should succeed Mr Bush as Republican candidate. Nor
did Mr Al D'Amato, the Republican senator from New York, who also said
earlier this week that the president might well not run again. Mr D'Amato,
it was thought, was merely trying to put a little distance between himself
and the president so as to help his own re-election campaign.
It has been very fashionable on the right to say that the real problem with
the Republican ticket is not the vice-president, Mr Dan Quayle, whose future
has been the subject of speculation, but the president himself. Some have
been arguing that it would be better for the conservative movement for Mr
Clinton to make a mess of things as president rather than to have four more
years of drift under Mr Bush.
The Bush campaign has been trying to shore up the conservative base. Mr Jack
Kemp, the housing secretary, will now probably get a speaking slot in
Houston, as may Mr Pat Buchanan, the early primary challenger.
The former president, Mr Ronald Reagan, is to kick off the convention with
an opening night keynote address on foreign policy.
