The TV ad opens with California gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein in a 
bold red suit, looking directly into the camera and challenging her Democratic 
opponent, John K. Van de Kamp, to run a positive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case he doesn't get the point, Feinstein's image is suddenly 
replaced by a 1950 photograph of Richard M. Nixon, who Feinstein says "smeared" 
his U.S. Senate opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
As the battle of the TV ads continues to push the California governor's race 
away from a discussion of the issues, Feinstein's advisers have come up with a 
surprising -- and maybe risky -- answer to a commercial Van de Kamp is running 
that attacks her record as mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign advisers William Carrick and Hank Morris offered Feinstein 
possible avenues of counterattack. But they said she rejected this tactic for 
now and chose to capitalize on her front-runner status and try to focus 
attention on the tone of the Democratic gubernatorial primary election. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the 30-second remember-Nixon spot that the campaign started 
producing Monday by filming Feinstein in Los Angeles and finished Tuesday in a 
New York studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted 
(the) record. And we all remember the 1988 (presidential) campaign," Feinstein 
says in her commercial challenge. The first reference was to a very nasty 
California U.S. Senate race in 1950, in which Nixon won his only statewide 
election in part by accusing Douglas of being a communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the new commercial were shipped to TV stations throughout California 
on Tuesday night and will begin airing in various markets tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a high-risk strategy because the usual response to an attack like Van 
de Kamp's is a counterattack," Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris added: "We all know the public is tired of negative ads, but the fact is 
they almost always work." 
</P>
<P>
The consultants admit that Feinstein may be uniquely positioned to try to pull 
off this latest tactic because she is a woman candidate who was sometimes 
called "Goody Two Shoes" when she was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
She sought to back up that approach Tuesday with a speech to business and civic 
leaders in Los Angeles. She declared, "Let's make 1990 the year when we break 
with the past and put negative politics behind us. Unfortunately, it takes two 
to make a positive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But the Van de Kamp campaign said the linking of Van de Kamp to the memory of 
Nixon was as down and dirty as anything seen so far in this campaign. And more, 
Van de Kamp aides said this was not the first time she had tried to link an 
opponent to a reviled politician. They produced a San Francisco Examiner news 
clipping from her 1979 race for mayor of San Francisco in which she likened an 
opponent to a racist politician. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent was Quentin Kopp, now a state senator. The article said that 
brochures Feinstein sent out contained testimonials from black leaders and this 
headline: "The Real Quentin Kopp-George Wallace Returns." (Wallace was governor 
of Alabama and one of the foremost segregationists of the 1950s and 1960s). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Van de Kamp has his own problems with his latest TV ad. Lawyers for 
the San Francisco Chronicle Publishing Co. said they sued him in federal court 
Tuesday for trademark infringement because the spot Van de Kamp is now running 
uses the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper's name four times as it cites 
articles to back up its charges that Feinstein left the city in debt and dumped 
sewage in San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Chronicle Publishing Co. saw their trademark in a photograph 
taken from the Van de Kamp ad that was published in the Los Angeles Times last 
week along with an analysis of some of the Van de Kamp charges against 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp campaign agreed to remove the Chronicle Page 1 nameplate from 
its ad, but Chronicle general counsel Ron Ingram said Tuesday that the type 
used in the remake of the Van de Kamp ad still infringed on the Chronicle 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"It still makes it appear that we are sponsoring the attack on Dianne 
Feinstein," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the independent challenges to Van de Kamp's ad, Carrick and Morris 
believe that the attacks have hurt Feinstein, who soared ahead of Van de Kamp 
and the presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in 
a Los Angeles Times poll taken last month. 
</P>
<P>
The new Feinstein commercial begins with Feinstein citing a Van de Kamp 
quotation from some months ago in which he said he thought the public was tired 
of negative campaigns. "Weeks ago, John Van de Kamp said people are tired of 
negative campaigns," Feinstein says as she looks into the camera. "I don't know 
about John, but I really believe that. I still remember when Richard Nixon 
smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted her record. And we all remember the 
1988 campaign. We Californians are trend-setters. So let's make 1990 the year 
we put negative politics behind us." 
</P>
<P>
But does this strategy mean that Feinstein can go through the entire Democratic 
primary without running a harsh ad about Van de Kamp? 
</P>
<P>
"That's what Dianne would like, but we aren't making any promises," Carrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad? Democratic candidate and former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Target of ad: Her opponent in the primary election, 
current Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
 What the ad says, with an analysis by Times political writer Keith Love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Weeks ago John Van de Kamp said people are tired of negative campaigns. I 
don't know about John, but I really believe that." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a statement Van de Kamp made last year at a 
fund raiser: "People are tired of negative campaigns, tired of negative 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "I still remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and 
distorted her record. And we all remember the 1988 campaign. " 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a particularly nasty U.S. Senate race in 
1950 in California, in which Nixon won his only statewide campaign in part by 
accusing Douglas of being soft on communism. The reference to the 1988 
presidential campaign derives from widespread criticism of President George 
Bush and, later, Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis for some of their harsh 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: ". . . let's make 1990 the year we put negative politics behind us. . . . 
Mr. Van de Kamp, it takes two to make a positive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is sure to face criticism for, in effect, comparing Atty. 
Gen. Van de Kamp to Richard M. Nixon, who resigned his presidency in August, 
1974, during the Watergate scandal.
