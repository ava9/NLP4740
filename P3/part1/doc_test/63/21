At first glance, Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown's advice to party 
leaders to put increased emphasis on the West and South in trying to reverse 
the Democrats' long presidential slump might have seemed unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
But the context of his comments, offered here Saturday at the conclusion of a 
two-day conference on Democratic issues and strategy, could have considerable 
bearing on the party's future. Brown, the Democrats' first black chairman, has 
long been closely linked to the party's traditional liberal base in the North 
and industrial Midwest, while the conference was sponsored by the Democratic 
Leadership Council, a group of moderate-to-conservative officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
So Brown's suggestion that Democrats need to broaden their horizons served as 
striking reinforcement for the notion that dominated the meeting: the 
Democratic need to regain support among middle-class Americans if they are to 
have a fighting chance to regain the presidency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges New Road Map 
</P>
<P>
"We have our work cut out for us," said Brown, whose battle stripes include 
service in the Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson presidential campaigns. "We 
need to chart a road map to the presidency, a road that gives new emphasis to 
the South and the West." 
</P>
<P>
By his remarks here and his very attendance from start almost to finish at this 
centrist function, Brown appeared to be subscribing, at least in general terms, 
to the diagnosis of the party's strategic malady held by such conservatives as 
Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, the DLC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, calling on the nearly 80 elected officials present to take "an 
unflinching look" at the Democratic predicament, declared in his keynote speech 
Friday: "Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the electorate. We 
are losing the working- and middle-class Americans who used to be the mainstay 
of our party's coalition." 
</P>
<P>
No one here argued that the Democrats should turn their backs on low-income 
voters, blacks and minorities who make up their most dependable supporters. And 
some party leaders, such as House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, stressed the 
need for Democrats to maintain their base even as they reach out. 
</P>
<P>
"To make a choice between the interest of median-income Americans and those of 
the less fortunate who want only to scale the ladder to join the median-income 
ranks would be an act of self-defeating folly," Wright declared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Necessary Choice 
</P>
<P>
But Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee, 
conceded that at times the Democrats might have to choose between appealing to 
these two groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the two conflict, as they sometimes do, I feel we have to reach out" 
Bentsen said. "When you've decided your house is too small, it's all very well 
to do some shoring up and strengthening of the foundation. But at some point 
you've got to build where nothing existed before." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, this sort of talk did not sit well with one conference 
participant, heavily dependent for support on the Democratic base -- Jackson. 
He argued that Democrats could improve their presidential performance by 
increasing the turnout of their regular supporters, a tactic which he 
complained 1988 nominee Michael S. Dukakis failed to pursue vigorously enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost 10 states with 160 (electoral) votes by less than the margin of 
unregistered African-American voters in those states alone," Jackson argued. 
The Democrats will be better served, he claimed if they focus on the concerns 
of their hard-core constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"What counts the most," Jackson said, "is not who leads us, but who needs us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scorns Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
He was scornful of suggestions that Democrats try to broaden their appeal. "We 
have to determine which side of history we are on," Jackson told reporters 
between conference sessions. "If we are all things to all people, we become 
rather ill-defined, indecisive. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The argument that Democrats should remain true to their old- fashioned brand of 
two-fisted liberalism was also advanced by Rep. Richard A. Gephardt. A DLC 
founder and 1988 presidential candidate, who like Jackson, is expected by many 
Democrats to try again in 1992, Gephardt invoked the memory of his fellow 
Missourian, Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
As the Democratic standard-bearer in 1948, Gephardt recalled, Truman depicted 
the Republicans as arch-reactionaries, "silent and cunning men who would skim 
the cream from our natural resources to satisfy their own greed." Underdog 
Truman won a stunning upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
"People say populism and saying where you stand doesn't work any more," 
Gephardt said. "I think it does."
