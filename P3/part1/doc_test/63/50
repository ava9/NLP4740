  [Text] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, upon his 
return yesterday from Mexico City, confirmed that the government 
will sign a free trade agreement with Mexico before the end of 
the year. 
  Calderon Sol, who will assume the presidency on 1 June, said 
that "if negotiations continue at their current rate," the 
treaty could be signed before the end of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's term, set for 1 December. 
  The president-elect met with several ministers and local 
business representatives during his visit to Mexico. The 
purpose was to measure the degree of interest in investments in 
El Salvador. He said this was only possible "thanks to the 
stability of the democratic system and the peace process, which 
have given the county prestige." 
  In statements to the Mexican press, Calderon Sol expressed 
his willingness to establish a common market, since this would 
open operations to 120 million consumers, 30 million of which 
are in the Central American isthmus. 
  If no agreement is signed during President Salinas de 
Gortari's mandate, talks would continue with the new president 
to be elected on 21 August. The new Salvadoran president said 
that signing a free trade agreement with Mexico would be the 
first step toward reaching a similar agreement with the United 
States. 
  On 23 May Calderon Sol will fly to Washington to meet Vice 
President Al Gore, who will host a summit meeting several days 
later to discuss NAFTA with all of the Central American 
presidents. In commenting on his scheduled trip to UN 
headquarters in New York, the president-elect said he had "no 
concerns at all about addressing any topic with the secretary 
general." He was referring to statements made by Chief Justice 
Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, of the Supreme Court of Justice, 
during the opening session of the Legislative Assembly. 
  He explained the purpose of his trip was to express the 
political will to fully comply with the peace agreements and to 
request aid from the United Nations, through agencies such as 
UNICEF, FAO, and the WHO. He said that, belonging to this 
international forum, El Salvador has a right to the programs 
these agencies offer. Therefore, it can request such aid "with 
dignity and authority."
