the Massachusetts long shot on the New Hampshire campaign trail

THE PALACE Theatre was packed with students, anti-nuclear activists, a woman
in a Spitting Image mask of Margaret Thatcher, and a cross-section of the
earnest, well-informed voters of New Hampshire. The candidate, a slightly
built man who turns 51 this week, shuffled on stage to a huge burst of
applause.
Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts is enjoying his 15 minutes of
fame in the Democratic presidential campaign. With less than a week
remaining until next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr Tsongas, the long
shot, has drawn level with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early
favourite dogged by accusations of adultery and draft-dodging during the
Vietnam war.
'When I entered the race 10 months ago, George Bush stood at 91 per cent in
the polls. Today he is in the mid-40s. I have done one hell of a job for
this country,' says Mr Tsongas, the candidate whom Richard Nixon describes
as 'too responsible' to become the Democratic nominee.
The rise of Mr Tsongas, the self-styled pro-business liberal, is one of the
more improbable stories of the 1992 election campaign. A Greek American from
Massachusetts, he is a cancer survivor who cannot raise money, a candidate
who three months ago stood at barely 2 per cent in the national opinion
polls, the man who has turned dourness into a political virtue.
'For most political analysts, I don't compute,' he says, showing the
self-deprecating humour which has become his trademark. 'But I know what it
will take to turn this economy round. I am not afraid to tell the truth.'
More than 450 people gathered at the Palace Theatre on Monday night to
listen to Mr Tsongas. He cast himself as the man who can make America
competitive in the international market, restore manufacturing and create
new jobs. In New Hampshire, which has suffered more than most states during
the recession, this is the message which sells.
The gospel according to Paul is one of economic austerity. He dismisses the
middle-class tax cut favoured by other Democratic candidates as a gimmick;
he wants to reduce the Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) federal budget deficit
(although he is vague on how he would cut spending); he supports a capital
gains tax cut and relaxing anti-trust laws to make US corporations more
competitive with Japanese and German counterparts. He is unashamedly in
favour of free trade.
Asked to condemn the Bush administration's proposed North American
free-trade pact with Mexico on the grounds that American jobs 'will go
south', Mr Tsongas says: 'I don't wish to compete with Mexico, Thailand and
Indonesia. I want to compete with Japan and Germany. I want high wages and
high value-added products.'
President Tsongas - which almost sounds as remote a prospect as President
Dukakis, his fellow Greek American from Massachusetts defeated by George
Bush in 1988 - would spend most of his time running USA Inc. 'My job is to
figure out what works, how do you compete?' he says.
It is a narrow vision of the presidency which reduces the world to one long
economic struggle; it offers little clue as to how he would handle, say, the
role of commander-in-chief. Recognising this, Mr Tsongas tried on Monday
night to spell out a more expansive vision.
In a moving speech about his battle with cancer, during which he suffered
radiation equivalent to being within a mile of Hiroshima, Mr Tsongas spoke
of the strength of purpose and obligation which it has brought to his life.
It was an effective performance.
Still, large questions loom over the Tsongas candidacy. By his own
admission, he is desperately short of cash. He may not be able to withstand
the rigours of a long campaign, although a recent television advert shows
him swimming vigorously to underline his physical recovery. More important,
his appeal outside his home base in the north-east looks limited.
These weaknesses suggest it is too early to write off Mr Clinton, who raised
more than Dollars 500,000 at a New York dinner on Monday night, despite
lingering suspicions that he has been badly wounded by the 'character
issue'.
His supporters insist that Mr Clinton does not need to win New Hampshire to
remain a viable candidate, but they have yet to find a way to inoculate him
against further allegations of marital infidelity. And other Democratic
candidates have begun to smell blood.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose campaign remains
stalled in third place behind Mr Tsongas and Mr Clinton, said on Monday:
'One of the worst attributes of politicians is when they begin to feel sorry
for themselves.'
The latest opinion polls suggest that one in two voters in New Hampshire
remain undecided. So far Mr Tsongas has escaped attack; but now he is
jockeying with Mr Clinton at the head of the Democratic pack, it is only a
matter of time before he comes under the same scrutiny as Mr Clinton.
