</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton has regained a sizeable lead over President George Bush in the
run-up to the presidential election on November 3, according to an ABC
News-Washington Post poll. The poll gave Clinton 56 per cent of the vote to
36 per cent for Bush, nearly as big a lead as the Democratic presidential
nominee enjoyed prior to the Republican National Convention.
