  [Text] Yesterday the Solidarity Party announced its 
presidential ticket. It is headed by Samuel Lewis Galindo, a 
businessman. The party also authorized its national directorate 
to negotiate an electoral alliance to face the upcoming 8 May 
elections. 
  The Solidarity Party held its convention at the Atlapa 
Convention Center. The other members of the presidential ticket 
are Carlos Clement as the first vice presidential candidate and 
Marisin Villalaz de Arias as the second vice presidential 
candidate. In his acceptance speech, Lewis Galindo promised more 
jobs, better education, and renegotiation of the foreign debt. 
  The Solidarity conventioneers also agreed to authorize the 
party's national directorate to negotiate before 8 February -- 
the deadline established by the Electoral Tribunal for engaging 
in alliances -- a possible political alliance with other 
parties. According to Villalaz de Arias, the Solidarity Party is 
talking with the National Unity Mission and the Papa Egoro 
Movement about the possibility of an alliance. The presidential 
ticket can be changed to adjust to the results of negotiations, 
a source said. 
  Meanwhile, at the Doctrinal Panamenista Party [Partido 
Panamenist Doctrinario -- PD] convention, Jose Salvador Munoz 
was nominated as the presidential candidate. The nominee for 
first vice president is Rodrigo Bernal, and the nomination for 
second vice president went to Julia Suria. In his acceptance 
speech, Munoz described his party as the third force and the 
best option. According to him, the oligarchy that governed the 
country during the past three years and the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party and its allies, who represent 21 years of 
"military dictatorship and repression," must be discarded. 
  According to reports from the Electoral Tribunal, 1.5 
million 
Panamanians, out of a population of 2.5 million, have been 
called to participate in the general elections in May. According 
to authorities, these will be the first democratic elections 
ever to take place.
