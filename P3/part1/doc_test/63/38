legislator is likely to fill top Treasury post

EVEN before Mr Bill Clinton won the US presidency some of his advisers made
no bones of their belief that the next Treasury Secretary should be capable
of reassuring even the most sceptical in the financial markets that the
administration would give priority to economic and fiscal affairs.
Although some backed Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve, every shortlist included the name of Mr Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
chairman of the Senate finance committee and as heavyweight a legislator as
any in Washington in the last generation. The announcement of his selection
now appears imminent.
To the wider public Mr Bentsen's reputation rests on one immortal sound
bite. In 1988 he figuratively undressed Mr Dan Quayle in their televised
vice-presidential candidate debate by interrupting his young opponent with
the words: 'I knew Jack Kennedy and, senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.'
In the nation's capital, however, Mr Bentsen, 71, has long been known as a
man to be reckoned with.
He arrived after beating an up-and-coming Republican, George Bush, in the
1970 Texas Senate race. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1976, emerged unscathed from his performance in
1988 as Mr Michael Dukakis's running mate and was still mentioned this
spring as a compromise candidate should Mr Clinton falter.
The Bentsen record in Congress is substantive, especially in the last six
years as finance committee chairman. He may not be the 'new kind of
Democrat' Mr Clinton promised to bring into power, but no legislator knows
more about the budget and taxation.
Like the president-elect, Mr Bentsen is a non-doctrinaire conservative on
fiscal matters. He has always favoured business-related tax breaks,
logically given his connections to the Texas oil and gas industry, but he
was an architect of the 1990 Budget Act which produced the tax increase
that, in the end, helped undo President Bush.
He also had a reputation as a closet protectionist. In 1988 he spoke of the
need for a new relationship with Japan which might take away some of its
competitive advantages.
If elected vice-president, he told the Financial Times that year: 'I would
not consider it beneath my office to push US products abroad.' But he has
been a careful supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
is popular in Texas, although sceptical of the fast-track authority under
which it was negotiated.
He has long fought for personal pensions, known as individual retirement
accounts (IRAs), on the grounds that they offer the most workable solution
to the country's savings shortfall. His proposal to extend IRAs to the 55
per cent of two-income families currently ineligible fell victim to Mr
Bush's veto of the urban aid bill in October.
Still unanswered is why Mr Bentsen should want to sacrifice being a grand
panjandrum on Capitol Hill, particularly if it means, as Governor Ann
Richards of Texas has warned, the loss of his Democratic Senate seat.
Perhaps he was persuaded by the arguments that only he could break the
gridlock between the executive and legislative branches. This must have been
Mr Clinton's pitch, as it was from another old Texas friend, Mr Robert
Strauss, now returned to Washington from the US Embassy in Moscow. They are
a persuasive pair.
