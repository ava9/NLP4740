abortion threatens to become a key election factor

NO TOPIC in contemporary America provokes such passion as abortion. For
every poll showing 70 per cent of the country, including a majority of
Catholics, in favour of reproductive rights, another will reveal a similar
number believing that to terminate a pregnancy is to commit a form of
murder.
Not since the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements of more than a
generation ago have the streets been so full of protest. Hardly a week goes
by without an attempt being made to close down, often violently, abortion
clinics. In early April as many as 1m people marched peacefully through
Washington in favour of freedom of choice.
The language of the abortion debate is extreme. Last week Mr Randell Terry,
of the anti-abortion Operation Rescue, had no compunction in declaring that
'anyone who says they are a Christian and yet supports child killing is a
liar and a sheep in wolf's clothing'.
Mr David Andrews, of the Planned Parenthood Federation, can put it just as
starkly. 'We have moved,' he said, again last week, 'from Roe vs Wade (the
1973 Supreme Court ruling establishing the constitutional right to an
abortion) to this administration vs American women, and American women will
not stand for a loss of their reproductive rights'.
Reconciliation seems impossible, so entrenched are the respective positions,
leaving any resolution to the courts, government and politicians. And this
is an election year.
Six justices on the nine-member Supreme Court were elevated by Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Their nominations were designed to advance
the conservative agenda in general and to exclude those known to believe in
freedom of choice in particular. As is often the case, the judges are
beginning to behave in ways not entirely intended by the presidents who
promoted them.
Three justices in particular - Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, both
Reagan appointees, and David Souter, named by Mr Bush - have begun to
inhabit a broad middle ground, pragmatic, often narrow in judgment and
disinclined to set constitutional precedent.
They stand between Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, both of
moderate Republican lineage, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the more doctrinaire right.
Justice Byron White, named by President John Kennedy and the only Democratic
appointment, has become more conservative over the years.
Twice in the last week the new centre turned down Bush administration
arguments - on religion in schools and on habeas corpus. Their general
tendency seems to be to uphold the rights of states to set their own law,
but last Friday they felt compelled to tell Mississippi that it had not done
enough to rectify the legacy of segregation in higher education.
This is, by no stretch of the imagination, a liberal court, as those who
have sought to avoid the death penalty have found out. Moreover, its two
most liberal voices, Justices Blackmun and Stevens, are ageing. There are
rumours that the former will soon retire; moves are afoot in the Senate to
ask Mr Bush not to nominate a replacement before the election, should he
step down.
The political demarcation lines on abortion are clearer. Mr Bush was once in
favour of the right to choice, but changed his mind when he became Mr
Reagan's vice-president. Vice-President Dan Quayle hardly lets a moment go
by without inveighing against the moral perils of single motherhood.
Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, stands solidly
behind freedom of choice, as does his party. The position of many prominent
Catholic Democrats has best been expressed by Governor Mario Cuomo of New
York who argues that, although he accepts church doctrine, he must also as a
public official uphold the law, which now permits abortion.
Mr Ross Perot's opinions are less distinct, as they are on so many issues.
But the prospective independent candidate, while frequently talking of the
need to restore traditional family values, has never called for a ban on
abortion.
In the past, for all the passion it has generated, abortion has tended to
fade as an election determinant. This year, however, the calculation may be
changing.
No single overriding subject is consuming the electorate and, perhaps
because of this and perhaps because its time has come, there has been a
conspicuous surge in interest in women's issues. Almost all, regardless of
party, are pro-choice.
There is even a vocal pro-choice Republican women's lobby which is
threatening to upset the planned unity of the Houston convention in August.
This should concern Mr Bush, whose strength in the party has always derived
in good part from the support he gets from Republican women.
The Supreme Court's action yesterday has ensured abortion stays high on the
political agenda this year.
