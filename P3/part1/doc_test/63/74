</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle said Friday that he was delivering "a very emphatic, 
very strong" message that the United States expects El Salvador's armed forces 
to eliminate violations of human rights or face "consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters just before he entered the Salvadoran military 
headquarters for meetings with Defense Minister Carlos Vides Casanova and 
ranking field commanders, the vice president said: 
</P>
<P>
"And when I emerge . . . there will be no doubt in their minds of our 
seriousness about our commitment to human rights and to justice, and that we 
expect them to work toward the elimination of human rights (violations)." 
</P>
<P>
Although most Salvadoran officials and politicians were more anxious to hear 
Quayle's reaction to recent peace proposals by the nation's Marxist-led 
guerrillas, the vice president made it clear that he wanted the world to know 
of the Bush Administration's concern over human rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early 1980s Violence 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the bloody days of the early 1980s, when more than 800 people a 
month were dying in El Salvador's political violence, most of them at the hands 
of government-sanctioned death squads, the current figures provided by church 
and human rights groups, are relatively light: 96 in 1987 and 145 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle appeared eager to exert influence toward reversing the trend toward 
rising political violence. 
</P>
<P>
He alluded to the December, 1983, visit here by then-Vice President Bush, who 
had threatened an end to the huge American military aid program and apparently 
forced a moderation of government-inspired human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"My message will be direct," Quayle said, "it will be emphatic. It will be much 
along the lines that Vice President George Bush conveyed to them in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, for whom the nine-hour visit here was the last stop on his first 
foreign trip as vice president, flew from Venezuela where he had represented 
the United States at the inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debate About Peace 
</P>
<P>
He arrived here in the midst of efforts by the government and various political 
parties to find a common response to a peace proposal made last week by the 
guerrillas who have been fighting the government for nearly nine years. 
</P>
<P>
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN as the group is known by 
its Spanish initials, offered to take part in a national election for president 
and accept the results of the voting if the election, now scheduled for March 
19, were postponed to Sept. 17. As part of such an accord, the group said it 
would drop previous demands for a negotiated sharing of power and the 
integration of the 7,000 guerrilla fighters with the 58,000-member regular 
army. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-minute session with reporters at the residence of U.S. Ambassador 
William G. Walker, Quayle said the rebel proposal "is a step forward." But he 
added that any negotiations should be accompanied by an immediate cease-fire by 
the FMLN, something the rebels have not offered. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president's remarks came a day after President Jose Napoleon Duarte 
backtracked from his initial rejection of the FMLN offer, saying that the 
proposal now gives "promises of hope." Duarte said any movement toward a 
national consensus had to be within a constitutional framework. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Proposal for War' 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran president had originally called the plan "a proposal for war" 
and said any postponement of the election would be unconstitutional. The 
constitution calls for the first round of presidential balloting to take place 
no later than two months before a new president is supposed to take office -- 
in this case by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's change of mind, under pressure from the Bush Administration and the 
U.S. Embassy here, signaled a subtle shift that allowed the president's 
followers to suggest a solution. For instance, Fidel Chavez Mena, the 
presidential candidate of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party, proposed his own 
peace plan Friday just before meeting with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
The key point of the Chavez Mena's plan calls for all presidential candidates 
to withdraw, thus mooting the election. Under this plan, when Duarte's term 
ends in June, the National Assembly, as permitted by the constitution, would 
appoint an interim president until new elections could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
This plan will be discussed Monday and Tuesday at an all-party conference, 
together with a plan advanced by the Nationalist Republican Alliance, an 
ultra-rightist party now leading the presidential polls. The rightist proposal 
is to invite FMLN leaders to discuss their offer before the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle told reporters that the effort "to develop a national consensus within 
the framework of the constitution is the way to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
But it was human rights that he returned to whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I will have a very direct discussion," he said of his meeting with the army 
leaders. "There will be specifics in my discussion. We're not just here to give 
a platitude for the support of human rights. . . . The conversation and the 
talks will be very direct and very candid." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would threaten the military with an end of U.S. aid, the vice 
president answered: 
</P>
<P>
"There are consequences of human rights violations in the future. We, the 
United States, are committed to the process and the system of democracy. 
Democracy means human rights and decency. . . ."
