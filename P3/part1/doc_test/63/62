BADER HEAPS UP FUNDS TO UNSEAT AYALA; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE ASSEMBLYMAN'S WAR CHEST OF $407,175 HAS MADE THE SENATE RACE THE 
COSTLIEST IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.

Armed with $387,000 more than his opponent, Assemblyman Charles W. Bader 
(R-Pomona) is gearing up for a strong finish in his bid to replace state Sen. 
Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), who is struggling to retain a seat he has held for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Statements filed with election officials by the 34th State Senate District 
candidates showed that Ayala had $19,788 in his campaign treasury at the end of 
September while Bader had $407,175. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheingold, Ayala's campaign manager, said the figures are deceptive. Both 
candidates have raised about the same amount of money, he said, but Ayala has 
probably paid more of his bills. To avoid running up a deficit, Sheingold said, 
he always insists that the campaigns he manages pay bills promptly. 
</P>
<P>
But, Sheingold conceded, it is also evident that with the election less than a 
month away, Bader has "got more money to spend." 
</P>
<P>
In intensive fund-raising efforts over two years, each candidate by the end of 
last month had netted nearly $700,000 in contributions. Bader has saved most of 
his money for an intensive effort to boost voter turnout through absentee 
ballots, and for a barrage of mailers during the final weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said Ayala is using mailers and running an absentee ballot effort, 
too, but is also employing cable television. Ayala has spent $60,000 on cable 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-second spot is appearing on CNN and ESPN programs on cable systems 
throughout the Senate district, which stretches from Diamond Bar and Pomona 
eastward to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial attacks Bader for an incident last June in which he left the 
Assembly floor to attend a political event and another Republican Assembly 
member cast votes for him. Bader has acknowledged the so-called "ghost-voting," 
but said it was done without his authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said the Ayala campaign has turned to cable television advertising 
because he believes political mailers are losing their impact. Bader, however, 
said he thinks mailers are still the most effective approach, and he plans to 
spend nothing on cable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the candidates have raised similar amounts, Bader is getting more help 
from his party and other sources. Bader said that the state Republican Party is 
spending $250,000 in the district, which will push expenditures on his behalf 
by election day above $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said he hopes to get a mailer from the state Democratic Party but its 
expenditures on Ayala's behalf will "not even be close" to the Republican 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the National Rifle Assn., which was angered by Ayala's vote last 
year for a ban on assault rifles, has sent mailers to voters urging Bader's 
election and Ayala's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Sheingold said, Bader will outspend Ayala by $300,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Bader-Ayala race is by far the most expensive campaign in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16th State Senate District, which includes parts of Pasadena and 
Altadena, Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield) began this month with $116,094 in the 
bank, while his Democratic opponent, former Assemblyman Ray Gonzales, had no 
cash and $5,596 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said in his campaign statement that he has raised $77,304 this year 
but spent more than $82,000. Meanwhile, Rogers, who's heavily favored to win 
reelection despite a Democratic edge in voter registration, has raised 
$145,337. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley's five incumbent Assembly members who are seeking 
reelection are all favored to win, but some of their opponents have raised 
enough money to wage strong campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the 60th Assembly District, Republican Ron Aguirre has collected $49,982, 
most of it his own money. He loaned his campaign $38,400. His opponent, 
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), raised only $47,000 this year but 
had $89,653 in the bank at the beginning of this month, including funds raised 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
In the 42nd Assembly District, South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro, the 
Democratic nominee, loaned her campaign $31,000 to help amass a total of 
$62,465 for her race against Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). 
Mountjoy reported contributions of $104,393 so far this year, and had $67,159 
on hand Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st Assembly District, Democratic nominee Jeanette Mann of Pasadena 
raised $50,035, but most of it was spent during the primary. She had just 
$12,047 in cash at the beginning of this month to face Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), who had $136,914 left in the bank after raising more than 
$375,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the 59th Assembly District election to pick a successor to Charles M. 
Calderon, who has moved up to the state Senate, Democrat Xavier Becerra of 
Monterey Park has raised much more money than his Republican opponent, Leland 
Lieberg of Alhambra. Becerra raised $140,000 to win a hotly contested primary 
in the heavily Democratic district and has raised another $78,871 for the 
general election. He reported $32,163 in cash at the begining of this month, 
contrasted with $4,841 for Lieberg, who has raised a total of $14,910 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money raised in the 52nd Assembly District also was spent in the 
primary. Republican nominee Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar raised $342,794, but 
had only $2,642 in cash at the start of this month. His Democratic opponent, 
Gary Neely, also of Diamond Bar, began this month with $3,526 in cash after 
raising $22,586. Horcher's contributions include $238,421 he loaned to his 
campaign.
