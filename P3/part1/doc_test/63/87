Cesar Gaviria, 43, took office Tuesday as president of Colombia and vowed in an 
ambitious inaugural speech to pacify his violence-torn South American country. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria took a tough position against "narco-terrorism," ruthless bombings and 
shootings by the notorious Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Narco-terrorism is the principal threat against our democracy," he said. "We 
will face it without concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign officials attending the inauguration ceremony, which took place in a 
plaza between the Congress building and the presidential palace, included three 
South American presidents and Vice President Dan Quayle. Police and soldiers 
cordoned off a large area around the plaza, and armed helicopters hovered 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The extreme security measures reflected fear of an attack by drug traffickers, 
and so did Gaviria in his speech, recalling the assassinations of three 
presidential candidates in the campaign that ended with his election May 27. 
Police have blamed the Medellin drug cartel for all three slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"No nation in the history of humanity," Gaviria said, "has paid as high a price 
as Colombia . . . for confronting the most powerful criminal organizations in 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
He did not refer to a truce that has silenced narco-terrorist bombs and guns 
since July 28, but he had said earlier that it was good news. The traffickers 
have called for an end to the government policy of extraditing Colombians for 
trial in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria said Tuesday that extradition is a "discretionary" tool, but for the 
government to exercise true discretion, "it is first required that the terror 
disappear and that we have a strengthened judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to leave the door open for a tacit peace arrangement that would 
offer traffickers the alternative of trial in Colombia rather than extradition 
-- if the narco-terrorism ends and if Colombia's courts, made impotent by 
intimidation and bribes, can be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria promised deep reforms in the criminal justice system and special 
protection for judges. 
</P>
<P>
Without effective justice for traffickers in Colombia, the outgoing 
administration of President Virgilio Barco Vargas has in the past year 
extradited 22 accused traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, after meeting with Gaviria, was asked by a Colombian journalist if the 
United States would halt its economic aid to Colombia if the new administration 
stopped extraditing suspected drug dealers to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle did not respond directly but said: "We anticipate the extradition will 
go forward, and we think it will. I have no reason to believe that it will 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria's pacification proposals also include dismantling death squads, which 
have killed thousands of suspected guerrilla sympathizers and other leftists, 
and following through on the Barco administration's peace negotiations with 
guerrilla organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the April 19 Movement, or M-19, laid down their arms last March 
and joined in the presidential campaign. Three other guerrilla groups also have 
entered peace talks, but two others continue to fight the government. 
</P>
<P>
On April 26 a gunman killed Carlos Pizarro, the M-19 presidential candidate. 
Antonio Navarro continued the race as the M-19 candidate and finished third 
with 12% of the vote.
