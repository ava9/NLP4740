THE two commodities with which the Democratic party has become unfamiliar
are hope and unity.  Both are present this week in New York, but both are
still fragile.  Storm clouds hover on the horizon as Democrats gather in New
York to pick their presidential candidate
Not since 1964 has the party held what might be described as a confident
convention. Even in New York in 1976, the precursor of the last presidential
election victory, the hierarchy's suspicions about the insurgent southern
candidacy of Mr Jimmy Carter were only partly allayed by the selection of a
party stalwart, Mr Walter Mondale, as running mate.
The 1968 convention in Chicago was a disaster. The assassination of Robert
Kennedy, the likely nominee, split the party and the anti-Vietnam war
protests in the streets outside were the worst backdrop imaginable.
In 1972 in Miami, procedural wrangling meant that Mr George McGovern gave
his acceptance speech in televised prime time only in Hawaii. Even the
selection of Mr Tom Eagleton for second place on the ticket turned out to be
disastrous when he withdrew shortly afterwards following revelations about
his health.
In 1980 there was a sense of doom about Mr Carter's chances of re-election,
exacerbated by the fact that the party's liberal establishment was
emotionally and politically committed to the cause of Senator Edward
Kennedy.
In 1984 Mr Mondale seemed destined to be defeated from the outset against a
popular incumbent. His choice of Ms Geraldine Ferraro as running mate was
eye-catching and perhaps salved the souls of the activists, but it did
little for the party's national credibility.
Mr Michael Dukakis went to the 1988 convention with hope, ahead in the
polls, but that was to prove illusory. Unity was wafer thin and fell apart
as soon as the Republican guns were turned against him.
Comparisons may be made this year with all the recent predecessors; some
work to Mr Bill Clinton's advantage while others do not. For example, it
probably helps that the party's activist wing, with a litany of liberal
causes that runs to pages, is not the force it was.
Only Mr Jerry Brown of the dissidents remains a non-convert, and even his
own powerful political family from California is urging him to come around,
partly for Mr Clinton's sake but also for the future political prospects of
his sister, Kathleen, now the state treasurer and likely gubernatorial
candidate two years from now.
Conversely, liberals have always been nothing if not enthusiastic, but
genuine exuberance for Mr Clinton is still not conspicuously present. The
enforced harmony of this convention, so Republican in its concept and
execution, may be politically necessary but it may also have the effect of
persuading would-be voters to stay at home in November, which is precisely
what the Democrats do not want.
Furthermore, the Clinton-Gore ticket is a southern one. This makes sense
because if the Democrats cannot break through in that part of the country,
now a solidly Republican stronghold, they cannot win in November. (Mr Ross
Perot's presumed presence in the race makes it even more vital that a
credible southern campaign be effected.)
However, the liberal establishment remains profoundly suspicious of
southerners, even though neither Mr Clinton nor Mr Gore can be described as
political outsiders.
The last successful regional ticket was that of Truman and Barkley in 1948,
a good precedent in one sense because it won, though it did so against all
odds.
The party will be concerned, as it was with Mr Carter in 1976, that a
southern-dominated campaign will lack sophistication and bite. The party
will seek to impose its values and insert its people into Mr Clinton's
organisation, which is still run from Little Rock and still dominated by
those without overweening national reputations. The potential for subsequent
infighting is great.
Nothing unsettles traditional Democrats more than an overt commitment to
traditional values - of religion, the family and the work ethic - all of
which are centrepieces of the Clinton movement. The implication is that such
a commitment leaves out society's less fortunate, most of whom the Democrats
have reckoned to be their own since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Such an approach, no matter how cloaked, appears to be borrowing too much
from Republican clothes, even though the Republican method has led to
victory in five of the last six presidential elections.
Of course, causes have changed. The great party commitment of the early
1980s to the equal rights amendment for women has been replaced by
determination to defend women's reproductive rights, a sentiment which is
certainly more popular in the country at large and which cuts across party
lines.
It is also a fact that the trade union movement, the underpinning of Mr
Mondale, for example, has lost political clout. Yet it can still turn out
the vote better than most (even Reverend Jesse Jackson) if it is turned on.
Mr Clinton, coming from a state in which unions are not favoured, has still
to prove he can do this.
Democrats have also been comfortable traditionally with activist economic
policies, partly to promote their causes and partly in reflex opposition to
Republican alternatives. The decay of the social infrastructure in the last
12 years, many still feel, vindicates these beliefs.
But Mr Clinton is not a conventional 'tax and spend' Democrat and, while
there may be an appreciation of the fact that this makes him a less easy
Republican target, it leaves the question of where his heart really lies.
All these factors, present and sometimes dominant in recent conventions, are
still clouds over New York this week. They may not appear as great as the
fundamental question of Mr Clinton's 'character' and fitness to be
president, but in the months ahead, if not in the enforced harmony of New
York, they will drop their rain on him.
After all, Democrats would not be Democrats if they did not fall out from
time to time. It is a characteristic that makes the party more interesting -
and so difficult to put in the White House.
