showing that Mr Ross Perot is virtually level with President George Bush in
California, with Mr Bill Clinton a close third  - is beginning to focus the
minds of Republican and Democratic strategists on the impact of a strong
independent candidacy in the presidential election.
Vice-President Dan Quayle, for example, noted with some glee this week that
it was quite possible Mr Perot would pass Mr Clinton in the national polls
in the weeks ahead and even emerge as Mr Bush's main challenger in November.
But his satisfaction at this prospect is tempered by growing evidence that
Mr Perot is most popular at this early stage in the south-west and west,
regions which have voted solidly Republican.
The Los Angeles Times survey of Californian voters gave Mr Bush 33 per cent,
Mr Perot 32 per cent and Mr Clinton 26 per cent. Other local polls have put
the Texas businessman ahead in his home state and in New Mexico and coming
on strongly in Arizona.
Even if Mr Perot's support fades as the electoral year progresses, as most
third-party candidacies have, the threat he poses to the two main party
candidates may yet determine the outcome in critical states.
The most immediate concern is for Mr Clinton, assuming he is the Democratic
nominee. To be relegated to third place would undermine his credibility
further, which explains why he has taken to attacking Mr Perot.
On the other hand, the historical record, demonstrated in 1892, 1912, 1968
and 1980, is that measurable independent candidacies tend to hurt the
incumbent president most. Exceptions to this, however, were registered in
1924 and 1948.
Much would depend on how Mr Perot's support holds up. Probably the best rule
of thumb is that the more votes he gets the more he hurts the Democratic
candidate, whereas if his support drops his natural market is more in the
Republican ranks, concentrated in regions where he appeals most.
Mr Perot encourages this prospect by attacking Mr Bush more consistently
than he does Mr Clinton. He said this week that if his friend, Senator Lloyd
Bentsen from Texas, were the Democratic candidate he would not be running.
A strong Perot performance in November also raises the prospect of no
candidate securing a majority in the electoral college, which in turn would
throw the choice of the next president into the new House of
Representatives.
But Mr Perot would have to do very well for this to happen. George Wallace
got 13 per cent of the national vote in 1968 and carried five southern
states, but this was not enough to deny Richard Nixon a comfortable victory
in the electoral college (though not in the national vote) over Hubert
Humphrey.
Conventional wisdom, supported by history, still has it that in the US, as
in Britain, independent, or third-party, candidacies get squeezed in the
autumn as the two main parties become energised. Certainly Mr Perot is now
the subject of the sort of media scrutiny, not all of it favourable, which
can take the bloom off his political rose.
Additionally, he has no formal political organisation in the country at
large, beyond the small army of volunteers now trying to get his name on the
ballot in every state.
Working for Mr Perot are his vast private financial resources, equivalent to
what the two main parties are likely to spend, and the pervasive sense of
dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual and the likely two major candidates.
