THE Democratic party convention has not needed more than a single ballot to
choose its presidential nominee since 1956, and this year's convention in
New York will be no exception.
But Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the winning candidate, appears to
have done a better job than his predecessors of quelling any dissonant
voices that could have upset a show of Democratic unity behind his
candidacy.
Mr Clinton, with the backing of 2,565 of the 4,288 convention delegates, has
had to make remarkably few concessions to his opponents, either on the
content of the party platform or on the roster of speakers for the four-day
gala at Madison Square Garden.
'This will be more unified than any convention I've been to in recent years.
. . This is going to be Bill Clinton's convention,' says one Democratic
party activist now working for the Clinton campaign.
Some of the Arkansas governor's critics within the party have been
strong-armed into a display of team spirit - such as Governor Mario Cuomo of
New York, who has agreed, at the urgent behest of Mr Ron Brown, the party
chairman, to make the formal nominat ion speech on Wednesday night.
Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's strongest challenger during the primaries, has
agreed to endorse his rival in exchange for a chance to speak to the
convention on behalf of his pro-business economic policies.
Others have been kept off the speaking list altogether, notably former
Governor Jerry Brown of California, whose rebellious primary campaign won
him 613 delegates.
Mr Brown's supporters hope to raise a challenge with a procedural vote on
the convention rules, but Clinton supporters are dismissive.
Mr Jesse Jackson, who has endorsed Mr Clinton but has spent the last week
sulking on television because no-one will treat him with the respect he
feels he deserves, could pose more of a problem. His convention speech has,
however, been relegated to Tuesday night, when it seems likely to receive
less attention than the simultaneously broadcast All Star baseball game.
Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mr Clinton will be to come up with an
acceptance speech on Thursday that is not eclipsed by the oratory that has
gone before. The Democrats have lined up all their most talented speakers:
from the acerbic wisecracks of Governor Ann Richards of Texas and the
intense eloquence of former Representative Barbara Jordan, to the emotional
uplift of Mr Cuomo.
Mr Clinton's last convention speech, nominating Governor Michael Dukakis in
1988, has gone down in the Democratic party annals as one of the dullest of
all time, but he can be more exciting.
The party platform, meanwhile, shows the marks of Mr Clinton's moderate
supporters, many of them drawn from the Democratic Leadership Council, a
mostly southern grouping that has set about drawing the party towards the
centre.
Calling for 'a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American
people and their government', the platform includes many traditional liberal
Democratic themes, such as urban investment, abortion rights, affirmative
action in favour of minorities, public support for the arts, and a limited
amount of gun control.
However it also marks a shift away from government interventionism in its
rhetoric on economic policy - although not as far as Mr Tsongas would have
liked.
'An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the
most important family policy, urban policy, labour policy, minority policy
and foreign policy America can have,' the platform states.
'We reject both the do-nothing government of the last 12 years and the big
government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our
way to prosperity.'
Perhaps as important, it contains a significantly tougher anti-crime plank
than recent Democratic platforms, remedying a weakness that the Republicans
have gleefully exploited for decades.
Democratic leaders hope the party platform and the selection of Senator
Albert Gore of Tennessee - a southerner very similar to Mr Clinton in age,
views and style - will help to signal to voters that the Democrats are now a
moderate party representing middle-class Americans, not left-wing interest
groups.
Even some of Mr Clinton's opponents acknowledge that this is likely to be a
more winning electoral recipe than the left wing coalition of recent
elections.
Mr Clinton's campaign has already broken out of the doldrums that becalmed
it this spring, when every step and every statement seemed to strengthen his
image as another slithery politician.
Yet he has not succeeded in putting these doubts about his character wholly
behind him, and is still no better in opinion polls than level pegging with
President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire.
A united convention and an inspired acceptance speech could lift Mr Clinton
by 10 percentage points in the opinion polls, according to one of his
campaign advisers. While this lead would clearly dwindle in August, they
say, it does not have to disappear entirely - as Mr Dukakis's even larger
edge did in 1988.

               THE GHOSTS OF DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS PAST
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
HUBERT HUMPHREY
1968 Chicago
With battle raging in Vietnam and outside the convention hall, Vice-
President Humphrey won the nomination from Senators Eugene McCarthy and
George McGovern. He lost the general election to Richard Nixon.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
GEORGE McGOVERN
1972 Miami Beach
After drafting extensive changes in the Democratic party's selection
rules, McGovern won the nomination but lost in a Nixon landslide.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JIMMY CARTER
1976 New York
In the wake of Watergate, Carter, then a little known Southern governor,
won the nomination and went on to beat President Gerald Ford.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JIMMY CARTER
1980 New York
After a tough primary campaign, President Carter won the nomination but
had to give way to his challenger, Senator Edward Kennedy, on much of
the party's election platform. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WALTER MONDALE
1984 San Francisco
Former vice-president Mondale won the nomination from Jesse Jackson
and Senator Gary Hart, and picked Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate.
The Democratic team was again no match for Reagan.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MICHAEL DUKAKIS
1988 Atlanta
The convention gave Governor Dukakis a big lead over Vice-President
George Bush in opinion polls, but by November it had evaporated.
