In the first substantive meeting in at least six years between a senior U.S. 
official and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader promised 
Vice President Dan Quayle on Monday that he will relinquish power as scheduled 
next month, Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"He guaranteed me two things: One, on April 25 he will turn over his presidency 
to Violeta (Barrios de) Chamorro, and two, he guaranteed to me that Violeta 
Chamorro will appoint all of the ministries, including the Defense Ministry and 
the Interior Ministry," the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle added: "We are going to work with him and others to make this happen. I 
believe it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
While Ortega has made such promises during the 2 1/2 weeks since Chamorro upset 
him in the Nicaraguan presidential election, a senior U.S. official traveling 
with Quayle said that Monday's pledge, made directly to the vice president, was 
taken by the Bush Administration as "a very definitive commitment" that "the 
vice president found . . . very assuring." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's promise to hand over the powerful Interior and Defense ministries -- 
and to guarantee that their new ministers would report to Chamorro -- was seen 
as particularly important because those posts control the governmental 
machinery through which the Sandinistas have exercised much of their control of 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders encountered each other three times during the day in Santiago, 
where they were attending celebrations marking the peaceful transfer of power 
to a democratically elected government after 16 1/2 years of dictatorship by 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, comparing the experience in Chile this weekend to the transition facing 
Nicaragua, pledged "to make the transfer in Nicaragua more peaceful than the 
transfer here in Chile," the Vice President said. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez said during a 
meeting here with Quayle that he and other Central American leaders had agreed 
to meet March 30 and 31, presumably in Nicaragua, and "the main item will be 
the repatriation of the Contras," most of whom are in camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle spoke to reporters as he was about to board Air Force II en route to 
Asuncion, Paraguay, his fourth stop on a seven-day, seven-nation tour of the 
West Indies and South America. 
</P>
<P>
While Quayle's aides said Ortega attached no conditions to his promises, the 
Nicaraguan president told reporters in Santiago that the best way for a normal 
transition to take place "would be that the Contras cease to exist by April 
25," when Chamorro is scheduled to take office. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said Quayle responded that the United States would "seek ways of 
supporting that idea so that the Contras are no longer around by April 25." 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior vice presidential assistant said Quayle only agreed that the 
United States would work toward the demobilization of the Contras without 
setting a specific date for their disbanding. 
</P>
<P>
The twinned questions of the futures of the Contras, the rebel army supported 
by the United States, and of the Sandinista-led Nicaraguan army have dogged 
officials in the United States and Central America as they seek the smooth 
transfer of power from Ortega to Chamorro after eight years of guerrilla 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras are reluctant to lay down their weapons while the Sandinistas 
maintain control of the highly politicized Nicaraguan army. And the 
Sandinistas, for their part, have sought guarantees of their safety as the 
opposition leaders, aligned with the Contras, take over civilian authority in 
the strife-torn Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that United Nations peacekeeping forces could be 
inserted between the two hostile camps, and Ortega was said to have told Quayle 
"that would be fine if they were willing to take a risk." 
</P>
<P>
With Bush about to announce a package of economic assistance for Nicaragua, 
Ortega was also said to have asked Quayle for the immediate lifting of economic 
sanctions imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The vice president 
responded, aides said, that Chamorro had already sought such a move and that it 
was being "actively considered by the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Economic advisers to the Nicaraguan president-elect have asked for $200 million 
to $300 million in aid, and Bush is expected to announce his decision today. 
</P>
<P>
After years of hostility between Washington and Managua, Quayle ended up 
meeting three times on Monday with Ortega, with each meeting longer than the 
previous one and the tone apparently growing warmer as the day progressed. 
</P>
<P>
The longest session occurred over lunch at the Chilean and presidential palace 
with the collection of foreign leaders attending the Chilean celebrations. 
Ortega asked Arias to switch seats with him so that he could sit next to 
Quayle. The two men then ended up in a conversation that lasted 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega later described the discussion as "frank, friendly and constructive." 
</P>
<P>
At a 10-minute meeting during a reception that preceded the luncheon, Quayle 
was said by an aide to have told Ortega that the transfer of power cannot be 
held up while he waits for the Contras to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make unilateral demobilization of the Contras a precondition for the 
transfer of power," Quayle told Ortega, according to a senior Quayle aide. 
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting of the day, they encountered each other for barely one 
minute at the start of a Roman Catholic Mass celebrating a return of democracy 
to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
The interaction throughout the day between Quayle and Ortega reflected the 
turnabout that is occurring in Central America. The vice president, who has 
certainly shared President Bush's angry rhetoric toward the Sandinistas and 
perhaps gone beyond it in harshness, appeared generally relaxed about his 
encounters.
