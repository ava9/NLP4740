This 'deeply weird' election year, as President George Bush never stops
calling it, has come down to this final irony. The selection of the man to
lead the most mobile and changing society the industrialised world has yet
produced will probably be determined in the oldest and most stolid parts of
the nation, that swathe of yesterday's industrial heartland that stretches
from the awful refineries of New Jersey to the ethnic beer halls of
Milwaukee, with a few excursions to the even more ancient colonial south.
This weekend, the voters of about a dozen 'battleground' states will have
digested all they have learned this year about Mr Bush, Governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas, and Mr Ross Perot, a billionaire from Texas. It is now
probably too late for 11th-hour smoking guns, bimbos and October surprises,
unless the unpredictable Mr Perot endorses one of the other two.
There will be no more economic statistics to muddy the waters. It has all
come down to final frantic efforts in non-stop six-state-a-day tours by
Messrs Bush and Clinton, the occasional foray in the flesh by Mr Perot, and
a barrage of commercial advertising by all three to wind up the most
expensive election there ever has been.
All that is now left before tomorrow are the final polls and a lot of
questions. Here are some of the more important:
Can Bush win?
The answer is yes, but luck will be needed. Though he has narrowed his
deficit in the national polls with Mr Clinton, he has not risen much above
35 per cent in any of them. The lowest winning percentages of the popular
vote this century have been Woodrow Wilson's 41.84 in 1912 and Richard
Nixon's 43.42 in 1968, which indicates Mr Bush still has a way to go. But
both those contests featured strong third-party candidates, a role Mr Perot,
vaingloriously, unwittingly and unwillingly, may yet play by spoiling Mr
Clinton's exclusive opposition patch.
But can Bush win the electoral college?
This is where everything must go right on election day, because the
president starts with a huge debit. He has already conceded California, New
York and Illinois, the first-, second- and sixth-largest states, together
worth 109 of the 270 college votes needed to win. He has visited none of
them for weeks and his campaign is paying for no prominent media advertising
in California and New York and only radio spots in Illinois. In 1988, he
took California and Illinois and cannot be unconscious of history which says
that no Republican this century has taken the White House without carrying
California.
In 1988, Mr Michael Dukakis won 11 states, including New York and the
District of Columbia. This year they are worth, excluding New York, 71
votes. None looks even remotely fragile for Mr Clinton, though Mr Bush chose
Wisconsin for a Saturday train tour. It must be assumed the Democratic
candidate will carry Arkansas, his state, and Tennessee, Senator Gore's,
worth another 17 votes.
By a conservative calculation, therefore, Mr Bush is up against an opponent
with 198 electors virtually in the bank, more than double Mr Dukakis's
total, nearly five times what President Carter got in 1980, more even than
Hubert Humphrey in 1968, who lost by only 500,000 popular votes.
This is not, by itself, an insuperable handicap for a man who four years ago
swept the south, cleaned up in all the big states except New York and ruled
supreme elsewhere except some north-eastern states, the Pacific north-west
and Hawaii. The problem this year is that Mr Clinton, a southerner, is very
competitive in his own backyard, especially in bigger states such as North
Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana, with their 36 electors, not to mention
Florida and Texas, the third- and fourth-largest states worth 57 votes.
What is the Bush strategy then?
His campaign claims, without being specific beyond the questionable
inclusion of Texas and Florida, that he leads in 14 or 15 states with about
140 electors and is 'competitive' in a like number. By this, Mr Fred
Steeper, his pollster, means states in which he now trails by one to six
points but which he would win in the event of a last-minute three- to
four-point swing in his favour. He concedes there is no margin for error.
If Indiana, Vice-President Dan Quayle's home and the first state to report
on Tuesday, looks sick, 'we can roll up the rug', though Connecticut and New
Jersey will be the best early tests. In the final days, Mr Bush is spending
all his time in the industrial heartland, before going home to Texas, and is
deploying former President Reagan in the south.
Can Clinton lose?
Again the answer is certainly yes, if Mr Bush's hopeful scenario comes true
and if Mr Clinton suffers some unexpected setbacks. There is another factor.
His whole election strategy was predicated first on breaking the Republican
monopoly on the south and its borders. Of the six elections held after the
impact of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was fully digested, the only Democratic
victory was achieved, in 1976, with a southerner on the ticket. Put another
way, the Republicans gained an inherent advantage in the south which meant
that any Democrat needed to carry about two-thirds of the remaining states
to have a chance of victory. If Mr Clinton does not make his southern
breakthrough, the old electoral mathematics prevail.
In any event, the industrial heartland battleground is crucial. This is a
part of the country which has increasingly split its preferences, voting for
Republican presidents and state governors and Democratic senators and
congressmen. Even in 1976, Jimmy Carter eked out only narrow victories in
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin, losing elsewhere. Mr Bush took them all
except Wisconsin four years ago, though he trails in most of them today.
How will Perot do and whom will he hurt most?
There is no clear answer to either question, except that he will not win the
presidency and will not, barring a miracle, force the election into the next
House of Representatives. Nobody before has tried to buy an election
outright. John Connally's attempt in the Republican primaries of 1976, where
he spent the odd million to win one convention delegate, does not compare
with Mr Perot's personal outlays of well over Dollars 60m, almost all of it
on television advertising, more even than the other two.
Independent or third-party candidacies invariably flourish, flatten and
wither. Mr Perot's 'second coming' in the last month of the campaign may
conform to this pattern but it would require a big shrivelling now for him
to fall back to single-digit irrelevance. His support is drawn heavily from
those previously outside the political process. If they sense he cannot win,
they may stay at home as usual.
Most of them seem more conservative. Admiral Stockdale, his nominal running
mate, and Orson Swindle, his campaign director, are far more critical of Mr
Clinton than Mr Bush, but Mr Perot's particular venom is more directed at
the president.
The only half-safe rule of thumb, borne out by the latest polls, is that the
better Mr Perot does, the more he hurts Mr Clinton; the worse he does, the
more he hurts Mr Bush. At any level, he may spell the difference in Texas
and Florida, which would hurt Mr Bush, and in Michigan and Ohio, which would
more damage Mr Clinton. He will do best in the south-western and mountain
states, until now solid Republican territory, but Mr Steeper claims that
there is no state which Mr Perot can hand to either candidate.
Is there any chance that more Americans will vote this year and, if so, what
does that mean?
In 1988, barely 50 per cent of registered voters - and barely one-third of
those of voting age - cast a ballot, the culmination of a 30-year decline.
Partly because of enthusiasm generated by Mr Perot's drives to get on the
ballot, partly because of vigorous party registration drives and partly
because of the perception that this really may be an important election,
turn-out may reach and even exceed 55 per cent this year.
Low participation usually helps Republicans, less numerous than Democrats
but more likely to vote. This year the Democrats seem to have been signing
up more voters, but so has the Christian right. There does appear, mostly
from anecdotal evidence, to be much greater engagement by young people. This
segment, once fertile ground for Messrs Reagan and Bush but with problematic
current prospects for employment, is now more inclined towards Mr Clinton
and, to an extent, Mr Perot.
What about congressional coat-tails?
Republican hopes for big gains in the Senate and House, based on national
discontent with incumbents, have dissipated. The Democrats might get up to
60 seats in the Senate (they now control 57) which would be enough to stop
filibusters, while losing only 15 to 20 in the House, where they currently
hold a large 268-166 edge over the Republicans, with one independent. There
will be a huge turnover, however, with 120 to 150 new denizens on Capitol
Hill next January.
Trailing in the polls, Mr Bush was shunned by many Republican candidates,
whereas Mr Clinton had far closer identification with his party aspirants,
especially a new crop of women. In general, coat-tails  - from the
presidential candidates down to Congress and vice versa - are not expected
to be strong.
All right then, in the last analysis, what will decide this election? And
who will win it?
Mr Fred Malek, a Bush campaign director, concedes that if the election were
merely a referendum on the economy his man would already have lost. Mr
Clinton believes that is still the case and that the nation will pass its
own negative verdict on 'trickle-down' economics and a positive one on his
detailed plans for change.
Mr Malek now argues that the electorate is focusing on just two issues - who
has the better future plan for the economy and which man has the integrity
appropriate for the presidency. Regardless of whether the Bush attacks on Mr
Clinton have been fair or warranted - and many have not been - personalities
are critical in a presidential election. If Mr Bush wins, it will be because
he has undermined public confidence in Mr Clinton.
But elections are also about looking forward with hope to new changes and
challenges, and that clearly is the much younger and more articulate Mr
Clinton's forte. If Mr Clinton wins, it will be because he has exposed the
exhaustion of Republican policies after 12 years in power.
There are no safe bets in this game. The spread remains where it has been
for some time - between a comfortable Clinton victory and a narrow Bush one.
Either is possible and so is something in between, and there are a lot of
racetracks to visit from Michigan to Florida.
