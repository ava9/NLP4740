DAN QUAYLE, US vice-president, carefully set about business as usual
yesterday in the wake of President George Bush's collapse in Tokyo. He spent
a few hours in his White House office before leaving for a campaign trip to
New Hampshire, which will hold the first primary election of the year next
month.
Mr Quayle defines his role in Mr Bush's re-election team as the campaign's
pit bull terrier, assigned to confront head-on the conservative challengers
for the Republican party's nomination.
That he is allowed to campaign at all is a measure of the ground he has
regained since his disastrous showing in the days after Mr Bush picked him
to be his running mate in the 1988 election.
Successful campaigns in Indiana for election to the House of Representatives
and then the Senate had not accustomed him to hostile press questioning, and
Mr Quayle himself concedes that he lost control.
Mr Quayle thought the onslaught would die away after the election. It did
not.
The vice-president remained the butt of every satirist, building his own
legend with a new string of blunders and spawning a vast Quayle joke
industry.
Over the last year, however, the image of the vice-president as a pampered
featherbrain has undergone considerable revision. In what is widely
acknowledged as a difficult role with few defined functions, Mr Quayle has
managed to make a number of initiatives. His special field has been
deregulation, as chairman of the president's council on competitiveness.
Assessments of his success as a deregulator are mixed. Some right-wing
groups complain that the Bush administration has added new layers of red
tape. Other critics contend that his well-publicised initiatives to curb
America's litigation addiction by reforming the civil justice system or to
speed up the Food and Drug Administration's procedures for approving new
medicines have, for the most part, simply repackaged measures that were
already being implemented.
Perhaps the best testimony to his effectiveness, however, is the fierce
hostility that several congressional committees are now showing to his
competitiveness council.
At the same time, Mr Quayle is increasingly considered as a bona fide
spokesman for the right-wing of the Republican party within the
predominantly pragmatic Bush administration.
Mr Quayle's press clippings, too, have changed markedly for the better.
Mr David Broder, the Washington Post's senior political writer, and Mr
Robert Woodward, its well-known investigative reporter, are publishing this
week a seven-part reassessment of his career. They depict an ambitious
politician who, far from being plucked from obscurity, in fact conducted a
skilful, low-key campaign for the vice-presidency; and their judgments
appear for the most part to reflect favourably on Mr Quayle.
But the vice-president's problems lie less with Mr Broder and his ilk than
with Mr Jay Leno or Mr David Letterman, the late-night television comedians
whose jokes have done much to create the Quayle legend.
While Mr Quayle's stock has undoubtedly risen in Washington, it is less
clear that the rest of the country has forgotten the disastrous, if arguably
unfair, first impression he made in 1988.
A Gallup poll in November showed that three quarters of those questioned had
no greater confidence in Mr Quayle as a leader after seeing him in office
for three years. Only 37 per cent thought him qualified to be president,
against 53 per cent who found him unqualified.
Even among Republican voters, 32 per cent believed Mr Bush should choose
another running mate for the 1992 election.
Few votes are decided on the basis of the vice-presidential nominee, and a
few months ago, with President Bush coasting in the polls, the unfavourable
perception of Mr Quayle might not have mattered.
But with the president's collapse in Tokyo reawakening concerns about Mr
Bush's health, Mr Quayle has much to do to turn himself into an electoral
asset.
