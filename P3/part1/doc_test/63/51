President Bill Clinton may be having mixed success in persuading Congress to
pass the laws he wants, but he is making more progress at putting his stamp
on the men and women who will interpret those laws.
Already, Mr Clinton has won Senate confirmation for 86 of his nominees to be
federal judges, and White House officials hope they may be able to squeeze
another 40 or so through in the next few weeks before the Senate breaks up
ahead of November's congressional elections.
That would not only make a dent in the sizeable backlog of unfilled
judgeships that Mr Clinton inherited from President George Bush; it would
also go some way to changing the complexion of the federal judiciary away
from the conservative nominees of Mr Bush and President Ronald Reagan.
That includes Mr Clinton's two nominees to the nine-member Supreme Court,
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, the first two
justices nominated by a Democratic president since President Lyndon Johnson.
In ideological terms, the change is not stark.
Very few of Mr Clinton's nominees have aroused much opposition. Most have
been, like Mrs Ginsburg and Mr Breyer, moderates of unquestioned legal
competence.
This is in contrast to the Justice Department, where in fields ranging from
civil rights to anti-trust the Clinton administration has diverged sharply
from the policies of the Reagan and Bush years.
The biggest confirmation row so far came over Judge Rosemary Barkett, a
former Catholic nun from Florida whose reservations about the death penalty
came under attack. But Ms Barkett eventually won confirmation to a seat on
the 11th circuit federal appeals court, which covers Florida, Georgia and
Alabama.
Another nominee who has aroused some controversy, Judge Lee Sarokin, has yet
to be confirmed.
Mr Sarokin was removed in 1992 from a liability case against a cigarette
company by the 3rd circuit appeals court to which he has now been nominated.
In diversity of background, however, Mr Clinton's selections differ
radically from the white males chosen overwhelmingly by Mr Reagan and Mr
Bush.
Among the judges so far nominated or confirmed, Mr Clinton has already
picked more women than Mr Bush did in his whole four-year term, and over
one-third more than Mr Reagan in eight years. The 28 black Americans he has
nominated beat by almost 50 per cent the combined Reagan-Bush total.
