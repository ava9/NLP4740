FT  17 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasury market faces test of nerve

SOME people, it seems, are never satisfied. Despite the fact that Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has sanctioned more interest
rate cuts in the past 18 months than any of his predecessors over a
comparable period, and despite borrowing costs being at their lowest level
for almost 30 years, the call has gone up again for another policy ease.
The politicians, of course, are still unhappy with the Fed for not doing
more to boost economic activity, but in an election year that is to be
expected.
The economic pundits in the media also continue to press for further rate
cuts, while plenty of their counterparts on Wall Street agree that more
should be done to breathe fresh life into the weak recovery.
All argue that recent economic indicators show interest rates need to go
lower if consumers are to be persuaded to dig into their wallets and pick up
their spending.
Some go even further, such as Mr Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at
brokerage house CJ Lawrence. Commenting on last week's 'disappointing' 0.4
per cent rise in July industrial production, Mr Yardeni said: 'Manufacturing
production is at a standstill. Weak early August car sales are not
encouraging. We believe lower interest rates are needed just to sustain slow
growth in the economy.'
The chances of a new cut in rates, however, are slim.
For one, the sustained and troubling weakness in the dollar has left the Fed
with less room to manoeuvre. Regular and co-ordinated intervention by US and
European central banks to support the ailing currency during the past few
weeks has shown how concerned the monetary authorities are by the steady
decline in the dollar.
The Fed is unlikely to give the green light to another interest rate
reduction, which would make the dollar even less attractive to overseas
investors, at a time when central banks worldwide are working hard at
propping up the US currency.
Second, the Treasury market is becoming more nervous about the outlook for
efforts to reduce the budget deficit as the election battle hots up, and so
another policy ease may not bring long-term market rates down much further.
Last week was a clear example of how the bond market is unwilling to push
long-term rates substantially lower.
On Thursday, the 30-year bond nose-dived after Mr James Baker, the new chief
of staff at the White House, said tax cuts should be the centrepiece of
President George Bush's re-election campaign and second term.
His comments immediately drew fire from bond analysts. Mr Mitchell Held, of
Smith Barney, said that 'if Baker's statement is meant to imply that
attempts to balance the budget will begin to play second fiddle to the need
for new federal fiscal stimulus to undo the economy's lethargy, then the
fixed-income market's disapproval has only begun to be heard.'
More of that disapproval could be on display over the next few days during
the Republican Party convention.
The market is particularly concerned that the president may announce during
his acceptance speech a tax cut as part of a package of economic stimuli
aimed at recapturing the ground lost in the polls to Democratic nominee
Governor Bill Clinton.
Rumours that he may do just that were flying around Houston yesterday as
delegates arrived for the convention, as was speculation that the president
is ready to recommence hostilities with Iraq.
It looks as though the next five days will be a test of the Treasury
market's nerve - if it breaks, bond yields could head back up through 7.5
per cent in a hurry.
