<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, with a pair of vacant congressional seats up for grabs, Orange 
County's political stage featured a host of candidates battling it out for the 
rarely available, highly secure federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
This year's county congressional races haven't provided voters with the same 
kind of spectacle. There are no open seats, and all five of the county's 
congressmen are heavy favorites to win. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the races, the incumbents face no active major party opposition at 
all. No Democrats surfaced to challenge 43rd District Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad), who represents southernmost Orange County and northern San Diego 
County; his only opponents are Libertarian Richard L. Arnold, a retired Army 
officer, and Peace and Freedom Party member Doug Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, 38th District Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) confronts a 
Democratic opponent who dropped out of the race before the primary election -- 
too late for her name to be pulled from the ballot -- but won anyway. Planned 
Parenthood spokeswoman Barbara Jackson said last spring that she withdrew to 
protect her nonprofit employer, and last week she reiterated that "nothing has 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
In the county's other three congressional races, the incumbents at least face 
spirited, though under-funded, opponents of decidedly different political 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Francis X. Hoffman, the Democratic candidate in the 39th District, said he is 
running against Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) to give voters a 
choice and to raise certain issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any illusions about a landslide in November," said Hoffman, a 
Garden Grove attorney and Democratic Party activist. "But I'd like to see him 
(Dannemeyer) answer for the votes he's taken. . . . Two years ago, he wasn't 
opposed (by a Democrat) and he wasn't made to answer for anything." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Hoffman takes exception to Dannemeyer's persistent attacks on 
homosexuals, especially the congressman's reading into the Congressional Record 
explicit descriptions of homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
"If my kid came across this, I'd punch Mr. Dannemeyer right in the nose," 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer called Hoffman's position "ridiculous" and said he read the 
descriptions into the Congressional Record so that the public would know 
exactly what homosexuals do. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more bizarre tactics Hoffman has employed in his campaign was taking 
and releasing the results of an AIDS test and a lie-detector test, in which he 
was asked if he had ever engaged in sex with another man or if he had ever been 
unfaithful to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The answers were all negative, and Hoffman wants Dannemeyer to submit to a 
similar test. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't normally consider doing something like that, but he seems so severe 
in his criticism," Hoffman said. "Leadership should be by example." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, when asked if he would consider Hoffman's challenge, said his blood 
was determined to be free of the HIV virus three years ago when he donated 
blood. As for taking a lie-detector test to prove his heterosexuality and 
faithfulness to his wife, Dannemeyer said Hoffman "has the whole concept of due 
process turned upside down. I'm presumed innocent until someone proves me 
guilty or even suggests that I'm guilty of something." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and his wife celebrated their 35th anniversary last month, the 
congressman pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said he intends to focus his campaign on such issues as the need for 
a balanced budget amendment, reduced government spending and a more secure 
southern border 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Peace and Freedom Party stalwart Maxine B. Quirk, is also in 
the race and brings with her a call for action. A 68-year-old apartment owner 
who lives in Orange, Quirk said the electorate should sweep out the entire 
Congress, along with Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to get out all the incumbents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 40th District, freshman Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) is also 
facing a candidate who says he is running primarily to keep the Democratic 
Party name and philosophy afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody had to do it," said Laguna Beach attorney and Democratic Party 
activist Eugene C. Gratz. "Particularly in the 40th District, somebody had to 
be willing to do it to focus voters on the issue of choice." 
</P>
<P>
Cox -- whom Gratz describes as "bright" and "an effective legislator" -- 
supports abortion rights but opposes government funding for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
But Gratz, an issues-oriented candidate who taught English and theology before 
getting his law degree, says the distinction is irrelevant. "You can't 
seriously say that you're not anti-choice if you're anti-funding," Gratz said. 
"The deprivation of funds is tantamount to the deprivation of the procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, whose main domestic issues are budget reform and fiscal responsibility, 
called Gratz's argument "fallacious." 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers need not subsidize yet another new spending program," Cox said. "The 
notion that the government must subsidize something because it is someone's 
personal choice is not logically compelled." 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal 40th District, occupied by freshman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Long Beach), Democrat Guy C. Kimbrough is not quite ready to lump himself 
with candidates running solely to make a point or keep the party name on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go into this race as some sort of Pollyanna to raise some issues," 
said Kimbrough, a political science instructor at Mt. San Jacinto College. "I 
entered to win." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough hopes to raise money from arts supporters nationwide who may be 
angered by Rohrabacher's much-publicized opposition to the National Endowment 
for the Arts. He said that he will also focus on the issue of a woman's right 
to an abortion, which Kimbrough supports and Rohrabacher opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, however, said Kimbrough is on the wrong side of both issues. "If 
he leans toward using tax dollars to subsidize pornography and sacrilegious art 
in order to get money out of the Hollywood left, I think he's making a 
mistake," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said he will not focus his campaign on the NEA, but rather on 
his support of the aerospace industry and his views on tax and spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of things I want to try to cut out of the budget," 
Rohrabacher said.

issue that must be left to the states, that the U.S. Constitution does not 
grant the right to abortion, and that the federal government should neither 
assist nor finance abortion.
