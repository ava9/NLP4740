Clinton have fielded a mix of seasoned veterans and hungry newcomers as
advisers

As life sometimes imitates art, so politics can imitate baseball. Thus it
must be recorded that last Monday, Jose Canseco, the heavy hitter of the
Oakland Athletics, was summarily traded to the Texas Rangers for a less
renowned slugger and a pair of pitchers. Three days earlier David Cone, the
New York Mets' star, was abruptly shipped to the Toronto Blue Jays for two
players of whom only their parents had ever heard. And Jeff Reardon, who has
saved more games than any other pitcher, was moved from the Boston Red Sox
to the Atlanta Braves.
American politics, too, has seen a transfer of serious proportions - with
big Jim Baker, the slugging secretary of state, and the rest of his
departmental infield going to the team of George Bush, the former Yale first
baseman, who promptly sent Sam Skinner, Clayton Yeutter and a host of others
to minor league oblivion.
The new Bush line-up was ready for action in time for the traditional
opening of the 'real' election season, which begins after Labor Day
(yesterday), two months before the country finally votes. But perhaps it
took the field a little late. Although the latest opinion polls vary widely,
all show Clinton holding on to his lead - 46 per cent against 40 per cent
for Bush in a Time magazine survey and 49 per cent versus 40 per cent in a
new NBC poll.
The Baker deal was long-rumoured. But politics, like baseball, can also
suddenly propel to prominence those known only to the true fan. James
Carville, George Stephanopoulos, Mickey Kantor, Betsey Wright, Mandy
Grunwald are not exactly household names. Neither are Rich Bond, Mary
Matalin, Bob Teeter and Charlie Black. However, if Bill Clinton becomes the
next president, a lot of credit will go to the first five, and a few more
besides, and if Bush wins another term he will owe much to the second four,
while reserving the best champagne for Mr Baker.
Good teams can make a difference in elections, though they are not
infallible in their judgments, as two seasoned professionals, Ed Rollins and
Hamilton Jordan, found when they cast their lots with Ross Perot. And they
cannot always pull off the same trick twice, as Mr Jordan and the Carter
team discovered in 1980. Still, until Mr Baker moved over, there was no
question that the hungrier Clinton team, toughened by a bitter primary
season, was running circles around Mr Bush's stodgy lot, which sent him on
disastrous road trips to Tokyo, Panama and Munich. As Mr Clinton's lead over
the president assumed serious proportions, some began to be viewed not
merely as campaign operatives but as leading lights in the next Democratic
administration.
This is more than premature and may be misleading. In 1976, Jimmy Carter
reached out beyond the tight Georgian ship that had helped him win the
presidency when filling senior foreign and economic policy positions in his
administration. The Clinton campaign, still based in Little Rock, is less
stuffed with Arkansas razorbacks than Mr Carter's was with Georgia bulldogs,
but it, too, will get its share of the plum slots in the White House
apparatus. There also remains a residue of a Democratic
government-in-waiting qualified to serve and, after 20 of the past 24 years
in the wilderness, rallying behind the Clinton cause.
His inner circle, together for most of the year, seems tightly knit but is
subject to innumerable sub-divisions. It has its pure political gunslingers,
such as James Carville - the 'ragin' Cajun' who was architect of Harris
Wofford's upset victory in last year's Pennsylvanian Senate by-election.
Another is the deceptively youthful George Stephanopoulos, on the Dukakis
communications staff four years ago and now, in practice, the chief Clinton
spokesman.
The Clinton camp also has its professional experts (Mandy Grunwald, the
hard-nosed media consultant who persuaded Mr Clinton to play his saxophone
on late-night television); old hands from the Arkansas state house (Betsey
Wright, brought back to handle the 'bimbo' factor and now doing much more);
and veteran Democratic consultants (Mickey Kantor, who has advised everyone
from George McGovern to Walter Mondale, including, in 1976, Jerry Brown).
The party itself has a national chairman, Ron Brown, with a feline
diplomatic touch and considerable organisational skills.
The great characteristic of this inner circle so far has been its quick
reactions. Mr Carville considers passivity a crime, while Mr Stephanopoulos
learned to his cost what sitting back did to the Dukakis campaign. It has
done its homework on the Bush record and every charge gets a counter-attack.
A televised exchange of views last week on economic policy between Mr
Stephanopoulos and Charles Black showed both camps at their best, with both
drawing on statistics published only hours before.
Clinton's team has also been careful not to impinge on Mr Bush's
prerogatives as president, especially in foreign affairs. But this artful
deference is currently being severely tested by the president's ability to
hog the domestic headlines and dispense largesse, in an ostensibly
non-partisan manner, in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.
The Clinton team also has its Bill and Hillary factions. In the first are
those who, along with Mr Clinton himself, are mostly interested in how
government can solve practical problems; in the second are those who, along
with the candidate's wife, are more interested - to paraphrase Tom Wolfe's
The Right Stuff - in testing the outer envelope of ideas. A measure of
tension between the two camps has been detectable. Mr Clinton has his
academic networks, some input from the media, plus a sizeable leavening from
the conspicuously moderate Democratic Leadership Council. Many of Mrs
Clinton's friends, such as Mr Kantor and Susan Thomases, nominally her
scheduling director, are from those areas of social reform for which Hillary
has long been an advocate.
At the next remove from the inner circle are the policy advisers whose roles
have grown as Mr Clinton has become a national candidate. Here the names are
more recognisable, especially in the areas of foreign and economic policy.
Tony Lake (one of the first outsiders to join the effort) and Richard
Holbrooke, both ex-Carter state department, Michael Mandelbaum and Peter
Tarnoff from the Council on Foreign Relations, and Warren Christopher,
deputy to Carter's secretary of state Cyrus Vance (now UN special envoy to
the former Yugoslavia), stand out in the foreign policy area. For what it is
worth, the popular betting is that either Mr Christopher or Congressman Lee
Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, will end up as
secretary of state, with Mr Lake a likely national security adviser.
The economic policy group has some heavy hitters, though none seems
particularly close to the candidate. They include investment bankers such as
Robert Altman, Felix Rohatyn, and Bob Rubin and Bob Hormats of Goldman
Sachs, Peter Peterson, commerce secretary in the Nixon administration, as
well as academics and authors such as Robert Reich and Lawrence Summers from
Harvard and Rudiger Dornbusch from MIT. One of them may emerge as secretary
of the Treasury or eventually as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Perhaps more interesting are the ideas emanating from the likes of Rob
Shapiro and Elaine Sciulla Kamarck of the Progressive Policy Institute,
research arm of the Democratic Leadership Council, and Ira Magaziner, a
Rhode Island business consultant with some blue-chip clients. Their
practical and eclectic arguments on the development of human capital in the
economy seem particularly close to Mr Clinton's own philosophies.
At a further remove, and bringing more specific expertise, are Tim Wirth,
the retiring senator from Colorado and authority on the environment, Senator
Sam Nunn and Congressman Les Aspin, both candidates for defence secretary in
a Clinton administration, Jim Jones, the former congressman and now chairman
of the American Stock Exchange, and another congressman, Dave McCurdy from
Oklahoma, with an expertise on international security issues.
Bush's team gets shorter shrift because Mr Baker's assumption of control
reduces the scope of many of its previous leaders. Indeed, until he came
over, it was not always easy to work out who was running the campaign. This
was in sharp contrast to 1988, when Mr Baker fitted in seamlessly with the
late Lee Atwater, the political director who played it rougher than anyone.
That partnership worked because Mr Baker was the strategist and Mr Atwater
the executor with a musician's feel for what the country wanted to hear. It
is not easy to see who will be this year's necessary eyes and ears of Mr
Bush and Mr Baker, both patricians to their marrow. Bob Teeter is an eminent
pollster and, together with Charles Black, he brings a wealth of experience
and knowledge to the campaign, but both are more intimates of the president
than of the man in the street. Atwater acolytes, such as Mary Matalin, the
abrasive political director, and Torie Clarke, the campaign's witty
spokeswoman, do not have his clout, though they may be just as hard to
muzzle.
It is a fair bet that less will be heard in the coming months from Rich
Bond, Ron Brown's opposite number. Mr Bond took over the Republican party
chairmanship after working for Congressman Bill Green of New York, the
quintessential moderate Republican, which sometimes made his fervent support
of the conservative agenda look a little odd. But at least he can claim he
made the convention run roughly on the right time. Vice-president Dan Quayle
will be equally confined to partisan corridors, inveighing only against
Hollywood liberals, the media and other targets of the right.
In the end Mr Baker may decide he is better off with his own instincts and
the advice of his own kitchen cabinet - Margaret Tutwiler, the messenger,
Bob Zoellick and Dennis Ross, the ideas men, and Liz Mullins, the
politician. Certainly the maestro will have the principal role in preparing
Mr Bush for his critical debates with Mr Clinton later this month and next.
He will hope here to emulate his performance in 1988, when he outmanoeuvred
the Dukakis team in all the negotiations over format.
The teams can pump and prime the candidates, but ultimately George Bush and
Bill Clinton are on their own, each as fallible as the other. Baseball knows
this unpredictability; immediately after the great transfers, Oakland, minus
Canesco, could hardly score a run against Baltimore and David Cone was
thrashed in his Toronto debut. Bill Clinton played softball last week - and
his team won - but that hardly counts.
