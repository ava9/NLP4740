perils of being offered a job in Washington

IT IS one thing to be chosen to serve as a senior member of a US
administration. It can be another successfully to run the gauntlet of
official and media scrutiny and be confirmed, unscathed and with reputation
intact, in the job.
This has been very much the experience of President-elect Bill Clinton's
nominees. It is still unlikely that any will either be rejected by the
Senate - the fate of Mr John Tower, President George Bush's defence
secretary-designate - or have to withdraw from consideration - as happened
to Mr Ernest Lefever, a controversial Reagan choice in 1981 for a senior
State Department position.
But such is the intensity of interest in the life and careers of those
chosen that few emerge unbruised. Probably even more know that they were not
selected because of something in their backgrounds that rendered them too
suspect. Those conspicuously affected by publicly disclosed problems
include:
Ron Brown, commerce secretary-to-be: on Wednesday a gala in his honour was
cancelled because its cost was being underwritten by corporations he might
find himself dealing with in the cabinet. Though the event was planned
before he was nominated and to recognise his achievements as Democratic
party national chairman, it looked too cosy for comfort and Mr Clinton urged
him to call it off.
Zoe Baird, the choice for attorney general: the New York Times reported
yesterday, on the basis of information supplied to Mr Clinton's staff and to
the FBI by Ms Baird herself, that she had employed a Peruvian couple as
housekeepers knowing them to be illegal aliens. The practice may be
commonplace, especially in Washington, but is potentially embarrassing for
anybody picked to be the country's chief law enforcement officer.
Warren Christopher, nominee for secretary of state, has had to address the
issue of what he knew 25 years ago as deputy attorney general about US army
covert surveillance of civil rights and anti-war activists. This
investigation, not in the least threatening to his confirmation, is the
handiwork of Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican Senator from North Carolina
and self-appointed scourge of anybody associated with President Jimmy
Carter's foreign policy.
Robert Reich and Laura Tyson, prospective labour secretary and head of the
Council of Economic Advisers, have been on the receiving end of much
professional jealousy from classical economists.
Mickey Kantor, chosen to be trade representative, a field in which he has no
track record, has similarly been denigrated by trade specialists.
More generally, lots of egos have been bruised by Mr Clinton's relentless
pursuit of diversity in his appointments, to the point where any number of
disgruntled hopefuls now freely complain they have been left out because
they are white and male.
This has been very much a 'top down' transitional operation, run by the
Clintons themselves and using their extensive networks of contacts.
Mr Richard Riley, the able former governor of South Carolina and education
secretary-designate, has been their chief Washington eyes and ears, with
genuine vetting influence, but real power has continued to reside in Little
Rock. This can frustrate the capital's barons who expect to be able to place
their people in senior jobs, especially since Mr Clinton seems to take his
time making up his mind.
However, the Clintons are also the victims of circumstance. All prospective
nominees to senior positions are subject to rigorous FBI background checks.
Mr Frank Weil, Mr Carter's first commerce secretary, recalls the alarm of
fishermen at his Maine holiday home at being contacted by the FBI. Ms Baird,
presumably sensing a problem that could not be kept under wraps, volunteered
her information.
Investigations are also pursued by both the media and the political
opposition, a fact of life with which Mr Clinton himself is only too
familiar from last year's campaign. Republican questioning of nominees has
to date been pretty soft and unrevelatory, but the process has barely begun,
with as many as 1,000 appointees subject to Senate confirmation.
Transitions are, by definition, ephemeral, but they are also dangerous,
particularly when a different party takes over the administration. By the
time Mr Carter took office in 1977, the word in Washington was that if his
government was no better than his transition staff then it would not fare
well.
No such closet conviction yet seriously attaches to Mr Clinton's transition.
Mr Brown is the only nominee whose professional career seems to conflict
with Mr Clinton's promise of a new and open way of doing things, but even
his critics acknowledge that he has been good at whatever task he has turned
his formidable talents to.
Interest will also soon switch to Mr Clinton's policies and away from those
he chooses to implement them. From the president-elect's perspective, the
inauguration probably cannot come soon enough.
