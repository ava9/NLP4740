<TEXT>
<P>
By a quirk of antiquated American law, George Bush Wednesday became the first 
vice president since Martin Van Buren 150 years ago to inform Congress 
officially that he had won the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to this two-month-old "news" and the formal counting of electoral 
votes, members of the House and Senate erupted into cheers and gave Bush a 
standing ovation as he declared himself and his running mate, Dan Quayle, the 
victors over Democratic foes Michael S. Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen 
(D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
While the tradition, dating back to the days of powdered wigs, is regarded as 
laughable by many lawmakers, Bush's role as presiding officer for the Electoral 
College announcement was required by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, for example, Vice President Richard M. Nixon had to certify that 
John F. Kennedy had defeated him for the White House in 1960. In 1837, Van 
Buren announced that he had won a lopsided race against William Henry Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in a half-empty chamber for the quadrennial ritual, Bush was pounded 
on the back and his hand was pumped steadily by the applauding members of 
Congress, especially the Republicans lining the center aisle of the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
He was preceded by two teen-aged pages carrying leather-trimmed mahogany boxes 
with leather straps -- suitable for stagecoach travel or the pony express -- 
that contained the formal certifications of electoral votes from the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
Wielding a mean left-handed gavel, Bush called the rather raucous audience to 
order and instructed the four tellers, two from the Senate and two from the 
House, to begin reading the results that were first flashed to the nation by 
television on the evening of Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
A comic note was introduced into the droning roll call by Rep. Frank Annunzio 
(D-Ill.), one of the House tellers, who forgot to identify Bush and Quayle as 
the winners in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
"Six votes for President and six votes for vice president," pronounced 
Annunzio, ignoring the script he had been handed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself leaned over from the Speaker's chair to ask: "Who won that 
election?" 
</P>
<P>
As the audience broke into laughter, Annunzio had the last word: "Obviously, 
they all knew the answer anyway," he said with a flourish. The rest of the call 
of states went off without incident. 
</P>
<P>
During the recital of the stale election returns, Bush made small talk with 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.)about the Electoral College, quail-hunting in Texas 
and life as a President-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about the procedure," Wright told reporters afterward. "It's kind of 
an antiquated process, from the day of powdered wigs and snuff boxes. Of 
course, if I lose any more hair, I could use a powdered wig myself. 
</P>
<P>
"We observed that it is the first time since Martin Van Buren that a vice 
president announced his own election," the Speaker said. "We discussed how this 
is a frill, in a sense, but a nice frill." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunting Chat 
</P>
<P>
As for quail, Bush noted that lack of ground cover prevented him from bagging 
as many birds as he would have liked during a hunting trip to Beeville, Tex., 
and the two men compared notes on shotguns as the electoral count proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
As for Quayle, he did not attend the Capitol Hill ritual where his election as 
vice president was proclaimed formally. Neither did Dukakis or Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
During their rambling talk, Wright said, Bush indicated that he would deliver 
his State of the Union message to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 8 or Feb. 
9, about three weeks after his inauguration on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bush thanked Wright for his promise of bipartisanship made Tuesday during 
Congress' opening day ceremonies and said that there have been "no surprises" 
during his weeks of preparation for his Oval Office responsibilities, the 
Speaker added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Print-Outs 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a step never imagined by the Founding Fathers who created the 
Electoral College in the 18th Century, the tellers signed computer print-outs 
showing the 1988 election totals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush became the focus of attention again when he rose to announce that he had 
received 426 electoral votes to 111 for Dukakis, and, because of a West 
Virginia elector's independent mood, a single presidential vote for Bentsen. 
Quayle's total was the same as Bush's. 
</P>
<P>
"This announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the election of 
the President and vice president for the term beginning Jan. 20, 1989," the 
President-elect solemnly intoned. Then, with another sharp left-handed bang of 
the gavel, Bush declared the joint session dissolved and received a resounding 
cheer. Meanwhile, Bush continued to mull over the choices for his two remaining 
Cabinet-level appointments, amid indications that he could name a secretary of 
energy this week, perhaps as early as today. A decision on the other remaining 
post, the newly created Cabinet-level drug czar, appears to be further away as 
Bush aides continue to argue over what sort of person is best suited to the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
For the energy post, a leading candidate is James R. Schlesinger, secretary of 
energy under President Jimmy Carter, secretary of defense under President 
Gerald R. Ford and a Bush campaign surrogate during this year's presidential 
race. Bush also has been considering Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee 
M. Thomas for the job as well as former Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana and 
Peter Johnson, the head of the federal Bonneville Power Administration and a 
protege of Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.).
