  [Excerpts] On at least five separate issues Israel and the 
PLO have now reached agreements at their talks in Cairo. 
[passage omitted] 
  The chief Israeli negotiator, Amnon Shahaq, spent the 
morning 
in Jerusalem, completing a round of consultations before 
returning to Cairo. 
  Under the agreement on water, the Gaza Strip and settlements 
will get their supplies from the Israeli Meqorot Company. The 
Palestinian autonomous authority which is to pay for the water 
it gets from Israel has also undertaken to maintain quality 
standards. Details were given by the chief Palestinian 
negotiator, Nabil Sha'th. 
  Norway and the PLO are trying to persuade the World Bank to 
finance projects in Gaza and Jericho regardless of the progress 
of the peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Sa'ib 'Urayqat and 
Norway's UN ambassador are concentrating their efforts to raise 
funds in the United States for sewage, medical, and other 
projects for the autonomy period. 
  Israel is insisting that industrial concerns in the 
autonomous areas comply with ecology standards. The request, 
originated by Israeli industrialists, was put to the 
Palestinians at the multilateral committee meetings on the 
environment. One of the Israeli concerns is that pollution will 
be caused by the unsupervised flow of sewage into a nearby 
aquifer or a natural underground water reservoir. 
  We have just received a report from Cairo. It is in fact 
Jamil al-Tarifi, the head of the PLO's committee for civilian 
matters. He is speaking to Moti Amir in Cairo about agreements 
the two sides have reached so far: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We finished the whole 
negotiations at civilian committee, and we already agreed about 
all the papers, and we transfer the whole authorities to the 
Palestinian national authority. 
  [Amir] How many issues? 
  [Al-Tarifi] It's 38 issues, and we already finished it 
yesterday, at 0400 morning. 
  [Amir] Including the water? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Including the water, including everything. 
  [Amir] And you are satisfied about the water? It was a long 
discussion yesterday. 
  [Al-Tarifi] Yes. It's not only the water. Many issues took 
long discussions. The water -- we have the full authority on 
Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we have the right to 
development our resources and to drilling our wells. In the 
meantime, the wells inside the settlements is under the control 
of Meqorot Company, but we have to know exactly how many wells 
they have. And, we have to know, in monthly basis, how many 
cubic meters they will pump from these wells. [end recording]
