  [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, has expressed the 
assessment that there will be a decline in terrorist attacks 
from the autonomous areas following the signing of the Cairo 
agreement. On the other hand, the number of terrorist attacks 
from other areas in the territories will rise. Maj. Gen. Sagi 
briefed the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee today. Our correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports: 
  [Begin Vismonsky recording] Twenty-four hours prior to the 
beginning of the IDF evacuation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF Intelligence Branch, 
presented his evaluations regarding the near future to the 
members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
Sagi believes that the number of terrorist attacks within 
Israel originating from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the 
attacks against settlers inside those areas will significantly 
decrease. On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Sagi expressed the 
assessment that the level of terrorism will rise in other areas 
of the territories where autonomy is not in effect. Sagi 
explained to the committee members that the PLO has an interest 
in keeping the security situation quiet and will therefore do 
everything to reduce the number of attacks in the areas under 
its control. 
  Maj. Gen. Sagi also commented on relations between the PLO 
and the rejectionist groups, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], and the Islamic Jihad. Sagi takes a positive view of 
the inclusion of Hamas representatives in the autonomy 
institutions as part of PLO efforts to prevent a Palestinian 
civil war. Sagi asserted that the PLO will attempt to prevent 
the murder of collaborators, noting that this phenomenon cannot 
be completely stopped. [end recording]
