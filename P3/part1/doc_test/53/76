Violence flared in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday as Israeli troops shot
and wounded at least 37 Palestinians protesting at the Israeli killing of an
Islamic fundamentalist military commander.
Militants of Hamas, the Islamic movement opposed to peace with Israel,
blocked roads with burning tyres, clashed with Israeli troops and ordered a
three-day general strike to mourn the killing on Wednesday night of Mr Imad
Aqel, northern Gaza commander of Hamas' military wing. In a military
communique, Hamas, recalling the words of Mr Aqel, said: 'Killing Israeli
soldiers is a worship by which we get close to God'.
The eruption, the worst since the peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation was signed in September, came as Mr Yassir
Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO was defeated in student elections at Beir
Zeit University in the occupied West Bank by a coalition of Hamas and
left-wing PLO factions opposed to the peace accord.
The Beir Zeit poll was the first electoral test of young Palestinians since
the peace agreement was signed. It marked Palestinian discontent with the
lack of results from the peace process and continued Israeli closure of the
territories.
However, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday he and Mr
Arafat were optimistic about the peace process and confident agreement would
be reached on implementing the peace accord and beginning Israeli military
withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of Jericho by December 13.
Israel and the PLO said talks on implementing the agreement, to be enshrined
in the December 13 protocol, had, over the past two days, reached broad
agreement on the transfer of authority from the Israeli-run civil
administration in Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian hands. Mr Hassan Asfour, a
member of the PLO delegation meeting the Israeli side in the Egyptian resort
town of El-Arish, said most matters had been resolved, including fisheries,
religious affairs and identity cards.
In Cairo, separate Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams were trying to
reach agreement on issues including the size of the Jericho area, the
release of 10,000 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners and control over border
crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan.
In talks in Paris, an Israeli official said Palestinian agricultural
produce, previously barred from entering Israel, would be allowed in if both
sides agreed on a customs union and free movement of goods and services.
