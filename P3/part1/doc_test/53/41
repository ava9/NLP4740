  [Text] Tunis, June 4 (AFP) -- A group of 158 officers and 
officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) left 
here Friday [3 June] night aboard a special flight to Cairo 
en-route for the autonomous Gaza Strip. 
  It was the first large contingent of Palestinian exiles 
based 
in Tunis to return to the territories vacated by Israel to be 
placed under Palestinian self-rule . 
  The 158 who are officially part the Palestine Liberation 
Army, the PLO's military arm, were mainly officials who had 
served for the last few years in the PLO's various civilian 
departments. 
  Some who had never worn a uniform seemed ill at ease in the 
green military fatigues offered by the Tunisian authorities. 
  The group included six Palestinian journalists, some of whom 
will man the first bureau in Gaza of the Palestinian news agency 
WAFA. Others will join the Palestinian television service now 
under construction. 
  The contingent left for Cairo on a Tunisian aircraft 
chartered by Saudi Arabia. The group will travel by bus from 
Cairo to the border and will cross over into Gaza at Rafah on 
Sunday. 
  Several senior Palestinian officials, including the 
Palestinian ambassador in Tunis Hakam Bal'awi and Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-'Ala'), economics "minister" of the new Palestinian 
Authority took part in a farewell ceremony at Tunis airport. 
  A Palestinian source said 20 security agents trained in 
Tunisia or in other countries had left Tunis since Thursday for 
the Gaza Strip and the other autonomous territory of Jericho on 
the West Bank. 
  So far, 3,500 Palestinian policemen have been deployed in 
the 
two territories which PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is scheduled to 
visit in the middle of June. 
  "The next step is to repatriate the political cadres to Gaza 
and Jericho," a senior PLO official told AFP Friday. 
  Abu-'Ala' told journalists that promised funds from 
international donors must be forthcoming quickly, saying the 
lack of resources was causing serious anxiety to Palestinians. 
  "Without the means there can be no security," he said. 
  Thirty-one of the officials' family members had left earlier 
Friday by a scheduled flight to Cairo. 
  The leader of the contingent, Colonel Samih Nasr, 46, said 
he 
hoped to have the means "to defend the dignity and institutions" 
of the new Palestinian authority. 
  He denied that the Palestinian police would be repressive, 
saying "that is not our aim."
