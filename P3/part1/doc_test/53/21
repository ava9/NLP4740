  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 11 (AFP)--The 
son of PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th has arrived here to take over 
the computer software the Israeli Army has used to run the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho, a colleague said Monday [11 April]. 
  'Ali Sha'th, 35, who works for the family computer firm 
Team, 
crossed into Gaza for the first time on Sunday via the Rafah 
border crossing linking Egypt and the Strip, a Team official 
said here. 
  Team has been authorised by the PLO to handle the software 
to 
be given to the new Palestinian administration by military 
authorities in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, Team's 
managing director Sa'id al-Qidrah told AFP. 
  Under the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel 
and 
the PLO in Washington in September, all responsibility for 
health, education, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism 
is due to pass to the Palestinians. 
  Team which has 400 experts working in 14 branches across the 
Arab world specialises in developing human resources, training 
experts in engineering, technology and sociology.
