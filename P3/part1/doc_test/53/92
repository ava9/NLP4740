  [Text] Cairo, April 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher arrived here this evening from Riyadh on a 
24- hour visit to Egypt as part of his current Middle East tour. 
  Immediately after arrival, Christopher delivered the first 
batch of police cars donated by the U.S. Government for the 
Palestinian police force to Nabil Shaath [spelling of name as 
received], PLO chief negotiator. 
  Christopher said an effective police force was essential to 
making a success of Palestinian autonomy when Israel pulls out 
its troops from the the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  He said the shipment of the vehicles was a tangible sign 
that 
the process of implementation of the peace accord will be soon 
be under way. 
  Shaath said in taking the delivery of the U.S. gift that he 
was happy to have received the the first shipment of the 
automobiles, which "will make it possible for the Palestinian 
police to start deploying in Gaza and Jericho." 
  The U.S. official is scheduled to meet Thursday with 
Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak and will hold talks with his Egyptian 
counterpart 'Amr Mussa on the Middle East peace process and 
other international issues of common concern. 
  Christopher is expected to be present at a tripartite 
meeting 
with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, who is scheduled to 
arrive here after midnight, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres, who will arrive in the Egyptian capital early Thursday. 
  The meeting is to remove hurdles blocking the signature of a 
final Palestinian-Israeli agreement on implementing Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Political observers say the mission of Christophers present 
Middle East tour is to assist in resolving the delicate problems 
facing Palestinian and Israeli negotiators currently meeting in 
Cairo to reach a successful conclusion so 'Arafat and Israeli 
Premier Yitzhaq Rabin will be able to sign a final agreement 
early next month. 
  His second task, according to the observers, is to try to 
convince Israel and the Arab parties concerned to return to the 
negotiating table and resume the bilateral talks in Washington, 
suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre of February 25 by 
an Israeli settler, killing some 40 of Palestinians. 
  Christopher is to discuss with Egypt how to make efforts to 
push forward the peace process and he may call on Egypt, the 
only Arab state that has diplomatic ties with Israel, to play a 
more active role in resumption of the bilateral Arab-Israeli 
peace talks, particularly the talks between Syria and Israel. 
  Before leaving Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Christopher said the 
Middle East has suffered too long from bloody conflict and 
repressive rule. 
  Now the region "has a chance to turn a new page, to put war 
aside, to choose peace, to end the boycott of Israel and lay the 
foundation for regional development and cooperation," he noted.
