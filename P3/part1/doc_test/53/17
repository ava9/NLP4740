  [Text] Cairo, Feb 7 (AFP)--PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is 
ready to meet here this week with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres if Israel shows more flexibility toward 
implementing Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories, a 
senior PLO source said late Sunday [6 February]. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization representative to 
Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, earlier disclosed that 'Arafat had turned 
down a chance to see Peres here on Monday on the grounds that 
Israel was delaying agreement on a final autonomy deal. 
  He said the PLO leader would hold talks with Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak on Tuesday. 
  In Tunis a PLO source told AFP that 'Arafat would travel to 
Cairo on Tuesday and would meet Peres "in the event that there 
is progress in the Israeli position." 
  He said the PLO was sending a delegation here on Monday 
headed by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, a member of the organization's 
executive committee, to meet Peres in another bid to overcome 
obstacles blocking application of a September agreement between 
the PLO and Israel. 
  The accord offered limited self-rule to Palestinians on the 
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
But its implementation, scheduled to start with the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops on December 13, has been repeatedly delayed by 
disagreements over security issues. 
  In the latest attempt to iron out differences, 'Abd-Rabbuh 
will be accompanied by Faysal al-Husayni, a prominent 
Palestinian figure from the territories, Ahmad Quray', head of 
the PLO economic wing, and Nabil Sha'th, leader of the PLO 
negotiating team on security questions. 
  In another development, Ahmad al-Tibi, a senior aide to 
'Arafat, predicted Sunday in Jerusalem after discussions with 
Peres that a comprehensive autonomy accord would be signed in 
Cairo this week. 
  "I can say an overall agreement will be signed this week in 
Cairo ... [ellipsis as received] Mr. Peres is committed to 
meeting with Mr. 'Arafat," al-Tibi declared, describing Peres as 
"sincere and serious in trying to accomplish an agreement very 
soon." 
  A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
meanwhile refused to confirm that Peres would be in Cairo on 
Monday, saying: "We will issue a statement in due time." 
  But Gad Ben Ari also said Rabin had told the Israeli cabinet 
he was still "interested" in having the Peres-'Arafat meeting 
"take place as planned." 
  The goal of the meeting would be to "agree on how to pursue 
the negotiations with the PLO in order to end them as soon as 
possible," Ben Ari said without promising that a final accord 
would be reached in Cairo. 
  The Cairo negotiations between Peres and the PLO team will 
focus on a list of points drawn up in the Swiss resort of Davos 
where Peres and 'Arafat met on January 29-30, Kamal told 
reporters after talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  Both sides emerged optimistic from the Davos encounter. 
  But while 'Arafat said he would be ready to sign a final 
deal 
in Cairo this week, Rabin said it needed three or four more 
weeks and the Israeli army raised its own reservations. 
  "The security issues are the most important, but they are 
not 
the only ones," Rabin warned on Wednesday. "We will also have to 
agree on civilian and economic issues." 
  The key stumbling-blocks remain the control of border 
crossings with Egypt and Jordan into the new autonomous areas 
and measures for protecting Jewish settlements in Gaza. 
  But according to Israeli press reports, the two sides agreed 
in Davos on the amount of land around Jericho to be granted 
self-rule. 
  A PLO statement on Sunday appealed to the United States and 
Russia, co-sponsors of a Middle East peace initiative launched 
in 1991, to "pressure" Israel into "rapidly" withdrawing its 
troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The communique, drafted by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO 
political department, charged that the behavior of Israeli 
authorities "clearly shows that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is 
trying to avoid a withdrawal of Israeli forces under the 
inadmissible pretext of security, which bears no relation to 
reality."
