  [Text] Cairo, May 11 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat has 
nominated five leading figures from the occupied territories to 
the 25-member Palestinian Authority due to take over in Gaza and 
Jericho, the PLO's chief autonomy negotiator said here Wednesday 
[11 May]. 
  Nabil Sha'th named the five as: 

  -  Zakariya al-Agha, a doctor and head of 'Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah faction in the occupied Gaza Strip, 
  -  Furayh Abu-Middayn, president of the Gaza Bar Association 
and a 
member of the Palestinian delegation to the autonomy talks with 
Israel, 
  -  Riyad al-Za'nun, a doctor and head of the higher health 
council 
in the Gaza Strip, 
  -  Ilyas Furayj, mayor of Bethlehem in the West Bank, 
  -  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, a Palestinian deportee who 
returned to the occupied territories. 

    Earlier a source at PLO headquarters in Tunis said Zakariya 
al-Agha would be put in charge of Gaza and autonomy negotiator 
Jamil al-Tarifi would take charge of Jericho. 
  In Cairo, Palestinian officials said Sha'th had also been 
nominated to the authority, but Sha'th refused to comment when 
asked to confirm the report. 
  Yasir 'Amr, a member of the PLO executive committee, said 
Tuesday the Palestinian Authority would consist of 15 figures 
from the occupied territories and 10 from the Palestinian 
diaspora. 
  'Arafat, who is due to head the authority, will resume 
discussions on its composition once he returns from South 
Africa, where he attended the swearing-in of President Nelson 
Mandela. 
  The PLO has accused Israel of linking the deployment of 
Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho to the formation of 
the team. 
  "I'm awaiting from the other side honest implementation of 
what has been agreed upon. It is not the case," 'Arafat told 
Israeli television from South Africa.
