<F P=106> ["Israel, PLO Strike Communications Deal" by Mona Salem] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO struck a 
deal Tuesday [19 April] on communications systems for Gaza and 
Jericho in another step toward the launch of Palestinian 
autonomy, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said. 
  "We have just completed a difficult agreement which took a 
lot of time and (which gives) to the autonomy authority the 
right to obtain the necessary frequencies for the Palestinian 
police," Sha'th said. 
  "An accord was also reached on giving the Palestinians a 
radio station and telephone network," he said without giving 
details. 
  Each side had claimed the right to decide on their own 
frequencies, with Israel wanting to avoid disrupting its 
existing bands, an Israeli negotiator told AFP earlier. 
  The communications accord follows deals last week to set up 
a 
Palestinian police force and release 5,000 prisoners, but PLO 
officials on Tuesday accused Israel of backtracking on the 
prisoner issue. 
  One official who requested anonymity said Israel refused to 
set a date for freeing 1,000 of the prisoners until it received 
a PLO assurance that the Palestinian police "had the situation 
well under control." 
  The official who asked not to be named said the 1,000 were 
all serving long sentences for crimes judged serious by Israel. 
  PLO negotiator Muhammad Dahlan said Israel took a tougher 
line on the prisoners after the Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas carried out attacks that killed 12 Israelis this month. 
  Israel "now categorically rejected the release of certain 
Hamas members," said Dahlan, who is in charge of the prisoner 
file. 
  Under last week's accord 2,500 prisoners are to be released 
when Israel and the PLO sign a final accord to launch self-rule 
in the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  An additional 2,500 prisoners would be set free three weeks 
later when limited autonomous powers were transferred to the 
Palestinians. More than 10,000 Palestinians are estimated to be 
in Israeli jails. 
  A PLO negotiator said that Israeli proposals on jurisdiction 
in the self-rule areas still fell short of Palestinian demands. 
The two sides had also to settle the issue of water sharing 
between Israelis and Palestinians. 
  In the Gaza Strip and West Bank, Israeli troops arrested 
about 285 suspected Islamic fundamentalists in a major crackdown 
following a series of revenge attacks for the Hebron massacre, 
Palestinian sources said. 
  The vast majority were suspected of links with Hamas, which 
has claimed the bombings of two buses in which 12 Israelis died, 
and an axe attack on Monday in which five Israelis were hurt. 
  It was the biggest crackdown on fundamentalists since Israel 
arrested hundreds in December 1992 following a wave of killings. 
Israel deported 415 of the fundamentalist suspects to Lebanon 
but allowed them to return last December. 
  The group has threatened to launch five attacks on Israeli 
targets to avenge the massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settler 
in Hebron on February 25.
