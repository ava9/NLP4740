  [Text] Cairo, 10 Apr (MENA)--A new round of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho resumed at noon today in Cairo. 
The Palestinian side is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and 
Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources said that this round of 
negotiations, which will continue until the day after tomorrow, 
Tuesday, started with a closed meeting between the heads of the 
Palestinian and the Israeli delegations to set the agenda for 
the talks. Then, the meetings of the Security, Civilian, and 
Legal Affairs Committees started. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources told MENA that the Security 
Affairs Committee will mainly discuss a withdrawal schedule for 
the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho region. It 
will also discuss the agenda for the entry of the Palestinian 
police force. The number of men in this force will range between 
9,000 and 10,000 men. This was the reason for the breakdown of 
the negotiations last week. 
  The same sources said that the Palestinian side proposed the 
possibility of the Israeli forces' withdrawal during a period 
ranging between seven days to less than two weeks starting from 
the date the final agreement is signed. 
  The sources added that the two sides will also discuss a 
number of other issues dealing with the security arrangements in 
the autonomy areas, the security of the settlements, and issues 
pertaining to the security zones around these settlements. 
These are all issues that were not finalized during the 
previous rounds of talks. 
  The Palestinian sources added that another issue under 
discussion is the return of Palestinian deportees expelled by 
the Israeli authorities after 1967 on the pretext that they were 
carrying out actions hostile to the Israeli occupation. They 
are estimated at around 2,200 deportees. 
  Israel has already taken back 200 deportees in several 
groups 
since the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was 
signed in Washington in September 1993. The Palestinian 
negotiators are demanding the return of all deportees to their 
homeland as soon as possible. 
  The Palestinian sources denied that the Palestinian and 
Israeli negotiators have agreed on a timetable for the release 
of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails, 
estimated to number about 10,400 prisoners according to the 
statistics of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
They also denied that the Palestinians have agreed to exclude 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] detainees from the release 
agreement. They affirmed that the PLO insists on the release of 
all Palestinian detainees. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs Committee is due to 
discuss in its meeting today the transfer of authorities, 
services, and utilities to the Palestinian side. An important 
issue under discussion is the transfer of authority over water 
resources. 
  The Israelis have said that this issue was not discussed at 
previous meetings because no Palestinian water experts were 
present. The Palestinians and Israelis agree that considerable 
progress has been made in the discussions of the Civilian 
Affairs Committee over the past several rounds of talks, leaving 
only a few minor points of disagreements. They pointed out, 
however, that an overall agreement in the negotiations cannot be 
attained until the two delegations sort out their security 
differences. 
  The Palestinian sources pointed out that if no progress is 
made in the current round of talks, seen to be revolving in a 
vicious circle, then it will be imperative to hold a meeting of 
high-level officials from both parties to remove the current 
obstacles. Consequently, it is likely that a meeting will be 
held in Cairo next Sunday [17 April] between PLO Executive 
Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas "Abu-Mazin" and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. It should be noted that Mahmud 'Abbas 
is currently in Cairo, closely following the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations while holding talks with Egyptian officials. 
'Abbas held a lengthy meeting with the members of the 
Palestinian delegation to agree on the negotiating method in the 
current round of talks. 
  The Palestinian sources announced that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee, one of the 
committees formed by the Gaza- Jericho meetings, will discuss 
today the wording of the general agreement and the legal text of 
the articles already agreed upon by the two delegations.
