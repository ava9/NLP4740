  [Text] Cairo, April 2 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO are close 
to agreeing on the deployment of up to 10,000 Palestinian 
policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th 
said Saturday [2 April]. 
  "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded 
during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which 
begin here on Sunday, Sha'th said. 
  The talks would also focus on "preparations for the 
deployment" of the police and security arrangements for the West 
Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of 
policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said after talks 
here Saturday with Palestinian officials to prepare for the 
deployment. 
  Under a security accord signed in Cairo Thursday Israel and 
the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed in 
the mosque massacre town of Hebron, and a first contingent of 
Palestinian police would be sent to Gaza. 
  Sha'th added that the talks on transferring civilian powers 
would be held here on Monday, while negotiations on the size of 
the Jericho autonomous area would be conducted by PLO chief 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.
