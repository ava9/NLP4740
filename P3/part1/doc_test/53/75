  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and 
the PLO will resume talks on Tuesday [28 June] in the occupied 
territories, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday. 
  He said the talks had originally been planned for Monday but 
were put back "for technical reasons." 
  Negotiators would not meet in Egypt, as suggested on 
Thursday 
by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, but the talks "will 
be in the occupied territories," he said, although the place had 
not yet been announced. 
  Sha'th said he would meet with Dani Rothschild, head of the 
Israeli military administration, instead of General Amnon Shahaq 
who led the Israeli delegation at previous autonomy talks. 
  "Shahaq is not any more the head of the Israeli delegation," 
he said, although there was no official army confirmation of the 
move. 
  He said the two delegations would first discuss the agenda 
for negotiations. 
  They would then talk about the release of prisoners, 
extending Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and completing matters which remained unresolved before the 
May 4 autonomy accord was signed. 
  Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule 
enclave of Jericho were put to one side so the signing ceremony 
could go ahead in Cairo, launching autonomy in the West Bank 
town and the Gaza Strip.
