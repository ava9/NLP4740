  [Text] Israel has agreed to permit the return of 47 
deportees. They will arrive in the territories in two groups. 
The first group is slated to arrive in Jericho today. 
Officials in Tunis said that in the next few days, Israel will 
present a list of another 20 deportees who will be permitted to 
return. At the same time, Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head 
of the PLO's Economic Department, said that the Paris 
negotiations on economic issues will be concluded before 13 
April. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] The first deportees will return to 
Jericho today via Amman and the Allenby Bridge. A Palestinian 
source in Tunis yesterday said that Israel had agreed to permit 
the return of 20 deportees and would present a list of their 
names to the PLO in the next few days. The source stressed that 
in his opinion, the new list would also include Akram Haniyah, 
who was deported from al-Birah in 1988 and has since served as 
one of Yasir 'Arafat's senior advisers. Speaking over the 
telephone from Tunis, Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-al-'Ala', the head 
of the PLO's economic department, said that in addition to the 
aforementioned 20 deportees, Israel has also authorized the 
return of 47 deportees. 
  [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I think about 47. I am not 
speaking about names; I am speaking about figures. I believe 
that all of them, if not in this group then in the other groups, 
they will come. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] As 
for the economic talks in Paris, Abu-al-'Ala' expressed the 
assessment that the negotiations with Israel will be concluded 
before 13 April. 
  [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I hope, and we will do our best. 
I believe that we and Mr. Shohat and the delegation, both of 
us, are concerned to finish this mission immediately so as to 
come into the implementation of the first stage of the agreement 
on Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Jericho today awaits the arrival of the deportees returning 
across the Allenby Bridge. PLO representatives in the 
territories are preparing a warm reception; however, the Civil 
Administration has been instructed by the defense establishment 
to permit the deportees to enter Jericho only this afternoon in 
order to keep celebrations to a minimum. The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will probably close off the Jericho area to the 
media to prevent any coverage of the deportees' return. The 
deportees intend to hold a news conference in Jericho. Fatah 
leaders in the territories, who, on 'Arafat's instructions, have 
closed most of the PLO offices, are now waiting to turn over 
supervision of the organization's activists in the field to the 
first representatives of the PLO leadership in Tunis. The 
returning deportees will primarily handle the preparations for 
the arrival of the PLO leaders from Tunis, who are already 
packed and ready to move to the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
Abu-al-'Ala' estimates that the PLO leadership, led by Yasir 
'Arafat, will arrive in the territories immediately after the 
IDF withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian police.

  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 5 April in a report 
by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on pages 1 and 19 
reports that "in his talks with Israeli officials in Tunis, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat expressed his desire to pray at the 
Temple Mount in Jerusalem shortly after he arrives in Jericho in 
May. It has been learned that Israeli decisionmakers are 
inclined to accept 'Arafat's request." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 5 April 
reports that "reacting to Yasir 'Arafat's desire to be allowed 
to pray at the Temple Mount mosques, Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal said that in his opinion, the time is not ripe for this. 
The police minister believes that at this stage, it would be 
best to put this off to a later time."]
