  [Text] Immediately after the signing of the agreement in 
Cairo on Wednesday, the release of the first half of the 5,000 
Palestinian prisoners slated to be released will commence. The 
release process will continue until the beginning of the week 
following the signing of the agreement. Twelve hours after the 
agreement is signed, the Palestinian police force will start 
moving from Egyptian Rafah into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah 
border terminal. Palestinian sources told our correspondent 
Moti Amir that the convoy will include jeeps, light armored 
cars, and approximately 1,500 policemen under Raji Jabali, 
commander of the Gaza Strip police. They will be accompanied by 
Muhammad Dahlan, head of the Gaza Strip security services, who 
is considered to be the strong man in the Gaza Strip. 
  Approximately 500 policemen will arrive in Jericho, but it 
is 
still unclear whether they will enter from Gaza, via the open 
passage agreed upon by the two sides, or from Jordan, via the 
Allenby Bridge. The policemen will be accompanied by 
administrative workers from the PLO headquarters in Tunis, and 
Jibril al-Rajub, head of the Palestinian security services in 
the West Bank. 
  Yasir 'Arafat will apparently arrive in the territories on 
15 
June, after preparations in the field and the organization of 
the Palestinian institutions in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He 
will be received in a large ceremony attended by ambassadors and 
possibly heads of state.
