Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, last
night held urgent talks in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak after Israel
and the PLO failed to break the deadlock in peace talks.
Egyptian officials said that, in the half-hour meeting, Mr Arafat reacted
positively to some of the Israeli proposals on plans for its already delayed
troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
Mr Mubarak, who is believed to have requested Mr Arafat's trip to Egypt, was
expected to press the PLO chairman to soften his stance. But Mr Tayeb
Abdel-Rahim, the PLO's ambassador to Jordan, said Mr Arafat had gone to
Cairo with a formal rejection of 'humiliating' Israeli proposals.
The two sides had earlier given conflicting statements about progress in the
Cairo negotiations aimed at implementing the Israeli withdrawal.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the two sides had reached
broad agreement but would need more talks. Israeli officials said they had
offered their last compromise position.
At a press conference with Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO's chief negotiator, Mr
Peres said: 'The two delegations have reached a meeting of the minds on the
central issues of border crossings, the size of Jericho and matters relating
to the Gaza Strip. The leadership of the two parties will now have to accept
or reject this paper.'
A more downbeat Mr Abbas said: 'The negotiations were constructive. There
were some ideas that will be discussed . . . and we hope to reach an
agreement.'
The failure of the talks came amid growing signs of a crisis in the PLO
leadership over strategy and mounting criticism by rank-and-file
Palestinians of the lack of consultation by Mr Arafat.
An hour before the Cairo press conference, the PLO executive committee
issued a statement in Tunis rejecting the latest Israeli proposals. It
insisted that Palestinians must have total control of crossings between Gaza
and Egypt and between the Jericho enclave and Jordan.
The committee blamed Israel for obstructing the negotiations and withdrawing
previous offers.
The Tunis statement fuelled speculation that Mr Arafat was deliberately
undercutting the position of Mr Abbas. Mr Abbas is reportedly in favour of a
softer negotiating stance and a greater democratisation of the PLO.
Mr Peres also appeared to indicate that the obstacle to an agreement was Mr
Arafat rather than the PLO delegation.
