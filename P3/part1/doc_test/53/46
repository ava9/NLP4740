  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is preparing to 
evacuate all forces from most parts of the Gaza Strip and their 
deployment to the Qatif Bloc settlements and the northern edge 
of the Strip. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says that IDF commanders 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho say that once the order is given, 
they will be able to complete the redeployment within 72 hours. 
  Yesterday bulldozers began clearing land near the settlement 
of Vered Yeriho in order to set up a crossing point to and from 
the autonomous region of Jericho. An Army base and a police and 
border police post are also to be built near the crossing point. 
  The Defense Ministry is considering setting up a special 
body 
which will deal with coordination between the IDF and security 
forces and the Palestinians in the autonomous zones of the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. Qol Yisra'el's military affairs 
correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that a senior Army officer 
will head the committee.
