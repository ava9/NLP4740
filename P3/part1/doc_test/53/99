  [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, declared that 
the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached agreement on the 
size of the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho area during the round of negotiations that ended in 
Cairo today. 
  Speaking at a news conference today at the conclusion of the 
negotiations, Sha'th said that the police force agreed upon will 
comprise 9,000 personnel; 2,000 from inside [the occupied 
territories] and 7,000 from outside. 
  He added that the agreement stipulates that 6,000 
Palestinian 
policemen will enter immediately after the signing of the 
executive agreement of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and then 
another 1,000 will enter within three months of the signing of 
the agreement. [passage indistinct] 
  Sha'th went on to say: As to the weapons of the 9,000 
Palestinian policemen, they will be modern automatic rifles for 
policemen, and officers will also be issued pistols. He said 
that the Palestinian police will be supplied with a number of 
machine guns and some armored personnel carriers. 
  Regarding the issues on which no agreement has been reached 
so far, Sha'th said that these are: roads; the crossing points 
between Gaza, Jericho and Israel; joint patrols; the security 
measures on the roads; how to deal with any military operation; 
wrapping up the water issue. He added that these issues will be 
referred to the round that will be held in Cairo on 17 April. 
  On what Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said 
in 
his news conference today, that Palestinian detainees who are 
members of Hamas will not be released, Sha'th said that the 
Palestinian side in the negotiations represents all the 
Palestinian people and it is its responsibility to negotiate to 
release all the detainees and not only the Fatah ones. 
  He added: I know that there is some sensitivity on the 
Israeli side, especially after the recent 'Afula incident in 
northern Israel. However, agreement was reached today to 
release 5,000 detainees and negotiations will be conducted to 
release the others. He stressed that the negotiations are being 
held in the name of the entire Palestinian people. 
  He went on to say: We are not negotiating for some detainees 
and not others. The peace we want to conclude is a peace between 
the entire Palestinian people and the entire Israeli people and 
not a peace between a Palestinian organization and an Israeli 
one. He said: We must shoulder the responsibility for an 
agreement on a general amnesty that will lead to the release of 
all the detainees. 
  Sha'th underlined the Palestinian side's determination to 
continue the negotiations to release all the detainees so that a 
real peace can be achieved, one which halts the conflict that 
has lasted for a long time and of which the detainees constitute 
a part.
