  [Text] Jerusalem, May 8 (AFP) -- The on-off arrival of the 
first contingent of armed Palestinian policemen to the occupied 
territories was delayed again on Sunday [8 May], Israeli 
officials said. 
  A battalion of 270 men carrying M-16 rifles reached the 
Allenby Bridge crossing from Jordan to the West Bank, but Israel 
said they would not be allowed in until Monday. 
  An AFP correspondent reported that the men, members of the 
PLO's Palestine Liberation Army, had gathered a kilometre 
(around half a mile) from the bridge. 
  The Palestinian representative in Jordan, al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim, had said the contingent could set off shortly 
after formalities were completed. Another 300-strong contingent 
was then due to cross Monday after arriving from Iraq. 
  However Israel's military administration for the West Bank 
denied that the police would cross the Allenby Bridge to the 
newly-autonomy Jericho enclave on Sunday. 
  "Nothing will happen today," an administration spokesman 
said. "It should be tomorrow, Monday." 
  The Israeli news agency ITIM reported that the arrivals had 
not been coordinated with the Israelis over Friday-Saturday and 
would therefore be delayed. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said: 
"We are sorry for the delays, which the Palestinians say are due 
to technical reasons, we hope they will arrive as soon as 
possible." 
  On the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said the police 
deployment there had been postponed again after being scheduled 
for Sunday. 
  Several hundred policemen were at first scheduled to cross 
the Rafah border from Egypt last Thursday. That was delayed 
until Sunday, then put back further until the middle of the 
following week, before being brought back to Sunday again. 
  The Palestinian sources blamed "technical reasons" for the 
latest hold-up in the arrival of some 300 policemen from Egypt. 
  No new date has been given for the arrivals to Gaza. 
  Nineteen senior Palestinian officers, including several 
"generals" did arrive in Gaza last Wednesday ready to take 
charge from the withdrawing Israelis. 
  They have formed a liaison committee and toured Israeli army 
and police buildings which the Palestinians are to take over. 
  The bulk of the 9,000-strong Palestinian police has been 
recruited from the PLA [Palestine Liberation Army], which is the 
PLO's army and has brigades scattered across several Arab 
countries. 
  The policemen are to take over security from the Israeli 
army 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the autonomy deal Israel and 
the PLO signed last Wednesday. 
  The autonomy agreement gives Israel the right to approve all 
the names of the police and details their arms and equipment. 
  They can carry 7,000 personal arms, 120 machineguns of 0.3 
mm 
and 0.5 mm calibre and drive 45 armoured vehicles, the accord 
says. 
  The armoured vehicles will need prior Israeli approval to 
use 
the main north-south road on the Gaza Strip. 
  Any equipment, weapons and munitions donated or bought from 
abroad is subject to Israeli approval. 
  The police are to maintain order in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho while Israel remains responsible for the protection of 
settlers and borders.
