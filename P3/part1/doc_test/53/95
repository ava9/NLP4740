<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Umberto De Giovannangeli in Jerusalem; date not given: "A Rapid 
Israeli Withdrawal -- Only in This Way Can We Save Peace" -- 
first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- "Despite all the current difficulties, 
I believe that the handshake between Rabin and 'Arafat 
represents a point of no return. We must get back to the 
negotiations table as soon as possible: because I am convinced 
that this time we will succeed in resolving all the issues that 
still remain open." Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin 
is certain of this. The hopes of peace in the Middle East have 
not faded. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion do the margins for a 
resumption in negotiations between Israel and the PLO exist for 
the immediate future as well as for an acceleration in the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Beilin] In the last sessions of negotiations with the PLO 
we 
dealt with practically all the fundamental issues relating to 
the implementation of the declaration of principles signed in 
Washington. We were on the point of closing this phase of 
talks. Then the Hebron massacre took place. Nevertheless, I am 
convinced that if we return to negotiate quickly, which I think 
is possible, we will succeed in speeding up the implementation 
of autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  [De Giovannangeli] At what point are diplomatic discussions 
on the possible deployment of international observers or a 
multinational military contingent in the occupied territories? 
  [Beilin] The problem has already been raised in Oslo and an 
accord with the PLO has been reached on an international 
presence in Gaza and Jericho during the transitory phase of 
autonomy. The Palestinians should understand the novelty and 
the importance of this "yes" by Israel, a fact that is without 
precedent in our history. 
  [De Giovannangeli] A civilian presence or even a military 
presence? 
  [Beilin] Civilian, only civilian. 
  [De Giovannangeli] The position of Syria is crucial in 
achieving overall peace in the Middle East. Can you tell us if 
something is moving in negotiations with Damascus, even if 
officially interrupted. 
  [Beilin] There is no doubt that Syria today still maintains 
a 
central role in the Middle East scenario: Peace with President 
al-Asad would mean really turning over a new leaf in this 
tormented region. But peace as defined by Syria is still a 
limited "armored" peace that is dictated more by necessity than 
by conviction. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Instead what kind of peace does Israel 
propose? 
  [Beilin] Total peace, without any restrictions on the 
economic, political, and diplomatic relations front. If Syria 
is willing to talk about peace in these terms, on our side we 
could easily open discussions on the schedule and the extent of 
our withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In these days, the usual proclamations of 
war seem to be accompanied by some signs of flexibility from the 
Palestinian refusal front, and even from the Hamas integralists. 
Do you think that these signs are credible? 
  [Beilin] Absolutely not. Hamas has gained consensus not 
because of the strength of his ideas but because of the poverty 
and the profound hardship that marks the life of Palestinians 
today, particularly in the Gaza Strip. For this I consider it 
crucial to accelerate the process of autonomy. I am convinced 
that when the economy of the territories becomes buoyant and 
when the Palestinian police force is formed, many will pass over 
to the side of the PLO. I believe that the effort of 'Arafat, 
also in view of the elections in Gaza and Jericho, will be to 
form a coalition among the moderate elements. At least this is 
what I hope. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or 
"uncertain" over the likelihood of a resumption in peace 
negotiations? 
  [Beilin] Despite everything, I am confident about the future 
of the negotiations. For a very simple reason: because I do 
not see any other path to follow. There is no alternative to 
dialogue. The choice of peaceful cohabitation, which lies at 
the basis of the Washington accords and which unites the 
majority of the Israelis and Palestinians remains irreversible, 
and no terrorist act can place this under discussion again. 
  [De Giovannangeli] The Jewish settlements in the 
territories, 
which the Palestinians are asking to be dismantled even in light 
of the Hebron massacre, are an obstacle on the road to peace 
today. 
  [Beilin] The Oslo accords postponed discussions on the 
settlements to the final phase of negotiations. And for us this 
still remains valid. It does not mean, however, that we will 
not act to stop the colonization and above all to suppress the 
terrorist acts of extremist groups. 
  [De Giovannangeli] But disarming the colonists and 
dismantling, even if this is gradual, the settlements are 
requests that have also been advanced by the Meretz ministers, 
to whom Rabin seems to want to respond by opening to the Tsomet 
of the right. 
  [Beilin] Personally, I hope that the Tsomet will not enter 
the government. However, even if this were to happen, the peace 
process will not be interrupted and neither will the decision to 
negotiate with the PLO under the terms sanctioned by the accord 
on Gaza and Jericho be questioned again.
