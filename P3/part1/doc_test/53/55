  [Text] Tunis, March 25 (AFP) -- The PLO has not yet decided 
whether to resume negotiations with Israel on launching 
Palestinian self-rule, a close aide to PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat said here Friday [25 March]. 
  Marwan Kanafani said PLO-Israeli discussions set to resume 
in 
Cairo next week "do not constitute a resumption of the 
negotiations." 
  Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 
AFP the negotiations on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank 
town of Jericho would resume in Cairo Tuesday, exactly one month 
after the talks were suspended over the Hebron massacre. 
  Kanafani said the PLO was continuing its contacts with all 
concerned parties, including the United States, Russia and 
Norway, to obtain answers to demands made by the PLO in the wake 
of the Hebron massacre. 
  A resumption of the autonomy talks "depends on positive and 
practical answers which the Israelis must provide," concerning 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which 
allowed for protection of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  After the massacre the PLO called for an armed international 
protection force to be deployed in the territories, the 
disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of certain 
flashpoint settlements. 
  The Israeli official, declining to be named, said 
negotiators 
General Amnon Shahak and the director general of the foreign 
ministry, Uri Savir, had reported to Rabin on "the progress made 
in the Egyptian capital." 
  "We will go back to Cairo on Tuesday and this time we will 
be 
able to conclude," Shahak, the deputy chief-of-staff, said on 
his return after two days of talks on boosting security for the 
Palestinians of Hebron. 
  The PLO broke off the autonomy talks after a Jewish settler 
massacred 30 Palestinian worshippers in a mosque of the West 
Bank town of Hebron on February 25. 
  In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two 
sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of 
international observers and a Palestinian police force for 
Hebron. 
  But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume, 
saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the 
Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for 
Hebron. 
  Sha'th said the draft accord would be submitted to PLO and 
Israeli leaders. "Important progress was achieved during 
negotiations in the last two days in Cairo but there are certain 
points to clear up," he cautioned. 
  Israeli radio said that if the security measures for Hebron 
were finalized early next week, the negotiations to launch 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho would 
resume "immediately."
