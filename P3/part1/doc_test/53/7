  [Text] Jericho, Occupied West Bank, March 25 (AFP) -- 
Palestinian officials Friday [25 March] denied Israeli reports 
that autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo Tuesday, 
insisting that full agreement must first be reached on 
protection for Palestinians in the massacre town of Hebron. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat, a senior peace negotiator, said the two 
sides 
must press on with talks held this week in Tunis and Cairo, "to 
agree on measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, faced with 
settler violence." 
  "No date has been set for resuming the negotiations on 
(Palestinian) self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho" in the 
West Bank, 'Urayqat told AFP here. 
  Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 
AFP that the autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo 
Tuesday, one month after the PLO suspended the talks over the 
massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in a 
Hebron mosque. 
  Israeli state radio said both sides had agreed that "several 
dozen" Palestinian police would be deployed in Hebron at the 
beginning of April, notably outside municipal buildings and the 
university. 
  The Palestinian police would also patrol jointly with 
Israeli 
soldiers, under overall army command, the radio said. 
  'Urayqat said the Israeli government was presenting the 
security issue the wrong way. 
  "It is not a question of knowing whether Palestinian police 
or foreign observers should be deployed in Hebron, but of first 
carrying out an evacuation of settlers from Hebron." 
  He said that if the 450 Jewish settlers remained in the 
town, 
the presence of Palestinian police or foreign observers "will 
change nothing and the population will continue to live under 
the threat of a new massacre." 
  After the February 25 massacre the PLO called for an armed 
international protection force to be deployed in the 
territories, the disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of 
certain flashpoint settlements. 
  In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two 
sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of 
international observers and a Palestinian police force for 
Hebron. 
  But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume, 
saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the 
Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for 
the Palestinians of the West Bank town. 
  "There are certain points to clear up," Sha'th cautioned. 
  Israeli negotiators agreed on Thursday after two days of 
talks to the deployment of armed Norwegian observers in Hebron. 
  Marwan Kanafani, a close aide to PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
said in Tunis that the PLO was keeping in contact with all 
parties involved, including the United States, Russia and 
Norway, to obtain answers to the PLO's demands following the 
massacre. 
  Norway brokered the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord signed in 
Washington last September, according to which Israeli troops 
were due to start pulling out of the occupied Gaza Strip and 
Jericho on December 13. 
  Implementation of the deal has been set back by the Hebron 
massacre and disagreements over security issues. 
  The occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank were paralysed by a 
general strike Friday to mark the first month since the massacre. 
  Meanwhile, a Palestinian truck driver from Hebron died after 
being shot by a Jewish settler near Beit Jibrin in southern 
Israel, police announced. 
  The 42-year-old gunman fired shots from a car at the truck 
and then fled the scene, but he was later arrested by police in 
the southern Israeli town of Kyriat Gat.
