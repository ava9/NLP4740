<F P=106> [Report by Sophia 'Amarah in Cairo] </F>
  [Text] Cairo today bid farewell to a member of the 
Palestinian National Authority [PNA] formed to administer the 
Palestinian autonomous areas. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, who will be accompanied by Monte Carlo 
radio in the car that will take him from the Egyptian capital to 
his homeland -- where he will settle in Gaza, held a news 
conference in the Cairo this morning prior to his departure. 
  [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Let us brush 
aside the issue of your return home. What are the major 
difficulties that you will confront at the start of your new 
mission in Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] Our major difficulty will be with Israel. It lies 
in the implementation of the agreement signed with the Israelis, 
and the continuation of the negotiations, as provided for in the 
Declaration of Principles. There are still many issues that we 
and the Israelis need to work out and agree upon, including the 
release of all prisoners, the opening of a safe corridor between 
Gaza and Jericho, bringing the West Bank under the PNA's 
authority, and the repatriation of the persons displaced in 
1967. We must immediately begin efforts to settle these issues, 
which were obscured by the Israeli [words indistinct]. 
Moreover, we must confront any problems the Israelis might 
create over Jerusalem. 
  ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has also announced that 
Palestinian border guards will soon be deployed on the Allenby 
Bridge and the Rafah Border Post. He added that the 
Palestinians will shortly be allowed to move freely from the 
Gaza Strip to the Jericho area. 
  With regard to the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, 
Sha'th 
had the following to say: 
  [Sha'th] We will not allow people bearing arms to move 
freely 
on the street. However, we will not storm houses to seize 
weapons. As we once fought the Israelis, we will not now allow 
the Israelis to move freely with their weapons on streets and 
roads, and to use them to open fire on the Palestinians. In the 
same vein, we will not allow the Palestinians to open fire on 
the Israelis. We will not allow any of us to turn into a judge, 
indictor, prosecutor, and executioner. We will not allow this 
to happen. There might be some collaborators with the 
occupation authorities. Those who have any complaints in this 
regard must head for the Palestinian police, provide evidence, 
and demand a trial of those suspected of collaboration. If 
everybody acts conscientiously and out of a sense of 
responsibility; that is, if everybody believes in Islam, in 
their leaders, in a constitution, and a host of principles, then 
he or she must grant officials and leaders the opportunity to 
continue the struggle in its various forms in light of what is 
deemed appropriate by the current phase, taking into account 
what the Muslim community deems best. I believe that the 
Palestinian people now have the opportunity to achieve their 
goals. If we were to fail in this, then nobody would blame us 
if we return to armed struggle. 
  ['Amarah] On the other hand, Sha'th announced that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the 
autonomous areas next week to reside in Jericho. 
  In a related development, the Palestinian official affirmed 
that the PNA, which pledged to donor nations to achieve 
self-reliance within a year's time, is awaiting international 
aid modelled on the Marshal plan launched by the United States 
to aid the collapsing West European states in the wake of World 
War II, rather than a redemption operation similar to that of 
redeeming ruptured [word indistinct], as he put it. We will 
update you on relevant developments once we arrive in Gaza 
Strip. [end recording]
