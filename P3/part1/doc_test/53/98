Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night signed a crucial
security agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule. The deal, signed by Mr
Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
will give much-needed momentum to the peace process after months of delay
and bickering.
The full details, set down in a three-page set of principles and an
eight-page agreement, were not released. Mr Peres said they included
resolution of the two most sensitive security issues - control over the
Egypt-Gaza and Jericho-Jordan border crossings and security arrangements for
Jewish settlers in Gaza which would divide the strip into three zones.
Officials said this meant exclusive Palestinian control in the largest zone,
exclusive Israeli control in another zone around the Jewish settlements and
joint patrols, under Israeli control, in a third smaller zone.
Mr Peres said there was agreement in principle on the third main obstacle of
the past three months - the size of the Jericho area - but a final decision
would be taken only when Mr Arafat met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister. Mr Osama el Baz, political adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt, said the two sides had agreed an area 'a little more than 55 sq km'.
The agreement, however, fell short of bridging all the security issues,
leaving problems not resolved in Cairo to be negotiated under a new document
of principles called the 'Cairo document' which was also signed last night.
Mr Arafat said he had agreed to work with Mr Peres to overcome the remaining
problems. 'We are sure we can create a new era for our people,' he said. 'We
can say that Palestine and the name Palestine have returned to the map of
the Middle East.' Further talks are expected to resume next week in Paris
and in Cairo.
After lengthy talks, Mr Peres and Mr Arafat initialled the documents shortly
before midnight to loud applause at the Al-Itahidiya presidential palace in
front of President Mubarak.
The agreements, negotiated according to one Israeli official 'paragraph by
paragraph, line by line, word by word', broke a deadlock over the most
difficult obstacles preventing implementation of Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
It will unblock suspended talks on economic relations and the transfer of
civilian administration to Palestinian hands. Once the remaining issues have
been resolved, expected within two to three weeks, the stage will be set for
Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to sign a comprehensive protocol in Cairo, starting
an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho which was to have begun last
December 13.
Although last night's documents must be approved by the Israeli cabinet and
the PLO executive committee, this is expected to be a formality.
