  [Excerpt] Taba, Egypt, Jan 11 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO 
began Tuesday [11 January] to draw up a list of points upon 
which they agree and differ during negotiations to implement 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  "A drafting committee (on military issues) has started to 
write down the subjects on which we agree and the security 
questions on which differences remain," Israel delegation 
spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska told AFP. 
  "The delegation head to the committee on civilian issues are 
doing the same," he added. 
  The military committee, made up of a jurist and a military 
officer from either side, met in a ninth floor suite of the 
Hilton hotel at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba where 
negotiations resumed on Monday. 
  Foreign ministry legal adviser Yoel Singer and General David 
Agmon, a chief-of-staff adviser on the intifadah, were drafting 
a document with Camille Mansur, an international law professor, 
and Palestine Liberation Army General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Yahya. 
  The four face the main issues which have delayed application 
of the September 13 autonomy deal -- the size of the Jericho 
enclave and the control of borders and crossings between the 
autonomous areas and Jordan and Egypt. 
  Israeli General Gadi Zohar, head of the military 
administration in the West Bank, and Palestinian businessman 
Jamil Tarifi, met to draw up a list for the civilian committee 
which covers the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority 
for health, education, direct taxation, social welfare and 
tourism. 
  The decision to draft a list of points was taken by Israeli 
deputy chief-of-staff General Amnon Shahaq and the PLO's Nabil 
Sha'th during a lengthy tete-a-tete in Taba on Tuesday morning. 
  It followed the suspension of negotiations on December 29 
when the PLO denied an Israeli claim that a written 
understanding had been reached in Cairo on border crossings and 
Jericho. 
  Menawhile the Palestinians continued to demand an access to 
the Dead Sea and several religious sites south of the Jericho 
enclave. 
  "We are no longer talking about square kilometres for 
Jericho," Palestinian spokesman Hasan 'Asfur said. 
  "We are demanding that certain positions in the region be 
under Palestinian control, such as religious sites, access to 
the Dead Sea, private land and areas inhabited by Palestinians," 
he said. 
  Iasraeli spokesman Gluska told AFP there was "no agreement 
with the Palestinians on the boundaries of the Jericho territory 
because there is nothing new in the PLO proposals." [passage
