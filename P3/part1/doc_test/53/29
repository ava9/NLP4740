  [Text] Tunis, June 16 (AFP) -- PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
will make his long-awaited visit to Gaza and Jericho within the 
next week, but it will only be for a short stay, Palestinian and 
diplomatic sources said Thursday. 
  'Arafat will visit the newly-autonomous areas for three days 
but will spend every night in Amman according to the plans being 
laid, the sources said. No precise date is yet known. 
  Contradictory rumours have been circulating for weeks about 
when the PLO chief intends to make his triumphant entry into 
Jericho. But preparations have been going on nonetheless to 
hand over control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to the new 
Palestinian Authority. 
  'Arafat is due to return for good to Jericho, but has said 
he 
did not want to make the trip until donor countries had 
fulfilled pledges to help fund Palestinian self-rule. 
  Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been issuing various 
dates for his return for months. On Sunday the PLO's former 
negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 'Arafat would arrive within two 
weeks. Sha'th himself entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after 
spending most of his life in exile. 
  PLO officials said Sha'th would prepare for 'Arafat's 
arrival 
either later this month or in early July.
