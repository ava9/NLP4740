  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the 
PLO appeared moving toward a breakthrough Sunday [30 January] in 
talks on Palestinian autonomy with the PLO accepting a 
compromise proposal hammered out by negotiators overnight. 
  Working groups laboured through the night and morning hours 
to nail down details of the Israeli withdrawal from the West 
Bank town of Jericho and Gaza Strip under an accord signed in 
September. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation, told reporters in this Alpine resort town that 
there was now a compromise on the table and "we accept it." 
  He would not give details of the proposal or say explicitly 
whether the Israelis accepted it. But he added, "I can't say 
that there is any problem holding up an agreement." 
  Israeli officials were not immediately available for 
comment. 
Israeli sources said the proposal was being transmitted to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who had lengthy 
talks 
with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat late Saturday and was to meet with 
him again outside the World Economic Forum here, was asked 
earlier if they were close to a breakthrough. "Closer than 
yesterday," he replied. 
  He told reporters the two hours of discussions he had with 
'Arafat at their hotel here Saturday were constructive but he 
refused to say whether they would produce an accord. 
  'Arafat declined to comment on progress, telling reporters 
at 
the hotel where he and Peres were staying: "You will have to 
wait." 
  "Yesterday it was going well and we hope today we continue 
on 
the same lines," 'Arafat said. 
  Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said the working 
groups of negotiators met until 3 a.m. (0200 GMT) Sunday and 
resumed at about 7 a.m (0600 GMT). He said they would continue 
their work and then 'Arafat and Peres and full delegations would 
meet again. 
  Asked about progress he said: "As long as documents are not 
being signed, I don't want to speculate about progress." 
  Peres is due to fly out Sunday night for Washington. But 
when asked if he was leaving Sunday night, he only said: "Maybe." 
  'Arafat had said at the start of his discussions with Peres, 
their first since a meeting in Oslo a week ago, that they hoped 
to get an accord here or at least "a main platform for an 
agreement." 
  Peres had added: "There are serious differences between the 
parties, but we are here with serious intentions. We will do 
all that is possible to answer hopes for peace." 
  Under an agreement signed on the White House lawn on 
September 13, the Israelis were to have started a four-month 
withdrawal of their troops from Jericho and the Gaza Strip on 
December 13. 
  But Israel and the PLO have been wrangling over who should 
control border crossings with neighbouring Jordan and Egypt, the 
size of the Jericho autonomous area and security for Jewish 
settlements. 
  Sarid had said earlier that if there was an agreement later 
Sunday it would focus on the size of the Jericho and Gaza 
autonomous areas as well as on the border crossings but leave 
many other issues still to be resolved, such as the status of 
Palestinian authority and administrative arrangements in the two 
areas. 
  "There are many legal questions which we have not even 
discussed," Sarid said. 
  'Arafat had arrived from Tunisia on Saturday after appealing 
to US President Bill Clinton for help in ending the impasse 
which he blamed on the Israelis. He made the same request of 
British Prime Minister John Major on Friday.
