  [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--Sources from the Palestinian 
and Israeli delegations have agreed that substantial differences 
are impeding the current negotiations in Cairo to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The sources said that these negotiations are going through 
"a 
crisis," despite some positive statements. 
  The Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli side 
continues to refuse to draw up a definite timetable for the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
They added that the Israeli side is also refusing to draw up a 
timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police and 
specifications for the type of weapons to be used by this force. 
  The Palestinian sources went on to say that the Israeli 
side, 
which has mainly used civilian negotiators with the exception of 
Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, wants to ignore the 
Palestinian military commanders' view of the security and 
military situation in Gaza and Jericho. They added that these 
commanders are demanding a definite timetable for the entry of 
their main forces into the Palestinian self-rule area in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho area. They are also demanding an 
agreement on the type of weapons needed for these forces to 
achieve security in the areas from which Israel will withdraw.
