  [Text] Rafah, 14 May (MENA) -- The Palestinian Liaison 
Committee has resumed its work in the Gaza Strip to take over 
the rest of sites allocated for the Palestinian national 
security forces and to take the final measures for the police 
forces' deployment. 
  Liaison officer Brigadier General Ghazi al-Jabali said the 
handover of police and civilian authority sites in the Jericho 
area has been completed and that the Palestinian authorities 
have begun work. He added that police forces are being deployed 
in the northern part of Gaza in preparation for its handover to 
the civilian authorities. According to the agreement, he said, 
the civilian authority should remain in place for a three-year 
transitional period under the PLO leadership. 
  Coordination official Colonel Zakariya Ba'lushah said that 
obstacles impeding the entry of some personnel of the 
Palestinian national security forces have been removed and the 
civilian police will assume their duties in providing security 
as soon as they enter. 
  Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majayirah said the forces 
coming from Libya, Sudan, and Algeria continue to assemble 
inside Rafah on the international border with Egypt and enter 
the Gaza Strip in stages according to a timetable being drawn up 
in coordination with the Israeli side. He added that the 
Palestinian national security forces are made up of several 
groups, such as the civilian police, security forces, and 
intelligence, in addition to civil defense and other police 
services, who will perform their roles in maintaining internal 
security and order; guarding military posts, border crossings, 
and public figures; and maintaining the security of the country, 
its citizens, and the self-rule areas. 
  Elsewhere, Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of 
the forces, and members of the civilian authority continue to 
follow up on the withdrawal from various sites, the Israeli 
withdrawal from the few remaining places, and the deployment of 
Palestinian personnel in them. This procedure is scheduled to 
be complete by Wednesday, when the self-rule authorities will 
assume their role inside the Gaza Strip and Jericho area.
