  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 13 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is 
disappointed that Israel is deliberately delaying transfer of 
power to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the 
West Bank, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday. 
  Malaysia hoped Israel would be sincere and committed to the 
peace agreement which it signed on Sept 13 with the Palestine 
Liberation Organistion (PLO) giving limited self rule in the two 
areas, he said. 
  The new year has come and a Palestinian government should 
have been in place in the two areas, he told reporters before 
giving a cheque for RM13.6 million (about U.S. $5 million), 
being a donation from the Government of Malaysia, to Palestinian 
Ambassador Ahmad al- Farra, here. 
  Malaysia hoped the agreement would be implemented as soon as 
possible, he said. 
  He said Malaysia would continue to support the aspirations 
of 
the people of Palestine to have their own independent homeland 
with Jerusalem as the capital. 
  Abdullah said Malaysia was the first country to give direct 
financial aid to the Palestine National Council authority to 
develop the Gaza Strip and Jericho when the two areas were 
returned to the Palestinians. 
  The donation represented Malaysia's fulfillment of a pledge 
to the PLO to help it redevelop the two areas, he said. 
  Malaysia is also ready to give all necessary aid to 
Palestine 
in the development of its human resources and institutions under 
its technical cooperation programme, he said. 
  Ahmad al-Farra said the financial aid reflected Malaysia's 
strong support for the Palestinian cause. 
  He said there were four main factors which had stalled the 
transfer of power in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The factors were related to the side of the area in Jericho 
to be turned over to the Palestinians, who is to administer the 
border area between Jericho and Jordan and the Gaza Strip and 
Egypt, security for the Jewish community in Gaza Strip and the 
question of Jerusalem.
