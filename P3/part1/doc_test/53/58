The Gaza-Jericho agreement could prove to be a small but important step on
the road towards Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. The next
phases of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are, however, mired in
ambiguity and open to different interpretation by each side.
Essentially, yesterday's agreement gives the PLO a five-year interim period
of self-rule (more than autonomy but less than statehood) over the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank enclave of Jericho. The accord, covering a limited
slice of the Palestinian land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War, is
supposed to be a transitional agreement towards a permanent solution to the
Palestinian question in 1998.
The agreement rules out, for the moment, Palestinian statehood, the
definition of international borders, Palestinian control over the rest of
the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, and the right of return of up to 4m
Palestinian refugees.
These issues are all left for staged negotiations until 1998, when a
permanent solution is intended, based on UN resolutions which realise 'the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements'. As
such, the interim agreement is a gamble for the Palestinians, as it contains
no guarantees of further advances towards an independent Palestinian state
in all of the pre-1967 Arab land.
Gaza-Jericho is clearly designed by Israel as an experiment, the success of
which will determine the shape of a future Palestine. Many Palestinians fear
that 'Gaza-Jericho first' could end up being 'Gaza-Jericho only'. Under the
agreement, the PLO is supposed to take control over Gaza-Jericho
immediately. An advance contingent of 1,000 Palestinian police of a
9,000-strong force will cross into Gaza and Jericho today to pave the way
for a phased Israeli troop withdrawal within 21 days.
In the coming month, the PLO must take over executive power from the Israeli
military administration and build the institutional structures for
self-rule. The most important task is the appointment of a 'Palestinian
interim self-government authority', to be composed of 24 members or
'ministers' led by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, which will govern
Gaza-Jericho until elections. Mr Arafat and his inner circle of senior PLO
officials are expected to return to Gaza-Jericho within six weeks.
The next steps of the peace process are much more complicated and ambiguous.
The Declaration of Principles signed last September says implementation of
the Gaza-Jericho accord is supposed immediately to be followed by
negotiations on the second phase of the interim period: the extension of
Palestinian self-government to the rest of the West Bank excluding Arab East
Jerusalem.
Under this phase, Israeli troops are supposed to move out of Palestinian
population centres and make way for Palestinian policemen. The declaration
says the second phase will be implemented after the PLO holds elections for
a National Council on July 13 and the Israeli redeployment must be completed
'not later than the eve of elections'.
On the inauguration of the Council, the civil administration will be
dissolved and the Israeli military government withdrawn. The elections have
to be held under a protocol to be negotiated by Israel and the PLO. However,
it is already clear the elections will be long delayed and might even be
indefinitely postponed. Furthermore, Israel has promised speedy talks on
early transfer of power to Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank ahead
of a formal agreement on extension of self-rule.
Israeli officials clearly intend to drag out negotiations on the second
phase of the agreement until they can assess how Gaza-Jericho has worked.
For Israel success essentially means security: whether the PLO can curb
attacks by Palestinian extremists on Israelis.
If security is not increased there will be tremendous domestic pressure in
Israel not to proceed. If Mr Arafat does not hold elections, Israel will be
able to hide behind that excuse for not honouring its obligations in the
declaration.
Mr Rafi Ganzor, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, said an appointed
Palestinian Council and proof that Gaza-Jericho was working were conditions
for beginning talks on the rest of the West Bank.
Even if Gaza-Jericho goes well, complicated security negotiations for the
150 settlements and 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank could well mean
implementation of the second phase will be delayed well into next year.
The declaration also says negotiations on a permanent settlement to the
Palestinian question - essentially statehood or confederation with Jordan -
as well as the sensitive issue of Jewish settlements and the future of
Jerusalem, are to be discussed not later than the beginning of the third
year of Palestinian self-rule.
Under the timetable laid out in the declaration, this would mean
negotiations on permanent solutions would begin in December 1995 and would
be implemented by December 1998. It is unclear how the five-month delay in
implementing Gaza-Jericho and any future delays will affect the timetable.
