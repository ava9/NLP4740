<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] Israeli sources say that any delay in the deployment 
of Palestinian policemen will bring about a delay of one or two 
weeks in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. Major General Amnon Shahaq also said as much to 
his colleague, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, during the last round of talks 
in Cairo. This was reported in a consultation held in Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's Tel Aviv office yesterday. 
  A member of the Israeli delegation explained that the 
deployment of the Palestinian police force will take about one 
month and that until it is completed, the IDF will not complete 
its withdrawal. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin firmly opposes 
unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Sources 
in the defense establishment say Israel will not create a power 
vacuum which could be filled by Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], even if this means our remaining in the Gaza Strip 
for another week or two against our wishes. 
  The question is: Why are the Palestinians holding up the 
entrance of the first Palestinian police officers, who are 
slated to arrive in the autonomy areas in two days. A senior 
political source said: This does not stem from 'Arafat's 
negative attitude; even worse, it is the result of internal 
differences of opinion and disarray within the Palestinian 
delegation. 
  Jerusalem hopes that despite the differences of opinion 
between the generals and the politicians within the PLO, the 
first eight Palestinian police officers will arrive in Gaza and 
Jericho next Sunday or Monday.
