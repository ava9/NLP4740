  [Text] Palestinian leaders are continuing widespread 
political activities in East Jerusalem, which are coordinated 
with the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
The Palestinians are now saying that they are prepared to renew 
the negotiations with Israel on the transfer of authorities in 
the other West Bank towns. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] The furor surrounding the letter 
written by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has led to a 
confidence crisis among Palestinian leaders. The affair has 
been exploited by Palestinian supporters of the peace process 
who oppose the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and believe that it 
is detrimental to the Palestinian cause. Faysal al-Husayni, as 
if to highlight the political activities at Orient House, 
received a delegation of foreign consuls in his office and 
Palestinian leaders continued yesterday to hold discussions on 
Jerusalem's current situation as well as its future. A 
Palestinian source pointed out that although the famous letter 
sent to the Norwegian foreign minister was not addressed to the 
PLO, the letter's contents had undoubtedly been coordinated with 
the PLO. To prove his point, the source noted that he had a 
copy of the letter before it was signed by Foreign Minister 
Peres, which was dated 9 September. 
  Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the higher liaison committee 
and 
one of 'Arafat's closest aides, yesterday emphasized that at the 
time, the letter of commitment guaranteed that the Palestinian 
delegation could carry out the political activities in East 
Jerusalem that were necessary in order to conduct negotiations 
with Israel. Al-Tarifi asserted that it was impossible to 
separate the political activities of PLO institutions in East 
Jerusalem and the activities of the autonomy institutions, which 
will indeed be located in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as 
stipulated by the agreement. 
  [Al-Tarifi, in English] Everybody knows that we have many 
institutions in Jerusalem. It will be as it is, and of course 
it's a Palestinian institute and we will not change anything on 
it. So, nobody can cut the relations between the Palestinians 
and their leadership, which is PLO and one of its organizations 
PPA [sentence as heard]. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Al-Tarifi expressed the assessment that now, following the 
establishment of the Palestinian Authority, the negotiations 
with Israel on the transfer of authorities could be resumed. 
Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians would demand authority 
over more than the five spheres of health, education and 
culture, tourism, social welfare, and direct taxation stipulated 
by the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June adds 
that 
"the PLO has rejected an Israeli proposal to release hundreds of 
Palestinian prisoners tomorrow after Israel demanded that the 
prisoners remain in the Gaza Strip before returning to their 
homes until their original prison terms were over. This was 
stated by Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the Palestinian 
Authority. Al-Tarifi said that Yasir 'Arafat had instructed him 
over the telephone yesterday to reject the release proposal and 
said that the Israeli offer contravened the Cairo agreement. He 
expressed the hope that this was merely a misunderstanding and 
that an agreement would be reached on the release of the 
Palestinian prisoners."]
