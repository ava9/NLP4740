  [Text] About 150 Palestinian policemen crossed into the 
Gaza Strip from Egypt this evening. They were the first group 
to enter Gaza under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo 
last week. Thousands of Palestinians gathered in Rafah to greet 
the policemen, who drove across the border in buses and U.S. 
donated military vehicles. They are headed for Dayr al-Balah, 
where they will be stationed in the present Civil Administration 
building. They were wearing olive-green uniforms and berets, 
and waved Palestinian flags. 
  Qol Yisra'el's correspondent on the spot reports that there 
is much excitement among the local population seeing the first 
sign of the transfer of power. Before their arrival, the new 
Palestinian police commander in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, held a joint 
news conference with the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] Brigadier 
General Yom-Tov Sami'. Yusuf called it a historic day for the 
Palestinian people; the first day on the road to their 
independence. And, he added, we hope to have good relations 
with all our neighbors. 
  Earlier today, Israeli officials began handing over offices 
and supplies to Palestinian officials in Jericho. It was the 
start of a two-day handover. The actual transfer of power is to 
take place on Thursday [12 May]. The entry of Palestinian 
police into Jericho is expected tomorrow.
