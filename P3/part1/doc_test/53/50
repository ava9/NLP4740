  [Text] Cairo, April 11 (AFP)--The PLO chief negotiator 
acknowledged here Monday that it was now impossible to meet the 
target date for launching Palestinian self-rule with just two 
days to go, despite progress in talks with Israel. 
  "I don't think we can resolve (the outstanding issues) by 
April 13," although there has been "progress Sunday in talks on 
jurisdiction" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho, Nabil Sha'th told AFP. 
  Sha'th said the Israeli delegation had presented new 
proposals for jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho "which could open 
the way to real progress." 
  Under the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel 
and 
the PLO in September, Israel was to have started its withdrawal 
from the two areas on December 13 and was to complete it by 
April 13. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has insisted that Wednesday's 
deadline should be met. 
  In a phone call to US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
he urged Washington to step up efforts to ensure the success of 
the talks, warning a failure to meet the target date would harm 
the credibility of the peace process. 
  Talks reopened Sunday in the Egyptian capital after a 
four-day break and are due to continue until Tuesday in a bid to 
wrap up an accord on implementing Palestinian autonomy. 
  Sha'th added there had been progress both on prisoners and 
on 
security matters, including the deployment of a 9,000-strong 
Palestinian police force to take over from the Israeli army when 
it withdraws. 
  Security issues have bogged down over a date and timetable 
for an Israeli pull-out, and the deployment of the Palestinian 
police. 
  He also said the two sides had "come close" to agreement on 
the release of around 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held in 
Israeli jails. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation is demanding the 
release of all prisoners, including Islamic militants. 
  But Israel has refused to free members of militant 
organisations such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) or 
the Islamic Jihad, and those responsible for bloody attacks on 
Israelis. 
  Asked Monday if Islamic militants would be included in an 
agreement, Sha'th said: "All the prisoners are going to be 
scheduled for release one day or another. We represent all the 
Palestinian people." 
  Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin charged that 
Arafat was to blame for the delay in implementing Palestinian 
autonomy. 
  "Israel did not suspend the negotiations after the car-bomb 
attack in Afula unlike Yasir 'Arafat did after the Hebron 
massacre," Rabin told state radio. 
  "That is why we are not to blame for the loss of time in the 
negotiations," he said, after the Palestinians expressed 
exasperation at the failure to launch autonomy on time. 
  Sha'th added that the committee negotiating the transfer of 
civilian matters had on Sunday decided on all the agenda items 
under discussion, except for the thorny issue of water resources.
