  [Text] Cairo, April 6 (AFP) -- Israel is holding back on a 
date for its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to pressure the 
Palestinians into giving up their demands, the PLO complained 
here Wednesday [6 April]. 
  A PLO negotiator, asking not to be named, said Israel aimed 
to win concessions from the Palestinians on key issues such as 
water-sharing rights for Jewish settlers in the future 
autonomous areas. 
  The date for the Israeli army's withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and West Bank town of Jericho is being used as a weapon to 
secure Palestinian concessions on several other points, he said. 
  The Israelis also wanted veto rights over legal matters so 
they could overrule decisions taken by Palestinian courts. 
  On archaeology, another of the issues under discussion since 
a new round of autonomy negotiations opened in the Egyptian 
capital on Sunday, Israel demanded excavation rights. 
  The negotiator said Israel was calculating that the PLO had 
more to lose from a delay in an army withdrawal, which was 
originally due to start on December 13 and be completed by April 
13. 
  When the two sides failed to meet the December target set by 
the Declaration of Principles they signed in Washington on 
September 13, opponents of peace such as the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) gained ground, he noted. 
  To ease the pressure of time and win room for manoeuvre, the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation has asked for an Israeli 
commitment to pull out between April 13 and May 1, he said. 
  "Once one commits himself to a date, he really goes about to 
do everything to respect it," chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th 
said on Tuesday. 
  But his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq remained 
non-committal and stressed that the emphasis was on signing a 
final package for the launch of autonomy. 
  "What is important is to have the agreement signed and it 
will be signed when all discussions will be finished here. I 
can not say when," he said. "We will continue next week and I 
hope it will be finished soon." 
  The latest round, following a five-week break because of the 
Hebron mosque massacre, was to wind up on Wednesday because of 
Israel's commemoration of the Holocaust the next day and to 
reopen on Sunday. 
  On the ground, 26 Palestinians who were exiled by Israel 
returned to the West Bank on Tuesday to bolster preparations for 
self-rule. Another 23 Palestinian exiles returned home to a 
hero's welcome on the Gaza Strip. 
  Meanwhile in Cairo, both sides were still divided over the 
release of Palestinian prisoners. Sha'th complained that Israel 
was refusing to free members of groups hostile to the peace 
process, including Hamas. 
  Talks on deploying a Palestinian police force focused on 
several issues, including the size of the force, a factor which 
appears to have been resolved in contrast to the other 
difficulties. 
  The force will be 9,000 strong, a compromise between the 
10,000 demanded by the PLO and the original Israeli offer of 
6,000, according to Sha'th. 
  Akram Haniyah, a close aide to 'Arafat, said in an Israeli 
newspaper interview from PLO headquarters in Tunis that Arafat 
should arrive in Jericho during the first week of May. 
  "I think 'Arafat and the political leadership of the PLO 
will 
arrive in Jericho during the first week of the month of May," he 
told HA'ARETZ. 
  However the aide added a note of caution with an eye on the 
talks: "The situation is still fluid. Everything depends on the 
outcome of the negotiations underway in Cairo." 
  'Arafat himself on Wednesday left Amman after talks with 
King 
Husayn to travel to the Egyptian capital where he was to guide 
his negotiators on the last day of talks. 
  Israel and the PLO were also to meet in Paris the same day 
to 
discuss economic issues.
