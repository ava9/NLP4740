  [Text] Moscow 15 February TASS -- Russian Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has congratulated PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on their agreement reached at 
bilateral negotiations in Cairo. 
  Russia estimates the Cairo document as a fore-sighted 
political step, that brought Israel and the PLO closer to the 
conclusion of a full-scale agreement on the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, says a statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
circulated here today. 
  The agreements that regulate the implementation of the 
declaration on principles of temporary Palestinian 
self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are the 
result of a compromise. 
  The latter was made possible by thorough work for 
rapprochement of the sides' stands on complicated issues that 
had hampered the negotiations. These are communications, 
including corridors between Jericho and the Gaza Strip, 
security, in particular that of Israeli settlements, and check 
points. 
  The Foreign Ministry believes the most difficult part of 
implementation of the Gaza and Jericho formula has been done. 
  The Arab-Israeli negotiations are part of Russian-Israeli 
foreign political consultations underway in Moscow, said the 
statement.
