  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The first 
group of Palestinian policemen numbering some 150 arrived in the 
Gaza Strip at about 03:00 (12:00 GMT) this morning, formally 
starting Palestinian self-rule in the strip. 
  The entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza was in 
accordance with an agreement signed between the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel on implementing 
Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's 
Jericho area. 
  The first group of Palestinian police had been scheduled to 
come on May 8. But the arrival was delayed because of some 
technical problems and lack of adequate coordination between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides. 
  Before the arrival of the group, Major General Naser Yousef, 
commander of the Palestinian National Security Forces, and 
Brigadier Yom-Tov Samia, head of the Israeli side of the 
coordination committee between the Palestinians and Israelis on 
the transfer of authorities in Gaza, met Tuesday [10 May] 
afternoon with local and foreign reporters at the Rafah Border 
Check Point, the scheduled entrance for the Palestinian 
policemen to Gaza from Egypt. 
  Yousef said, "this is a historic day, the first day on the 
road of independence and freedom of the Palestinian people. It 
is also the starting of the implementation of the May 4 Cairo 
Agreement" between the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
  He said he believed "we will be capable of building our 
relations with our brothers and neighbors with very good spirit. 
Good neighborliness will prevail in this area." 
  Samia, who is also former commander of the Israeli forces in 
the Gaza Strip, said he hoped "security people on both sides 
will work together to ensure smooth transfer of area camps and 
responsibility," adding he believed both sides are ready to make 
it as smooth as possible. 
  In this way, he said, both sides can continue their 
missions, 
a common mission, to make sure that the people on both sides in 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area will feel safety and "we can 
start a new era of prosperity for all the area." 
  Over the past few days, local Palestinian people expressed 
their joy and excitement by turning out to the streets and 
gathering at the main road near the Rafah Border Check Point, 
some 50 kilometers southwest of Gaza City, to greet the arrival 
of the police. 
  Thousands of people waited for three consecutive days, some 
holding flags of the PLO, some singing and dancing, and others 
chanting slogans. 
  A total of some 9,000 Palestinian policemen will be deployed 
in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The PLO and Israel signed a peace accord in Washington on 
last September 13, which provides for Palestinian self-rule in 
the two areas as a step toward a final resolution of the 
Palestinian problem.
