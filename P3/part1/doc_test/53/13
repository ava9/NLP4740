  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will begin talks in Cairo 
next week on the points that are still the subject of 
disagreement, namely the stationing of a Palestinian policeman 
on the Allenby Bridge, the appointment of a Palestinian director 
for the Rafah crossing, the al-Mawasi area on the Khan Yunis 
beach, and the size of the Jericho area. This came at a news 
conference he held today to explain the details of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement which was signed by President 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 4 May. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that parallel to the talks on the points 
that are still the subject of disagreement between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides, talks will also start on 
extending the Palestinian authority to the West Bank at an early 
date so that the Palestinian police will deploy in the West Bank 
towns to prepare for the Palestinian elections. He refused to 
set a date for these elections, indicating that, in accordance 
with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, they 
were supposed to take place on 13 July. However, in view of the 
delay in signing the agreement from April to 4 May, holding 
these elections in Gaza and the West Bank might be delayed . 
  Dr. Sha'th explained that President 'Arafat will deliver the 
list of the names of the members of the Palestinian authority to 
Israel on 11 May. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will 
also take place in Washington when the Arab-Israeli talks resume 
on the other tracks. The talks, which on the Palestinian side 
will be chaired by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, will focus on the 
Palestinian legislative elections and the withdrawal from the 
West Bank. He added that talks will be held in Gaza and Jericho 
on the return of displaced people who left their homes after 
1967. He noted that the exact number of these displaced people 
is not known because of population growth over the past 27 years. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the first group from the Palestinian police 
force consisting of 360 policemen and officers left for Rafah 
today. He added that 1,500 policemen will cross the Jordan 
River to Jericho tomorrow. He said more Palestinian policemen 
will continue to arrive in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
indicating that the PLO will adhere to the timetable mentioned 
in the agreement, namely one to three weeks to establish 
security control in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinian forces in Yemen today 
began moving overland to Najran in Saudi Arabia in view of the 
circumstances in Yemen and the closure of airports. He said 
Saudi planes will fly them to Cairo. From there they will move 
to their assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in 
Libya have also moved overland to Cairo and from there to their 
assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in Algeria will 
also move to Egypt and then to the assembly point in Rafah. 
  Dr. Sha'th said Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf has been appointed 
commander in chief of the Palestinian police force. Ziyad 
al-Atrash has been appointed representative of the Palestinian 
side on the Palestinian-Israeli Coordination Committee. 
Al-Atrash arrived in Gaza yesterday. Brig. Gen. Ghazi 
al-Jabali has been appointed police commander of the Gaza Strip. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the interim period will begin on 4 May 1994, 
the date of the signing of the agreement. He indicated that a 
general amnesty will be issued for all prisoners and detainees 
when agreement on the interim period is reached. He added that 
no detainee will make a pledge to adhere to the accord. The 
pledge will be given to the Palestinian authority and not 
Israel; it will be a pledge to adhere to what the authority 
adheres to. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th said the agreement signed in Cairo 
Wednesday was the best possible agreement under the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on 13 September. He noted that the Declaration 
postponed discussion of main issues such as Israeli settlements, 
Jerusalem, Israeli withdrawal, border protection, and the return 
of the refugees. 
  He said the Palestinian National Authority, as it was agreed 
to call it, will be responsible for implementing what has been 
agreed upon. This authority, he added, will not have the right 
to exercise international powers, and countries cannot, for 
example, open embassies in the self-rule areas, but they may 
have representation offices in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said the PLO outside will have the right to open 
embassies because the Palestine National Council had announced 
the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
  Concerning the structure of the Palestinian National 
Authority, Dr. Sha'th explained at the end of his news 
conference that a 24-member council will assume legislative and 
executive powers. The judicial power, he added, will be 
exercised by appointed judges that cannot be dismissed, in 
accordance with the familiar norms in this regard. 
  Sha'th said the Palestinian negotiator managed to regain an 
important part of his rights within the framework of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  He stressed that the Palestinians will continue the 
negotiations until they attain all their rights to 
self-determination, the establishment of the Palestinian state, 
and repatriation. 
  He emphasized that the Palestinians will respect all their 
obligations and will work for a just and genuine peace.
