<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to Cairo talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place 
and date note given; from the "With the Midday Events" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening. You are welcome. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, hopes are rife that the negotiations 
will end before the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. Is what remains only 
time to draft the clauses of the agreement or are there other 
substantive issues? 
  [Sha'th] No substantive issues remain to hamper this 
agreement. Naturally, one always tries to confine his optimism 
to the framework of what is possible and realistic. Therefore, 
I cannot be absolutely certain, but can say we may conclude all 
these matters before 'Id al-Fitr, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the Israel Defense Forces' 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, has agreement been 
reached on dates? 
  [Sha'th] Agreement has been reached on the withdrawal plan 
and dates, but the first day of withdrawal depends on the day of 
signing. Consequently, it is an integrated timetable which 
lacks only the date of signing which will be the starting day of 
withdrawal. 
  [Mu'addi] What was agreed regarding the Palestinian police 
force? When will the vanguards of this force arrive in the Gaza 
Strip? 
  [Sha'th] Several officers will go there as of now to make 
the 
necessary preparations and contact the Israeli military 
commanders in Gaza in order to define the Palestinian police 
positions and what is required before the rest of the police 
forces arrive. Once the agreement is signed, the Palestinian 
police forces will begin to leave for the Strip and Jericho. 
They will do so before the Israeli withdrawal starts so that 
they will accurately learn all positions and needs on the 
ground. These forces will arrive in stages and gradually take 
up their positions prior to withdrawal. The withdrawal will then 
immediately commence from the positions, one at a time. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you realize that the issue of releasing 
prisoners is the main preoccupation of the people on the street. 
What stage have you reached in this regard? 
  [Sha'th] This subject preoccupies us as well. I think there 
is a favorable Israeli response in this regard and a feeling of 
its importance for Palestinians and the coming peace and the 
start of a new stage of relations. Therefore, we are conducting 
these negotiations, in addition to all other activities, day by 
day. I think we got closer in some points and others need to be 
finalized. What is important is to agree to a timetable for the 
release of all prisoners, even if this timetable is spread over 
a period of time that includes withdrawal and completion of the 
agreement on the West Bank, too. We want all prisoners to 
eventually return home in peace. We want to see an end to this 
period so a new era of peace can begin. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. When do you expect a 
summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Sha'th] This, of course, depends on the day of signing. 
They might meet one or two days before the signing to discuss 
those issues left for them to finish. Therefore, if the signing 
is ready before 'Id al-Fitr, then the two leaders will meet 
before 'Id al-Fitr. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to Cairo talks, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you and welcome.
