  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel are 
optimistic that a Hebron security accord will be signed here on 
Tuesday [29 March] to clear the way for the resumption of 
autonomy talks after a one-month break. 
  A senior Palestinian official said Sunday the PLO was 
putting 
to one side its demand for the evacuation of the 400 Jewish 
settlers who live among 120,000 Palestinians in the massacre 
town of Hebron. 
  "The departure of the Hebron settlers is a pressing demand 
so 
as to prevent further violence, but it is not a precondition," 
Muhammad Subayh, secretary general of the Palestine National 
Council or parliament-in-exile, told AFP. 
  Although Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has ruled out 
their withdrawal, an Israeli source said the settlers living in 
five areas of Hebron could be regrouped. 
  The PLO and Israel agreed over the weekend that the only 
serious issue left was the number of Palestinian policemen and 
Norwegian observers to be deployed in the occupied West Bank 
town of Hebron. 
  Israel accepted the deployment of lightly armed police and 
foreign observers in talks with the Palestinians last week in 
Tunis and Cairo. 
  The accord on Hebron could be signed when the two sides 
reconvene on Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are 
ironed out in time, the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
Saturday. 
  "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on 
launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately," 
after a one-month suspension by the PLO because of the February 
25 massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a settler, he said. 
  The Palestinian police will be posted at fixed points around 
Hebron to guard schools, hospitals and the university, said 
Sha'th. Joint Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town. 
  He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have 
the last word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will 
be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be 
launched. 
  As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the 
launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which 
the Israeli army was to have pulled out of the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank town of Jericho, said Sha'th. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he 
hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a 
last session on the security arrangements for Hebron. 
  Rabin said an accord was in sight on security for Hebron 
Palestinians, as demanded by the PLO as a condition for resuming 
the autonomy negotiations. "I believe we have advanced in the 
right direction," he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres said implementation of the autonomy accord could start "in 
one or two months." 
  A deal on the launch of autonomy was to have come into 
effect 
on December 13, under the September 13 Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington, but it has been held up mainly by Israeli 
security concerns. 
  Israeli state radio said Saturday that Palestinian police 
would be deployed in nine day's time in Hebron, Jericho and Gaza. 
  Subayh raised an additional Palestinian demand on Sunday -- 
for police also to be sent to the rest of the West Bank. "The 
settlers are everywhere and risks of a massacre exist everywhere 
they live," he said. 
  "The question of the security of the Palestinians does not 
only present itself in Hebron," said Subayh. 
  But Rabin has said the Hebron arrangements were 
"exceptional," and would not be extended to other West Bank 
towns such as Nablus or Ramallah. 
  UN Security Council Resolution 904, adopted on March 18, 
condemned the Hebron massacre and called for protection for 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  After the massacre, the PLO demanded an armed international 
protection force, the disarming of Jewish settlers and 
dismantling of certain flashpoint settlements, including those 
in Hebron.
