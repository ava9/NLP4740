  [Text] At the conclusion of his meeting with Nabil Sha'th 
at the Erez checkpoint a short while ago, Major General Amnon 
Shahaq said that Sha'th would apparently not visit Jerusalem 
tomorrow due to changes in his schedule. 
  Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that Maj. Gen. Shahaq 
said that Nabil Sha'th had asked him to increase the number of 
entry permits for Palestinian workers from the autonomous areas. 
Shahaq, for his part, raised the issue of the collaborators who 
have been arrested in the autonomous areas. The two men agreed 
that this matter, as well as the issue of the Palestinian 
prisoners, would be discussed at their meeting next week. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 19 June 
reports that "Maj. Gen. Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th this afternoon 
agreed that Israel and the PLO will next week launch 
negotiations on the beginning of the next stage: The gradual 
transfer of powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinian 
authorities." The report notes that "next week, the two men 
will also discuss the full implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement and the release of all the Palestinian 
prisoners, including those who were transferred to Jericho. 
Nabil Sha'th asserted that he intended to visit Jerusalem 
tomorrow; however, this also depended on how busy he would be in 
the Gaza Strip. At any rate, Sha'th said, his intention was to 
hold a private visit and to people he described as friends, such 
as Faysal al-Husayni, visit the churches, and pray at al-Aqsa 
mosque." The report adds that "Nabil Sha'th and Maj. Gen. 
Shahaq today agreed that at the beginning of next week, 30,000 
permits to work inside Israel would be issued to the residents 
of the Gaza Strip. It was also agreed that the families of the 
Palestinian policemen would immediately be allowed to enter 
Israel. The Army will also ease the policy regarding entry and 
departure from the autonomous areas."] 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Nabil 
Sha'th's planned visit to Jerusalem and the intention to convene 
the autonomy council at the Orient House building were raised 
today at the weekly cabinet session. The speakers at the 
meeting expressed doubts as to whether the autonomy council 
would really be convened in Jerusalem. The cabinet was told 
that in general, the territories were more quiet, although the 
autonomy authorities had failed to meet the timetable for 
assuming responsibility over the residents' daily affairs. 
  The cabinet revoked the ban against signing contracts with 
South Africa following the Security Council's decision to end 
the military embargo and other restrictions against South Africa. 
  The cabinet also issued another 10,000 work permits for 
laborers from the territories. Approximately 55,000 work 
permits for Palestinians from the territories have been issued 
so far.
