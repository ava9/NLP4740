  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Former 
U.S. President Richard Nixon has already been laid in his final 
resting place. At the state funeral, President Clinton and 
former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush, as well as 
many other dignitaries were present. It was an occasion of 
glory and of mourning. 
  Nevertheless, Americans at home and abroad have varying 
opinions about Nixon's historical achievements and faults. 
Although Watergate disgraced him, his three major diplomatic 
achievements were visible for all to see, namely that he ended 
the Vietnam War through talks, opened the door to the 
establishment of Sino-U.S. relations by his personal visit to 
China, and defrosted the Cold War by reaching an arms reduction 
agreement with the Soviet Union. These three major events have 
had worldwide influence and will surely be recorded in the 
history books. Moreover, today, U.S. China policy, which he 
designed himself, continues to influence the White House and has 
a positive part in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Nixon always viewed Sino-U.S. relations from a strategic 
plane and with foresight. Since stepping down, he has always 
opposed pressuring China by linking most-favored-nation [MFN] 
trading status with the human rights question. In his last book 
"Beyond Peace" he wrote: "Today, China's economic power makes 
U.S. lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it 
will make them irrelevant. Within two decades, it will make 
them laughable. By then, the Chinese may threaten to withhold 
MFN status from the United States unless we do more to improve 
living conditions (of the poor) in Detroit, Harlem, and South 
Central Los Angeles." 
  Obviously, Nixon predicted from the historical angle that 
China would become a first-rate power within two decades and 
that it would be so strong as to get tough with the United 
States over human rights issues. However, he may have forgotten 
that China has repeatedly declared that it "will never seek 
hegemony." Even though China may become strong, it is certainly 
not going to pressure others using human rights or any other 
issues. 
  In all events, Nixon never changed his view of China's world 
status and international role even when Sino-U.S. relations were 
at a stalemate and going through the most difficult of times. 
For example, in the wake of the "4 June Incident" in Beijing in 
1989, the U.S. administration and other Western countries 
jointly imposed "economic sanctions" on China, leading to the 
possible crisis of renewed confrontation in Sino-U.S. relations. 
In response to this, Nixon, who had stayed out of public life 
for a long time, publicly stood up to show his disapproval of 
"sanctions against China" and energetically urged maintaining a 
channel of dialogue between China and the United States. In 
late October that same year, despite criticisms from the 
government and the public, he paid a visit to Beijing, bringing 
a message from former President Bush to Deng Xiaoping and acting 
as a broker between them. Afterward, he paid another three 
visits to China, contributing to the restoration of normal 
relations between China and the United States. 
  Nixon's firm stance on maintaining Sino-U.S. friendly and 
cooperative relations was derived from his profound analysis of 
the international situation. In the 1960's, he was vice 
president in the Eisenhower administration and was a prominent 
anticommunist figure. Later, after touring all over the world, 
his horizons were broadened and he began to realize that it was 
impossible for the United States to solely dominate the world 
and nor was it possible to control the world in collaboration 
with the Soviet Union. At that time the Soviet Union had a 
wilder ambition to solely dominate the world than the United 
States. In the meantime, China had already broken through U.S. 
encirclement and had stood up in the East. In 1968, Nixon won 
the presidential election. He appointed Henry Kissinger as 
White House security adviser, revised the foreign policy 
strategy together with him, pursued the "world triangular 
balance strategy," and admitted that the world had not only two 
poles but a third one, namely China. In 1971, he resolved to 
establish diplomatic relations with China and China also wished 
to usher in new diplomatic prospects and expand economic and 
trade exchanges with the West, thus it was high time they 
established diplomatic relations. The Chinese top leadership 
pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations were founded on common 
interests, not on ideologies or social systems. Nixon agreed 
with this viewpoint. 
  As the 1990's unfolded, drastic changes took place in 
Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union disintegrated. Some Americans said 
that "China's role has weakened" and the "CPC will not stand" 
and that the world has only one pole, the United States. 
Therefore, they were publicly exerting pressure on China using 
the human rights issue in an attempt to bring about the 
"peaceful evolution" of China. This is the root cause of the 
numerous disputes between China and the United States in recent 
years. 
  Because whoever starts the trouble should end it, so the 
Clinton administration should act on Nixon's China policy, face 
China's speedy economic development squarely, and separate the 
MFN status issue from the human rights question. Only by doing 
so can Sino- U.S. relations further develop.
