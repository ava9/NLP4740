SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Archives and Records Administration proposes to amend regulations on procedures for preserving and
protecting the Presidential historical materials of the Nixon administration and for providing public access to
these materials. The Archivist of the United States is required by law to issue these regulations, and may amend them
from time to time. The proposed regulatory amendments would clarify various terms that appear in 36 CFR part 1275;
clarify the nature of the archival processing being conducted on the Nixon Presidential materials; and provide for
the reproduction of the Nixon White House tape recordings. The proposed amendments to 36 CFR part 1275 would affect
former President Nixon and other individuals whose names appear in the materials, as well as members of the general
public interested in conducting research regarding those materials.

578 F. Supp. 951 (D.D.C. 1983); the case held that the previous regulations were tainted by the legislative veto provision
of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (``PRMPA''), 44 U.S.C. 2111 note (1974). The current
regulations were published on February 28, 1986, 51 FR 7228, and became effective on June 26, 1986. On April 12, 1988,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the District Court's approval of the regulations
promulgated by the Archivist on June 26, 1986.

Since promulgation of the current regulations, the National Archives and Records Administration has continued
to prepare the Nixon Presidential materials for public access. Nixon Presidential historical material falling
into several categories has been released since 1986. One category consists of selected subject categories and Staff
Member and Office Files from the Nixon White House Central Files, which has been released (subject to the withholding
of restricted material) in relatively small portions over time. Most of this material from the White House Central
Files documents the President's constitutional and statutory duties, and the release of that material has been largely
uneventful. 51 FR 32700 (Sept. 15, 1986), 53 FR 1870 (Jan. 22, 1988), 53 FR 40976 and 41441 (Oct. 19, 1988), 54 FR 24054
(June 5, 1989), 54 FR 43878 (Oct. 27, 1989), 56 FR 30774 (July 5, 1991), 57 FR 417 (Jan. 6, 1992), 57 FR 23602 (June 4, 1992),
58 FR 17433 (April 2, 1993), and 58 FR 31548 (June 3, 1993). In addition, the National Archives and Records Administration
has released the Nixon White House Photo Collection, 44 FR 57221 (Oct. 4, 1979); Nixon White House Communications
Agency Audio and Video Files, 51 FR 26782 (July 25, 1986); Nixon White House selected audiovisual materials, 53 FR
40976 (October 19, 1988); and Nixon Presidential historical materials relating to POW/MIA matters, 58 FR 52121 (Oct.
6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, a large series of materials known as the White House Special Files was released. 52 FR 3068 (Jan. 30, 1987).
That file consists of many thousands of pages of sensitive documents, a high percentage of which document abuses of
power. In addition to the withholding of material that the National Archives and Records Administration determined
to be subject to restriction under the current regulations, the National Archives and Records Administration withheld
material from the White House Special Files which it deemed releasable, but which former President Nixon claimed
was subject to restriction or that was private or personal and therefore returnable. These contested documents are
currently undergoing further review by the Presidential Materials Review Board in accordance with the provisions
of the current PRMPA regulations.
