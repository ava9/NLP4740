THE ceremony was set for 11am, but the White House gates opened at 8am, for
those specially invited to witness it, and some were already queuing soon
after 7am to be sure of a good seat. At the head of the queue was a man from
the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac).
Until a few weeks ago that committee, perhaps the most formidable lobbying
organisation in all Washington, would have moved heaven and earth to prevent
the re-election of any senator or congressman foolish enough to suggest a
resumption of official contacts between the US and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, let alone an invitation to the White House for Mr Yassir
Arafat himself, whom most Americans have regarded as the world's
arch-terrorist ever since his famous 'gun-and-olive-branch' appearance at
the United Nations in 1974.
But there was the man from Aipac (after consulting the woman next to him he
declined to give his name) queuing up to get within handshake distance of
the PLO leader, and declaring benignly his support for 'the peace process'.
Later arrivals included most of those who in successive US administrations
have handled that 'process', which has been a principal feature of US
foreign policy under both Republican and Democratic presidents since at
least 1973.
There was Mr Henry Kissinger, who as secretary of state in that year
negotiated the ceasefire at the end of the Yom Kippur war and the
'disengagement of forces' agreements which followed, first between Israel
and Egypt, then - a far tougher affair, requiring a two-month marathon of
shuttle diplomacy - between Israel and Syria. But it was also Mr Kissinger
who in 1975, as part of the price for Israel's partial withdrawal from
Sinai, gave the pledge that the US would never deal with the PLO unless it
first renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist.
There was former President Jimmy Carter, who 15 years ago hosted the
three-week Camp David summit between Egypt's then President Anwar Sadat and
Mr Menachem Begin, Israel's prime minister of the time.
Mr Carter has perhaps as much right as anyone to feel fulfilled by
yesterday's agreement, since it is closely modelled on the Camp David
'framework', which at the time the PLO, along with almost the entire Arab
world outside Egypt, furiously rejected.
He may have reflected with irony that, had the framework been accepted, the
interim period of Palestinian autonomy might have started in 1979 rather
than 1993 or 1994, in which case negotiations on the final status of the
territories should have begun by 1982 and been concluded by 1984.
Yet Mr Carter was bound throughout his administration by the Kissinger
pledge, and so was never able to bring his diplomatic talents directly to
bear on Mr Arafat or other PLO representatives. This thought must yesterday
have been running through the mind of Mr Andy Young, the black American
leader who in 1979 was forced to resign as Mr Carter's representative at the
United Nations after secret contacts between him and the PLO representative
there came to light.
There were Mr Cyrus Vance and Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, respectively secretary
of state and national security adviser in the Carter administration and
frequently at odds over the Middle East as well as over policy towards the
Soviet Union.
There was General Alexander Haig, who as Mr Ronald Reagan's first secretary
of state gave the green light for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982,
and resigned in the midst of the crisis which followed. There was his
successor Mr George Shultz, who in 1988 negotiated the PLO's first explicit
recognition of Israel's right to exist - an essential precondition for
yesterday's agreement.
And there were former President George Bush and his secretary of state, Mr
James Baker, who between them nudged Israel and the Arabs into the peace
conference which began in Madrid the year before last, in the wake of the
Gulf war. They also can take some credit for bringing Mr Rabin to power in
Israel last year. By witholding loan guarantees from Israel they showed for
the first time US support was not unconditional.
Indeed it depended on Israel's willingness to halt the settlement process in
the occupied territories and give up 'land for peace'.
