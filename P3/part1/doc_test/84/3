Richard M. Nixon blended past and present Wednesday, viewing the simple wooden 
house where he was born and strolling through the next-door presidential 
library to be dedicated today at a triumphal gathering of Presidents, friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day marked by an evening party of Nixon Administration alumni and a 
lunch for library contributors, a reunion of men and women like Nixon friend 
Bebe Rebozo and presidential secretary Rose Mary Woods; former Treasury 
Secretary William E. Simon and the Rev. Billy Graham; former Secretary of State 
Alexander M. Haig and former press secretary Ron Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon peeked into the home his father built from a kit, and then proceeded with 
his wife, Pat, daughter Julie and her husband, David Eisenhower, to the 
$21-million, Spanish-style building that will be opened to the public Friday. 
There they entered the library auditorium and he spoke to more than 300 people 
who had converged from across the country to salute him. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the standing-room-only audience were former White House workers and 
members of the February Group, an organization of Nixon Administration alumni 
that formed months after their leader was forced by the Watergate break-in and 
cover-up to resign the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. Others were library 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-minute standing ovation, Nixon started to talk, only to be 
interrupted by a shout of "Welcome Home, Mr. President!" 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was closed to the press, but those inside said Nixon told them, 
"You are very special, very special." He said he and Pat knew in 1946, during 
his first political campaign for Congress, that the volunteers working for him 
were vital and that to see so many people from the old days made him feel like 
he was looking at his roots. 
</P>
<P>
He said his library "belongs to all Americans" regardless of ideology or 
politics, and that he hoped it would inspire young people with the lesson that 
they can rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon reminisced about his campaigns of 40 years ago, when after being a 
congressman from Whittier he won a U.S. Senate seat and then became Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
He told the crowd that Julie and David Eisenhower's children were at Disneyland 
and his other daughter, Tricia, her husband and their son flew to California 
with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew into El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on Wednesday afternoon, saying 
he was "very pleased to be going to this dedication of this library." After 
spending the night at the Anaheim Hilton, this morning he is scheduled to host 
a California Republican Party fund-raising breakfast before presiding at the 
open-air dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Nixon will join the other two living Republican ex-Presidents, Gerald 
R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, for the ceremony and later for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion will mark the first gathering of four former Presidents since the 
1981 White House gathering of Reagan, Ford, Nixon and Jimmy Carter en route to 
the funeral of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Carter declined an 
invitation to attend the library opening. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremonies are open to the public, and police said a crowd of about 
20,000 is expected for the dedication of the nation's 10th presidential 
library, the first one in California and the first to be built and operated 
entirely with private money. The next library will be Reagan's, which is 
scheduled to open in 1991 in Simi Valley. Tonight Nixon will be honored at a 
dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
As the Nixons emerged from their car Wednesday to the cheers of about 50 
people, the only man to resign the presidency waved to the crowd and mouthed 
the word "tomorrow" at people shouting questions at him from a roped-off area 
for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon, 78 years old and appearing frail in a white and black silk dress, 
accepted a bouquet of yellow roses from three Brownie Scouts and kissed each 
one on the forehead. Her husband, 77, in a dark suit and white shirt, bent over 
and shook hands with them before entering the building. 
</P>
<P>
For Pat Nixon, today's dedication will be a rare public appearance. While her 
husband has spent much of the last decade removing the tarnish from his 
reputation, writing books, visiting foreign countries and meeting world 
leaders, Pat has spent her time in private. Friends say she is devoted to her 
children and grandchildren and indulges her love for gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Drown of Rolling Hills Estates, who has known Thelma (Pat) Nixon since 
they were both schoolteachers in Whittier, said her longtime friend is "just 
thrilled to pieces about" the library dedication, viewing it as "a great 
tribute to her husband." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nixon met for an hour in Century City with Reagan, who later said 
in an interview that historians should rethink their view of Nixon and place 
greater emphasis on the former President's foreign policy record. Much 
criticism of Nixon, Reagan said, "was based on nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
But Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state at the time of his 
resignation, disputed that statement Wednesday, saying that while his former 
boss deserves enormous credit for his Administration's foreign policy 
successes, Nixon and his staff also blundered badly in handling the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were definite, huge errors," Kissinger said during a 40-minute 
interview at a Beverly Hills hotel. "I have always believed that he was 
punished much too severely . . . but I think there were huge mistakes made." 
</P>
<P>
With some scholars questioning the Nixon library's value as a research 
institution, Kissinger also called on the former President to compile a 
complete set of presidential papers and administer them according to National 
Archives access policies. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon library Executive Director Hugh Hewitt had said that certain people would 
likely be excluded from the library -- a statement he later retracted -- and 
Kissinger suggested that Nixon issue a statement announcing his intention to 
have the library administered identically to other presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
While the museum, with its exhibits on Nixon's career, opens Friday, the 
library portion, of more interest to scholars, is not expected to open until 
next year. Hewitt said the Watergate exhibits in the museum still were not 
ready and might not be finished Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service set up a booth outside the building for a special library 
postmark. Across the street, facing the building, was a hand-lettered sign: 
"Watch out, George. He's tan, rested and ready. Nixon 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the Nixons visited the library, Simon, who served as treasury 
secretary under Nixon and one of the main money-raisers for the facility, 
hosted a luncheon at the building for about 50 longtime Nixon supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Rebozo, one of Nixon's closest friends; Max Fisher, an 
oil magnate and Nixon pal; and Carl Karcher, founder of Orange County-based 
Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be a great tribute to the Nixon family, and it will 
be a great asset for Orange County," Karcher said as he entered the luncheon. 
"I think as time goes on Nixon will go down as one of the outstanding 
Presidents in history." 
</P>
<P>
Before the gathering of the February Group, former Nixon speechwriter Patrick 
J. Buchanan said the meeting "will probably be the real first and last conclave 
of those who have been associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his second 
inaugural" in 1973, 19 months before he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The library entrance was the scene of some reunions Wednesday, with Haig 
striding across the lawn when he spotted Simon and greeting him, "Hello, Uncle 
Bill." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about the library, Haig said young people will especially 
benefit from studying Nixon, who he said has a "steel-like character that has 
carried him through recovery after recovery, whether it's his physical health 
or his political health." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who was one of the first to be called by Nixon in 1984 to help resume 
the library project, described his first tour of the facility Wednesday as 
"breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anybody who was with Nixon in the White House who didn't come out 
without tears in his eyes after looking at some of the pictures and the 
memorabilia," he said. "It's incredible, it's a very warm, wonderful affair." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Khachigian of San Clemente, who started his presidential speech-writing 
career in Nixon's White House, said the former President was "very jovial and 
upbeat" when he saw him Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian said Nixon was interested in the latest assessments of the 
California governor's race, noting that the Republican candidate, U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson, worked on Nixon's campaign for California governor in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nixon campaigns were a training ground for thousands of operatives who 
made their way up the ladder like Pete Wilson," Khachigian said. As a result, 
he said, the reunion of Nixon supporters and staff prompted by the library 
dedication was extraordinarily large and included American political leaders 
reaching back nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
"They say (Vice President) Dan Quayle is young; Nixon was 39 when he was vice 
president," Khachigian noted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people here who haven't seen each other for . . . years all greeting 
each other with great warmth," he said. "Politics uniquely brings people 
together but his time was even more unique because we went through so much 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the glue that held us all together." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Garment, White House personal counsel to Nixon, called Watergate a 
"kidney stone" that "worked its way out of everybody's system a long time ago. 
. . . You won't find this group wallowing in Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Woods, longtime personal secretary to Nixon, said, "There's so much else to 
talk about, so many great accomplishments -- why dwell on it?" 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a longtime friend and frequent golfing buddy of Nixon's, said the 
library dedication at which he will give the invocation will be the "pinnacle" 
of Nixon's career. The clergyman said it will symbolize the American public's 
forgiveness.
