<F P=106> [From the "Commenting on the News" feature by Miguel de la </F>
Guardia for the "Evening Information Review" program] 
  [Text] Frequently, it has been said that secret or 
diplomatic contacts have been made to improve relations between 
Cuba and the United States, which have been historically at odds 
since the victory of the socialist revolution in Cuba 35 years 
ago. Apparently there were some secret contacts during the 
administration of President James Carter, according to Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez, vice president of the Council of Ministers of 
Cuba, who revealed this in a recent interview. 
  Interviewed by GRANMA, the Cuban leader revealed some 
details 
of that communication, although he considered it very unlikely 
that there will soon be positive changes in Washington's 
attitude toward Havana. At that time, a secret meeting had been 
arranged between the high-ranking Cuban leader and then-U.S. 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, to be held at the apartment of 
then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Andrew Young in New York City. 
At that time, a surprising accusation by President Carter was 
made against Cuba. He accused the Havana Government of being 
involved in an internal conflict in the African republic of 
Zaire. Vance, coming from a meeting with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Andrey Gromyko, was informed by the selfsame Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez of what Carter had said, which also suprised 
the secretary of state. Consequently the negotiations were 
suspended. It was later seen that Cuba had nothing to do with 
the Zaire problem, but the moment for negotiating was over, 
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez explained. 
  We recall that those were the days in which Reagan's 
campaign 
for the presidency focused on accusing Carter of having a soft 
hand on foreign policy matters. Reagan based his campaign on 
Carter's inability to free the U.S. hostages being held by the 
Iranian Government, which became a scandal as a result of 
publicity by the large contingent of U.S. media influenced by 
the nation's extreme right. Carter thought it was necessary to 
harden his foreign policy positions, thereby foiling the secret 
negotiations with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. 
  Carlos Rafael Rodriguez stated that the current 
administration of President William Clinton believes that the 
Cuban revolution might collapse at any minute and that is why it 
has not shown any interest in promptly settling differences with 
Cuba. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez ruled out the violent outcome the 
Republican administrations of Reagan and Bush hoped to provoke, 
adding that the current policy of Clinton will face the same 
fate. 
  This commentator agrees with the aforesaid position of the 
Cuban leader and predicts that it will be too late for 
Washington to improve relations, because Cuba is demonstrating 
it can once again defeat the empire's pressure.
