<TEXT>
<P>
Once the most scorned politician in America, former President Richard M. Nixon 
is now lionized by both liberals and conservatives and is regularly consulted 
on foreign policy and political strategy by the Bush Administration and 
Congressional leaders. Yet, Nixon's latest book, "In the Arena," is an eloquent 
reminder of his profound limitations as a politician and political thinker. Its 
callow attempts at self-justification and its neo-Cold War policy prescriptions 
reflect a man who is still bedeviled by his past. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon devotes a good deal of "In the Arena" to lame excuses for Watergate. 
Perhaps assuming that Americans' memories have dimmed, Nixon reduces the entire 
Watergate scandal to campaign peccadilloes. "At the core of the scandal was the 
fact that individuals associated with my reelection campaign were caught 
breaking into and installing telephone wiretaps at the headquarters of the 
Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel," he writes. He either 
denies or minimizes his role in the sundry assaults on Constitutional liberties 
that the Watergate investigation uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon insists that the numerous wiretaps he ordered were "carefully limited and 
totally legal for reasons of national security. . . . We were concerned that 
leaks might abort our secret China initiatives and our Vietnam peace 
negotiations." But the wiretaps were first installed in spring, 1969, on 
Nixon's National Security Council and two of his closest aides after the New 
York Times revealed that Nixon had begun secretly bombing Cambodia. The 
wiretaps had nothing to do with Nixon's China initiative or peace negotiations. 
The Supreme Court later ruled that they were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon dismisses as "bizarre" and "false" charges that he "ordered massive 
illegal wiretapping and surveillance of political opponents," but in July, 
1970, Nixon approved a massive plan for political repression concocted by aide 
Tom Huston that included intensified electronic surveillance of "domestic 
security threats" and increased "mail coverage." These activities were to be 
coordinated by a new "Interagency Group." Fortunately, J. Edgar Hoover balked 
at creating a rival to his own agency. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon acknowledges that the Watergate cover-up was illegal, but blames it on 
his subordinates. "I made the inexcusable error of following the recommendation 
from some members of my staff -- some of whom, I later learned, had a personal 
stake in covering up the facts -- and requesting that the CIA intervene," Nixon 
says in trying to excuse his request that the CIA throttle the FBI 
investigation of Watergate. Nixon limits his own role to not setting "a higher 
standard for the conduct of the people who participated in my campaign and 
administration." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon frequently uses the debating technique of denying what has never been 
charged in order to evade what has already been shown. Denying any hint of 
political corruption, he writes, "No one who donated over a million dollars was 
ever appointed to any ambassadorship." What he fails to mention is that quite a 
few people who contributed somewhat less were given appointments. According to 
J. Anthony Lukas' "Nightmare," Nixon appointed 13 non-career ambassadors after 
his 1972 election who, together, contributed $706,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon uses a similar debating technique in discussing the use of the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) to harass political opponents. He cavalierly defends 
using the IRS against Democratic chairman Lawrence O'Brien. "I see nothing 
wrong with getting wealthy people to pay their taxes," Nixon says. But Nixon 
doesn't mention using the IRS against virtually anyone who crossed his path, 
from a Newsday editor to basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's rendition of his Vietnam policy is about as credible as his version of 
Watergate. He blames the prolongation of the war on the North Vietnamese 
"filibustering" the negotiations. Nixon omits his own role in sabotaging the 
Johnson Administration's October, 1968, peace overtures; his adamant refusal 
for four years to accept a North Vietnamese presence in the South, even though 
it was obvious they could not be dislodged; the South Vietnamese government's 
veto of the agreement finally worked out in summer, 1972, between National 
Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon not only defends but recommends as models of decision-making the 1970 
invasion of Cambodia and the brutal and unnecessary 1972 Christmas bombing of 
Hanoi. He writes that the Cambodian invasion "saved lives and reduced the 
Communists' ability to continue their attacks on our forces," not mentioning 
that the invasion failed utterly in its main objective of unearthing and 
destroying the North Vietnamese headquarters (the infamous COSVN) supposedly 
located in Cambodia, nor that by inflaming domestic opposition, the invasion 
restricted Nixon's future options far more than it restricted North Vietnam's. 
</P>
<P>
As President, Nixon's greatest achievement was to break with the Cold War model 
of a monolithic world Communist movement. Nixon recognized that the United 
States could use the growing divisions within the Communist world to its own 
advantage by playing China off against the Soviet Union. The problem is that 
two decades later, with Communism in ruins and the Soviet Union turning inward, 
Nixon clings to the same geopolitical strategy. Nixon still believes that the 
Soviet Union remains a dangerous threat that must be parried through alliance 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, Nixon avers that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is not a 
reformer but a wily Brezhnev, seeking the same ends through more devious means. 
His musings on Gorbachev sound as though they were excerpted from a John Birch 
Society newsletter: Gorbachev's reforms "represent little more than crumbs 
which have fallen from the banquet table." Gorbachev's goal is not "to replace 
the Communist system, but to strengthen it." The Soviet army is "stronger than 
when Gorbachev came to power five years ago. . . . Gorbachev's principal 
political reform has been to concentrate more power in his own hands than any 
Soviet leader since Stalin. . . . He has not given up his support for those 
regimes besieged by anti-Communist freedom fighters." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Nixon insists that the Chinese are worthy and valuable 
allies against the Soviet Union. After the Tian An Men Square massacre, Nixon 
called for the Bush Administration to retain its "cooperative relationship" 
with Deng Xiaoping and China's other leaders to prevent the Soviet Union from 
creating an alliance with China against the United States. In this book, Nixon 
wildly exaggerates China's importance to American foreign policy. China, he 
writes, is "the number three political player on the world scene." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also glosses over China's retrogression after Tian An Men Square. He 
predicts that "after some necessary retrenchment Deng's economic reforms will 
continue and . . . with them will inevitably come renewed pressure for 
political reforms." He portrays Deng and disciple Li Peng, the architects of 
the massacre, as being "reformers" and warns that an American attempt at 
"isolating China will only be grist for the mill of the reactionaries." 
</P>
<P>
In typical Nixon fashion, he refutes his critics by attributing to them 
untenable positions they do not hold. After the massacre, Nixon writes, "some 
observers called for the United States to punish China's leaders by breaking 
off all relations." China's critics, however, did not call for breaking off all 
relations but rather for suspending high-level contacts above ambassadorial 
level -- a far different and more reasonable response and one that Nixon might 
have found more difficult to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
Like Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson, Nixon was a lot smarter in office than out. 
Out of office, he has seemed determined to prove his conservative credentials 
-- even positioning himself in 1987 on Ronald Reagan's right by opposing the 
manifestly benign INF treaty. He also seems driven by a need to justify his 
continuing close relations with China's leaders and his questionable role in 
persuading the Bush Administration to take a conciliatory posture after Tian An 
Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is so obsessed with Cold War geopolitics that he barely mentions the 
global issues that will dominate American foreign policy in the next two 
decades. Nixon has only the foggiest notion of international economics. He 
devotes a single sentence to economic conflicts with Japan. Many of our trade 
disputes, Nixon declares, have been "politically potent" but "economically 
petty." If anything, the exact reverse has been the case: The disputes have had 
little effect politically, but have had enormous repercussions on key American 
industries like semiconductors and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are sensible and interesting sections in this book. In chapters on 
temperance, recreation, public speaking or privacy, Nixon offers Dale 
Carnegie-like advice to the young about how to succeed in politics. Nixon also 
can display a commendable realism in rejecting proposals for total disarmament 
or world government. But just as Nixon's greatest achievements as President 
were overshadowed by his darker side, the virtues of this book are dwarfed by 
its vices.
