  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen offered his condolences here 
this morning on the unfortunate death of former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon, who made important contributions to the 
improvement and growth of Sino-U.S. ties. 
  Today the U.S. Embassy was filled with a solemn silence. 
Wreaths presented by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen as well as State 
Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan 
were placed in the mourning hall of the U.S. Embassy. A portrait 
of Nixon draped with black gauze was hung on the wall in the 
hall. 
  At about 9:30 A.M. Qian and Luo slowly walked into the 
embassy and shook hands with U.S. Ambassador to China J. 
Stapleton Roy, expressing their deep condolences on Nixon's 
death. 
  They stood silently in front of a portrait of the deceased 
for a while and then each wrote a few words of commemoration in 
a mourning book. 
  Qian's inscription read, "During the time he served as U.S. 
president, Mr. Nixon opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations and 
made historic contributions." Luo's inscription expressed his 
deep condolences and sent his best regards to Nixon's family and 
relatives. 
  Also on hand were Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Jiang 
Enzhu, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's 
National People's Congress Zhu Qizhen, Vice-Minister of the 
State Sports Commission Liu Ji and Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor of 
Beijing. 
  Nixon died of a major stroke on the evening of April 22 at 
the Cornell Medical Center in New York at the age of 81. 
  He had always been keen in Sino-U.S. relations and visited 
China on seven occasions. During his presidency he opened the 
door to Sino-U.S. relations together with the late Chairman Mao 
Zedong and the late Premier Zhou Enlai, thus opening up a new 
phase in bilateral ties.
