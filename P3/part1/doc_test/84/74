  [Text] Havana, 1 Jan (PL) -- Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the 
vice president of the Council of Ministers, revealed today that 
during President James Carter's administration Cuba and the 
United States held high-level contacts with a view to initiating 
negotiations. 
  The official disclosed these events in an interview with the 
official GRANMA newspaper. He also said that changes in 
relations between the two countries were unlikely during William 
Clinton's administration. 
  Rodriguez said that "a possible solution to the U.S.-Cuba 
crisis" had been interrupted by Carter's decision to accuse Cuba 
of being responsible for the internal conflict in Zaire, which 
was triggered by armed refugee groups on the border with Angola. 
  He recounted that he was scheduled meet secretly with then 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance at the apartment of Andrew Young, 
then U.S. representative to the United Nations, on the same day 
that hostilities broke out in the African nation. 
  Rodriguez said that Vance was meeting with former USSR 
Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko when Carter gave the speech in 
which he made his charges. Thus, it was the Cuban official who 
informed Vance of the U.S. president's statements when they met. 
  Vance apparently did not know that Carter had decided to 
make 
this announcement; embarrassed, he ended the meeting. The Cuban 
vice president added that it later became known that Cuba had 
had nothing to do with the Zaire events "but the opportunity to 
begin negotiations had passed." 
  Rodriguez indicated that the Clinton administration's 
position is based on the idea that Cuba could collapse in the 
immediate future. It is also under pressure from the most 
recalcitrant sectors of the Cuban-American community and its 
allies. 
  He added that the Clinton administration is not being 
pressed 
to make decisions and "that is why it is difficult to expect a 
change in relations between the United States and Cuba." 
  The vice president emphasized that Washington has become 
obstinate in its intent to regain its control over the island. 
He added that the possibility of a new U.S. attack was greater 
during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush. 
  Our land has not had a moment of respite in the enjoyment of 
its independence, he asserted.
