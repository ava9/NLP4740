Like the mythological Egyptian bird that consumed itself by fire and rose 
renewed from its ashes, Richard Nixon is a latter-day phoenix. Defeated by John 
F. Kennedy for the presidency in 1960 and by Pat Brown for the California 
governorship in 1962, Nixon told a press conference: "You won't have Dick Nixon 
to kick around any more." 
</P>
<P>
As so often in his career, his words masked the reality of his actions. He at 
once began working toward the comeback that culminated in his two victorious 
campaigns for the White House in 1968 and 1972. Resigning the presidency in 
1974 rather than face impeachment and conviction for Watergate crimes, Nixon 
began his final battle: the vindication by history. Making the case for himself 
in his 1978 memoirs, he has worked to convince Americans of his greatness as a 
foreign-policy leader and to obscure the truth of Watergate and other 
improprieties by blocking release of documents and tapes that might further 
blight his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
His current campaign enjoys some success. A November, 1988, Louis Harris poll, 
asking a cross section of Americans to rank the last nine Presidents from 
F.D.R. to Reagan in 11 categories, rated Nixon as "best in foreign affairs," 
well ahead of all the others, except Reagan, who was a close second. 
</P>
<P>
Although a decisive plurality of the poll said that Nixon had set the lowest 
moral standards of all these Presidents, he scored better than Johnson, Ford, 
and Carter in several other categories. Having suffered the worst public 
humiliation of any President in U.S. history by resigning from office and 
having continued a spirited fight for vindication, Nixon has partly redeemed 
himself with some Americans who find considerable appeal in a man who doggedly 
struggles to overcome self-inflicted defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Two new biographies by Roger Morris and Stephen Ambrose will undercut Nixon's 
efforts to create a positive historical image. A former member of the State 
Department and the National Security Council, who resigned in protest against 
Nixon's 1970 invasion of Cambodia, Morris has become a prize-winning 
journalist. To be published next month, his massively detailed 900-page book, 
the first of a multi-volume biography, takes the story only through Nixon's 
election as vice president in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The book tells us more about Nixon than most readers would ever care to know, 
but therein also lies its strength. It is the most detailed and authoritative 
reconstruction of Nixon's life and career we have ever had. Building his 
account on materials in 35 archives and from hundreds of oral-history 
interviews, Morris dispassionately recounts the story of Nixon's early life in 
California, at the Duke University law school, in a Whittier law practice, in 
the Navy during World War II, and, above all, in postwar politics. Nixon's 1946 
congressional race against Jerry Voorhis, his role in the Alger Hiss case as a 
member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, his 1950 race for the 
U.S. Senate against Helen Gahagan Douglas, his campaign to become Dwight 
Eisenhower's running mate, and his part in the 1952 presidential election never 
has been told more completely and evenhandedly. 
</P>
<P>
Morris shows a keen understanding of Nixon's strengths and importance as a 
representative American. He describes him as a man of extraordinary diligence 
and determination, with an exceptional feel for public sentiment that propelled 
his meteoric rise in mid-century American politics. In high school, Morris 
writes, Nixon's "grades were nearly perfect. . . . There was a dour fierceness 
of application and ambition about the record." But he struggled with geometry, 
scoring only B's the first two quarters. ". . . When the teacher once presented 
a special problem, promising an A for the next quarter for its solution 
overnight, he worked until 4 a.m., got the grade, and finished the course with 
an A." 
</P>
<P>
His first campaign for a House seat was a microcosm of his capacity to succeed 
in politics. The campaign was "a political balancing act between the warring 
wings of the Republican Party -- a matter of conviction as well as expedience 
and opportunity -- that Richard Nixon was to practice with an almost 
instinctive brilliance throughout his career." No detail that could serve the 
campaign escaped his notice. "So complete was his attention to detail, so 
insistent the control . . . that the candidate himself even decided the precise 
telephone poles and other locations 'where campaign posters should be placed to 
the best advantage.' " He would stand "in the print shop as his political 
pamphlets came off the press, making certain every word and layout was exact." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's genius for reaching a mass audience was demonstrated in his 1952 
"Checkers" speech defending himself against charges of a secret campaign slush 
fund used for personal ends. Speaking to more than 60 million people, about 
half the possible TV viewers in the United States, Nixon gave a performance 
that Hollywood mogul Darryl F. Zanuck called "the greatest production I have 
ever seen." Moving some people to tears and generating 4 million overwhelmingly 
favorable telegrams, letters, cards, and calls, Nixon convinced Americans not 
of his innocence but of his shared identity with them as a hard-working, 
ordinary fellow who loved his country and dreamed of a better life for himself 
and his family. In Morris' words: "For a single dramatic half-hour in the 
autumn of 1952 -- as for so many smaller audiences before and after -- Richard 
Nixon had become the quintessential American politician." 
</P>
<P>
It is not Nixon's political astuteness that echoes through Morris' book, 
however, but his all-consuming ambition, his determination to win at any price. 
Fellow students and teachers at Whittier High remember his debating tactics and 
race for student-body president as the actions of someone ready to rationalize 
bad means for reaching self-serving goals. The same attitude dominated his 
later political career, especially the Alger Hiss case, which did so much to 
make Nixon a prominent national figure. His objective never was to weigh the 
evidence in a search for the truth but to make his reputation by getting Hiss. 
At a crucial moment in 1948, when it appeared that the case against Hiss for 
stealing government documents and lying about his actions seemed about to 
collapse, Nixon threw a private fit. "Oh, my god, this is the end of my 
political career," he shrieked. "My whole career is ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ambrose's biography, the second of a three-volume work, begins in 1962 
when, he says, Nixon launched his second drive for the presidential nomination, 
and ends with his reelection to the White House in 1972. Ambrose, a 
distinguished professor of history at the University of New Orleans and author 
of a fine two-volume biography of Eisenhower, has produced a study that is 
equally damning of Nixon but less convincing than Morris' book. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose's biography rests on a more limited body of sources. Although he makes 
extensive use of Nixon's jottings on news summaries compiled during his first 
term and of some letters and memos in his presidential papers, the book largely 
rests on printed materials, memoirs and secondary accounts by journalists. 
Ambrose has also done some interviewing, but much less than Morris. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a book that does not take us much beyond what we already knew 
about Nixon in the decade after 1962. Ambrose says that "It is not news that he 
(Nixon) was devious, manipulative . . . passionate in his hatreds, 
self-centered, untruthful, untrusting, and at times so despicable that one 
wants to avert one's eyes in shame and embarrassment. Nor is it news that this 
same man could be considerate, straightforward, sympathetic and helpful, or 
that he was blessed with great talent, a superb intellect, an awesome memory, 
and a remarkable ability to see things whole, especially on a global scale and 
with regard to the world balance of power. If he was the ultimate cynic, a 
President without principle in domestic politics, he was also the ultimate 
realist, a President without peer in foreign affairs." 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting feature of Ambrose's book is the extent to which he 
contradicts his own assertion about Nixon's matchless leadership in world 
affairs. Ambrose has warm praise for Nixon as a President with a world view who 
understood the need for a "new era of negotiations" with the Russians and the 
Chinese. Indeed, Nixon had the imagination and foresight to do what no other 
post-1945 President had done -- seek detente with the Soviets and normal 
relations with China that became essential steps in the developing end to the 
Cold War. Yet Ambrose is sharply critical of Nixon's slow withdrawal from 
Vietnam, which cost so many additional lives for no productive end. He also 
faults Nixon's policies toward Cambodia, Chile, India and Pakistan, describing 
them as leaving a legacy of serious unresolved problems.

In time, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, every scoundrel becomes a hero. Richard 
Nixon is not there yet.
