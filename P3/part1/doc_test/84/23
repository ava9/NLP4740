On June 4, 1991, the National Archives and Records Administration released a group of Nixon White House tape recordings.
The release consisted of approximately 60 hours of tape recordings previously subpoenaed by the Watergate Special
Prosecution Force (``WSPF'') during its investigations, as well as tape transcripts located among the records of
the WSPF. Approximately 121/2 hours of these tape recordings had previously been played in open court in

and released, 45 FR 26823 (April 21, 1980); however, the balance of approximately 471/2 hours had not been released
previously. This 1991 release of tape recordings and accompanying transcripts, processed in accordance with the
decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Archives and Records Administration decided that the best way to proceed with the release of the body
of the 4,000 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings was to release Watergate-related segments of the tape recordings
in small monthly groupings on an ongoing basis. The first of these releases was noticed in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 2, 1993, 58 FR 17433, and took place on May 17, 1993, without any objections from affected parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second and third releases were noticed in the

 on June 3, 1993, and July 2, 1993, to take place on July 15, 1993, and August 26, 1993, respectively. 58 FR 31548 (June
3, 1993); 58 FR 35983 (July 2, 1993). Former President Nixon raised certain procedural objections to these proposed
releases. When the National Archives and Records Administration rejected former President Nixon's contention
that those releases should not go forward, he sought relief in the courts. On August 9, 1993, Judge Royce Lamberth of
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order preliminarily enjoining the National
Archives and Records Administration from carrying out the releases of allegedly Watergate-related tape recordings
scheduled for August 13 and 26, 1993, pending (1) Segregation and return to former President Nixon of all private or
personal conversations on the tape recordings; and (2) processing of the tape recordings before release to the public
as a single ``integral file segment.'' The Court's ruling relied on the terms of the current PRMPA regulations, and
on the terms of a draft processing manual which the National Archives and Records Administration's Nixon Presidential
Materials Project (``Nixon Project'') has used in preparing Nixon Presidential materials for public disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several respects, which will be discussed in greater detail below, the current regulations and the Nixon Project
draft processing manual, especially as interpreted preliminarily by the court in the context of the preliminary
injunction, do not reflect what the National Archives and Records Administration has come to recognize as the most
appropriate fashion in which to process and release the Nixon White House tape recordings. Therefore, the National
Archives and Records Administration proposes certain amendments to the current regulations (which will have the
effect of altering the draft processing manual) to balance the National Archives and Records Administration's responsibility
to provide public access to the tape recordings, including those segments relating to Watergate, at the earliest
reasonable date, with the need to protect the rights of former President Nixon and other affected parties.

Section 1275.16(b) is amended to make clear that no physical portion of the original tape recordings shall constitute
private or personal material, and therefore no portion of those original recordings is to be returned to former President
Nixon or to any other affected party. The PRMPA requires the Archivist to maintain those original tape recordings,
whether or not they contain personal conversations; as a result, the amendment to &sect;1275.16(b) states that the
original tape recordings constitute Presidential historical materials.
