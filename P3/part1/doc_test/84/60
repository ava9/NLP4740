  [Text] Dresden, 4 Feb (DPA) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president 
of the Cuban National Assembly who is in this city today at the 
end of his official three-day visit to Germany, has said that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton has moderated the policy on Cuba 
that the George Bush administration handed down to Clinton 
through the Torricelli Law. 
  After expressing to his German hosts measured optimism about 
the possibility of the U.S. embargo against Cuba being eased 
during the latter half of Clinton's current term, or his second 
term should he be reelected, Alarcon told DPA that Havana has 
observed Washington becoming more flexible in the practical 
enforcement of the strict embargo. 
  Alarcon, a former foreign minister and deputy foreign 
minister, was until today guest of Rita Sussmuth, president of 
the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). Alarcon met with 
representatives of the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
federal deputies, and members of the regional parliaments of 
Bremen and Saxony in the former East Germany. 
  Alarcon believes an eventual easing of the U.S. embargo 
against Cuba, which has lasted more than three decades, can take 
place in Clinton's second term, because the issue is still too 
heavily loaded, ideologically speaking, and the U.S. 
Administration still does not have enough latitude to make a 
political decision of this nature. 
  Alarcon, who did not conceal from his hosts Cuba's interest 
in the current PRC model of evolution toward political 
liberalization by way of cautious economic reforms, nevertheless 
said that so far there has been no direct official contact 
between the U.S. and Cuban governments. [sentence as received] 
  According to Alarcon, Havana observes "the U.S. Government's 
language is changing." For example, Cuban authorities have 
taken notice of "a reiterated statement by the U.S. State 
Department and Assistant Secretary of State Watson, saying that 
U.S. territory will not be permitted to be used for terrorist 
activities or violence against Cuba." 
  Alarcon said: "This is what the American Neutrality Act 
states, and this is normal in international law. But the United 
States never said this during the past 12 years of Republican 
administrations. This is something we cannot overlook." 
  He added that "the U.S. Government's position during the 
neuritis epidemic in Cuba" must also be considered in this 
regard. Washington "did not object to several U.S. scientists 
from National Institute of Health traveling to Cuba." The U.S. 
scientists "cooperated with Cuban authorities and made very 
unbiased remarks about Cuba when they concluded their work." 
The experts "returned to the United States, but kept in touch 
with Cuban researchers. The reason for this is still being 
discussed and pondered. It is interesting to note this, because 
the neuritis epidemic can occur elsewhere." 
  Alarcon declined to comment on the lifting of the U.S. 
embargo on Vietnam after 20 years. He also elected not to imply 
that he can base his moderate optimism concerning Cuban-U.S. 
relations on this decision. 
  The Clinton era represents for the United States a great 
leap 
ahead, since the generation that served in World War II and 
experienced "McCarthyism" until the time of the young men who 
either fought or refused to enlist in the Vietnam war. [sentence 
as received] 
  The personalities who were active during the administrations 
of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson have disappeared or 
retired, while some who belonged to Jimmy Carter's time are 
still alive. Nevertheless, most members of the Clinton team are 
much younger people, unrelated to active politics since they 
were in the opposition during the quarter century of the 
Republican Party's several terms in the White House -- since 
Richard Nixon in 1968. 
  All this can explain to Cuban authorities the whys and 
wherefores of the transformations under way today in the United 
States, and why the Clinton administration has established a 
policy allowing women and Hispanics to hold positions of 
responsibility.
