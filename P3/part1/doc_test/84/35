NIXON'S VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, ad nauseam, Nixon is being "rehabilitated" by his nostalgic 
admirers and a bemused press. Conrad, as usual, is right on target in 
satirizing this latest resurrection of our disgraced ex-President. 
</P>
<P>
What puzzles me, as a retired Foreign Service officer, is Nixon's reputation as 
a foreign policy guru, which rests largely on the puffery that surrounded his 
not-so-surprising restoration of relations with China. Otherwise, he has been 
associated with some notable fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
As President Eisenhower's reputed expert on Southeast Asia, our then-vice 
president pushed for us to replace the French when they were forced out of 
Vietnam by the 1954 debacle of Dien Bien Phu, while he ignored any possible 
understanding with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
Later, his decision to bomb Cambodia appears to have been part of a sequence of 
disasters that led to the genocidal scourge of Pol Pot. Was the slaughter of 
millions of Cambodians part of his "peace with honor"? 
</P>
<P>
On Iran, did Nixon foresee that our overthrow of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh in 
1953 might eventually lead to the fanatical revolution of 1979? What led him, 
as President, to believe that the vain, mercurial shah could be our effective 
surrogate in maintaining peace in that troubled area? 
</P>
<P>
Has Nixon ever regretted our 1954 ouster of the leftist Arbenz government of 
Guatemala, which led to a series of brutal military dictatorships and to the 
loss of more than 100,000 lives? 
</P>
<P>
The same deviousness and amorality that entangled Nixon in Watergate 
characterized his foreign policy maneuvers. By using his national security 
adviser, Henry Kissinger, as de facto secretary of state, he was able to avoid 
Congress' traditional scrutiny of cabinet members. This finally led him to use 
the NSC for action purposes, as in the CIA's apparently successful overthrow of 
Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, which almost certainly became the 
precedent for the supreme folly of Irangate. 
</P>
<P>
This institutional perversion persists, with President Bush frequently relying 
on his NSC staff to perform missions that should logically fall to our resident 
ambassadors or to the secretary of state and his deputies.
