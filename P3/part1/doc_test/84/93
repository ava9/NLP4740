NIXON LEFT HIS MARK, AND IT IS ALL AROUND US

By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris' Richard Milhouse Nixon: The Rise of an American 
Politician, 1913-1952, the first of a three-volume biography, will be published 
this fall by Henry Holt &amp; Co.

It was a dramatic, unparalleled scene in the history of American politics. The 
choked, emotional farewell to the last of the loyal White House staff, the red 
carpet rolled out to the waiting helicopter on the South Lawn. Then, with a 
last characteristic wave at the door, Richard M. Nixon, who had been with us 
somewhere on the national stage for so long, was suddenly gone. The 37th 
President of the United States had resigned from office under the threat of 
impeachment, soon to be saved from a likely criminal conviction only by the 
controversial pardon by his successor and old friend, Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, it seems almost surreal, this constitutional crisis of the 
century. In part, of course, time has blunted and blurred the images. And Nixon 
himself, as he did again and again in his remarkable career, has staged 
something of another skillful and fiercely determined comeback in public 
relations. After the bipartisan ineptitude and relative dimness of his 
successors, there is a sort of nostalgia for his old diplomatic initiatives 
toward the Soviet Union or China, and even what seemed clear villainy 15 years 
ago now takes on the soft tint of competence and decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the dramatic Nixon foreign policy does not deserve careful study -- 
though there may have been, as Tallulah Bankhead used to say, less here than 
meets the eye. His mutual propping with Leonid S. Brezhnev's corrupt and 
sclerotic government may only have delayed and obstructed the liberalization we 
now see unfolding in the Soviet Union, and the savage repression in China shows 
all too clearly the character of the regime he embraced so expediently in 
Beijing in 1972. It was also Nixon who instituted in earnest the covert little 
Punic and proxy wars that now pass for our foreign policy in the Third World, 
who presided over the first, perhaps fatal decline in our international 
competitiveness and currency strength, whose refracted Realpolitik with Henry 
Kissinger roundly ignored the vast problems of poverty, migration, and 
environmental decay that threaten to overwhelm statesmanship in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, his proteges, and his mark, are everywhere -- from a defeated 
young Texas politician named George Bush whom he rescued from oblivion in 1970 
and named to the U.N. ambassadorship, to Chief Justice William Rehnquist and 
his conservative majority on the Supreme Court, or to the former Kissinger 
aides and clients who now crowd the upper levels of the National Security 
Council and the State Department, guiding the otherwise-frozen hands of an 
uncertain new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the real danger to memory and history is not in romanticizing Nixon's 
global strategies, or mistaking his considerable patronage. The problem goes 
much deeper, coming home to the nation and body politic we truly are -- and to 
how much this once-disgraced, fallen President made us so. 
</P>
<P>
For it was also Nixon who largely wrought the Republican revolution in the 
South and the West, and thus redrew the map of America's Electoral College 
politics that gave us Ronald Reagan and George Bush. More than any other 
politician of the era, it was Nixon who led and rode the huge tides of 
anti-communist fear and reaction, and the great-if-furtive counterrevolution 
against the racial and social upheavals of postwar America -- all of which have 
driven the Democratic Party into a political wilderness from which it has yet 
to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
And back further still, in the brilliant and tireless young politician he was 
at his beginnings, it was Richard Nixon who represented above all the elemental 
forces of corporate power, finance, agribusiness and energy, who epitomized the 
manipulative might of the media in politics, who in California in so many ways 
pioneered the use and masking of great money in political campaigning. And, 
above all, who artfully tapped the insidious prejudice, vengeance and smear 
mentality in American politics long before Bush ran his effective ads against 
Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon is never going to be the most beloved American President of the 
century. But he is going to turn out to be the quintessential politician of the 
epoch, and most of what he really embodied is in the ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long time since they rolled up that red carpet from the departing 
helicopter, but he is with us still. And in the end, in ways yet little 
understood, he has probably won.
