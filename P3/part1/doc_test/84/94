Russia Could Change If Russian Authorities Follow Opposition's 
Foreign Policy Recipe"] 
  [Text] Washington-Moscow -- "The day when Russia joins the 
`Partnership for Peace' program will be a great day for Europe." 
Bob Graham, Democratic senator from Florida and a close friend 
of President Clinton, is convinced that Russia will continue to 
be one of the administration's main foreign policy concerns in 
the foreseeable future. 
  During a trip to Washington organized by the U.S. NATO 
mission for journalists from 22 European countries, the subject 
of Russian-U.S. relations overshadowed all other issues, with 
the sole exception of the Bosnia crisis. Officials and experts 
from the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security 
Agency, and the Congressional Research Service made no secret of 
the fact that many points of concern to Washington have recently 
emerged in Russian policy. 
  First and foremost there is Moscow's skepticism about the 
"Partnership for Peace" program. Russia's unexpected decision 
to delay joining the "Partnership" indefinitely was a nasty 
surprise for the Americans. When nationalists and Communists in 
the Duma oppose military cooperation with the West, that 
surprises nobody, but it is quite another matter when the 
president and defense minister start adopting that stance.... 
  Washington finds the arguments put forward by Moscow against 
"Partnership" less than convincing. "Russia is demanding 
special status in relations with NATO. But it will have such a 
status," was the assurance given by a high-ranking Pentagon 
official who was speaking to journalists, like most officials, 
anonymously. "Perhaps not everyone in Moscow realizes that 
`Partnership for Peace' is actually not one partnership but 
many. Each side implements its own cooperation 
program with NATO. When Russian colleagues tell me that they do 
not want to be playing the same role as Albania, I say: `Look 
at the map. Yours is a huge country with a very powerful army, 
you are a nuclear power. Who would think of comparing you with 
Albania?' Naturally, we will have an entirely special 
relationship with Russia -- a closer and a detailed 
relationship. I see no serious reason why Russia should 
renounce participation in `Partnership' and deliberately condemn 
itself to isolation." 
  In the Americans' opinion, Moscow's vacillation over both 
cooperation with NATO and the much-troubled Russian-U.S. joint 
maneuvers is due to domestic factors. Following the reformers' 
failure in the December elections, Yeltsin has changed the 
emphasis in foreign policy, espousing some of the opposition's 
ideas. These include -- however unpalatable it may be for 
Washington to recognize it -- the arbitrary anti-Americanism of 
the Russian "patriots." 
  Researchers from the "security policy research center," who 
regularly send reports to the White House, Congress, and the 
State Department, are convinced that since December the Russian 
authorities have lost their reformist potential, that a rapid 
retreat into the past has begun, and that the world is on the 
threshold of a new era of confrontation between Washington and 
Moscow. Frank Gaffney, one of the center's leading experts, 
believes that it would be a mistake to involve Russia in 
"Partnership for Peace" and that the program in general is of no 
value to the West -- the functions of restraining Russian 
expansionism could be successfully handled by NATO. Former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former National Security 
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski are of a similar opinion. 
  The White House is in no hurry to follow their 
recommendations. Washington's policy toward Moscow is 
determined to a considerable extent by Strobe Talbott, deputy 
secretary of state, who is a Yeltsin supporter and believes that 
Russian reform will succeed. It is premature to talk about a 
revision of the U.S. approach to Russia. In the opinion of most 
of the specialists to whom I talked during the trip, the Clinton 
administration has staked too much on Yeltsin to suddenly 
deprive him of support and recognize that the tone in Russia is 
now set by the nationalists rather than the democrats. "We are 
proceeding on the basis that the Russian Government is keeping 
faith with the reform policy, does not plan to implement an 
imperial policy toward its neighbors, and is geared to 
cooperation with the United States," a high-ranking State 
Department official stated. 
  Concern over Russia's relations with the other republics of 
the former USSR was repeatedly evident during my meetings with 
U.S. officials. They clearly indicated that, if Yeltsin and his 
entourage follow the hard-line opposition's recipe in their 
foreign policy (above all in resolving territorial disputes with 
neighbors), the Clinton administration's approach to Russia 
could change. The Americans consider the Kremlin's increasing 
pressure on the Baltic states and the troop withdrawal delay 
unacceptable, and, in the event of any infringement of Ukraine's 
territorial integrity, Senator Graham has promised to employ 
"effective economic and political measures." 
  But as far as the stepping up of the Kremlin's role in the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia is concerned, none of the people 
I spoke to condemned Moscow -- as if tacitly admitting that the 
states which have taken shape there form part of its sphere of 
special interest. No longer seeing Russia as the strategic 
enemy of the United States, U.S. diplomats clearly prefer 
Moscow's influence in these explosive regions to be strengthened 
in preference to that of fundamentalist Iran or other Islamic 
states.
