Testifying in court for the first time about national security matters, former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told a jury Monday that while he never 
knew the names of intelligence sources, "to the best of my knowledge" former 
Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai was not a CIA agent. 
</P>
<P>
But in carefully measured testimony, Kissinger never said, unequivocally, that 
Desai was not an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger's unprecedented federal court appearance came in a libel suit Desai 
filed against journalist Seymour Hersh for assertions in his 1983 book, "The 
Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House." In a chapter dealing with 
India, Hersh wrote that Desai was a paid CIA agent who provided information on 
plans and policies of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's 
Administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks $100 Million in Damages 
</P>
<P>
Desai, now 94 and in poor health in Bombay, called Hersh's report "a scandalous 
and malicious lie." The former Indian politician, who also served as finance 
minister and deputy prime minister, is asking for $100 million in damages 
claiming the book brands him as a traitor to India. 
</P>
<P>
Hersh, who won a 1970 Pulitzer Prize for disclosing the My Lai massacre during 
the Vietnam War, sat quietly, eyes fixed on Kissinger. Hersh, who has written 
extensively on the American intelligence community, maintains that he has 
multiple confidential sources for his claim and believed the information was 
true when he wrote the chapter. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Norgle ruled last week that Hersh did not have 
to reveal his sources. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes testy and sometimes witty, Kissinger was a reluctant witness who had 
fought the subpoena served on him two weeks ago when he was giving a speech to 
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Outside the courtroom, he told 
reporters that he had an agreement with lawyers that if he gave a deposition in 
the case, he would not have to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not eager to testify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who was accompanied by his wife, Nancy, said this was only his 
second time he had ever appeared in court. The first time, he said, he was a 
witness for Mrs. Kissinger, who was accused of assaulting a supporter of 
political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche at an airport terminal. She was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
In court Kissinger discussed information the United States received in the days 
leading up to the 1971 India-East Pakistan war that led to the formation of the 
new country of Bangladesh and acknowledged that there was reliable information 
coming from within the Indian government. 
</P>
<P>
Before giving his deposition in the case, Kissinger said he checked with former 
CIA director Richard Helms. Kissinger, responding to a question by Hersh's 
lawyer, Bernard Nussbaum, said he told Helms that "to the best of my belief Mr. 
Desai was not an agent. And he (Helms) said, 'you are on safe ground saying 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Desai's lawyer, Cyriac Kappil, asked Kissinger if he ever had a reason to 
believe Desai was an agent in 1969, '70 and '71, Kissinger said: "I have no 
such reason to believe that." 
</P>
<P>
The former national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and 
secretary of state under both Presidents Nixon and Gerald R. Ford could not, 
however, identify names of sources of information. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never briefed as to names, but we were briefed as to categories," 
Kissinger said. However, he said that he could not discuss what those 
"categories" were. "That gets us into classified areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attests to Unknown Sources 
</P>
<P>
But Kissinger also testified that the U.S. did have sources unknown to him who 
were providing high-level intelligence from within the Indian government. 
</P>
<P>
After his three hours on the witness stand, Kissinger told reporters that he 
too considered filing a libel suit against Hersh after reading portions of the 
book but decided against it because of the time that it would take. And he said 
he hoped this was his last association with the journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be just as happy if I never heard of Mr. Hersh again," Kissinger said. 
"I'm not looking for an opportunity to prove points against Mr. Hersh. Frankly, 
the quicker he goes out of my life the happier I'll be." 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last several more days. 
</P>
<P>
Desai's lawyers filed their suit in Chicago citing a tradition of filing 
defamation actions in the home town of the defendant. While he was born in 
Chicago, Hersh no longer lives here.
