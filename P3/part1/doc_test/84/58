</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look for a Kitchen Cabinet from George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush takes the oath of office today, he will become the first new 
President in many years who will not have an inner circle of advisers -- former 
business associates, card-playing cronies, Army buddies and the like -- who 
serve as an informal but indispensable corps of non-governmental advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, his two predecessors, Bush has himself 
been a Washington insider for most of the past two decades. He has retained a 
few friends from his earlier days as a Texas oilman -- notably James A. Baker 
III, Nicholas F. Brady and Robert A. Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
But they will be in the real Cabinet, not the Kitchen Cabinet: Baker as 
secretary of state, Brady as Treasury secretary and Mosbacher as Commerce 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The close associates whom Bush has developed more recently have worked in his 
vice presidential office and on his presidential campaign, and they too will be 
part of the government. These include C. Boyden Gray, formerly counsel to the 
vice president and soon to be chief White House counsel; David Bates, deputy 
chief of the vice president's staff and soon to be Cabinet secretary; Chase 
Untermeyer, a longtime personal aide who is soon to be personnel director, and 
Andrew Card, a campaign operative who will be a top deputy to the White House 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any evidence so far of any kind of insiders' group," said 
Alexander B. Trowbridge Jr., head of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, a 
longtime acquaintance of Bush's from the business world and a former Commerce 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflection of Style 
</P>
<P>
"All the people he's picked for the main economic policy areas seem to have a 
longstanding close relationship of trust with George Bush," Trowbridge said. 
"These are people he's been talking to for years, and they've been on a 
first-name basis with him for years. But they also know their way around 
Washington and the ways of government. That makes a potent combination, and we 
haven't had that for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a distinct outside advisers clique is a reflection of Bush's 
management style. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush wants another viewpoint on an issue, he is more likely to call on a 
wide array of acquaintances than a few longtime cronies, those close to him 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very open and approachable person," said Richard Rahn, chief economist 
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and husband of Bush's key speech writer, Peggy 
Noonan. "He sure makes a lot of phone calls. He touches base with an enormous 
number of people. That's always been his habit, and it was even more so in the 
campaign. We're not going to have one of those presidencies where the man in 
the White House cuts himself off. It won't be like Johnson, Nixon, Carter, even 
Reagan -- who all had their barriers." 
</P>
<P>
If Bush did have a Kitchen Cabinet, former White House National Security 
Adviser Richard V. Allen said in an interview several months ago, "the numbers 
would already be in three digits, maybe four." 
</P>
<P>
That is a sharp departure from his immediate predecessors, who came to the 
White House as outsiders intent on changing the Washington way of government, 
and relied on longtime friends for advice on doing it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Over Appointments 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, when Reagan swept into office promising to curb an entrenched 
government bureaucracy, considerable influence was vested in a shadow cabinet 
of conservative Western businessmen: Holmes Tuttle, Joseph Coors and Justin 
Dart among them -- who provided suggestions and observations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Reagan's pre-inaugural Kitchen Cabinet is believed to have been behind 
some of the new President's initial Cabinet appointments. 
</P>
<P>
During his term, Carter depended heavily on a tight inner circle, largely drawn 
from the political and business world in Georgia, where he had been governor. 
Some critics blamed the outsiders' sway for the problems Carter had in making 
Washington's government machinery work for him. 
</P>
<P>
The last previous elected chief executive before Carter, Richard M. Nixon, 
plotted his moves with a coterie of Southern California public relations men 
and political tacticians who were little known until the Watergate scandal 
exposed his presidency's inner workings.
