  [Text] Naha, June 7 KYODO -- Okinawa Gov. [governor] 
Masahide ta will urge the U.S. Government and military to reduce 
its bases in Okinawa during a 13-day trip to the United States 
starting Thursday [9 June], prefectural officials said Tuesday. 
  Ota, who has visited the U.S. twice over the issue, is 
scheduled to meet commanding officers of the Hawaii-based U.S. 
Pacific Fleet. 
  In Washington he will have talks with representatives for 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary 
William Perry as well as with members of the Senate and House 
Armed Services Committees. 
  Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are 
located in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. Ota hopes 
to convince Washington that a partial withdrawal from Okinawa, 
which would make more land available for nonmilitary purposes, 
will help the prefecture's economic development. 
  On Ota's wish list are the return of the U.S. naval port in 
Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and 
live-ammunition exercises. 
  The governor also plans to meet former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger, who served as the late U.S. President Richard 
Nixon's adviser during the negotiations for the return of 
U.S.-held Okinawa to Japan. 
  Okinawa was reunited with Japan after a 27-year occupation 
on 
May 15, 1972, under the condition that U.S. forces would be 
allowed to continue to use Okinawan bases. 
  Ota plans to ask Kissinger for more details about a secret 
document guaranteeing the reentry of U.S. nuclear weapons and 
transit rights in Okinawa in case of emergency. The pact was 
signed in 1969 by then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and 
Nixon as revealed in a recently published book, the officials 
said.
