  [Text] Former U.S. President Richard Nixon considers Boris 
Yeltsin's reaction to his meetings with Russian opposition 
leaders as an "unfortunate misunderstanding," according to 
Nixon's advisor, Dmitri Simes, who is accompanying him during 
his visit to Russia. Simes made this statement at a news 
conference in Moscow Wednesday [9 March]. 
  "We did not know that permission is needed to hold meetings 
in a democratic country, taking into account the fact-finding 
character of the visit," Simes said. 
  As has already been reported, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin 
said this afternoon that neither he, nor his chief of staff, 
Sergey Filatov, would meet with Nixon. A scheduled meeting 
between the ex-President and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was also not held. 
  "This was even more strange as we have received confirmation 
for the meeting more than once," Simes was quoted as saying. 
  Simes believes that Yeltsin's reaction was provoked by 
distorted information he had been given about Nixon's meetings 
with some prominent figures of the Russian opposition such as 
the leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma, Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, and ex-Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Simes said the meeting with Rutskoy could not be planned 
beforehand as Rutskoy was kept in custody until recently. 
  According to Simes, the goal of the ex-President's visit was 
to familiarize himself with "political forces which have weight 
in Russia and report his findings to the Congress, 
administration and the American public." 
  Simes put a special emphasis on the "private and 
fact-finding 
character" of Nixon's visit to Moscow. At the same time, he 
said that Nixon had a telephone conversation with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton on March 3. He said that Clinton supported the 
idea of the visit and hoped that Nixon would make an 
unprejudiced report on the state of affairs in Russia to his 
administration. 
  According to Simes, Nixon will have to amend his schedule of 
meetings in Moscow. "Under the current circumstances," a number 
of meetings with "many high-ranking members of the Russian 
leadership" who had said they were ready to meet with the 
ex-President would be impossible. 
  At the same time, Simes did not rule out that Nixon could 
meet with the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  Simes said many Russian government officials took part in 
the 
organization of Nixon's visit. The official invitation for 
Nixon to visit Russia was signed by Security Council Secretary 
Oleg Lobov.
