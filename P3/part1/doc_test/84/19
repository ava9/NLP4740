Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger has never taken kindly to
criticism. Now that it is coming via a dead man he is becoming quite
apoplectic.
The object of his ire, expressed in letters to the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal last Friday, is H R Haldeman, whose posthumously published
diaries of President Nixon's first term are as riveting a read as those of
Alan Clark, despite the lack of sex.
It is not so much Haldeman's revelations about linking US withdrawal from
Vietnam to the US electoral timetable which upset the elder statesman. It is
the presumption that Nixon dared to discuss vital policy with Haldeman, his
chief of staff, rather than Kissinger, the national security adviser.
'Nixon was just blowing off steam rather than changing strategy for Haldeman
was concerned with public relations, not substance, and any change in
strategy would have been discussed with me,' says Kissinger.
The problem is that there is a lot more in the Haldeman diaries about 'K'
than Vietnam strategy, such as his bitter rivalry with Bill Rogers, then
secretary of state, who is still alive. The letters columns threaten to be
compelling reading in the weeks ahead.
