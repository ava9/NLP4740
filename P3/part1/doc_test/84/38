MR Lawrence Eagleburger, known to all as Larry, does not exactly fit the
popular image of a US secretary of state, forever on shuttle diplomacy,
smoothly speaking in subtle nuances, and frequently at war with thenational
security adviser in the White House.
He is 61, overweight, a chainsmoker afflicted by circulatory and respiratory
ailments, and walks with a cane. He is also blunt, funny and, above all, a
professional diplomat. He is the first career foreign service officer to
have become deputy secretary of state, albeit after having left to work for
Henry Kissinger and Associates from 1984-89.
Mr Eagleburger has not been a member of the inner circle of advisers to
President George Bush and Mr James Baker, who have formulated US foreign
policy. His main role as deputy has been day-to-day departmental management,
with a special focus on subjects in which Mr Baker was known to be less
interested, such as Haiti and, as often as not in the last year, Yugoslavia.
He joined the foreign service in 1957 and became Dr Kissinger's right hand
in the White House of President Richard Nixon's first term before rising to
the ambassadorship to Yugoslavia in 1977-80.
The intertwined connections with Dr Kissinger and Yugoslavia are the most
controversial aspects of Mr Eagleburger's career. His closeness to Marshal
Tito and the Serbian political hierarchy is seen as one reason why the US
was slow to wake up to the profound, now tragic, changes in what was
Yugoslavia. He recently admitted that he misjudged the character of Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman.
His appointment now as acting secretary, through Mr Baker's move to head the
White House staff, means he will not be subject to Congressional
confirmation. The Bush campaign had made no secret of its wish to avoid,
before the US presidential election in November, hearings on what was
Yugoslavia.
As caretaker, however, his chances of making an independent mark are
limited, with Mr Baker still in effective control from his new perch.
