<P>
Beneath the Bush Administration's determination to stick with defense 
secretary-designate John Tower to the end, there is a lively but 
still-unofficial debate over who will be next if Tower goes down in defeat on 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, said sources close to the Administration, is not only who the best 
candidate is to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and reform, 
but how the President should respond to the Senate in the wake of a repudiation 
of Tower, his first choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Directions 
</P>
<P>
Should Bush's next pick be someone designed to please the very lawmakers who 
are bent on dealing his Administration a harsh political blow in its infancy? 
Or should the President use the opportunity to show Congress who's boss? 
</P>
<P>
The debate has split Republican strategists, and White House insiders suggest 
the rift is reflected among Bush's inner circle of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The range of candidates whose names are now circulating is broad. 
</P>
<P>
There is a trio of former defense secretaries -- Republicans Donald H. Rumsfeld 
and James R. Schlesinger and Democrat Harold Brown. 
</P>
<P>
There is another former lawmaker -- Jack Edwards, the Alabama Republican who 
voluntarily gave up a congressional seat and recently co-chaired a commission 
recommending the closing of obsolete military bases. And there is a pair of 
retired military officers already in the Administration -- Adm. James D. 
Watkins, Bush's energy secretary, and Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the President's 
national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the White House has brooked no public discussion from its ranks about 
possible replacements, wary of undercutting the already hard-pressed lobbying 
effort to keep Tower's chances alive. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any list of candidates exists, one Bush Administration official 
said flatly: "None. Zero. None." 
</P>
<P>
But another Administration official familiar with the process said: "It's 
absolutely foolish not to be considering alternatives and considering people 
for these priority positions . . . I'm sure it's being discussed in little 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Melvin R. Laird, a former Richard M. Nixon Administration defense secretary who 
has advised Bush on transition matters, acknowledged that "advice to the 
President has been divided" over how long to stick with Tower and to whom to 
switch if the expected Senate rejection comes this week or next. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say there is some support for Bush making his next move a defiant one, 
reasserting his primacy over national security issues with a Tower-Scowcroft 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
Under that scenario, Scowcroft would slide over to the top Pentagon post and 
Tower would become national security adviser, a job that does not require 
Senate confirmation. That would allow Bush to keep Tower in a key policy post 
despite the Democrats' snub and at the same time not risk a confirmation 
backlash against Scowcroft, who is widely respected by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republican strategists said the idea has been discussed within the 
Administration, but acknowledged there is disagreement on its wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Such a stroke is "the only thing you could do to save political face" after an 
embarrassing, personal defeat, said one Administration official, adding: "What 
do you do when this guy, your friend, is getting clobbered?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush, while refusing to discuss any second choices, has fed the speculation 
about such a counterpunch nomination with his angry rhetoric on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush 'Wants' Tower 
</P>
<P>
There is "the right of the President to have -- historical right -- to have who 
he wants in his Administration," Bush said in his press conference Tuesday. "I 
want him." And he could have Tower -- as national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
But other prominent Republicans said they fear such a ploy would only infuriate 
Democrats and provoke them to paralyze future Administration legislative 
efforts that will require bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
Should Bush choose instead to appease his congressional opponents in an effort 
to restore bipartisan cooperation, other options might be more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the center of the Democratic effort to defeat Tower, 
said last week that there are "all sorts of people" who have strong national 
security credentials, and no heavy burden of allegations, who would pass 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
Making the same point, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) cited Rumsfeld and 
Schlesinger as prime choices, adding: "If the President sends another name up 
here, it'll be confirmed by a heavy majority." 
</P>
<P>
Such a choice by the President might fall short of a strong statement, however, 
and within Bush's circle of advisers those particular men have some problems. 
In January, Schlesinger's reputation as an acerbic intellectual with 
questionable political loyalties helped cost him the job of energy secretary in 
the Bush Cabinet. Schlesinger had served as defense secretary in the Nixon and 
Gerald R. Ford administrations and as energy secretary for Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Rumsfeld, while a Bush adviser in the final phases of the 1988 campaign, began 
the race in the camp of Bush's chief rival, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a fact that 
Laird said has weighed against him. Moreover, sources say that Bush's relations 
with Rumsfeld, who is now a Chicago-based investment banking adviser, remain 
strained from bureaucratic battles waged when Bush was CIA director and 
Rumsfeld secretary of defense during the Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Laird said he thinks President Carter's defense secretary, Harold 
Brown, would be a good choice. "Brown is a very strong national security 
advocate who understands the Pentagon very well. He's not a partisan person 
when it comes to defense." 
</P>
<P>
A number of other names have surfaced from the ranks of politics and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Donald B. Rice, president of the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp., would be 
unlikely to face a challenge from Nunn, the leader among Democrats in defense 
issues. Rice has been an informal adviser to Nunn as well as a golfing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Drew Lewis, whose name was floated for the top Pentagon job before Tower was 
named, is a favorite candidate among those who seek a tough budget-cutter and a 
hands-on manager with business experience. Lewis, a former Ronald Reagan 
Administration transportation secretary, is chief executive officer of the 
Union Pacific Corp. and served recently on the congressionally created National 
Economic Commission that explored methods of reducing the federal budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Law Waiver 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a retired high-ranking Navy officer held in high regard by both 
parties, might be a popular choice for rebuilding a bipartisan spirit. However, 
his choice would require Congress to waive a 1947 law that prohibits retired 
military officers from serving in the senior defense position within 10 years 
of leaving the service. Scowcroft would not face that problem, having left the 
Air Force more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tower, Jack Edwards would bring a knowledge of Congress and an expertise 
in the fine print of the defense budget to the Pentagon's top job. But critics 
say that unlike Tower, Edwards is no grand policy strategist, an important 
trait for that job. 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategists predict that Bush will stick to his Tower pattern by 
choosing someone with broad policy vision who would complement his nominee for 
Pentagon's second-in-charge, Donald J. Atwood, a former General Motors 
executive with strong management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
That might rule out previous runners-up like Martin-Marietta chief executive 
Norman R. Augustine and Alcoa chairman Paul H. O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
But it would allow Bush options for either a defiant gesture or a conciliatory 
one, whichever way Bush decides to play the next round in the Pentagon 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, said one GOP source, Senate Democrats may "rue the day" they 
thought they won the Tower battle.
