PRESIDENT BUILDS NEW PROGRAMS HEADING TO A SECOND HONEYMOON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, after 
he lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White 
House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard M. Nixon, who had encouraged 
the race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations? OK, said Bush, and he launched an 
international career that put him on the road to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White 
House say that he had a different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe 
even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, 
drawing on his days as an oilman and as member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could 
serve the country well if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. 
By fall, he should unveil a plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the 
economy, this is an ideal time to strike. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position 
since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe seemed to liberate him from a 
cautious past. Suddenly he gained his bearings -- with his handling of the 
China crisis, a clean air proposal, blockage of a minimum wage proposal and 
House passage of most of his savings-and-loan bailout. An early June Gallup 
poll showed his popularity climbing 14 points to 70%, highest of the year. And 
that was before his call for cleaner air -- a sure winner. After a dangerously 
slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
He has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in 
public esteem. While the Democrats have now elected stronger leaders in the 
House, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six 
months ago. For the first time since the Vietnam War, the flow of power away 
from the White House to the Congress may end. Ronald Reagan was more formidable 
than Bush in his first year, but he could never reverse the tide. Bush might -- 
if he sets a more ambitious agenda for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
With the tectonic plates shifting in geopolitics, Bush might be tempted to 
spend his time in the diplomatic arena. He clearly feels more at home there. 
And he enjoys the company of his foreign policy team. Recently, he has been on 
the phone as many as a dozen times a day with his pal, Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the United States must pay close heed to the breakup of the communist 
empire, the White House has an equally large stake in troubles brewing back 
home. The U.S. economy may seem strong today -- and the Administration has the 
statistics to prove it -- but, in private, serious thinkers in the government 
admit the foundations are rusting and need repair. America's position as the 
preeminent economic power is eroding. 
</P>
<P>
The case should not be overstated. U.S. workers are still the most productive. 
The U.S. economy remains more than twice the size of the Japanese. During the 
1980s, while the number of jobs in Western Europe increased by two million, the 
United States created nearly 16 million new jobs -- and more than half are 
high-paying. Yet, some basic trend lines are moving in the wrong direction. As 
studies point out, U.S. productivity levels have been rising less rapidly 
during the 1980s than many nations in Asia and Europe. The U.S. savings rate, 
traditionally anemic, has sunk to a level four times below the Japanese. The 
federal debt is now so large that all personal tax collections west of the 
Mississippi were barely enough to pay last year's interest payments on the 
national debt. And where did those payments go? About $30 billion were sent to 
foreign creditors, twice as much as Washington spent on housing in a nation 
where a scandalous number of people sleep on sidewalk grates. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s promise not much better. A private document prepared by the Japanese 
Economic Planning Agency projects the Japanese economy will grow at a rate 
nearly twice that of America's from now through the year 2000, and Japanese per 
capita income will surpass that of the United States. The Japanese also expect 
Western Europe to grow more rapidly than America. Among prominent U.S. 
economists, C. Fred Bergsten now expects that because of the renewed strength 
of the dollar, the U.S. trade deficit will widen to $200 billion a year during 
the early 1990s and overall U.S. debt overseas will exceed $1 trillion by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The perception is now spreading in Asia and Western Europe that the United 
States cannot manage its own affairs. Business leaders return from Japan 
complaining about being treated with a new arrogance. One chief executive 
officer of a major corporation recently visited Tokyo to see old Japanese 
friends from the Harvard Business School. At dinner, he said, they were as 
jovial as in student days, but in their offices the next morning, they were all 
icy condescension and lectured him on U.S. business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Implications stretch far beyond individual relationships. During most of the 
postwar period, the United States called the shots because of its overwhelming 
military and economic might. But as the United States and Soviet Union 
dismantle forces, military strength will no longer command the same obeisance. 
Economic might will be decisive and economic rivalries will displace military 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already moved from clear dominance in the West to a 
position of first among equals. As Bush said in Europe, the United States 
should welcome a sharing of leadership with others. After all, the rise of 
Western Europe and Japan has been a U.S. goal since the war. But sharing No. 1 
is a far cry from being No. 2. Japan and West Germany are already causing 
jitters as they grow more independent. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons both historic and apparently racial, the rise of Japan most upsets 
America. A poll last year found, by 57% to 37%, Americans feel that Japanese 
economic competition poses a greater threat to U.S. national security than 
Soviet military power. In the Pentagon, there are reportedly whispers about 
plans for a potential fight with the Japanese. In a recent Atlantic magazine 
cover article, James Fallows, who has been living in Asia, called for a U.S. 
"containment" policy toward Japan, echoing the famous article George F. Kennan 
wrote four decades ago about the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
These are sentiments that a U.S. President must channel into more constructive 
directions. There are some around Bush who would prefer not to rock the boat. 
They see an economic recovery rolling through its seventh year. So why take on 
a bold project that can misfire? The answer is easy: That's why we have a 
President. His first responsibility is to attend to the nation's largest needs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush would capture the country if he went before a joint session of Congress 
with a plan of economic renewal. Borrowing a title from an organization started 
a few years ago, he could rally the public behind a crusade to "Rebuild 
America." And he could insure Democratic support if he then took Democratic 
congressional leaders along with GOP leaders to Camp David to develop a 
legislative attack. How could the Democrats resist his call to "keep America 
No. 1"? 
</P>
<P>
The summer months provide a useful time for the Bush team to assemble its 
package. As with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan, Bush could call 
on key advisers, headed perhaps by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman, to piece together the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resolution of the Budget Crisis. With tax revenues flowing into Washington 
at an unexpectedly high rate, some congressional leaders believe it may be 
possible to bring the budget deficit down without a tax increase. But inside 
the Administration, skeptics think it will require a combination of higher 
taxes and painful spending cuts to force Bush to break his no-tax pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Bush's stand against higher taxes should give him bargaining 
leverage in persuading congressional Democrats to cut long-term capital gains 
and trim back entitlement programs. Bush can gain more support for a budget 
plan if he earmarks part of the tax increase for education or an anti-drug 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increasing savings and investment. Reducing the deficit will automatically 
increase the country's savings rate. But even then, savings would be too low 
for long-term economic health. While economists dispute how well government can 
lure people to save more, evidence suggests that individual retirement accounts 
have been effective. Two of Bush's top lieutenants, chief economist Michael J. 
Boskin and domestic adviser Roger B. Porter, have studied ways to improve 
savings, and the President should direct them to come up with a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Educational overhaul. Secondary school systems in most major cities have 
collapsed. Parents across the country are looking for help. The Bush 
Administration says it doesn't have any money -- which is true. In the early 
days of the Reagan Administration, however, Education Secretary Terrel H. Bell 
proved a hard-hitting campaign led by a President and fired-up citizens could 
help schools without a lot more cash. If Bush truly wants to become an 
education President, he needs to gear up a massive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strategic industries. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher recognizes 
that the United States must encourage key industries -- especially high 
technology -- that will provide the necessary muscle for new economic growth. 
He is looking at alternatives to spur a high-definition TV industry. Bush ought 
to jump into the middle of this debate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Modernizing transportation. The Government Accounting Office has estimated 
it will cost over $300 billion to renew roads, bridges, airports and other 
sinews of an efficient economy. Bush should ask Transportation Secretary Samuel 
K. Skinner to accelerate current efforts to draw up a national transportation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other candidates for a renewal package: health care, child care 
or a revision of anti-trust laws. But the critical point is for Bush to get 
started. Polls show that by overwhelming majorities, Americans would welcome a 
greater emphasis on domestic needs. The President should direct that energy 
toward a more competitive economy. 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe and Japan are engaged in enormous enterprises to build their 
economies. If the United States coasts, it could drift into potentially 
dangerous splits with both. But if America pulls itself up as well, the three 
forces acting together could create a vast, open market -- with over 600 
million consumers -- that could remake the world.
