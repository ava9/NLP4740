  [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton has declared April 27, Wednesday, a national day of 
mourning for former U.S. President Richard Nixon who died on 
April 22, White House sources said here today. 
  Federal government offices will be closed and there will be 
no mail delivery for the day, the sources said. 
  Clinton has also directed that the U.S. flag, the stars and 
stripes, be flown at half-mast throughout the country and at 
diplomatic and military installations abroad for 30 days. 
  81 year old Nixon, the 37th president of the United States, 
died Friday of a major stroke in a New York hospital. A service 
will be held at 4:00 p.m., U.S. Pacific day-light time, on 
Wednesday at the Richard Nixon Library in his home town of Yorba 
Linda in California State. 
  Clinton, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole 
(Republican), California Governor Pete Wilson (Republican) and 
Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will deliver eulogies 
at the service. 
  Nixon's body will be flown to California on April 26, 
Tuesday, from New York, bypassing Washington and forgoing a 
state ceremony on Capitol Hill.
