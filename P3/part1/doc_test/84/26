  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
denied Thursday [12 May] that Japan had secretly agreed with the 
United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms 
on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian 
allies in times of emergency. 
  "Although former Prime Minister (Eisaku) Sato and U.S. 
President (Richard) Nixon were recently alleged to have signed 
the secret agreement, such a pact does not in fact exist," Hata 
told the House of Representatives plenary session. 
  "My government will firmly continue to live up to Japan's 
three antinuclear principles," Hata said in response to Tomiichi 
Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, 
SDPJ], the nation's No. 2 opposition party. 
  The three principles bar Japan from manufacturing and 
authorizing foreign nations to bring to or store nuclear weapons 
on Japanese soil. 
  Hata was referring to a recent allegation in a book authored 
by Kei Wakaizumi, a former special emissary of Sato, in 
negotiations with the Nixon administration, that led up to a 
1969 accord to return then U.S.-held Okinawa to Japanese 
sovereignty without the presence of nuclear weapons there. 
  Wakaizumi, a former Defense Agency researcher, alleged Sato 
and Nixon signed the top-secret memorandum at the White House on 
November 21, 1969. The memorandum says Japan is aware of U.S. 
expectations for a favorable response to possible U.S. requests 
to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of a contingency. 
  Wakaizumi, who negotiated with then National Security 
Adviser 
Henry Kissinger on behalf of Sato who sought Okinawa's return 
without nuclear arms, quoted Sato as saying, "Because Mr. Nixon 
signed (the memorandum) with his full name, I also signed it 
with my full name." 
  The former lecturer at the Johns Hopkins University said 
Sato 
demanded that the signing be shrouded in secrecy for fear of 
angering Japanese media people, many of whom were then balking 
at the Japan-U.S. security treaty. 
  Murayama told the Diet, "Then the special envoy of Prime 
Minister Sato exposed the secret agreement that authorizes the 
United States to deploy nuclear weapons in times of a 
contingency, which was inked after the announcement of the 
Japan-U.S. communique in November 1969." 
  Hata issued his denial after the SDP leader rapped the 
government for allowing the presence of U.S. military bases in 
Okinawa by referring to the recent crash of two F-15 U.S. jet 
fighters, which Murayama said pained Okinawan residents. 
  Hata also spurned Murayama's demand to immediately resume 
negotiations with North Korea to establish diplomatic ties with 
Pyongyang. 
  "Japan will never normalize its relations with North Korea 
unless the country clears up international suspicions over its 
suspected nuclear weapons program," the premier said. 
  He urged Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Security Council 
presidential statement, which called for North Korea to allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  On a related topic, Hata also said Japan's Constitution 
prohibits the country's involvement in collective security, 
brushing aside concerns that his government may move toward 
active military actions overseas. 
  "I think collective security is beyond the boundary of the 
Constitution, and it is in practice not permitted," he said. 
  "I have no intention to change" the conventional 
interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese 
Government on the issue, he said. 
  He was responding to a query by Yohei Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party, the No. 1 opposition party. 
  Although Japan has the right for collective security in 
terms 
of international law, Hata argued the war-denouncing 
Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum necessary" rights 
for self-defense. 
  Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed 
legislation to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula. 
  The issue requires a "highly political judgment" and "should 
be considered cautiously," he said. 
  The remark is an apparent effort to distance himself from 
some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation 
for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  However, in a reply to Murayama's similar question, Hata 
said, "The government is now considering such legislation to 
eliminate any ambiguities (concerning a response to a 
contingency) as it should appeal to the public to endorse it 
when necessary."
