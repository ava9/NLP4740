JIM MURRAY: RANDOLPH CLEAN-UP INFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Randolph bustled busily into the locker room. Willie Randolph always 
looks busy, a man with a mission. He doesn't walk, he darts. He acts like a man 
who expects a tough day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
He surveyed his locker. It was as neat as a chairman of the board's. Some 
ballplayers' lockers look as if a typhoon just went through. Willie's looks as 
if the janitor just went through. 
</P>
<P>
His shoes have a high polish on them. His uniform gleams white. Willie himself 
always looks as if he just stepped out of the shower. No one can ever remember 
his needing a shave. He wears a shirt and tie. He'd look right at home on Wall 
Street. He seldom raises his voice or gets alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps second base as neat as he is. You'd think second base was the 18th 
green at Augusta. There are never any loose baseballs leaking around the bag 
when Randolph is there. He landscapes it with his spikes as carefully as if he 
were lining up an 18-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, like Maury Wills, never does anything without a purpose. You 
see him now as he goes over a check list to get ready for the night's game. A 
reporter wants a few minutes of his time. Willie glances at his watch. OK, he 
has a few minutes to spare. Then, it's into the training room, out on the 
field, stretching exercises, preparation for the evening's encounter with the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Willie is as programmed as an English butler. Some ballplayers wander around a 
locker room in disarray, as aimlessly as refugees. Not Willie. He acts as if he 
has barely enough time to do what has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
A fly wouldn't light on him. You get the feeling that if Randolph had to slide 
into a base head first, he'd call time to get his shirt changed. And his shoes 
shined. Willie doesn't like to look sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
He plays baseball with the same deft, conscientious attention to detail. You 
get nine innings of impeccable baseball out of Willie Randolph night after 
night. Your money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
In the field, Randolph never seems to stretch or strain or anything frantic. He 
glides. When the ball gets there, he's there. Second base is taken care of. Let 
'em hit it. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many people playing the game today have something in common with Lou 
Gehrig. Willie Randolph does. They were both captains of the Yankees. Gehrig 
was the first. Randolph was the eighth. It is the measure of the esteem with 
which he is held by those who play with him. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers need no reminder. Fans rejoice when their teams sign the 
well-publicized sluggers, the fence-breakers. Pitchers shrug. Pitchers want the 
guys who will turn the double play when they make the batter hit their pitch -- 
the low-and-away breaking ball that will be hit on the ground. Tommy John once 
told a reporter that he signed with the Yankees when he left the Dodgers 
because he had Graig Nettles and Willie Randolph to make sure his good pitches 
became outs. 
</P>
<P>
"I throw ground balls for a living," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
If the public overlooks good fielding, pitchers don't. A .300 hitter may win 
one game for a pitcher a season. A sure-handed fielder can win 20. Randolph 
couldn't play his position any better on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he has never won a Gold Glove. He twice led the league in double plays 
turned, and in 1979 led the league in chances with 846. He made only seven 
errors all last year and had made only five in his first 110 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
He is as finicky about pitches as he is about his shirt collars. He is second 
on the team in bases on balls. Pitchers walk Eddie Murray because they're 
scared of him. Pitchers walk Willie Randolph because he makes them. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing they want to do is walk Willie Randolph. He has stolen 257 
bases. Still, he has walked 1,075 times in his career. If you don't think 
that's a lot, consider that Henry Aaron walked only 1,402 times in his 23-year 
career. And Henry hit 755 home runs. Randolph is 706 behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph led the American League in walks in 1980. He swings at strikes. And 
usually hits them. He struck out only 24 times one year, only 25 another. 
</P>
<P>
When he came over from New York to replace Steve Sax, the best guess in town 
was that he would be booed. Saxie was L.A.'s pet. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody boos Willie Randolph. What's to boo? He shows up on time. He's ready 
to play. He's as fastidious as a scrub nurse, as meticulous as a surgeon. Even 
in the rubber room that is Yankee Stadium, Randolph kept his dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"George (Steinbrenner) and I had our troubles," he acknowledges. "But I always 
figured his office door was open and we could close it and discuss the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner was more used to employees who took their grievances to the 11 
o'clock news, not to him. But that was not Randolph's style. 
</P>
<P>
What no one had to worry about was that he would have trouble adjusting to a 
new double-play partner. Over the years, Randolph has played with 31 
shortstops, including such memorable ones as Jim Mason, Luis Aguayo and Fred 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfredo Griffin is a joy," he says. "He plays the position the way it should 
be played." 
</P>
<P>
So, you have to think, does Willie Randolph. The Dodgers are third in club 
fielding with his glove in there. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph's job is to get on base (192 times, second on the team), score runs 
(second on the team in that) and make sure the other team never gets four outs 
an inning. He does that as well as anyone in the league. And he doesn't even 
spit.
