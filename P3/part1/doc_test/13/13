MELVIN DURSLAG: MAYBE NINE NO-HITTERS ARE JUST RESULTS OF LUCK

To date, scientists in the field have tendered the following explanations for 
the record nine no-hitters dispensed by pitchers in the major leagues this 
year: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ball is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gloves are larger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fences are softer, allowing flyhawks to crash into them and catch balls 
they would have been unable to catch crashing into hard fences. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Talent is diluted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spring training was shortened; batters never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barometric pressures have worked against the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Official scorers are suspect, changing hits to errors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whopping contracts are tempting hitters to go after bad pitches; one 
doesn't get $3 million for walking. 
</P>
<P>
This is a serious matter, especially pertaining to the ball Wade Boggs has 
assayed as an eighth of an inch smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Whipping out his jeweler's glass, Tom Lasorda inspects the ball and reports it 
hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't what he said in 1987 when a record 2,634 home runs were struck. 
By July 1, Mark McGwire alone had hit 28. George Bell had 27. 
</P>
<P>
Through their spokesman, Sparky Anderson, selected for his Churchillian 
eloquence, Lasorda, Whitey Herzog and maybe half a dozen other managers 
announced: 
</P>
<P>
"When certain hitters who are lucky to hit four homers all year have hit 16 by 
the All-Star break, we are not playing with the same ball as before." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt submitted it wasn't the ball at all. It was the growing incidence 
of split-finger fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
"When the split-finger doesn't split, you've got a nothing pitch," Schmidt 
testified. "The split-finger is making hitters rich." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Phil Niekro, a once vaunted warrior, now a coach with Atlanta, credits the 
split-finger for the no-hit epidemic today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the pitch of the age," Phil says. "It fools a lot of batters." 
</P>
<P>
Informed that Boggs sees the baseball as fractionally smaller this year, Niekro 
responds: 
</P>
<P>
"When a ball collapses at the plate or travels 95 (m.p.h.), it seems smaller to 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseballs have been produced since 1977 by Rawlings, which sends 
the materials to a factory in Haiti for assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
Told that voodoo has been practiced for centuries in Haiti, baseball scholars 
tapped the old scalp. Haitians wrapping the balls were giving them the 
spiritual dipsy-do. 
</P>
<P>
Then as fast as it came, the home run explosion vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew why," a Rawlings man explained. "We had switched back to the old 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
"And there actually was no change in baseballs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not. The formula has been the same ever since we started making 
them." 
</P>
<P>
And Rawlings insists that the formula for the balls used in today's no-hitters 
is identical to that the year all the home runs were hit. 
</P>
<P>
So what created that rash of homers in '87? 
</P>
<P>
"Very likely a passing surge of strength on the part of the hitters," the 
Rawlings man answered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, we may be witnessing a passing surge of strength by pitchers. The 
previous record for no-hitters in a season was seven, posted in 1917 when many 
prime hitters had entered the service of their government. 
</P>
<P>
So, you ask, if the hitters entered the service, what were the pitchers doing? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: They were throwing no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
If the Persian Gulf involvement should lead to conscription in America, hitters 
wish to drop the reminder it is the pitchers' turn to go. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all these explanations for no-hitters, but no one mentions luck," 
Niekro says. "I threw a no-hitter against San Diego in 1973. My stuff that day 
was nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"But our second baseman makes a great stop on one play. And, on another, our 
shortstop flags down a tough grounder. The throw is late. They give the 
shortstop an error. It should have been ruled a hit. That's what I mean about 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
He reflects a moment on the no-hit phenomenon, then continues: 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Holtzman threw a no-hitter for the Cubs without striking out a batter. If 
everyone gets wood on the ball, don't you think a pitcher needs luck? And look 
at that Andy Hawkins with the Yankees. He throws a no-hitter this year -- and 
loses, 4-0." 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the Hawkins case was, the ball was so small that day the 
Yankees couldn't field it.
