COMPLAINING DOESN'T HELP DODGERS IN 6-2 LOSS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As predictable as the game-time temperature in the Astrodome, three things 
happened when the Dodgers shared the floor with Houston pitcher Mike Scott 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Scott beat them. The Dodgers accused Scott of scuffing the baseball. Scott 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
This time the score was 6-2, before a crowd of 33,563. This time Scott struck 
out a season-high 11 batters in eight innings, giving up four hits and one run. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, after Scott got his major league-leading 16th victory, the 
shouting was louder than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"If one team complained, it would be different, but everybody in the league 
complains about him scuffing the ball," Dodger shortstop Dave Anderson said. 
"If you are playing him, it's obvious what he does." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kal Daniels: "I'll tell you what, that ball sure does have a lot more 
movement than anybody I've ever faced. The umpires check it, but they don't see 
what we see. They don't see the marks." 
</P>
<P>
In the Astro clubhouse, Scott smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to check the ball, let them check the ball," he said. "They want to 
check me, let them check me. People have checked, and they've never found 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder, what do they say when they beat me? What do they say when they get a 
lot of hits off me? Do they accuse me of anything then?" 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough thing to ask the Dodgers because in 25 decisions against him in 
Scott's career, the Dodgers have only won nine. His career earned-run average 
against them is 2.53, better than against any other team. In this season alone, 
he has beaten them four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said Scott, still smiling, "it seems like the Dodgers complain more 
than anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Astro reliever Dave Smith, who finished the game, took the rebuttal a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers definitely complain more than anybody, they and Montreal are 
probably the only two teams that even complain anymore," he said. "The clubs 
that do well against Mike, they never say anything. Don't you think that's 
funny? 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like the Dodgers come to the park gunned and ready to catch Mike 
Scott cheating." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that worrying about it works against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams that do the best against Mike just try to hit the ball, not wonder 
about whether it will do something funny," Smith said. "And what gets me is, 
90% of the time the Dodgers check his split-finger pitches, not his fastball. 
Why in the heck would he scuff a split-finger pitch that he can throw like he 
does?" 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers admit, they like to collect Scott's pitches. They have even sent a 
boxful of allegedly scuffed baseballs to the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their grandchildren must be playing with them somewhere," Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda said when asked where the baseballs were. 
</P>
<P>
About the scuffing, Lasorda said: "I'm not saying that he does anything, I 
can't prove anything. All I can go by is what my players tell me. And my 
players say yes." 
</P>
<P>
After several of his players checked pitches Wednesday, Lasorda met with home 
plate umpire Bob Davidson to check on a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he couldn't see it," Lasorda said. "But what I've seen of the ball, 
it's difficult to see it, you have to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Other Dodgers agreed that because of what they say are near invisible scuff 
marks, they will never be able to prove their charges against Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"As many times as people have checked him, and found nothing, it would be 
incredible to catch him now," Lenny Harris said. "But I saw something while I 
was standing on second base tonight that made me think. He was throwing balls 
to Billy Bean that, even if he swung, he couldn't get close to them. Pitches 
that were strikes! 
</P>
<P>
"His pitches do so many things, it's like a left-hander throwing them." 
</P>
<P>
Yet realizing the futility of their mission, some Dodgers insist on checking 
Scott anyway, for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Because checking on breaking pitches don't do any good, I'll ask them to check 
him a few times on pitches right down the middle," Kal Daniels said. "No way 
that ball would be scuffed but I figured, it might shake him up a little." 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't shake up very easy," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
In dropping his ERA to 2.44, Scott didn't allow a baserunner until Jeff 
Hamilton singled with two out in the fifth inning. Scott was so shook up by 
that single, he struck out the side in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
He did have trouble in the seventh, after Daniels and Franklin Stubbs singled. 
With two out, Hamilton sent a ball flying toward the left-field corner, but 
Mark Davidson make a leaping grab against the fence to turn a potential 
extra-base hit into an out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dodger starter and loser Fernando Valenzuela gave up nine hits and 
six runs, five of them earned, in 6 2/3 innings. After getting through a shaky 
first three innings, he couldn't survive a shaky Dodger defense in the fourth. 
He gave up three runs, all Houston needed. 
</P>
<P>
The inning wasn't quite what third baseman Hamilton needed. One out after Ken 
Caminiti led off with a double, Rafael Ramirez chopped a ball in front of third 
base while Caminiti was attempting to steal third. Hamilton, after retreating 
to the bag to cover the steal, couldn't react in time to get the grounder and 
throw Ramirez out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to run in two directions at once," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have taken a quick reaction," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
After Davidson was walked, Scott grounded a ball under Hamilton's glove and 
into the left-field corner to score two runs. A third run scored two batters 
later on Craig Biggio's fly-ball out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing up a little bit in case Scott tried something funny," Hamilton 
said of the grounder. "Maybe if I was back, I would have had a better chance. 
It's just the way the year has gone." 
</P>
<P>
Or in the case of the Dodgers vs. Mike Scott, the years. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall missed a second consecutive start Wednesday with a sore back. 
After playing four games in three days on the hard turf in Pittsburgh, Marshall 
has not started in three of the Dodgers' last four games. He took extra batting 
practice with coach Ben Hines Wednesday, still trying to refine a swing that 
will spare his back unnecessary strain. "We're trying different things to 
protect the back," Hines said. . . . The X-rays taken of shortstop Alfredo 
Griffin's right thumb were negative, but Griffin did not play for a second 
consecutive night. "It would be different if the pain stays all the time, then 
I know how to deal with it, but this pain comes and goes," Griffin said. "And 
the thumb is not just hurting, but it is weak." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson left the team for his Detroit area home Wednesday and won't rejoin 
them until this weekend in San Diego. Gibson was placed on the disabled list 
Sunday with sore legs, and could be out for the rest of the season. . . . One 
day after being sent to the bullpen, pitcher Mike Morgan met with Manager Tom 
Lasorda Wednesday and discussed causes for Morgan's recent struggle. Morgan has 
already thrown more innings this season (127 2/3) than all of last season in 
Baltimore (88 1/3). After missing time in 1988 with a sore calf and a toe 
operation, Morgan followed intense weight training program throughout the 
winter before reporting to spring training. "I wonder if my body is paying the 
price for it now," said Morgan, who has lost three consecutive starts and has a 
10.50 ERA during that time. "I'm sure not going to do that weight program this 
off-season." 
</P>
<P>
In a somewhat surprising deal, the Dodgers have traded hard-hitting outfield 
prospect Javier Ortiz to the Houston organization for a player to be named. 
Ortiz, who has reported to Houston's triple-A team in Tucson, had 11 homers and 
36 RBIs for triple-A Albuquerque and was recently a member of the National 
League triple-A All-Star team.
