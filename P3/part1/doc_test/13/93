Jim Gott, who had retired 22 consecutive batters spanning five appearances, 
made a 400-foot mistake on No. 23 in the ninth-inning Friday, giving up Kevin 
McReynolds' second home run of the game to give the New York Mets a 3-2 victory 
over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds' 18th homer, which came on an 0-and-2 pitch, dropped to the Dodgers 
to 6 1/2 games behind the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds, who 
defeated Pittsburgh 4-3. They also fell into a second-place tie with San 
Francisco, the first time they have shared second place since Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had one last threat in the ninth inning. But after Mike Sharperson 
drew a two-out walk from Dwight Gooden and pinch-runner Juan Samuel advanced to 
third on a bloop single by Mickey Hatcher against reliever John Franco, Rick 
Dempsey grounded to shortstop to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers need for the Reds to stumble in their remaining two games against 
the first-place Pirates. After this weekend, the Reds play only 10 of their 
remaining 36 games against teams with .500-plus winning percentages. When the 
Dodgers finish with the Mets this weekend, they play 15 of their final 35 games 
against winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
Before a sellout crowd of 48,358 at Dodger Stadium, Gott had relieved Ramon 
Martinez to start the eighth with the score tied 2-all, and had retired five 
consecutive hitters before McReynolds, who had homered in the fifth, completed 
his second multi-homer night in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden gave up six hits and struck out 11 while Martinez struck out only five. 
Gooden is 13-1 against the Dodgers in 18 career starters. He has not lost to 
them since May 25, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets had taken a 2-0 lead against Martinez in the top of the fifth inning 
on McReynolds' 17th homer and an RBI single by Dave Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers countered with a run in the bottom of the fifth against Gooden on 
Jose Offerman's grounder after singles by Hubie Brooks and Sharperson. They 
tied it one inning later on Kirk Gibson's hustle. He singled, stole second, 
then stole third and scored when catcher Mackey Sasser hurriedly threw the ball 
into right field. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who entered the night with a season-long two game losing streak, did 
not lose. But he did not break out of his doldrums, either. After throwing a 
hitless three innings, he allowed two runs on six hits in his final four 
innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
He was finally removed from the game for pinch-hitter Stan Javier in the bottom 
of the seventh. Although he leads the major leagues with 188 strikeouts, he has 
struck out just 14 in his last three starts. It is the first time this season 
he has gone three starts without a win. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers blew a good chance to take the lead in the seventh after Mike 
Scioscia led off with a single and Sharperson then bunted safely when catcher 
Sasser delayed on his throw to first base. After Offerman kept runners on first 
and second with a bunt that forced Scioscia at third, the runners advanced to 
second and third on Gooden's fourth wild pitch this season. 
</P>
<P>
But pinch-hitter Javier struck out, then Lenny Harris' line drive landed in the 
web of leaping shortstop Howard Johnson's outstretched glove. That final 
indignity was too much for Manager Tom Lasorda to take, as he threw a catchers' 
mask on to the field in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets touched Martinez on his fifth pitch in the fifth inning, when Kevin 
McReynolds broke an 0-for-19 slump with a home run. The hit, which sailed into 
the Dodger bullpen over the left field fence, was just McReynolds' second 
career hit in nine at-bats against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelvin Torve popped up the next pitch, Sasser singled to right field to 
start another scoring opportunity. Gooden's bad bunt was thrown to second base 
by Martinez to force Sasser, but Gooden soon moved to third on a single by 
Daryl Boston. With first baseman Eddie Murray guarding Boston on the bag, 
Magadan grounded a single past Murray and into right field to score Gooden. 
Boston, who moved to third on the play, was stranded when Jefferies struck out 
on three consecutive pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers came back in the bottom of the fifth after Brooks, mired in a 
five-for-35 slump, blooped a single to right. Scioscia's bouncer to Gooden 
moved Brooks to second, a single to shallow right field by Sharperson moved 
Brooks to third, and Offerman's grounder scored him. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers tied it in the sixth on an 150-foot base hit and 270 feet of 
hustle. Both were supplied by Kirk Gibson, who hit a one-out bloop single to 
right field off Gooden. With Kal Daniels batting, two pitches later Gibson 
stole second. Two pitches after that, Gibson stole third and continued his 
sprint around the base and to home plate after an obviously frustrated catcher 
Sasser bounced the ball past Magadan and into left-field foul territory. He 
scored to a standing ovation, which he acknowledged with several pumps of his 
fist. Those were his second and third stolen bases of the game, giving him 20 
stolen bases in 22 attempts this season, second best on the team even though he 
has played in just 63 games.
