COACH: Dave Johnson, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Bulldogs need a pair of pitchers' arms to heal in a 
hurry. Senior right-hander Jeremy Sparks, a returning starter who batted .500 
last season, is raring to go. But senior left-hander Brian Gordon (6-2, 190) 
and junior right-hander Joon Kwon are nursing injuries. Gordon suffered a 
shoulder injury during football season and will be the designated-hitter until 
he is able to throw. Kwon, a potentially overpowering submariner, is recovering 
from a sprained back. Left-hander Jason Chandler and right-hander Shawn 
Williams throw hard, Johnson said, but are rough around the edges. "At this 
point, I don't want to say we're going to be strong in pitching," Johnson said. 
He might be wise to reserve judgment on his fielders too. Players are battling 
for positions throughout: Chandler and junior Jeff Kadis at first base; juniors 
Teddy Gonzalez and Steve Rutkoske, both up from the junior varsity, at second; 
Sparks, Williams and junior Andy Salazar, at third. Senior catcher Steve Kelley 
(6-0, 200), who batted .330 last season, is a returning starter. Senior center 
fielder Brian Miclette is a first-year starter, and juniors Ozzie Areu, Ryan 
Woodburn and Jason Miller are vying for outfield positions.

<P>
OUTLOOK: Johnson inherited a program that he claims was in disarray. 
Consequently, he is aiming for long-range goals. "We're looking to turn things 
around, but the emphasis is going to be on doing things right," he said. "We'll 
field the ground ball, hit the cut-off man and pick off people. . . . It's a 
big mistake to set goals that are unrealistic, but we're going to be 
competitive."

COACH: Coach Terry Scott, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-12; 3rd in league at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team's top six batters graduated, and most of the current 
Indians spent last season on the junior varsity. Only three varsity players 
return and all were sophomores last season. Second baseman Mike Medina and 
shortstop Eddie Gavilan, both 5-foot-8, form a tiny but tight double-play 
tandem. "People will be amazed at what they do," Scott said. "They're good and 
they're very tough at the plate." Catcher Bobby Sherwood (5-10, 185) was a 
backup last year. Lanky right-handers Mike Rossiter (6-5, 185), a junior, and 
Mike Ewalt (6-4, 160), a side-arm senior, were the junior varsity's top 
pitchers last season. Junior third baseman Alex Megas (5-7, 145) pitched and 
played shortstop for the junior varsity. Junior first baseman Mike Campbell 
(6-1, 160), a potential power threat, moves up from the sophomore team. Junior 
Andy Young (5-10, 160), a right-handed reliever, batted .400 on the junior 
varsity last season. Senior outfielder Steve Bowler (5-10, 165) led the junior 
varsity with four home runs.

<P>
OUTLOOK: "I've got a certain amount of optimism this year, but we could be real 
tough next year," Scott said. The Indians are inexperienced, but their pitching 
might surprise. "I'm being a little prejudiced," Scott said, "but I think Mike 
Rossiter will be one of the best juniors in the Valley." Defense will make or 
break Burroughs.

Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bud Murray, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-7; tied for 1st in league at 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Indians arguably have the Valley's best starting rotation 
in senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine and junior right-hander Keith Halcovich, 
both returning starters. Murray called Lorraine (9-5, 2.18 ERA), who combines 
an 80-plus m.p.h. fastball and a good curve, the best left-hander he has 
coached. Halcovich (9-2, 1.28) might be even better. Senior right-hander Kevin 
Foderaro, who registered a late-season shutout and a save after moving up from 
the junior varsity, is the relief ace. Six starters graduated, but the Indians 
have talent where they need it. Line-drive hitting Lance Migita (.447, 13 
doubles, three triples, 31 RBIs) moves from outfield to second base. Shortstop 
Rob Davis (.426, 30 RBIs), like Migita, enters his fourth varsity season. 
Senior third baseman Chad Miyata and junior first baseman R. J. Simone, who 
missed last season because of a broken leg, round out the infield. Junior 
catcher Tom Wolff, who started on the junior varsity last season, replaces the 
departed Casey Burrill. The outfield is new and untested, featuring seniors 
Garrett Emeterio and Sean Buck, both up from the junior varsity, and senior Les 
Holmes, a varsity reserve last season. Sophomore Doug Distaso, the quickest of 
the crew, is the likely starter in center field. Juniors Damon Mori and Joey 
Freitas, as well as Halcovich, also will play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Murray is amazed at prognostications favoring Hart. Despite the loss 
of several key players, however, the Indians look a heap better than their 
league foes. "I don't know how they figure that," Murray said. "But I think the 
longer we play, the better we're going to get."
