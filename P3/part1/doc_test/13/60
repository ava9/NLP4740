How best to describe the impertinent Chicago White Sox and their dogged pursuit 
of the Oakland Athletics in the American League West? 
</P>
<P>
Chicago General Manager Larry Himes said the A's are probably finding that his 
team is comparable to a migraine. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't shake us," he said. "We're like a bad headache. They wake up in the 
morning and we're there. And aspirin won't help." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox have definitely been a pain to the A's, who have always felt they 
can tolerate what anyone throws at them simply because they are better than 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the A's still feel they can cope with a headache, but the pain from 
their own debilitating injuries is becoming acute. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with the hamstring and back problems affecting the availability and 
performances of Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on a wet and substandard field in Chicago the other night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Walt Weiss suffered a rib-cage pull and is day to day as the A's 
weigh the disabled list. Teammate Terry Steinbach missed 24 games with a 
similar injury earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Dave Henderson injured a knee that will require arthroscopic 
surgery and could sideline him for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
On a team of marquee names, the less flamboyant Dave Henderson is a quiet 
leader and clutch player batting .272 with 19 homers, 59 runs batted in and a 
history of being at his best in September and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the biggest loss of all the injured players we've had the last three 
years," pitcher Dave Stewart said of Henderson. "On the field, in the 
clubhouse, big plays, big hits -- he's the most underrated player on this team 
in terms of impact." 
</P>
<P>
For now, rookie Darren Lewis is filling in for a player the A's seem to 
consider irreplaceable, the captain of the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose his leadership in that area alone," Stewart said. " 'Hendu' keeps guys 
on the ball. Darren's not going to be able to tell Jose or Rickey to move, 
where to play. And even if he did, even if he knew when and how to do that, 
would they listen?" 
</P>
<P>
A four-time Gold Glove winner, Kirby Puckett is being moved from center field 
to right by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
He will platoon there for the rest of the season, then move permanently in 
1991, providing the Twins find a full-time replacement in center. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirby has had a pretty good career out there, but this might save him a few 
miles," Manager Tom Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
What Kelly didn't say is that the Twins have grown concerned about the number 
of balls falling in front of the deep-playing Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett is taking it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this will probably help my career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Devon White or Gary Pettis or one of those guys who plays shallow and 
still covers everything." 
</P>
<P>
Of his bid for a fourth consecutive National League batting title, which would 
be the longest streak since Rogers Hornsby won six in a row starting in 1920, 
the San Diego Padres' Tony Gwynn referred to current leader Lenny Dykstra, 
saying: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pressure might get to Dykstra, but for me and Willie (McGee) it's 
not first or foremost on our minds. We've done it before and know we can do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the New York Mets' Dave Magadan, now second to Dykstra and about 20 
points ahead of Gwynn, is not first or foremost on his mind either. 
</P>
<P>
A misguided campaign to re-name Anaheim Stadium in honor of Gene Autry, the 
Angels' owner, has met justifiable opposition from Anaheim city council members 
Tom Daly, Miriam Kaywood and Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Autry showed some courage in moving to Orange County in 1966, though it is 
worth remembering that Walt Disney had already done the research and surveys 
and was the real pioneer there, and that the Angels, dying in Dodger Stadium, 
had no other substantive offers. 
</P>
<P>
It is also worth remembering that Anaheim, a city of 150,000 then, supplied the 
land and finances for the construction of the stadium and has received Autry's 
gratitude through: (1) a suit that has cost the city and its taxpayers millions 
of dollars, and (2) an error-prone operation producing three division titles 
and 15 finishes of .500 or worse in the first 24 years there. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps, more than all else, it is worth remembering that it was Autry who 
refused to rename his franchise the Anaheim Angels because he was afraid 
"Anaheim" might generate laughs on Madison Avenue reminiscent of those Jack 
Benny got when he linked Anaheim with Azusa and Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Why now should the city be expected to rename its stadium? It's enough that 
Gene Autry and the county have helped one another. Let the city keep its name 
in lights. If it can't have Broadway, let it at least have State College 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Did George Steinbrenner unravel the New York Yankees' front office mess with 
his last-gasp reappointment of Gene Michael as general manager, or did he 
merely rearrange it? 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell. For the present, Michael is the final authority on baseball 
matters, but both he and George Bradley, who now carries the title of vice 
president of baseball operations, can initiate trade talks, as both Bradley and 
Pete Peterson had been doing, often tripping over the other's phone line. 
</P>
<P>
It is also unclear as to whether Michael or Bradley will conduct contract 
negotiations, and the Yankees have five players eligible for free agency -- 
Dave Righetti, Tim Leary, Mike Witt, Jeff Robinson and Wayne Tolleson. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there seemed to be at least one positive and one certainty 
stemming from Steinbrenner's final moves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The positive: Brian Sabean, credited with restoring stability to the Yankee 
farm and scouting system as director of scouting, was elevated to vice 
president of player development and scouting -- Bradley's former job -- and 
given a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, through Friday, had the best record in the American League East 
since the All-Star break, and much of the credit belonged to rookies Kevin 
Maas, Oscar Azocar and Jim Leyritz -- products of a rebounding farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The certainty: The awarding of a three-year contract to Steinbrenner's 
son-in-law, Joseph Malloy, as vice president of finance was an indication that 
the Yankees will remain a family trust, with Malloy eventually handling the 
business end and Steinbrenner's youngest son, Harold, now a senior at Williams 
College, handling baseball matters. 
</P>
<P>
Can Steinbrenner stay out of it until then? Won't he be on the phone, violating 
commissioner Fay Vincent's ruling? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of people asking me that," Michael said. "They should know 
me better. Do you believe I'd risk my baseball life? I mean, he's not going to 
call. Besides, I've been known to hang up on him." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Thigpen of the White Sox and Dennis Eckersley of the A's are closing in 
on Righetti's single-season save record of 46, but that isn't Righetti's main 
concern. There's already unrest in new Yankeedom because of comments by Michael 
on Righetti's contract situation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not like the Righetti of old, but he's good," Michael said. "Other clubs 
have expressed interest in him, so we know he has value. The decision on how 
high we go will have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Said Righetti: "I'm hurt. It's hard every year to prove yourself. I was hoping 
he'd say I was doing a good job and that they'd want to keep me. Instead of 
hearing something decent out of his mouth, he said I wasn't as good as I used 
to be. . . . It hurt because here's a guy who has been here since I've been 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti doesn't figure to be hurting long. He's 27 for 30 in save 
opportunities, the market is expected to be open again, there's a vast need for 
proven relief pitchers and the Yankees themselves have no apparent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a hell of a year," Manager Stump Merrill said. "He just hasn't had 
the opportunities. I still have a lot of confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
After a summer of indoctrination, making moves designed to strengthen the 
marketing and minor league departments, the new president of the Detroit Tigers 
believes he is ready to take a more active role in the varsity's baseball 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bo Schembechler, the former Michigan football coach, to Danny Knobler of 
the Booth newspaper chain: "I hope you'll take this the right way, but I know 
more about what it takes to put a team together and compete than any other 
person in my position. Therefore, I'm going into the baseball end of it now 
more actively than any other club president." 
</P>
<P>
And why did he wait? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to jump in and talk about players I didn't know about," he said. 
"I've now watched a lot of games, studied baseball and stayed up late listening 
to ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was reported here last Sunday that the Cincinnati Reds were 
bidding to become the first team since introduction of the 162-game schedule in 
1961 to lead every day of the season. The Reds are bidding to become the first 
National League team. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Detroit Tigers opened 9-0, 18-2 and 35-5 in a wire-to-wire run during 
which they also never trailed the Kansas City Royals during the playoffs or the 
San Diego Padres during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Add Reds: Manager Lou Piniella reminded his team about the story of the 
tortoise and the hare and how the race goes to the steadiest, most consistent 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
Said pitcher Rick Mahler: "What I liked best is when Lou acted out the roles."
