Over the long course of 28 seasons, Palos Verdes High baseball Coach Gil 
Eberhard has experienced his share of bitter defeats. But he couldn't remember 
any that hurt more than Friday's 4-3 loss to Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, he knows the pain will linger. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he said, pacing in front of his dejected players, "that's the 
bad feature about games like this." 
</P>
<P>
It's the way the Sea Kings lost that will haunt Eberhard. 
</P>
<P>
In command most of the way, Palos Verdes let its CIF-Southern Section 5-A 
playoff opener slip away at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Three errors in the last two innings opened the door for four Millikan runs, 
wiping out a 3-0 lead and a stellar pitching effort by right-hander Steve Hoye, 
who baffled the Rams all day with a steady diet of curve balls. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anyone like (Hoye)," said Aaron Seja, Millikan's lead-off 
hitter. "We see mostly fastballs in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Seja, hitless in his first three at-bats Friday, faced Hoye for the last time 
with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning and the tying run on second 
base. With the count 3-2, Hoye threw a curve ball that Seja half-heartedly 
swung at, just trying to make contact. 
</P>
<P>
The weakly hit ball easily could have been handled by a Palos Verdes infielder, 
as Eberhard pointed out. But instead it sailed past Hoye and skipped through 
the middle of the infield to tie the game, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Seja then stole second and advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher 
Mike Hoye. Dante Powell grounded to shortstop Lance Haworth, whose high throw 
pulled first baseman Jon Jacobson off the bag, allowing Seja to score the 
winning run as Powell safely dove into first. 
</P>
<P>
The play set off a wild celebration by Millikan, which has never lost a 
first-round playoff game in eight seasons under Coach Dan Peters. Meanwhile, 
stunned Palos Verdes quietly gathered in its dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Peters realized his team was fortunate, considering the way Steve Hoye pitched. 
The junior allowed only five hits and one walk. Unfortunately for Hoye, the 
walk led to Millikan's tying run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were in trouble when he could throw his breaking pitch for a strike 
any time he wanted," Peters said. "We never got a chance to run." 
</P>
<P>
Millikan (18-8), the Moore League runner-up, will face Ocean League champion 
Culver City (21-6) in the second round Tuesday. Palos Verdes finished with a 
17-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
Five South Bay teams will play second-round games in the CIF-Southern Section 
baseball playoffs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A Division, Bay League quad-champion Hawthorne (17-12) will play at 
home against top-seeded Lakewood (23-3), the Moore League champ. Francisco 
Cordova pitched a four-hitter Friday to lead visiting Hawthorne past Alemany, 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A Division, Santa Fe League champion Mary Star (19-6) faces Morro Bay 
(17-5) at Fromhold Field in San Pedro, while El Segundo and St. Bernard play 
away games. Second-seeded El Segundo (22-5) plays at Orange Lutheran (14-10-1) 
and St. Bernard (19-5) travels to meet Agoura (14-7). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran rallied to defeat Miraleste, 7-5, on Friday and spoil what 
would have been an all-South Bay match-up between the Marauders and El Segundo. 
St. Bernard advanced with an 8-4 victory over Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools Division, third-seeded Chadwick (15-5) will play at home 
against Villanova Prep (12-7). Senior right-hander Greg O'Riordan (7-0) pitched 
a three-hitter and struck out nine to lead the Dolphins past visiting Boron, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo and Mary Star each received first-round byes in the 2-A baseball 
playoffs, and having a week off was a welcomed relief for Mary Star Coach Frank 
Ponce de Leon. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us time to recooperate and get some sore arms healthy," he said. "We 
need a little break. This is a good time to prepare for the next step. Put it 
this way, I'm glad to be in the second round. Usually Mary Star teams have a 
tough time getting past the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Ponce de Leon said the Stars have reached the second round only twice since 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star will send senior right-hander Rick Ibarra (9-2, 1.97 ERA) to the 
mound Tuesday against Morro Bay, a team Ponce de Leon recently scouted. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's baseball season came to a disappointing end Friday with a 17-2 loss 
at the hands of second-seeded Riverside Poly in the 5-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Sea Hawks should be in better spirits Thursday night at the 
baseball awards banquet at the Los Verdes Country Club in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The program will include a dedication of the Redondo scoreboard to the late 
Denny Johnson, a former Sea Hawk assistant coach, and a testimonial for former 
head coach Harry Jenkins, who stepped down last season after guiding Redondo to 
10 league titles in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $17 and can be obtained at the school or by contacting Athletic 
Director Steve Shaw at 379-5421, Ext. 206. 
</P>
<P>
It's unusual in baseball for freshmen and sophomores to make an impact on the 
varsity level, but the South Bay boasts several young stars. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a soph-frosh team any coach would love to have: 
</P>
<P>
1B -- Danny Manjarrez, El Segundo sophomore (.309, 5 home runs, 29 RBIs); 2B -- 
Paul Lemire, Miraleste sophomore (.387); SS -- Grant Hohman, St. Bernard 
freshman (.400); 3B -- Antone Williamson, Torrance sophomore (.463, 4 home 
runs, 37 RBIs); OF -- Armando Fernandez, Hawthorne sophomore (.452, 5 home 
runs, 24 RBIs, 18 stolen bases); DH -- Cody Beason, Mira Costa freshman (.368); 
RHP -- Armando Cervantes, Bishop Montgomery sophomore (6-1, 1.80 ERA); LHP -- 
Pat O'Hara, Palos Verdes sophomore (5-3, 2.60 ERA); UTIL -- Brett Newell, El 
Segundo sophomore (7-1, 3.90 ERA, .390).
