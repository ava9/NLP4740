Look at it this way. 
</P>
<P>
If Tony Gwynn didn't hurl his body against the center-field wall to make a 
catch . . . if John Kruk didn't leap across the warning track to make a catch . 
. . if Roberto Alomar didn't swan dive into a line drive for a catch . . . if 
Tim Flannery didn't dig holes at third base to make three catches . . . the 
Padres would have lost, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, their second consecutive fall to the San Francisco Giants Monday was 
at least by something resembling a baseball score -- 8-3 -- even if Bruce Hurst 
did feel as if he had been passed, punted and kicked. 
</P>
<P>
In front a paid crowd of 21,768 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, making his 
National League and Padre debut, Hurst learned at least one thing. When you 
walk outside without your best stuff, they treat you here just as they would in 
Boston or Bangkok. They murder you. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's biggest free agent winner this winter ($5.25 million for three 
years) was a victim of a different sort of collusion as the Giants joined 
together to put him through five innings that stretched into the darkest parts 
of his imagination. One of baseball's premier left-handers was racked for 10 
hits and eight runs, including two homers (back to back) and three doubles, and 
he even threw a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Just four batters into his Padre career, he had allowed a run. Two innings 
later, he allowed six, facing 10 hitters in a stretch that included a three-run 
homer by Will Clark and another homer -- one pitch later -- by Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
After that inning, also for the first time as a Padre, the calm Hurst flung his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I was awful," said Hurst afterward, professionally facing and answering all 
questions. "I think my target area was dugout to dugout." 
</P>
<P>
He said his shoulder, which had suffered from some stiffness during the spring 
but didn't bother him as he went 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA, felt fine and loose in 
the 80-degree heat. He said it was his mind that was hurting. Being the new kid 
on the block, Hurst said, has taken his concentration around the block. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great, I had a nice sweat going . . . but I just wasn't prepared to 
pitch," Hurst said. "There's been a lot of distractions going on around here 
lately, there's been a lot of things happening . . . trying to get settled 
here, trying to do this or that, maybe do too much . . . but I'm not going to 
make excuses. That's my pet peeve -- they don't ask too much, just that you be 
ready to pitch. I should have been ready. I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' right-handed middle relievers were ready, as Greg Booker and Mark 
Grant combined for four shutout innings, including five strikeouts in the final 
two innings by Grant. The middle relievers have now thrown 6 1/3 scoreless 
innings in two games, giving much pleasure to McKeon, who has felt they have 
taken undue criticism. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the only thing that would make McKeon happier is a victory for 
his 0-2 club. Especially since the Padres may tend to take early season losing 
a little worse than other teams. After all, they have lost their first five 
games in each of the past two seasons en route to baseball's worst starts each 
of those years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be OK, we're not going to panic," McKeon said. "I said in 
spring training that some of these guys were actually pitching too good, and 
that I knew they had to have a bad outing, and hoped they would have it then. 
It's all part of the game. We'll be here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else Tuesday, as they struggled against the smart pitching of 
starter and winner Kelly Downs (seven shutout innings), the Padres proved their 
defense is with them. If only they hadn't needed such defense. 
</P>
<P>
Example: With one out in the first, Robby Thompson lined a single to left. Will 
Clark doubled into the right-field gap, moving Thompson to third. Mitchell 
bounced a single past shortstop, scoring one run and moving Clark to third. 
</P>
<P>
Then Candy Maldonado simply crushed a ball to center field . . . but Gwynn 
chased it down and made a leaping, bouncing-off-the-wall catch. Observers 
ranked it among Gwynn's top three career catches -- and he has had four in 
which he's gone over the wall. That catch was followed by a diving stop by 
Flannery at third base off a Matt Williams grounder to save another run. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the catch was that good," Gwynn said. "It was like, I couldn't 
tell where the wall was. Then I just caught it and karate-kicked the wall, and 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant Manager Roger Craig: "Those guys playing defense never quit." 
</P>
<P>
Flannery made another diving stop the next inning, but by the third, it didn't 
matter. Quickly now -- Brett Butler doubled. Thompson walked. Clark homered off 
of what turned out to be a pitch that typified Hurst's night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball," Clark stated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a forkball," Hurst said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell then hit his second homer in two games, to right. Maldonado 
singled. Kruk made a great leaping catch off Matt Williams' hit to right. Kirt 
Manwaring reached first on a throwing error by Flannery. Jose Uribe singled in 
a run. Manwaring scored on a passed ball by Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he felt awful for Hurst, Gwynn said, "I felt awful for everybody. 
You could just see that Hurst wasn't getting the ball where he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to today, 1:05 p.m., the Padres' Ed Whitson against the Giants' 
Don Robinson. Whitson is one of the Padres' best pitchers at stopping losing 
streaks, and while two games is not considered a losing streak, the Padres only 
lost more than three games in a row once last year under McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who ended last night's game in a rare pinch-hit performance because 
McKeon had run out of players, said he's ready to for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been good at this (winning games after losses) in the past, and 
hopefully, I'll be good at it again," Whitson said. "The Giants are hitting as 
good as I've ever seen them hit as a team. But I'll be out there. You can count 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rhoda Polley, the Padre administrative assistant who threw out the first ball 
Monday, resigned Tuesday to concentrate on her fight with cancer. . . . 
Monday's loss means the Padres won't equal one of baseball's most unusual 
records of last year, when they were the only team to win the first game of 
every home stand, going 9-0. They are still 17-2 in the past 19 home-stand 
openers. . . . Outfielder Shane Mack, on the 15-day disabled list with a sore 
elbow, is still unable to throw the ball any harder than a light toss. He won't 
be ready for a couple of weeks, at which point he will be shipped to triple-A 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Salazar was not surprised at the giant reception he received in Monday 
night's opener, including chants of "Louieeeee." "Hey," Salazar said, "I've 
been here before, you know? These people remember." This is his third stop 
here. . . . No wonder the Giants have won eight of their past 11 games here, 
including their last six. They are loaded with San Diego connections. No fewer 
than eight Giants either live here or used to play here, according to research 
by the Giants' publicity staff. Manager Roger Craig, coach Norm Sherry, and 
players Kevin Mitchell, Terry Kennedy, Craig Lefferts and Joe Price all live in 
the area. Coach Bill Fahey and pitcher Dave Dravecky used to play here. 
</P>
<P>
Giant fans will be heartened by the news that disabled pitcher Mike Krukow 
looked good in a simulated game Tuesday afternoon and could come off the 
disabled list within a couple of weeks. The return of Krukow, 7-4 with a 3.54 
ERA last season before undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery Sept. 13, will 
send either Don Robinson, Scott Garrelts or Atlee Hammaker to the bullpen. . . 
. In the Miracle Cure Dept., Giant third baseman Mitchell says he has been 
hitting so well this spring -- a major-league leading .455 during the spring 
and then two homers in the first two regular season games this week -- because 
of simple thing: contact lenses. Mitchell said he has not been truly seeing the 
ball since he was hit in the face with a pitch by Jay Tibbs, then a Cincinnati 
pitcher, in 1986. He decided this winter to get the lenses, and the results 
have spoken loudly for themselves. . . . Padre Fever Dept: On Monday, a local 
radio station auctioned 22 bats signed by the 1984 Padres. They were sold, for 
charity, for $4,600.
