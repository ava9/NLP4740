Vin Scully, the Walt Whitman of the baseball broadcast booth, has been known to 
describe the afternoon sky above a ballpark as "azure blue with pewter gray 
clouds." Joe Garagiola, the former catcher for the Cardinals, Pirates, Cubs and 
New York Giants, will look at that same sky and say, "I'm glad the clouds are 
there today, because they will help in seeing the pop flies." 
</P>
<P>
Whether you see baseball through the eyes of a poet or a player, the sky, 
Garagiola says, is just one of many signs and signals connoisseurs of the game 
will want to observe-even when watching on television. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, TV viewers are prisoners of the pictures the director and producer 
decide to show. If you want to see how the Dodger outfield is positioned to 
play Darryl Strawberry in the late innings of a close game, but the screen is 
filled with the svelte figure of Tommy Lasorda scratching his head in the 
dugout, too bad. Yet even with the inherent restrictions of television, 
Garagiola, who on Tuesday will begin his first season as the color man for the 
35 Angels telecasts on SportsChannel, says that viewers can often experience 
treats of the game that they'd never notice from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I was once broadcasting a 'Game of the Week' when Stan Musial was playing, and 
I noticed the trainer working on him in the dugout," the former NBC commentator 
reminisced. "So I said, 'Stan Musial is being worked on by the trainer. And you 
won't believe what he's doing. He's actually trimming Musial's eyelashes so 
that they won't interfere with his vision when he gets up to bat.' And the 
camera zoomed in real close on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"You miss the ambience, the flavor of the game, sitting at home. I'm sure lots 
of people watching on television got real excited when Kirk Gibson hit that 
home run in the World Series, but being there was something else. But at the 
same time, watching on television you get the benefit of those closeups and 
replays that you just can't see from the bleachers." 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of this lockout-plagued season, Garagiola, 63, the 27-year veteran 
of NBC who left the network following the 1988 season, offered several tips to 
help baseball fans get the most out of watching their favorite game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
* Know the starting pitchers. "If Nolan Ryan is pitching, you'll want to listen 
for the grunts, which I find entertaining, but also you'll want to see if the 
hitters are fouling the ball off or pulling it. If they foul it straight back, 
that means Ryan has his good stuff, but if they are pulling it early in the 
game, that means they are starting their swings very early and his curve is 
going to make a lot of people look silly." 
</P>
<P>
* Check the flags. "If the wind is blowing out, you can say, 'Hey we might have 
some home runs,' but also if a knuckleballer like (Texas Ranger) Charlie Hough 
is scheduled, that wind will make his pitches even livelier, and you'll want to 
watch to see if the catcher is having trouble handling those things." 
</P>
<P>
* Note the dimensions of the park. "In Atlanta or Oakland, there is tons of 
foul territory, so balls that might go into the stands in other stadiums are 
easy outs there. And Fenway Park in Boston has that fence that juts out down 
the left field line, so a hard hit ball just inside the bag can turn into a 
play at first or an easy out at second if the shortstop is alert for the 
ricochet. That's a fun thing to watch for." 
</P>
<P>
* Observe how the ball moves through the grass. On the first hit ball, 
Garagiola recommends noticing whether the ball dies in the tall grass or skips 
with some juice right through it. "In Wrigley field, the grass sometimes gets 
so high that the ball has to eat its way through, and you can expect some 
runners to try to take the extra base." 
</P>
<P>
* Keep an eye on the catcher. "See where the target is, inside, outside and 
whether it's a true target or just a decoy. Sometimes the catcher will put the 
glove in the center of the plate as a decoy, and the pitcher will use his shin 
guard as a target for pitching low and away." 
</P>
<P>
* Watch the baserunners. "Mark how far the runner on first goes for his lead, 
and then check to see f he's in the same place or if his lead is shorter or 
longer after every pitch. That gives you a clue about whether he wants to 
steal." 
</P>
<P>
* Look for the bunt. "With a man on first, watch the catcher motion for the 
pitcher to throw to first, and when he does, don't watch the ball, watch the 
batter. Sometimes at the first bit of motion from the pitcher, the batter will 
start to slide his hand down the bat, giving away the bunt." 
</P>
<P>
* Zero in on the tags. "Television gives you closeups of plays on the bases, 
like around second on a double play. You can see if the shortstop actually 
touches the bag or if he is just in the neighborhood. It's interesting to be 
the umpire on things like that. Or on plays at the plate-Mike Scioscia, the 
human dead end, is great at blocking the plate. But sometimes he does it too 
soon, before he gets the ball. Sometimes he gets away with it and sometimes he 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
* Steal the signs. "With a runner on second, the obvious thing to check is how 
big a lead he's getting, but you can also watch to see if he's trying to steal 
the sign from the catcher and then relay it to the batter. It's tough to steal 
signs, but if he can, he might be bent over with his arms straight, and that 
might mean fastball, and if he bends his arms, that would mean a curve." 
</P>
<P>
* Notice where the batter positions himself in the box. "At the beginning of 
the game, he might be right back at the back line. When the sinkerballer relief 
pitcher comes in, he may move up a step." 
</P>
<P>
A good announcer, Garagiola says, can help point out some of these baseball 
intricacies, and with today's sophisticated fans, can't just get by with 
stating the obvious. If a hard throwing pitcher is breaking a number of bats 
off in the batters' hands, for example, the announcer should note that it 
doesn't mean the team is saddled with a bad bundle of lumber, but that the 
pitcher really has great stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's best for all announcers, even the most astute analysts of the 
game's subtleties, to know when to shut up and let the picture speak for 
itself. "When Nolan Ryan got his fifth no-hitter," Garagiola remembered, "I 
didn't say anything in the ninth inning. The crowd told everyone what was 
happening. The viewers didn't need the announcer to tell them the crowd was in 
a frenzy. Anyone watching could appreciate the moment all by themselves."
