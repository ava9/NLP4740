CRAIG GREBECK IS CHICAGO'S LITTLE BIG MAN FOR A DAY

Diminutive rookie Craig Grebeck could stand on a pile of baseball record books 
and still be looking up to the accomplishments of future Hall of Fame pitcher 
Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
But one day, Grebeck, who at 5-foot-6 is the smallest player in the American 
League, rose above Ryan and his record collection. 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck, the former Cal State Dominguez Hills standout, shocked Ryan with his 
first major league home run, a three-run shot to help the Chicago White Sox 
complete a doubleheader sweep, 5-2, 5-1, over the Texas Rangers Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll remember this homer as long as I live," Grebeck said. "It came off one of 
the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck, who was recalled from the minor leagues Aug. 2, waited until his 69th 
at-bat before hitting his first home run. He had a .118 batting average with 
three runs batted in in 37 games before his confrontation with Ryan. He drove a 
Ryan fastball into the left-field stands in the second inning after a one-out 
double and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan had just walked a guy and with Ron Karkovice on base, I figured Ryan 
wants to make a good pitch, but he made it too good," Grebeck said. "When I hit 
it, I usually know the ball is going a long distance, but since I'm a little 
guy I don't try to hit homers." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan will remember Grebeck's home run as a footnote to his 269th career defeat 
and his second consecutive loss since won his 300th game. 
</P>
<P>
"When Grebeck hit that first pitch, I knew he hit it good," Ryan said. "I felt 
like I had better stuff than the last three or four outings, but I simply made 
some bad pitches, and it doesn't make any difference who's at bat." 
</P>
<P>
Grebeck can't wait for another round. That night the drinks were on him. 
</P>
<P>
No handouts -- Reliever Scott Neill, a former Loyola Marymount College 
standout, continues to receive requests to hand over a baseball, but it no 
longer means that he's being taken out of a game. Nowadays, Neill is being 
hounded by souvenir collectors, not angry managers. 
</P>
<P>
In the bullpen, Neill gets tapped on his cap by young fans requesting 
autographs. Neill tries to ignore the fans because it's against league rules to 
give away baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could sign every piece of paper and hand out a ball to every fan that 
requested one, but I can't," said Neill, who nevertheless enjoys the attention. 
"The umpires really watch us when a foul ball goes into the bullpen. We get 
fined for every ball we throw into the stands." 
</P>
<P>
A long reliever for the Cleveland Indians Class A team in Kinston, Ohio, Neill 
has an impressive 8-3 record with a 2.66 earned-run average entering this 
week's games. He pitched 28 2/3 scoreless innings until Greg Blosser of the 
Lynchburg Red Sox ended the streak with a home run two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a first-round draft pick to score a run off me," said Neill of 
Blosser, who was the Boston's top pick in the 1989 June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
No one thought Neill would be holding a baseball after graduating from Loyola 
Marymount in 1988. He had an unimpressive 5-4 record as a senior with the Lions 
and his fastball was judged to be too slow by professional standards. 
</P>
<P>
After being bypassed in the 1988 draft, Neill played with the Santa Maria 
Indians, a semi-pro team near his hometown of San Luis Obispo. Neill impressed 
an umpire, who had connections with major league scouts, and was signed as a 
free agent by the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a really slow process," Neill said. "I started at the bottom and 
have moved up one level at a time. I've been pretty close to the 10th and last 
man on every pitching staff until last year." 
</P>
<P>
Neill, 23, had his best minor-league season in 1989 when was 3-2 with a 1.80 
ERA as the stopper for Watertown, N.Y. (Class A). 
</P>
<P>
During spring training, Neill changed his delivery to become more of a side-arm 
pitcher and received a promotion to Kinston where he gained popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally had to tape a piece of paper to my hat that said, 'I don't give away 
baseballs,' " Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't been giving away too many runs, either. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of trouble -- Taunting can get pretty bad in the minor leagues, 
especially in North Carolina where Kinston plays the Durham Bulls, a team that 
became popularized by the movie "Bull Durham." The field is favorite hangout 
for college students attending nearby Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
In the season's first series, Kinston reliever Greg Ferlinda walked to the 
mound with the score of the NCAA basketball championship taped to his back. His 
handmade sign read: "UNLV 103, Duke 73." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't there, but I heard that sign silenced the crowd," Neill said. "We 
already have a pretty good rivalry with Durham, but I think that added to the 
intensity of our games. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to draw big crowds whenever we play there."
