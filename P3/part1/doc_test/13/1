Lonnie Summers, now 73, doesn't step up to the plate anymore. Or squat behind 
it and flash signals to the pitcher. But when the former catcher and batting 
champion picked up a bat in the living room of his Inglewood home the other 
day, he instinctively held it up as if ready to take a cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," he said in the middle of a conversation about the good old 
days, disappearing into another room. He came back with a team photo, 
disappeared again and returned with a huge stack of tattered newspaper 
clippings from decades ago. The mementos, and the memories they evoked, had not 
been hauled out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different during his years behind the plate, Summers recalled. 
Baseball was tougher, both on and off the field. The bus rides were long; the 
pay was low. And, oh yeah, blacks played on different ball diamonds from 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, an Oklahoma native who hung up his glove in 1954, is one of an 
estimated 140 survivors of the Negro Leagues, the sole professional baseball 
forum for blacks in the United States before Branch Rickey, general manager of 
the Brooklyn Dodgers, began the integration of the major leagues by signing 
Jackie Robinson in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"Lonnie was one of those big, strong ballplayers who hit powerful line drives," 
said Chico Renfroe, an Atlanta-based sportswriter. "He hit some of the most 
screaming line drives you've seen in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Renfroe, himself a former Negro League player, said it was only "Father Time 
that kept (Summers) from joining Jackie in the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Summers' professional career began in the late 1930s, when he played for the 
Baltimore Elite Giants in the Negro Leagues for a few years. Then, for the next 
decade and a half, he played on teams in Puerto Rico, Mexico and various South 
American countries before returning to the Negro Leagues' Chicago American 
Giants. He ended his career playing in a semi-professional integrated league 
based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, whose wife died recently, said it had been a long time since he'd 
thought about his glory days -- the game in Mexico in which he batted in 11 
runs, or the Negro League All-Star game at Chicago's Comiskey Park in which he 
played with Junior Gilliam, a star second baseman for the Baltimore Elites who 
later signed with the Dodgers and become rookie of the year in the majors in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was not on Summers' mind, he said, when he received a phone call last 
month inviting him to receive a plaque from the Inglewood City Council. The 
recognition was part of a nationwide program organized by Renfroe and sponsored 
by the Southern Bell telephone company of Atlanta to ensure that young people 
do not forget the trailblazers of the Negro League. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a part of history, and they're dying off so fast," Renfroe said. "People 
still tell me they didn't know there was a separate league for blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball could be an especially grueling game back then, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I once played a double-header in Chicago, rode all night to Philadelphia (on 
the team bus) to play one game and then headed out that day to play in Chicago 
again. After you took a shower, you sometimes didn't even have time to get 
something to eat before the bus left." 
</P>
<P>
Teams sometimes played three games a day and eight in a weekend. To pass the 
time on the rickety buses, team members played checkers, slept, gossiped or 
took turns driving. When the team finally reached its destination, there were 
segregated hotels, restaurants and water fountains to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
Renfroe said gas-station water fountains marked "Colored" had lukewarm water, 
but the ones marked "White" offered cold water. The team members could not 
drink from the cold fountain, but they sometimes surreptitiously filled a 
container with the cold water and drank it on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Summers recalled, he and his teammates entered a packed restaurant in 
Detroit after a game and were told by the manager that the eating establishment 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
But it's full, they protested. 
</P>
<P>
It's closed, the manager insisted. 
</P>
<P>
They ate down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said black team members knew to stay out of certain parts of town. 
Meanwhile, the routine of playing and quickly moving on to the next game kept 
racial incidents to a minimum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a love of baseball that kept players going, Summers said, not huge 
salaries. He earned $250 a month when he started, with a $2-a-day eating 
allowance for out-of-town games. The salary improved when he crossed the border 
to play in Mexico, but even then he earned less than his white teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Summers would not criticize the high salaries being paid his contemporary 
counterparts, saying they deserve what they are getting. He added, however, 
that ballplayers today do not appear to enjoy the game as much as Negro League 
players did. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said getting a chance to play in the majors did not prey on his mind 
during his career. Negro League baseball was highly competitive; its teams 
frequently beat major league teams in exhibition games. "I played against the 
best and with the best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But looking back, Summers said he does sometimes feel that he was cheated out 
of the big time. Once Robinson broke the color line, younger Negro Leaguers 
such as Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, Ernie Banks and Hank Aaron went to the 
majors. "It just shows that we could have done it all along," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed out on a lot," he said. "I had an excellent arm in my prime, and as 
far as hitting and catching and running was concerned, I knew I could play. The 
thing was getting the break. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game of baseball owes us something. But I would never bring it up 
because I know the first thing they're going to say: 'Why should we give you 
something when you didn't make it? You didn't make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Summers moved to Los Angeles after he left baseball and became a janitor in Los 
Angeles schools. He retired in the mid-1980s after 29 1/2 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, once his obsession, has lost some of its charm as the years have 
passed. Summers has been invited to Dodger Stadium as a dignitary but has 
turned down the offer. He still occasionally gets to the ballpark but prefers 
to sit by himself in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to the ballpark now, I don't let anyone know I'm there," he said. "I 
go to watch the game, not to celebrate anything." 
</P>
<P>
Summers had second thoughts about receiving the plaque from Inglewood but 
finally decided to accept it. Now, next to the team pictures and other baseball 
photos lining the walls of his home is a fancy proclamation. "Read it," he 
says. "It's all true." 
</P>
<P>
"These players," it says, "endured countless miles on the road, accommodations 
which were less than accommodating (and) pay which was no reflection of their 
talents and efforts. The strides made, the trails blazed, the sacrifices 
endured . . . and the heights reached will forever maintain their place in 
history."
