A powerful storm system moved into Southern California from the Pacific Ocean 
on Monday, bringing the drought-gripped region its first significant rainfall 
in months and kicking up desert winds that forced the space shuttle Atlantis to 
delay its landing. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters had offered a 60% chance of light rain with a half-inch of rainfall 
possible in some coastal and mountain areas before skies begin to clear later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Their predictions were right. By 9:30 p.m., showers were reported as far south 
as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real big storm system . . . but it does have a pretty good punch," 
said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The storm came onshore in the Los Angeles area at Malibu just before 8 p.m., 
knocking out power to more than 700 Southern California Edison customers from 
Trancas Beach to the Ventura County line, a power company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Malibu station described the rain 
as "heavy." A power company official said there were at least three reports of 
downed power lines. Electrical service was being restored to customers "a few 
at a time," the spokesman said, but he could not estimate when power would be 
fully restored. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9 p.m., Los Angeles Department of Water and Power crews were 
attempting to resume service to about 800 customers in an area bounded by 43rd 
and 53rd streets and Van Ness and Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Another outage affected about 800 homes in exclusive Bel-Air, the DWP said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, one hopeful weather forecaster on a local television station 
reportedly counted six drops of rain by noon, but instruments at the National 
Weather Service had not detected any measurable precipitation by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, anticipation ran high. People pulled out their umbrellas and 
slickers, brought in their dogs and cats and cast watchful glances from office 
windows before stepping outside. 
</P>
<P>
"All the media and every John Doe is calling in, wanting to know if it is 
really going to rain, what are the chances of rain, how much rain are we going 
to get, when is it going to rain," said meteorologist Jerry McDuffie of the 
National Weather Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't rained in so long, and it's just something people in California do 
out here, period." 
</P>
<P>
Just how long has it been since that last rain? In August, 0.02 of an inch of 
rain fell at the Los Angeles Civic Center -- hardly enough to notice. 
</P>
<P>
Back on May 28, a freak storm dumped 1.17 inches onto Los Angeles, setting a 
seasonal record and ruining the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Southern California has been suffering a drought, with 
rainfall levels far below normal. The average amount of precipitation recorded 
by the end of October is 11.03 inches; this year, 6.3 inches has been measured 
during the same period, McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain is not expected to greatly relieve the parched local landscape. It 
might be enough to make roads slick for the morning commute, and motorists were 
being cautioned to drive carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"It could fool us and rain harder in some spots. But (the storm system) should 
move across at a decent rate so it won't drop a lot of rain in any particular 
place," McDuffie said. "It's nothing that's going to wash any houses away." 
</P>
<P>
Added McKewon: "The system looks like it's got quite a bit of moisture. But I 
don't think a widespread range, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, is going to 
get rain. Unfortunately, some locations will get very little, if any." 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in downtown Los Angeles on Monday was a mild 64 degrees, 
with slightly warmer temperatures expected today. The long-range forecast calls 
for a sunny, windy Thanksgiving, with highs in the low to mid 70s. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, where temperatures were expected to drop below 50 
degrees overnight, city officials activated a foul-weather shelter program and 
opened a National Guard armory in Van Nuys for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
City vans picked up the homeless and took them to the armory, which holds 150 
people, for a hot meal and a bed away from the elements. By late Monday, 
however, only 18 people were in the shelter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
High above the Mojave Desert, a disappointed shuttle crew had to remain in 
orbit an extra day -- at least -- after shifting gusts at the last minute set 
up crosswinds in excess of the 15-knot safety level for the spacecraft. 
Officials said the landing on a dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base could be 
delayed until as late as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The swirling winds are not expected to let up today, McKewon said.
