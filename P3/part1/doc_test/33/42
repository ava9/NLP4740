A record-breaking heat wave during the weekend will not extend into today's 
Veterans Day activities, and the mercury is expected to continue dropping until 
Wednesday, when 70-degree weather is predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day hot spell, exacerbated by low-wind conditions, will begin easing by 
today, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which 
provides weather forecasts for the Times. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, hot, dry weather sent thousands of people outdoors to the parks and 
the beaches. In Newport Beach, where cooler temperatures prevailed, the high 
was a comfortable 78. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim reported 92 degrees, just two degrees cooler than the 94 achieved in 
Ventura County's Santa Paula, the hottest spot in the nation on Sunday, Burback 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's Monrovia and San Gabriel both reported 93 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend heat wave was attributed to a high pressure zone trapped above the 
entire West Coast for the past several days by two low pressure troughs, one in 
the Pacific Ocean and one over the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, El Toro reported 99 degrees, making it the nation's hot spot. But 
the warm easterly winds abated and onshore breezes blew over El Toro, cooling 
it to 83 on Sunday, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Northwest storm is expected to cool things off to the 70s and high 
60s beginning Tuesday, and extending through Thursday, before it warms up again 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the storm front should also bring some fairly moderate breezes and 
higher surf.DAVID REYES
