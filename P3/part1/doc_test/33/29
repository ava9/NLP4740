SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Voorhees remembers the winter five years ago when rains swelled San Juan 
Creek and gave local kids a place to catch bass and channel catfish. 
</P>
<P>
The cattle he raised on the sprawling Rancho Mission Viejo near here grazed on 
the rolling hills that rise above Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the creek is a dust bowl of dead willows and cattails. And the 
cattle have been moved to greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen it so bad," said Voorhees, a foreman at the ranch just east of 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing Southern California drought has taken a toll on farmers, nursery 
owners and ranchers in the 110,000-acre San Juan Creek basin, officials say. 
For the first time in 50 years, the 14 agricultural wells that feed the region 
have run dry. And unless there is substantial rainfall soon, the dozen or so 
tenant farmers and nursery operators who till the surrounding fields may be 
forced out of business by summer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst it's ever been," Voorhees continued, standing Wednesday in 
the dry creek bed as warm Santa Ana winds blew dust around his boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we are going to have enough water to keep all the tenants in 
business," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Kinoshita, a veteran of 35 years of farming who runs a vegetable and 
strawberry farm eight miles downstream from Rancho Mission Viejo, agreed. He 
said the beautiful Southern California weather, which is so welcomed by the 
tourist industry, could be the demise of local agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had too many Santa Ana wind conditions and high pressure systems, which 
are really unusual this time of year," Kinoshita said. He predicted that if the 
area does not get 75% of the normal seasonal rainfall by the end of the month, 
"we'll be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Local water officials said that the drought has virtually depleted much of the 
113,000-acre aquifer that stretches under San Juan Creek from Cleveland 
National Forest west to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The wells tap into the aquifer, a layer of underground, porous rock and sand 
that holds water, at various locations along an eight-mile stretch of land. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the depletion, farmers and nursery owners have had to rely on 
imported water piped from nearby water agencies, according to William W. Knitz, 
general manager of the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
"This really shows you that we are in a drought," said Knitz, who is also 
president of the San Juan Basin Authority board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the ranch all but abandoned the wells after spending close to 
$500,000 to hook up a seven-mile-long pipeline to the Santa Margarita Water 
District and a shorter line to the nearby Chiquita Canyon sewage-treatment 
plant, Knitz said. 
</P>
<P>
That imported water so far has replaced the wells, which once provided free 
water to the tenant farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ranch and the farmers pay $350 per acre-foot for the imported water. 
(An acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons, which is enough to supply a family of 
four with drinking water for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
"That is pretty expensive for water," Voorhees said. "You never know how 
valuable water is until the wells run dry." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Aguirre, vice president of ranch operations, said that the imported 
water so far has been enough to forestall most negative effects of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
But as summer approaches and the overall demand for water increases, Voorhees 
warned, the two utilities may not be able to supply enough water to keep the 
farm tenants in business. 
</P>
<P>
The water table has now dipped to 50 feet underground, the lowest it has ever 
been in recorded history, water officials said. In seasons with normal or 
near-normal rainfall, the underground water level is between 20 to 30 feet from 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's series of winter storms, which dumped more than two inches of rain 
in San Juan Capistrano, have done almost nothing to counter the effects of the 
drought in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
"We would need at least 15 to 17 inches of rain per year over the next two 
years to get the wells back to an operational level," Knitz explained. "I don't 
think much of the rain water got into the ground water basin." 
</P>
<P>
Supporting his statement is the fact that the hillside grasses remain unusually 
brown and the creek bed is still parched. 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees said that the drought has also affected the Rancho Mission Viejo's 
Reata Cattle Co. operation. The company normally raises 800 head of cattle a 
year. But because the hills are so barren, about 600 head were moved to the 
company's spread near Elko, Nev., to avoid starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Other local farmers share the bleak predictions for the agricultural industry 
if the region does not receive substantial rainfall by April. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bathgate, a lifelong San Juan Capistrano orange grower, said that the 
drought is affecting water quality throughout the Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall, he explained, has caused natural salt in the soil to 
accumulate near the surface rather than be leeched deeper by rain. 
</P>
<P>
"Plants don't like salty water," Bathgate said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that it costs more money to pump water out of nearly empty wells. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only does it take more power," Bathgate said, "but the efficiency of the 
pump is decreased and you get less water." 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Meadows, general manager of the San Juan Basin Authority, said that the 
agency has been studying a plan to build two dams on San Juan Creek to keep up 
to 60% of runoff water from flowing into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The dams would provide more than six billion gallons of agricultural and 
drinking water, Meadows said. 
</P>
<P>
"This would really give us a chance to have a major water source that is not 
dependent on what naturally falls into the system" Knitz added. 
</P>
<P>
The authority, which oversees ground water use in the water table under San 
Juan Creek and its two tributaries, Oso and Trabuco creeks, is seeking a 
$42-million federal grant from the Bureau of Water Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Early versions of the proposal called for a 90-foot-high dam in a canyon near 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, seven miles east of San Juan Capistrano on 
Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials have estimated that in a normal rainy season, water lost to the 
ocean could serve 18,000 families of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Voorhees said, he is counting the days when he will once again 
see water flowing in the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been four years now since any water flowed at all," Voorhees said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dust Bowl 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Creek Basin has lost almost all of its ground water due to the 
ongoing drought that has stricken Southern California. The creek once swelled 
during rainy seasons but has now been dry for four years.
