farming - The consequences of declining fish stocks and over-investment

Ecuador's shrimp farming business had another record year in 1991 as the gap
with other fishing exports widened.
Groups within the industry, unwilling to acknowledge over-fishing, accuse
each other of irrational practices or blame dwindling catches on climate and
ocean currents.
'We've seen this happen in other countries - with herring in the North Sea,
and anchovy in Peru,' said Mr Ian Scott, the economist in charge of
Britain's technical assistance programme for the fishing sector.
'There's been over-investment. If the Ecuadorian fleet fishes for 150 days a
year at 50 per cent efficiency, it can catch 3m tonnes - but the sustainable
stock of pelagic fish is only 500,000 to 1m tonnes.'
In the last few years fishermen supplying the fishmeal and canning
industries have seen a drastic drop in the harvest of sardines, mackerel,
thread herring and anchovies: the catch fell from 1,970,000 tonnes in 1985
to 233,000 tonnes in 1990, leaving many processing plants working at less
than 20 per cent of capacity.
Mr Scott said that although the warm southward-flowing El Nino current was
responsible for two bad years, the general decline was due to over-fishing
and licences and quota systems were needed to help stocks recover.
The tuna industry, centred in Manta, is also overblown, but the catch has
remained stable at 50,000 to 55,000 tonnes a year.
Both Ecuadorian and foreign boats fish for tuna. Local fishermen criticise
the fact that boats registered in the US, Japan and other countries are
contracted by Manta processing companies. However, it is argued that only
some of the vessels in the national fleet can freeze tuna to -40C, the
temperature necessary for good quality exports.
The under-secretary for fishing, Mr Max Aguirre, is proud of Ecuador's
record on the dolphin-tuna issue. 'The Ecuadorian law is strict. Ecuadorian
and foreign boats have their licences taken away if they fish on dolphins. I
report with satisfaction that in 43 trips with observers on board there were
zero dolphin deaths.'
Mr Aguirre admits that research studies warned of sardine fishing problems,
and says regional controls, including Peru and Chile, should be enforced.
'Licences should regulate the catch with reference to the resource.'
However, the private sector has been too powerful and the government too
timid to allow any quota-based management of stocks.
The fish sector earned about USDollars 570m in 1991, with shrimps
contributing more than 85 per cent. There are more than 125,000 hectares of
shrimp ponds along the tidal flats of the Ecuadorian coastline, mainly in
the southern provinces. Most shrimp farms are less than 50 hectares, though
the largest - up to as much as 2,000 hectares  - tend to be the most
sophisticated. Some use small aircraft to drop feed over the surface of the
ponds.
Shrimp farms produce all year round so close to the equator and two to three
harvests can be taken. With an ideal climate, plentiful larvae and
low-labour costs, Ecuador is the leading Latin American shrimp exporter.
'Our problem at the moment is the big jump in the cost of inputs. The dollar
price of shrimps has dropped and so has profitability,' said Mr Renato del
Campo of the Chamber of Shrimp Producers in Guayaquil. 'But there are
markets - the US is still attractive and we are diversifying into Europe,
especially Spain.'
Exports have risen from 10,000 tonnes in 1980 to more than 78,000 tonnes in
1991, and the need for more space and more larvae has led to conflict with
environmental groups, particularly over the clearing of mangroves.
Most shrimps are bred from wild larvae caught by thousands of seasonal
fishermen, but more than 100 laboratories have been started up in recent
years, with some exporting larvae to Colombia.
Although the shrimp fishing industry is small, accounting for less than 10
per cent of production, wild shrimp provide important breeding stocks for
the laboratories.
The sector expanded dangerously fast - from about 2,000 to 9,000 boats  - in
the 1980s and over-fishing is becoming a serious problem within a few miles
of the coast. Many of the boats are dug-out canoes based in small
communities.
'We need to teach people to take better care of the fish, then they'll also
improve their income. There should be ice available, and we need to
encourage marketing co-operatives,' said Mr Aguirre.
The British aid project, which is now ending after 12 years, has helped the
National Fisheries Institute to build up data on biology, product
development, marketing and management.
Ecuador has a stronger basis for planning resource use than many other
countries. 'There isn't any room for growth in the existing industry - it
needs reducing and consolidating,' said Mr. Scott.
