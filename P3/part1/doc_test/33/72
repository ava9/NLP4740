A low-pressure front that visited San Diego with clouds and cool temperatures 
last weekend is back this weekend, according to the National Weather Service in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The front, created Sept. 19 by cold air coming in from Canada, headed up the 
coast during the week, sprinkling rain on San Francisco and other parts of 
Northern California, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
A strong jet stream over Canada is now deflecting the front back toward San 
Diego, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high-level winds, the low pressure is trapped over California 
and a slow warming trend will begin, Shigehara said. In the meantime, the front 
is working its way back toward San Diego with rain falling ahead of it. It 
brings a 20% chance of rain to San Diego today and through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't ignore the potential of rain, but it really won't mean much," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although rain will be sporadic, the county will be shrouded in a cloud cover 
with cool temperatures and little sunshine, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The low pressure won't affect coastal as much as inland temperatures. The norm 
for early fall, which began Sept. 22, is 76 degrees at Lindbergh Field. With 
the effects of the low pressure and the normal marine cloud cover, the 
temperature will drop to about 74. But in the inland areas such as El Cajon and 
Escondido where the norm is 84 to 88 this time of year, the mercury will 
struggle to top the 78-degree mark, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, surf is up to 4 to 5 feet with a water temperature of 69 
degrees. Temperatures will range from 68 to 73 today and over the weekend.
