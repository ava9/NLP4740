Hurricane Hugo is a harbinger of the type of high-intensity storms that can be 
expected more often in the future due to the greenhouse effect and the 
resulting global warming, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Warming ocean and air temperatures will feed extra energy into the hurricanes, 
increasing their wind speeds by 20% to 25% and their maximum intensity by as 
much as 60%, according to computer models. 
</P>
<P>
"We can say with some confidence that the frequency of Category 4 and Category 
5 hurricanes (the most severe) will increase, but we can't say by how much," 
said meteorologist Richard Anthes, head of the university consortium that 
operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Sets Record 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean, 
Hurricane Gilbert with wind speeds of more than 200 m.p.h., occurred last 
September. But neither Gilbert nor Hugo can be definitely linked to global 
warming, researchers noted. "It's impossible to link one event to climatic 
change," Anthes said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are generally cautious in their predictions about the effects of 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to take something as complex as a hurricane and attribute 
changes to a single cause like warmer temperatures, simply because the 
atmosphere is such a complex mixture and there are so many physical processes 
going on," said Ohio State University atmospheric scientist Jay Hobgood, one of 
the researchers whose models are the basis for projections of hurricane 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of uncertainty and an awful lot that is not understood," 
added meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
another modeler. "But if ocean temperature goes up, the intensity of extreme 
hurricanes will go up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seat-of-the-Pants Feeling' 
</P>
<P>
And, said meteorologist Rainer Bleck of the University of Miami, there is a 
growing consensus among researchers that this is what will happen. But "that 
conclusion is not based on scientific results yet," he added. "It is more of a 
seat-of-the-pants feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The link to global warming occurs because heat is the engine that drives 
hurricanes. Strong sunlight heats both air and water near the Equator, causing 
a greater evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The warm, moist air expands 
and rises, creating a ring of low pressure and storms around the Equator known 
as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. 
</P>
<P>
As the moist air rises, it cools, causing its moisture to condense into clouds. 
But that condensation releases a tremendous amount of heat stored in the 
gaseous water, accelerating the heating and rising of the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starts With 'Kicker' 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists do not yet know under precisely what conditions hurricanes 
form, this condensation and heat release is the "kicker" that starts vast 
amounts of air climbing upward, drawing in ever-larger quantities of moist air 
from the ocean surface, Bleck said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Earth's rotation causes the fast-moving air masses to spin in a 
counterclockwise motion in the Northern Hemisphere or clockwise in the 
Southern. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricanes typically take five to six days to form, eventually spreading over 
an area of thousands of square miles and developing wind speeds that range from 
75 m.p.h. (the official minimum for a hurricane) to more than 200 m.p.h. The 
storms continue as long as they can draw warm moist air from the ocean. 
Hurricanes peter out when they pass over cold water or land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gases Trap Heat 
</P>
<P>
Climatologists predict that global warming -- caused by the accumulation of 
carbon dioxide and certain other gases in the atmosphere, which trap the 
Earth's heat like the panes of a greenhouse -- will cause both ocean and air 
temperatures to increase, perhaps eventually by as much as 10 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
A warmer ocean causes more water to evaporate, and warmer air can hold more 
water vapor. Both factors would increase the strength of hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you see in reality," Hobgood said. "If you have warmer air, warmer 
water, you do get a more intense storm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need More Research' 
</P>
<P>
The problem, he added, is that warming will not occur to the same extent 
everywhere, and other conditions caused by global warming, such as stronger 
winds at high altitudes, might mitigate some of the effects of heating. "We 
need to do a lot more research," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers did have one piece of good news. Hurricane Hugo will probably 
sap the strength of tropical depression Iris, which is following close behind 
it. It will probably also push Iris northward into the Atlantic, keeping it 
from striking the United States or islands in the Caribbean.
