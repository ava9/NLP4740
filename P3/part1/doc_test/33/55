HEAT TOPPLES RECORD AGAIN IN SAN DIEGO

San Diego County sizzled under record heat for the second straight day Thursday 
as soaring temperatures destroyed 50% of the strawberry crop and East County 
residents were advised to seek respite in the desert, where cooler weather 
prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said the heat wave should continue through the 
weekend, with relief coming on Monday, when a cooling trend is expected to 
bring patches of coastal fog early in the morning. Wilbur Shigehara, forecaster 
for the National Weather Service in San Diego, said there is a possibility that 
more record temperatures will be set today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the temperature hit 98 degrees at 3 p.m. at Lindbergh Field, 
breaking records for April 6 and the month of April. The old record for April 6 
was 89 degrees, set in 1939. The previous high for the month was 96 degrees in 
1910. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara predicted a high of 93 degrees for San Diego today, which would break 
the old record of 85 degrees set for this date in 1962. A high of 85 degrees is 
forecast for Saturday, which would also break the record set for that date, in 
1885. 
</P>
<P>
An SDG&amp;E spokesman said electricity consumption was up again Thursday. By 
3:30 p.m. the utility's customers had used 2,690 megawatts of power. On 
Wednesday, electricity consumption peaked at 2,538 megawatts. The all-time 
SDG&amp;E record for electricity use was set last Sept. 6, when 2,831 megawatts 
of power were used. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperatures were particularly grueling in the East County. Gillespie 
Field in El Cajon reported a high of 110 degrees, prompting Shigehara to issue 
the following advice: 
</P>
<P>
"If residents of Santee and that area want to escape the heat, they might want 
to think about going to the desert, where temperatures were slightly cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Desert readings were reported at 102 to 105 degrees Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Scorching temperatures also destroyed 50% of the county's strawberry crop, said 
Kathleen Thuner, county agriculture commissioner. According to Thuner, a county 
agriculture inspector recorded a pulp temperature reading of 110 degrees from 
one strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
"The strawberries are literally cooking on the vine . . . . The crop that has 
been lost is the fruit on the vine, not the plant. However, there has been some 
concern voiced by growers that they could suffer substantial plant damage if 
the heat continues," said Thuner. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials said it is still too early to estimate the dollar loss of 
the strawberry crop, which totaled about $21 million in 1987. Thuner said the 
Santa Ana winds have also damaged the fragile blossoms on the citrus and 
avocado trees. She said the yield from both crops will probably be smaller this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classes Canceled Again 
</P>
<P>
The record heat forced the cancellation of classes for the second straight day 
at two East County high schools. Students at Mt. Miguel and Granite Hills high 
schools only attended classes for four hours in the morning. A spokeswoman for 
the Grossmont Union High School District said the schools do not have air 
conditioning, making the classrooms "too hot and uncomfortable." Several other 
East County schools also canceled classes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the humidity reached a low of 9% Thursday, California Department of 
Forestry officials reported no fires in the county's outlying areas. Department 
spokesman Jim Van Meter said residents should heed a warning from the unusually 
hot April weather. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like people to take note of the upcoming fire season. Now is the time 
to prepare for the summer months ahead and people should clear a 30-foot 
clearance around their homes to lessen the danger from brush and grass fires," 
said Van Meter. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming fire season will be particularly dangerous unless the county gets 
a sudden surge of rain, said Shigehara. He said the county records about half 
its rainfall from January to March. However, the first three months of the year 
have been the 10th driest on record, going back to 1850, when rainfall records 
were first kept in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought and unusually high demand for water, Otay Water District 
officials said they might be forced to ration water if the heat wave continues. 
</P>
<P>
The current heat wave began Tuesday, when a high pressure developed over the 
West, pushing a blast of warm air into the Southland and blocking the usual sea 
breezes. The high pressure is expected to began weakening substantially by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the record high temperatures, lifeguard Matt Rowland said attendance at 
San Diego beaches was actually down from Wednesday. Rowland said about 40,000 
people went to the beaches Thursday, down from Wednesday's estimate of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said the cool spots in the county were Solana Beach and Mt. Laguna, 
where temperatures of about 80 degrees were recorded. Other hot spots included 
Miramar, 101 degrees; Montgomery Field, 98 degrees; Poway, 102 degrees; 
Coronado, 96 degrees; and San Nicholas Island, 97 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
El Toro Led the Nation 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, it was the third day of record-shattering heat. It hit 106 
degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday, the hottest day so far 
this year and the hottest April day on record. That toppled the old record for 
the date, set in 1962, by 15 degrees. It was the third day in a row that 
downtown readings topped 100. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro in Orange County, where the mercury climbed to 112, was the hottest 
spot in the country. Other Southland readings included 110 in Ontario, 107 in 
Monrovia and Palm Springs, and 105 in Long Beach, Westwood, Pasadena and 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime temperatures remained at record high levels too. Thursday's minimum 
reading at the Civic Center, recorded shortly before dawn, was 73 degrees, 11 
degrees above the 59-year-old record for the date. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was as dry as it was hot, with relative humidity ranging from a 
barely discernible 8% to a merely arid 34%. 
</P>
<P>
"And there really won't be any relief until next week," said Pat Cooper, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more heat Friday, in the low 100s from downtown, out through the 
valleys and into the deserts," she said. "Saturday will still be very warm, 
with more 100s downtown and in the valleys. Sunday will be just a little bit 
cooler, near 100. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't really begin abating until about Monday or Tuesday, when the 
highs will begin easing off into the 90s. And there's no sign of rain at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200,000 at Beaches 
</P>
<P>
Despite the oppressive heat, hospitals reported no noticeable surge in 
heat-related illnesses. But there were other problems -- stalled cars, closed 
schools, seared gardens, record power use and heat-related blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Play it cool," advised Dr. Edwin Newtown, a physician on duty in the emergency 
ward at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine if you went to the beach, where lifeguards said more than 200,000 
flocked to the sand and some of the more courageous tried a swim in the 
61-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
Cars overheated and fizzled out on Los Angeles freeways Thursday in what Sgt. 
Mike Brey of the California Highway Patrol described as a "vicious circle." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when they overheat, they're stuck in the fast lane," he said. "That 
slows traffic and that makes even more people heat up." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was especially acute Thursday in the downtown area, where 
converging freeways were sporadically jammed with stranded, sweating motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Brey offered one piece of advice that might not be popular, but it can keep 
your car from overheating: When stalled in traffic, turn off your air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electricity Use Up 
</P>
<P>
People turning up air conditioners in homes, businesses and public buildings 
pushed electrical consumption to near record levels for the third straight day. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said a peak of 15,101 megawatts was 
being used by 4 p.m., eclipsing the previous high set the day before of 14,282. 
Edison's all-time high is 15,987 megawatts, set Sept. 6 when the temperature 
reached 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also reported a new high for 
April of 4,785 megawatts, beating the mark set Wednesday of 4,541. DWP's 
all-time high of electricity use -- 4,991 -- was also set Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As the temperatures soared, DWP officials asked customers to delay the use of 
heat-producing appliances, such as stoves and dryers, until the evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered power outages were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's Ed Freudenberg said circuits overloaded by air conditioning caused a 
power loss to about 1,000 customers in the Westwood area Wednesday night. The 
power was restored before dawn, but at 9:20 a.m. Thursday about 800 of the same 
customers lost power again. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said none of the other outages were immediately linked to the record 
demands for electricity.
