Southern California's rainy big chill eased Monday, but the brisk holiday 
weekend storm that dropped more than two inches of rain and up to six feet of 
snow in local mountains did little to bring an end to the state's lengthy 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
Chill winds kept the high temperature at Los Angeles Civic Center to 59 degrees 
Monday, 10 degrees below normal but markedly warmer than Sunday's rain-doused 
55 degrees. At WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times, 
meteorologist Bill Hibbert said conditions will grow gradually warmer and the 
routine coastal cloudiness will resume by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the storm dropped 2.51 inches of rain at Civic Center, bringing the 
season total to 5.43 inches -- below both last season's mark of 7.22 inches and 
the normal rainfall by this time of 10.21 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take several more of these to do any drought-breaking," Hibbert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range forecast offers little optimism. A 60-day outlook by the 
National Weather Service predicted that rainfall would be marginally above 
normal on the West Coast. But Southern California, sitting at the lower edge of 
the "above normal" band, is less likely than the north to get that rain, 
Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next five days, temperatures are likely to return to the 60s during the 
day, but the nights will remain chilly, the meteorologist said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dumped up to six feet of snow on local ski resorts just in time for 
the holiday weekend, but it proved to be too much snow. Highways were closed to 
all but residents; would-be skiers and the resorts hoping for their business 
were forced apart by snow-clogged roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it was not much of anything," said Margaret Krajewski of the 
Snow Valley ski resort. Snow Valley, as well as other major sites, were forced 
to shut down Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very hopeful that it will be open tomorrow," she said. "Another big 
weekend and here we are." 
</P>
<P>
Krajewski said the three-day storm dumped almost double the amount of snow seen 
during most substantial storms. 
</P>
<P>
The storm's impact on other local roadways eased Monday, just in time for those 
vacationers who made it to their holiday destinations to start the long drive 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-mile stretch of Interstate 5, from Castaic to Kern County's Wheeler Ridge, 
reopened at 8 a.m. Monday, after being closed for 14 hours because of ice and 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
The closure came after a snowstorm degenerated into "whiteout" conditions, 
cutting visibility to as little as 50 feet, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. 
Scott Jones of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
During the closure, the CHP escorted caravans of 200 to 300 cars over the 
freeway about once an hour. Some drivers had to wait two hours before a CHP 
patrol scouting the roads declared that it was safe enough for a caravan to 
travel through, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks were banned from the road "because they have a tendency to get stuck the 
fastest," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 cars and trucks were stuck on I-5 before the CHP closed the roadway 
Sunday evening, and they remained stranded for three hours until state highway 
workers sanded the roads, Jones said. Two trucks jackknifed and some vehicles 
slipped backward on ice-covered roads before the closure, but no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, temperatures were still frigid and, in Reno, officials 
were still battling to dig out from the second-strongest storm recorded this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland reported a record low of 39 degrees Monday, five degrees below the 
figure set in 1983. Nearby Alameda also recorded a 39, tying a 41-year low. 
</P>
<P>
In Reno, however, residents awoke to a shivering 6 below zero -- which 
obliterated the previous mark of 7 above zero that was set in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
The storm that coursed across Northern California and Nevada dumped 21 inches 
of snow on the city's streets -- slightly less than a monster storm that dumped 
more than 22 inches of snow on Reno in 1916 -- and more than six feet elsewhere 
in the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Interstate 80 was open at midday, a day after a mudslide blocked the 
main artery between Sacramento and the Nevada ski resorts. The slide sent mud 
over all four lanes at depths up to 12 feet in places, and forced the closure 
of a 77-mile stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound lanes had reopened Sunday night, and one westbound lane was 
cleared for traffic at 2 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Hal Schilling said city workers and local construction crews 
brought in to aid the workers continued to shovel around the clock to make 
streets passable. 
</P>
<P>
The southern branch of the storm which left Southern California Sunday night 
dumped snow on Arizona as it made its way east. Up to two feet of snow was 
reported in southern mountains overnight, and the Arizona Department of Public 
Safety was forced to close a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 40 across the 
middle of the state because of heavy snow.
