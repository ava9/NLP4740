The slightly cooler weather that came to San Diego Friday and Saturday 
disappeared Sunday with the arrival of a weak Santa Ana that brought warmth and 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front late Thursday caused chilly nights, cloudy days and some gusting 
winds in San Diego, but the front, which earlier in the week had dropped some 
rain on the San Francisco Bay area, moved east out of the San Diego area late 
Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming Santa Ana, although weak and fleeting, raised Sunday's high 
temperature downtown to 80 degrees, 6 above normal, and to 70 to 75 at the 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Other warm sites across the county Sunday included Spring Valley and Fallbrook, 
90 degrees; Santee 88; Escondido, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Miramar, Poway, Vista 
and the Wild Animal Park 87; Alpine and Chula Vista 85. 
</P>
<P>
NWS forecaster Wilbur Shigehara predicted continued sunshine and days in the 
high 70s through midweek, and clear and cool nights as the Santa Ana slowly 
dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Today is expected to be sunny and warm, with a high of 79. Tuesday's forecast 
calls for more sunshine and a high of 77. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight and Tuesday night are expected to be clear and cool with a low 
temperature of 57. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Trudy south of Baja California will stir up the ocean surf slightly 
near San Diego for the next few days, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, the weather is expected to be clear though Tuesday, with the 
day temperature from 70 to 76 today, 69 to 73 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean winds are expected to be from 8 to 16 m.p.h., and the ocean temperature 
68 degrees, with the surf peaking at 4 feet at 10-second intervals, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal strip, the temperature will reach 77 to 84 Monday and 75 to 80 
Tuesday, Shigehara said. Overnight temperatures will be from 53 to 62, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland valleys will have high temperatures of 88 Monday and 86 Tuesday with 
overnight lows dipping to between 42 and 52, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains are expected to have temperatures from 64 to 72 through Tuesday 
as overnight lows fall into the low 30s, bringing frost in the coldest areas. 
</P>
<P>
Desert high temperatures will be 85 to 90 through Tuesday, the lows 50 to 60, 
Shigehara said.
