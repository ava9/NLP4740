Orange County baked for the second-straight day Wednesday as unusual weather 
conditions sent temperatures soaring into the record books. In Santa Ana, the 
high was 104, breaking a previous high of 84 set on April 5, 1904. 
</P>
<P>
According to county historian Jim Sleeper, the 104-degree reading on Wednesday 
also became the highest April temperature ever recorded anywhere in Orange 
County. Sleeper said the county's previous all-time high reading for any day in 
April was 101, recorded in Santa Ana on April 15, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Hot, dry Santa Ana winds also made for unusually high readings elsewhere in 
Orange County: 102 in Fullerton and San Juan Capistrano, and 101 in El Toro and 
San Clemente. Only Newport Beach, aided by coastal breezes, posted nearly 
normal temperatures for the day -- a high of 81, up from a low of 56.

Ontario Reaches 109 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Southland, Ontario was the nation's hot spot with a high of 
109 degrees Wednesday, and temperatures hit 103 in Long Beach and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the heat spell is expected to linger over most of the 
Southland until at least the weekend, although sea breezes could bring a slight 
cooling to coastal Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to be another hot day on Thursday, with near record temperatures," 
said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Sea breezes along the coast will be somewhat cooling on Thursday, but the 
first real relief in the heat for inland areas will not come until Saturday or 
Sunday," Dittmann said. "By Monday, there will be quite a bit of wind (in the 
Orange County area)." 
</P>
<P>
Officials for Santa Ana Unified School District, the largest in Orange County, 
announced that there would be slightly shorter class days today because of the 
continued hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
"None of our schools is totally without air conditioning, but we have 16 with 
partial air conditioning and 21 entirely air conditioned," district spokeswoman 
Diane Thomas explained. "Fans are used in classes without air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also said classes at some Santa Ana high schools are being held in shady 
areas, and elementary school children were having "quiet recesses," to 
discourage strenuous activity in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said the onslaught of summer-like temperatures may seem an aberration 
but is not totally unexpected. The season for Santa Ana winds, which blow 
desert heat toward the coast, usually lasts from September through April, he 
said, and "the later in the season they occur, the hotter the temperatures you 
get." 
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday, a strong high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere was 
stalled over the Pacific Northwest. That system, combined with a lower-level 
high-pressure system over the Great Basin states of Idaho, Nevada and Utah, was 
forcing warm air -- the Santa Anas -- to flow west toward a trough of lower 
pressure over the Pacific Ocean, Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said power usage in the Southland on 
Wednesday quickly eclipsed a record set only the day before. On Tuesday, 12,633 
megawatts were used, setting a new mark for an April day. But by 4 p.m. 
Wednesday, usage had passed 14,282 megawatts. Edison's all-time high is 15,987 
megawatts, set on a 110-degree day in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relief Sought at Beaches 
</P>
<P>
"It's all for air conditioning," said Don Bailey, regional affairs manager for 
the company. "Everybody's trying to keep cool." 
</P>
<P>
Others sought relief on Orange County beaches, under cloudless sunny skies 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of day we see in mid-July, not early April," said Lifeguard 
Jim Turner in Newport Beach, where about 45,000 people gathered at the shore to 
cool off. 
</P>
<P>
Major hospitals reported no unusual activity with heat-related ailments on 
Wednesday. But emergency room physicians at UCI Medical Center warned of 
hot-weather dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room physicians say that people should stay out of the heat, 
especially if they are very young or elderly," medical center spokeswoman 
Elaine Beno said. "People having any sort of health problems, such as heart 
disease or lung disease or being out of condition, should try to avoid being 
out in the heat. They also urged people to drink a lot of fluids during this 
hot period." 
</P>
<P>
In normally cool Huntington Beach, the temperature jumped to 90 degrees shortly 
after 10 a.m. on Wednesday,and by noon the temperature in Seal Beach was 94 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, the summer-size crowds that flocked to the beaches 
threatened to overwhelm the off-season marine safety staff, Lifeguard Lt. Steve 
Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
"With so many people coming to the beach this early, we're trying to put out 
warnings because we don't have as many lifeguards this time of year," Davidson 
said. "We're operating at a skeleton staff, and so we're warning people to be 
very careful, especially since the water is colder this time of year,and it 
makes people tire easier." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department officials on Wednesday expressed concern about 
dry brush in canyon areas and predicted another early start to the fire season. 
</P>
<P>
"Red flags are not out yet because fortunately there haven't been strong winds 
so far with this hot weather," Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond 
said. "We've been pretty fortunate so far. But it's very dry, and anything will 
burn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're warning people about matches and cigarettes. It looks as if we're not 
going to get any more rain (for the season), and so we face another critical 
year of extreme fire hazards." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, Wednesday's heat wave seemingly bullied everything in 
its path, from car engines to hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
At the Charles Ross Hair Design School in West Los Angeles, the few customers 
who braved the blistering heat to keep appointments arrived with 
weather-induced emergencies. They came with their flips flopped, with do's that 
didn't and sideburns that did, power bobs that lost their juice and permanents 
well on their way to becoming temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"Their hair designs are wilted," said William Towers, an instructor at the 
school. "When they start to sweat, the sweat relaxes the hairdos and they 
collapse. . . . We can fix them up in here, but when they get outside, they're 
on their own."
