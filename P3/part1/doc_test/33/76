Unusually hot weather for February raised temperatures into the mid- to high 
80s in Orange County on Sunday. The thermometer rose to 85 in Santa Ana, tying 
a record high for the date set in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler temperatures are predicted today and through the rest of the week, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's unseasonably warm temperatures even toasted some beach communities. 
The high in San Clemente was 82, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides 
weather information for The Times. In San Juan Capistrano, the temperature on 
Sunday soared to a summery 88. 
</P>
<P>
The balmy weather prompted thousands of people to flock to Orange County 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington State Beach drew about 10,000 people Sunday, according to Lifeguard 
Richard Rozzelle. "On a normal Sunday in February we'd get about 2,000 people 
max," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty warm for February, and the sun felt very, very nice. I was lying 
out in the sun myself during the morning." 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, runners entering the early-morning Spirit Run 5-kilometer and 
10-kilometer races at Fashion Island found themselves perspiring under the warm 
sun even before the races began. Normally runners can expect cool early-morning 
winter temperatures in Orange County -- especially in February. 
</P>
<P>
But according to WeatherData, Orange County had something like "July in 
February" over the entire weekend. "The high temperature in Santa Ana was 86 on 
Saturday," said Rick Dittman, a meteorologist with WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said mild Santa Ana winds flowed in over the weekend, spawned by a high 
pressure area over Nevada. Those warm winds, he said, added to a weather 
situation that already positioned Orange County for a balmy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a high pressure system in the upper levels, over Mexico, and a low 
pressure out in the Pacific," Dittman said. "That just helped create the fair 
weather over the last several days." 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said the high temperatures are predicted to slide back into the 70s 
locally today. "I don't think we'll have any more temperatures in the 80s for 
quite a while," he said. "The forecast calls for unsettled weather the rest of 
the week, with a chance of showers by mid-week."
