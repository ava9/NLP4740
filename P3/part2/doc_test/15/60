On the rabbit trail: Gary Wolf -- author of the 1982 novel on which "Roger 
Rabbit" is based -- is writing a sequel: "Who P-p-p-p-plugged Roger Rabbit." 
The book's about to be offered through auction to publishers, but Disney's 
already optioned film rights (for a possible 1994 release). 
</P>
<P>
This time, Roger and Jessica Rabbit have become movie stars (rather than 
cartoon stars), up for parts in a big picture. Then there's a murder -- and 
detective Eddie (Bob Hoskins in the original pic) is a suspect.

<P>
Meanwhile, a "prequel," "The Return of Roger Rabbit," is already in development 
at Disney as a 1991 production. Pat H. Broeske
