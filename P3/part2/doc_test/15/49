Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, co-founder of a private group that promotes 
high-technology rail transit, on Monday was awarded a $25,000 contract by the 
Orange County Transit District to produce a video promoting high-tech 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The OCTD board voted 4 to 0, with William E. Farris abstaining, to award the 
contract to Buffa, who owns a video production company. The contract, which was 
not competitively bid, carries the condition that Buffa must raise the 
remainder of the $75,000 production cost from other agencies in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers, a frequent critic of county 
transportation officials, criticized the contract as an example of government 
insiders' receiving favored treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth is an OCTD member who also is 
chairman of the California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, 
a bistate panel overseeing plans for a 200 m.p.h. magnetically levitated train 
between Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa has been a leading advocate of the train, and his video will include 
material about it, OCTD officials said. The video will also show light rail, 
monorail, people mover and automated highway systems. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Buffa accompanied Roth on a 10-day trip to Europe to ride a maglev 
prototype and the French TGV. 
</P>
<P>
"I deplore it," Rogers said of the contract decision. "They should not be 
entering into a contractual agreement with people who may be a factor in future 
votes. . . . It's the height of arrogance, and it leads to the appearance of 
impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he did not help Buffa secure the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not at the last (OCTD) board meeting where they went into an in-depth 
discussion about this," Roth said. "I don't have any problem with putting out a 
video about all forms of transit." 
</P>
<P>
Buffa is a co-founder of Transportation Alternatives for Southern California, a 
private group based in Newport Beach that promotes high-technology rail 
transit. Buffa also is a member of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor Agency, which is exploring rail transit for the median of a toll road 
now being built between MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach and Interstate 5 
near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Farris said he abstained because he had not seen backup materials supporting 
the video proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Orange County Transportation Commission drew fire for hiring 
Newport Beach Councilman John C. Cox Jr. as a lobbyist for Measure M, the 
half-cent sales tax proposal that was defeated 12 months ago and that appears 
again on today's Orange County ballot.
