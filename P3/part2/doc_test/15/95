Secrecy and suspense so surround the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee's 
25th Anniversary Premiere Night Party of the Pasadena Showcase House of Design 
that only party chairman Shirley Goldsmith, president Christina Varner and 
Brenda Owen, the anniversary benefit chairman, know the intricacies of the gala 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
We can tell you it's on a monumental scale with dancing planned until the wee 
hours. This year, says Linda Seiter, the committee goes to a reservation system 
for the Showcase public days next Sunday through May 21. That's because they 
couldn't control the flow of sometimes 53,000 people a year who come to the 
event in La Canada Flintridge. The phone number for reservations and tickets is 
(818) 792-4661, though reservations also are available through members, 
Ticketmaster outlets and the Music Center, P.O Box 1951, L.A. 90078.

CELEBRATION WEEKEND: Marlborough School's festivities for its many-faceted

Adams and Mary Adams Reinisch co-chair the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That includes the Alumnae Luncheon, co-chaired by Nancy McCullough; a 
Marlborough "Then and Now" musical revue with a cast of students, alumnae, 
parents and friends; a day of seminars headed by Daryn Horton and Chris 
Westwater, and alumnae brunches co-chaired by Suzanne Crowell and Bonnie 
McClure. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight will be the Gala Celebration planned by Pamela Mullin and Barbara 
Myerson. It's April 29, black-tie, at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum.

EVER ONWARD: In 1983, opera diva Dorothy Kirsten French created the French 
Foundation for Alzheimer Research to seek advances in scientific and medical 
research and provide model methods for caring for America's 3 million 
Alzheimer's patients. The result, in five years: $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy's husband, Dr. John Douglas French, the brain surgeon who founded the 
UCLA Brain Research Institute, died recently of Alzheimer's. His spirit 
emboldens efforts on the foundation's fifth anniversary gala May 7 at the 
Beverly Hilton. Pia Zadora, Dudley Moore, Norm Crosby and composer Bill Conti 
will entertain. Alex Trebek, "Jeopardy!" host, will emcee. First Lady Barbara 
Bush, a member of the foundation's honorary board, has accepted to be honorary 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Roy Anderson, former chairman of Lockheed, serves as dinner 
chairman; Bonnie Green is Founding Associates chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the foundation joined with Richard K. Eamer, chairman and CEO of 
National Medical Enterprises, Inc., to open the John Douglas French Center for 
Alzheimer's Disease in Los Alamitos -- the first free-standing center devoted 
exclusively to the care of Alzheimer's patients.
