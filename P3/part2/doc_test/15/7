All right, friends. Too late for office pools but just in time for Academy 
Awards parties, here are the Benson Oscar predictions, which come with the 
headstrong fearlessness of someone who has yet to win an office pool herself. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, I'll list the way I think academy members will vote first and if I 
disagree, my own immodest favorite. Reasons are given as much as practicable. 
Let's tackle the acting categories first. 
</P>
<P>
Best actor: Dustin Hoffman, because there seems to be a readable groundswell 
for him this year. My own choice would be Tom Hanks, who probably will suffer 
because academy members think it's too early in his career. Nonsense. The 
nomination was certainly for two movies, not simply one and when you consider 
"Punchline" as well as "Big" in the same year, we seem to be dealing with a 
huge and many-faceted talent. 
</P>
<P>
Best actress: Jodie Foster, from a hunch based on the affection I've seen her 
generate in appearances at various awards groups. She's regarded as a real 
Hollywood product, as a veteran and even, as one friend suggested, as the 
prodigal daughter come home again. And it is a phenomenal performance. My own 
choice, in a far less-seen and deliberately astringent film, is Meryl Streep in 
"A Cry in the Dark," who now seems to be able to throw away her formidable 
technique and come up with the pure essence of a character. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting actor: Martin Landau in "Tucker: A Man and His Dream," because it's 
a nice, safe, sentimental performance by a warmly regarded veteran. I shall 
never give up on Alec Guinness' performance in "Little Dorrit" myself, since it 
seems the distillation of a life's experience, on stage and off. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting actress: I think this is where the vote for Sigourney Weaver will go 
because I don't think she'll win in the best actress category. I guess, of the 
choices available, I'd go with Frances McDormand's delicate shadings in the 
indelicate "Mississippi Burning," although I wish enough of the academy 
nominators had seen Miriam Margolyes' Flora Finching in "Little Dorrit." Ah 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Best picture: "Rain Man" is all we hear, so it seems a safe-enough bet. For me: 
"The Accidental Tourist," whose humanity was a little less on display and thus 
a little more appealing, personally. And what a rainbow of performances it hid 
behind its quiet exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Director: Barry Levinson, for the reasons cited above. Also for the reasons 
cited immediately above, it pains me to make a personal choice from what seems 
a foreshortened field. I want "The Accidental Tourist's" Lawrence Kasdan to 
win, but he was not nominated. Deprived of that choice, I'll say Charles 
Crichton because comic charm is far too rarely encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Art direction: "Dangerous Liaisons" feels like the solid, showy pick that the 
academy might make. My heart, in this case, belongs to the less staid and 
classic but equally difficult "Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
Cinematography: Peter Biziou's work in "Mississippi Burning" seems to be the 
sort that academy members best remember. My own choice would be Sven Nyquist's 
multifaceted contributions to "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." 
</P>
<P>
Costume design: The extremely showy costumes of "Dangerous Liaisons," where you 
could practically picnic on those panniers and pluck every one of those 
diabolical roses, would seem to be aimed straight at academy members' hearts. 
For me: the exquisite restraint and beauty of "A Handful of Dust." 
</P>
<P>
Documentary features: Nice to know that the handful who voted in this category 
actually saw the films (they had to, or they would not have been given a final 
ballot). And since that is the case, I would think that Marcel Ophuls' "Hotel 
Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" would have made its singular 
impression on this thoughtful body. No quibble from me on that. 
</P>
<P>
Documentary shorts: "You Don't Have to Die," adapted from a young cancer 
patient's book addressed to children his own age would seem to be the winner 
here. The dark horse here would be "The Children's Storefront." I haven't seen 
the entire category; this hunch comes from (relatively) trustworthy friends who 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Film editing: You hear an awful lot of talk about "Die Hard" in this category, 
which may be the way the academy will swing. I think my own choice would be 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" 
</P>
<P>
Foreign language film: For a long while it seemed as though "Pelle the 
Conqueror" had a lock on this award. Now, one hears rumbles that supporters of 
"Pelle" and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" will cancel each other 
out and "The Music Teacher" will sneak through. Meanwhile, I'll be rooting for 
"Salaam Bombay!" 
</P>
<P>
Makeup: Let's be lighthearted and go with a double vote for "Beetlejuice" here, 
just as though Rick Baker ("Coming to America") didn't seem to be attached to 
this award like Velcro. 
</P>
<P>
Original score: John Williams is an even harder man to beat than Rick Baker, so 
this may be one place where "Accidental Tourist" wins. Two of the finest 
scores, Mark Isham's magical work on "The Moderns" and Peter Gabriel's 
superior, atmospheric music for "The Last Temptation of Christ," didn't even 
make the cut, so I feel vastly disinterested. If pushed, I guess I'd go with 
"Tourist" too. 
</P>
<P>
Original song: Could the academy resist "Calling You" from "Bagdad Cafe"? No! 
And I certainly couldn't either. 
</P>
<P>
Short film, animation: "The Cat Came Back," which is as lively as its old 
children's song, and even more fun. A double vote here. 
</P>
<P>
Short film, live action: Thin pickings this year.: "The Appointments of Dennis 
Jennings" might well be the academy pick, again on the hint of those who saw 
all three. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: Certainly, this is one of the places where the many virtues of "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit?" is recognized, no? Yes. A double yes. 
</P>
<P>
Sound effects editing: And again, I would imagine that "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit" would make its paw print here too. For me, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Visual effects: This gets down to imagination versus hard-core realism, but I 
think that "Roger Rabbit" may squeak by over "Die Hard." That would be my own 
vote too. 
</P>
<P>
Original screenplay: I think the voters will let poor old "Bull Durham" have 
its one chance in the sun here. But because I think its dialogue is more like 
great reading than great talking, my own vote slides over to "Big." 
</P>
<P>
Screenplay adaptation: Personally, this is the hardest one to psyche out. The 
Writers Guild went for "Dangerous Liaisons," which makes me think that the 
academy might too. It's hardly a secret that I am a great admirer of the work 
that Christine Edzard did in adapting "Little Dorrit" so, much as I love "The 
Accidental Tourist," I would defect here to writer-director Edzard. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it, bets for what has certainly seemed like one of the most 
lethargic and least interesting Oscar races in years. Just think of the furor 
that might have been stirred up if a few of the notable non-nominees had been 
in the running: combinations of actors or behind-the-camera artists from "The 
Moderns," "Dead Ringers," "Clean and Sober," "Clara's Heart," "Patty Hearst," 
"Eight Men Out," "Dominick and Eugene," "The Thin Blue Line," "Crossing 
Delancey," "Hairspray," "Punchline," "Stormy Monday," "Red Sorghum," "A World 
Apart," or even the great, ineligible "Wings of Desire."
