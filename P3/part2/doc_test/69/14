Amid assurances that the trip will be safe, Exxon officials announced Monday 
that they intend to tow to San Diego next month the oil tanker that ran aground 
off the Alaskan coast in March, causing the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank J. Iarossi said the Exxon Valdez will be 
brought from Alaska to undergo $25 million in repairs at the National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard on San Diego Bay where the Valdez was built in 
1986. Nassco President Richard Vortmann said the job will take about nine 
months and will create 300 new jobs at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are expected to repair an area in the ship's hull 700 feet long and 100 
feet wide, Iarossi said, which will require 3,000 tons of steel, about 10% of 
the ship's total steel weight. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the environmental concerns caused by the ship that spilled 11 
million gallons of oil when it struck a reef and polluted about 730 miles of 
shoreline in pristine Prince William Sound, Iarossi went to unusual lengths to 
offer assurances that the Valdez is now "environmentally safe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Truly Sorry' 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi began a press conference by saying that "we at Exxon are truly sorry 
for the circumstances that led to today's announcement." He said that both the 
outside and inside of the ship have been cleaned and all remaining oil removed 
from the tanks, clearing the way for towing of the ship to the Nassco yard. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past two months, we have been very active in clearing the oil residue 
from the tanks and exterior of the vessel," said Iarossi, who said that the 
Coast Guard has inspected the ship and certified that there is no oil in the 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Bill Ball, Coast Guard spokesman in Valdez, said that the ship's 
tanks "are fairly clean" and added that Coast Guard officials are currently 
reviewing Exxon's request for a permit to tow the vessel to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Safe Transit' 
</P>
<P>
"We have not approved a permit for the vessel to proceed just yet. . . . We're 
concerned that there is a safe transit with no chance for pollution," Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they expect to get towing approval later this month, and 
it will take four tugs about 20 days to tow the Valdez during the 2,500-mile 
trip. The tugs will follow a course that will keep the Valdez at least 100 
miles offshore, Iarossi said. The Valdez will not fire up its engines during 
the trip, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Anchorage, meanwhile, the former captain of the Exxon Valdez pleaded 
innocent Monday to Alaska felony charges of criminal mischief stemming from the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all three counts of second-degree criminal mischief, Joseph 
Hazelwood could face up to 15 years in jail and $150,000 in fines.
