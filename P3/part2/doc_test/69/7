The crude oil clotting the shores of Alaska's Prince William Sound mocks 
Washington's oft-made promise that oil development on federal lands and in 
federal waters will be conducted only in an "environmentally sound" manner. As 
late as Monday, Secretary of the Interior Manuel J. Lujan was vowing that the 
Bush Administration would forge ahead with exploration and drilling in the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska's North Slope in an "environmentally 
sound" manner. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that 8,548 tankers had successfully negotiated Prince William Sound in 
the past decade to load up at the port of Valdez lulled too many people into 
believing that the operation was so environmentally sound that it was immune 
from accident. The 8,549th tanker proved otherwise. The nation now demands a 
new definition of "environmentally sound." 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez did not become an environmental disaster just because the 
ship's captain may have been drunk and absent from the bridge. This was not a 
simple traffic accident. Veteran observers of the trans-Alaska pipeline system 
from its inception had said that if ever there was to be a serious accident, 
Prince William Sound was a likely site. 
</P>
<P>
There was no excuse, then, for cutbacks in the U.S. Coast Guard budget that 
made it impossible to fully monitor the movement of tankers in and out of the 
sound. There was no excuse for the failure to have adequate oil-spill equipment 
on hand in Valdez, and the trained personnel to use it immediately. There was 
no excuse for the failure to ring the ruptured Exxon Valdez with containment 
booms within the five hours that had been promised by the oil industry's 
accident contingency plan (It took a day and a half). There was no excuse for 
assuming that the worst likely spill would involve 200,000 barrels of oil or 
less. The Exxon Valdez hemorrhaged 240,000 barrels of Alaska crude and, but for 
luck, might have lost even more of its 1.2-million-barrel load. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to oil company officials, Interior Secretary Lujan said Monday: 
"If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails among the U.S. 
public, then we can kiss goodby the domestic oil and gas development in the 
(Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), off shore and in the public lands." But 
Lujan has it wrong. These are public lands and the first responsibility for 
seeing that development is conducted in an "environmentally sound" manner is 
that of the federal government. Rather, the government has been too much of a 
willing partner in exploiting them. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government cannot assume that the oil companies will follow every 
environmental stricture on their own. It must see that they do. The federal 
government cannot count on the companies maintaining adequate equipment and 
personnel to use in the event of a spill. It must insist on it, and inspect and 
test the gear frequently. The federal government cannot take for granted that 
the oil companies will react with alacrity when a disaster is in progress. It 
must be the primary watchdog and take control. These decisions involve the 
public's land, the public's waters, the public's wilderness shorelines, the 
public's fish, the public's waterfowl, the public's marine mammals. The 
public's interest must be protected and that can only be achieved by the 
public's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, echoing the oil companies, insists there is no connection 
between the Exxon Valdez and drilling the Arctic wildlife preserve. But 
physically, there is only one way to get the oil out and that is through Prince 
William Sound. Since Good Friday, the two are linked environmentally and 
politically. The Reagan and Bush administrations have conducted only the most 
superficial and optimistic of environmental assessments of the impact of 
drilling on the Arctic refuge, while promising that this industrial enterprise 
in the wilderness will be achieved in an "environmentally sound" manner. Since 
good Friday, those words are hollow ones. A skeptical nation will demand a new 
definition.
