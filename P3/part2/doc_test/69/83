<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A two-part study assessing the capability of escort tugs to control disabled tankers in Prince William Sound, Alaska,
was commissioned by the Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG). The study will specifically review the present
equipment, personnel, and procedures aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in Prince William Sound, as
well as the assist capabilities of the vessels presently in service for escorting these tankers. Part 1 of the study
has been completed, and the U.S. Coast Guard has been granted permission to make it available to the public. Certain
technical findings of this study will aid the U.S. Coast Guard in promulgating national-level tug escort regulations
under section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90).

In the aftermath of the EXXON VALDEZ grounding, the state of Alaska established a contingency plan that includes provisions
requiring laden tankers to be escorted through Prince William Sound. The escort vessels are expected to provide immediate
assistance to a tanker in the event it suffers a propulsion or steering failure. The escort vessels also have some spill
response capabilities. At present, there are 11 tugs and escort vessels in this service, operating out of Port Valdez
and escorting tankers to Hinchinbrook Entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG) was formed to review the present escort vessel practices in Prince
William Sound. The DTTSG is formed of representatives from the Regional Citizen's Advisory Council (RCAC) for Prince
William Sound, the Prince William Sound Tanker Association, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska Department
of Environmental Conservation, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DTTSG commissioned The Glosten Associates, Inc., to prepare a two-part study. The first part was to conduct an
expert review and evaluation of the emergency towing equipment aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in
Prince William Sound. The second part was to determine, by means of actual tanker/tug trials and computer simulation
analyses, the capabilities of the escort vessels to actually control disabled tankers.

Section 4116(c) of OPA 90 requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate issuance of regulations that define
areas where single hull tankers over 5,000 gross tons transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two towing
vessels (as defined under 46 U.S.C. 2101), or by other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. These defined
areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, Washington (including those
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Georgia subject to U.S. jurisdiction).
The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Coast Guard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard's regulatory response to this section of OPA 90 has been divided into two rulemaking projects: the
first project (CGD 91&hyph;202) focuses on the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters specifically identified
in the statute, the second project (CGD 91&hyph;202a) focuses on other navigable waters where escorts might be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to issue effective national escort rules, the Coast Guard finds it necessary to determine the realistic capabilities
of the various types of tugs that may be used for escort service. To this end, the Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS)
is expected to provide valuable technical information. In addition to its participation in the DTTSG, Coast Guard's
other actions to date have been as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 7, 1992 (57 FR 30058). Because the original public comments did not include sufficient information on certain
issues, the comment period was reopened March 26, 1993 (58 FR 16391), with a request for more-detailed comments on
some specified issues. Altogether, more than 100 public comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking public comment on other navigable waters where escort
vessels should be required was published April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25766). This ANPRM also requested detailed comments
on some specified issues. More than 45 public comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Three public hearings were held: in Anchorage, Alaska, on June 3, 1993; Valdez, Alaska, on June 5, 1993; and Seattle,
Washington, on June 7, 1993. Both Alaska hearings had teleconferencing arrangements to include outlying communities
in the Exxon Valdez impacted areas. All three hearings were well attended. Locally-interested parties, including
individuals and representatives of environmental, commercial fishing, and recreational groups, tug operators,
pilots, and tanker operators, made presentations at each hearing. Transcripts of the three hearings have been put
in files 43, 44, and 45 of Coast Guard docket 91&hyph;202a.

The Executive Summary from Part 1 of the DTTS, ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, Personnel and Procedures,'' is
reprinted here verbatim:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``This study has been undertaken by The Glosten Associates, Inc., to evaluate the existing capability for emergency
towing at Prince William Sound and to examine alternatives that could enhance the escort and assist capabilities
for disabled tankers within the waterway from the Alyeska Oil Terminal at the Port of Valdez to the Gulf of Alaska outside
Hinchinbrook Entrance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 1, reported herein, is an objective evaluation by an experienced salvage towing master of the existing tugs,
emergency towing equipment, towing practices, and discussion of alternate tug types. Part 2 will evaluate alternative
equipment and deployments, using engineering methods, including simulation, that could improve the safety or cost-effectiveness
of the response system.
