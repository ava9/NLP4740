</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon crews today finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker 
Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of North 
America's worst-ever oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it had finished transferring 48 million gallons of crude from the 
Exxon Valdez to three other ships. About 25 million gallons of oily waste water 
remained aboard the ship, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude 
into Prince William Sound when it struck a reef March 24. The company said 
crews will attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef 
at high tide Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes about 20 feet long in 
its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs.
