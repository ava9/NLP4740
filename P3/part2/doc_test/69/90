The Coast Guard's on-site commander of the Exxon Valdez oil spill told Exxon 
that its proposed cleanup plan was basically sound but ordered changes, 
including weekly progress reports. Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the on-site 
commander of the Alaska oil spill cleanup, ordered Exxon to provide immediately 
a detailed operations schedule for areas outside Prince William Sound, along 
the fouled beaches southwest of Valdez that include the spectacular Katmai 
National Park wildlife refuge. In Washington, Exxon USA President W. D. Stevens 
told a Senate committee that the company would deploy 1,600 more workers, plus 
more barges and boats, bringing to 5,000 the total number of workers involved 
in the shoreline cleanup.
