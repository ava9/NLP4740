If you're Irish a Fleadh is a party; if you're not Irish (perhaps even if
you are) it is falling flat on your face in a muddy field, making contact
with a rich undergrowth of detritus, and trying to avoid the rain while
waiting for some warmth, some raising of the spirits, by musicians from over
30 predominantly Irish bands.
Good things have been spoken of this annual hooley in north London, but
Saturday's event was only fitfully enjoyable. An English summer was at its
bleakest and Finsbury Park lacks natural grandeur. Even an appearance by
that well-known Irishman, Bob O'Dylan, failed to ignite the 20,000-odd
rather forlorn spectators.
Dylan was in one of his more bullish moods. He tried. And though not by
nature an Irishman you could somehow recall hearing his voice, that
confident cranking of a musical saw, replicated by some lone Paddy in the
bar of a Camden Town pub on a Saturday night. On my last viewing of perhaps
the most creative pop artist ever he was invisible, skulking in the shadows
of a stage and content with a perverse mockery of his talent. On Saturday he
was up front, blowing his harp with enthusiasm and duelling with his
guitarist in extrovert, imaginatively embroidered versions of 'All Along the
Watchtower' and 'Memphis Blues Again'.
The slower songs were less successful, enabling the man to take refuge in
his legend, but Dylan still sounds miraculously contemporary. He can find
relevance and rhythms in his music with the right aura to make a damp
depressing evening an occasion.
The Fleadh is a wonderful reminder of the Irish contribution to popular
music. Before Dylan on the main stage we had Irish high spirits, with
Hothouse Flowers, and Irish melancholy, with Van Morrison. Hothouse Flowers
lifted the crowd and got the arms waving. They may lack the character and
originality to become mega but as a snapshot for the 21st century of what a
mainstream pop band used to be like on stage they could hardly be bettered.
Morrison just goes on and on, his jangly, jig-like band acting as the ideal
counter point to his resonant, lived in, voice. He was in restrained,
spiritual mood, with songs like 'The Garden' rather than the old belters. He
came across as a genuine echo of an Irishman far from home.
