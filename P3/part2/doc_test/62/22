GROVE THEATRE SAYS IT WILL TURN PRO, SHORTEN ITS SEASON

The Grove Theatre Company in Garden Grove unveiled sweeping plans Thursday to 
go professional and to consolidate its 12-month season into 7 months, from June 
through December, with classical fare to be offered at both the indoor Gem 
Theatre and the outdoor Festival Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 10-year-old troupe offers a five-play amateur season of 
middle-brow programming featuring professional guest artists at the 172-seat 
Gem from October through May and, under the banner of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, a separately subscribed, semi-professional season of three 
Shakespeare plays at the 550-seat amphitheater during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, which will take effect this June, "will allow us to pool our 
production resources for both theaters, maximize our strengths artistically and 
financially and unify our marketing campaigns," Grove founder and artistic 
director Thomas F. Bradac said in an interview earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bradac said the consolidated season, despite being shorter, will present the 
same number of productions and performances as it currently does because "we 
will take a festival approach," mounting shows simultaneously rather than one 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the Gem, Grove officials announced the productions 
that will commence in June: "Romeo and Juliet," "The Two Gentlemen of Verona," 
"Twelfth Night, or What You Will," "Cyrano de Bergerac," Athol Fugard's "A 
Lesson from Aloes," "The Scoundrel" (an adaptation of Ben Jonson's "The 
Alchemist"), a play to be announced and the annual production of "A Child's 
Christmas in Wales." (See schedule on Page 26.) 
</P>
<P>
"By putting ourselves off-stride with the rest of the theaters in the county," 
Bradac said, "we will play to the strength we have already established in the 
summer. But it also enables us to get talented personnel without having to 
compete head-on for it because other theaters will be on hiatus when we're 
gearing up." 
</P>
<P>
A major change will be the implementation of an Actors Equity contract at the 
Gem, Bradac said. Under the provision for Small Professional Theaters, this 
would require that half the cast, and the stage manager, be union. Cast 
salaries, now under negotiation, have been recommended at $175 for a 
5-performance week. (The amphitheater would continue to operate under a current 
letter of agreement with Equity requiring five professional actors at $350 a 
week.) 
</P>
<P>
Grove managing director Richard A. Stein said the theater will underwrite this 
and other changes by increasing its annual budget to $660,000 in fiscal 1989-90 
-- up 16% from this year's $570,000. The theater will institute a modest rise 
in ticket prices and a new flexible subscription policy and will solicit 
private donations as well as public grants, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the company also will reap considerable fiscal benefits from the 
upcoming changes, principally by making its marketing and advertising more 
cost-effective in the effort to draw season subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The other changes include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new alliance with Cal State Fullerton. The college's drama department 
will provide rehearsal space and scenic and costume shop facilities that Grove 
lacks. In return, the theater will provide drama students with an internship 
program, utilizing them in non-Equity roles on stage and in technical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove used to receive financial and technical support from Rancho Santiago 
College. But that was withdrawn last year when the college decided to institute 
a semi-professional theater program of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Gem Theatre Youth Production Workshop to stage two plays from February 
through April, during the new season's "dark" months. A director will be hired 
to run the workshop, which will give hands-on experience for community actors 
and technicians ages 12 to 19. One of the plays will be chosen from the 
California Young Playwrights Program, operated by the Gas Lamp Quarter Theater 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the consolidation means we can run a single, coordinated (marketing) 
campaign that will be more concentrated," Stein said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said, the theater planned the indoor and outdoor seasons at 
different times of year and drew different audiences for each season, despite 
an overlap of about 600 subscribers. Thus, the theater had to prepare separate 
promotional literature and make separate mailings. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing everything twice was not only costly," Stein said, "it made no sense. 
Now we can also advertise in a way we couldn't do earlier. We can promote two 
plays at the same time. And our advertising dollars will stretch further." 
</P>
<P>
New ticket prices -- from $10 to $20 at the Gem and $10 to $23 at the 
amphitheater -- should not be prohibitive, Stein said. "Because we want to have 
as broad an audience as possible and do not want to disenfranchise anybody who 
can't afford tickets, we will maintain as low a bottom as we feel we can. And 
we will not increase preview prices." 
</P>
<P>
Single tickets currently run $10 to $17 at the Gem (including previews) and 
have run $15 to $18 at the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
The projected budget, to be financed by $467,000 in earned income and $193,000 
in contributed income, would allow for a decrease of 1,000 single ticket sales 
from last season's total of 13,500, he said, and would require an increase of 
only 200 season subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1,800 Shakespeare subscribers last year, and 1,600 Gem subscribers 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons will have a wide array of subscription choices: full season, indoor or 
outdoor, and a newly conceived "flexpass" providing admission to any of the 
plays in various combinations. "As Tom likes to say, we're going to make it 
very difficult for people not to subscribe," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Partial subscriptions will run as low as $30; a full-season subscription will 
cost from $70 to $149, and an eight-admission flexpass will cost $175. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of the season also will help the theater solicit donations by 
forging an image that is comprehensible to audiences and grant-making 
organizations alike, Stein said. He noted that fund-raising efforts already 
have gotten under way with substantial results. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Grove had "only a handful of corporate contributors," he said, 
with total corporate contributions of $8,500. Last year that grew to $87,000 in 
corporate gifts. 
</P>
<P>
A much-publicized funding crisis, resulting from the Garden Grove City 
Council's phase-out of a partial subsidy, spurred private contributions in 
1988. They soared to $180,000 from $47,000 the previous year, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Long-range changes still being contemplated include touring productions around 
the county, Southern California and beyond, Bradac said. "But they will not 
happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . We're taking things one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
