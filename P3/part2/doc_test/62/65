Daphne Du Maurier (1907-89) wrote three plays: the third, September Tide
opened in London in 1948 and is now at the Comedy Theatre in a joint
production with The King's Head, the Thorndike Theatre Leatherhead and the
Liverpool Playhouse. This brief Cornish sea tale is one sail short of a full
rig; but it is well acted and neatly paced.
Evan, a rumbustious Welsh artist of the Dylan Thomas variety, is
unromantically married to Cherry, a sulky, idle Chelsea art student. They
visit her mother, Stella, at her beach house in Cornwall; Evan falls in love
with his new mother-in-law, and the situation is further complicated by
Cherry's loutish brother and Stella's suave local suitor.
It is hard to tell whether this is a comedy: director Celia Bannermann's
problem is that Du Maurier's style is so open that any interpretation can
fit. The lines played as jokes pop up uninvited and unannounced: 'How do you
do, I'm mother,' says Stella to Evan, 'I've never had a son-in-law' and he
replies 'Perhaps I'll be the first of many.'
Du Maurier is at her best in stories which adapt well for the screen (Don't
Look Now, Jamaica Inn, The Birds) where her wonderful ability to create
atmosphere can be translated into images which have a vaguely menacing feel.
This show starts with a haunting tune from Eric Satie and ends with Stella
looking at the ferry which carries Evan away. In between there are
meaningful pauses over Evan's portrait of Stella and a warning about the
power of those September tides. In essence, this resembles Noel Coward's
Brief Encounter. One character declares love for another and the situation
becomes too too unbearable for both.
The acting carries the weakness of Du Maurier's plot. As the brawling Evan,
Michael Praed is superb: loose-limbed, quirky and passionate. His moods
shape every scene he plays. Opposite him, Susannah York as Stella is still
too distrait for a woman he would fall for; her best scene is alone on stage
waiting for him to tie up a boat during a storm, without speaking, she gets
across how worried she is that he might not return, and then hides her
concern from him when he does. Elsewhere, the cast seems less certain about
their difficult roles. Hermione Norris as Cherry is belligerent to a fault,
and Peter Byrne as Stella's suitor polite beyond belief.
Du Maurier originally called the play Mother, and based the central
character on Ellen Doubleday: it still bears the marks of that infatuation,
although Du Maurier protested that she was not a lesbian. What she has left
is a vacuum of a play filled by two good central roles.
