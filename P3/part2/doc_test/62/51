Not only arguably the worst rock 'n' roll movie of all time, but easily the 
worst Joe Eszterhas screenplay ever -- what better recommendation could a 
slap-happy masochist need for a hoot-filled night around the video camp "Fire"? 
If Bob Dylan is slightly credible as a washed-up rocker, try to picture blank, 
tuneless Rupert Everett as a Time magazine cover superstar whose awful 
techno-pop inspires New Kids-like hysteria, or Fiona as the 18-year-old airhead 
discovery -- coveted by them both -- who, magically, draws screaming sellout 
crowds to her very first concerts. Dylan gamely enunciates his lines but it's 
clear from his dazed look that he already realized what an incalculably 
embarrassing career choice he'd made. CHRIS WILLMAN
