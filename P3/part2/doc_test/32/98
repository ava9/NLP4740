ERMA BOMBECK: MR. &amp; MRS. SUPERMAN?; 
</P>
<P>
IT HAS A HOLLOW RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's always news when a bachelor of long standing gets off the dime and decides 
to take a bride. The world was atwitter recently when Clark Kent (a.k.a. 
Superman) proposed to the Daily Planet's star reporter, Lois Lane. Not since 
Prince Charles and Hugh Hefner decided to take their respective plunges has 
there been such a flap. 
</P>
<P>
I knew people were waiting longer to get married these days, but 50 years! Get 
outta here. I thought that kind of snap decision-making rested only with our 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
To tell you the truth, I don't feel good about this marriage. On one hand we 
have an aging crime fighter with one foot in the kryptonite. On the other, we 
have an old reporter who will not only have to jump-start her biological clock, 
but who has the mind of a food processor. (If Clark Kent takes off his glasses 
before climbing into the marriage bed, Lois won't even know who he is.) 
</P>
<P>
I hate to say it, but some people should remain in a single state. 
Personalities such as Smokey the Bear, Cathy, Miss Piggy and Warren Beatty are 
better off traveling alone. I'd hate to hear Barbie and Ken are getting 
married, despite the fact that all those little trousseaux that would be 
snapped up by indulgent mothers could put this country back on its economic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want Mary Worth saying, "I'd like to meddle in your life, dear, but my 
husband likes to eat dinner at 6." I don't want to hear a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtle say, "Jeez, my kid spilled oatmeal on my guitar strings," or that Mrs. 
Batman wore her husband's tights to aerobics and sprung a run in them. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow it's unnatural for Superman and Lois to be arguing about what kind of a 
phone booth they want installed at the house so he can change his clothes, 
AT&amp;T, MCI or Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
I can just imagine Lois' mother when she hears the news. "What do you see in 
this man?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mother, he's faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, 
and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not good enough for you, Lois." 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, please. I've been waiting for his proposal for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
"So, we're not asking you not to get married. We're just asking you to wait."
