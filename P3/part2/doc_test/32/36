Oh, those ubiquitous Muppets. The dynasty that Jim Henson hath wrought takes up 
the cause of music appreciation in "The Ghost of Faffner Hall," an ambitious 
new children's series that begins at 8:30 tonight on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
It all happens in a Gothic mansion called Faffner Hall, an institution 
dedicated to music. Residents include the Hall's founder, Fughetta Faffner, a 
ghost who loves music (even if it does tend to "solidify her ectoplasm"); the 
fat, jolly Wild Impressario, who plans the Hall's musical events, and hipsters 
Rif and Mimi. 
</P>
<P>
There are assorted penguins, fish, otherworldly monsters and the villain of the 
piece, music hater Farkus Faffner. 
</P>
<P>
Top-drawer, winsome guest stars are worked into each plot. Tonight's episode, 
"Your Body Is an Instrument," features Gary Karr, who says his double bass is 
his voice and "my voice is me"; Grammy winner Bobby McFerrin, whose body is an 
entire orchestra; and Swedish trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger playing an achingly 
beautiful solo. (The show's music is original.) 
</P>
<P>
In next week's episode, Nigel Kennedy, with his punk-rock look and young boy 
charm, shows the extraordinary range of a violin, while singer-songwriter Joni 
Mitchell is Wild Impressario's love interest. 
</P>
<P>
Created by producer Jocelyn Stevenson and based on a curriculum developed by 
two University of York professors, John Paynter and R. Murray Schafer, the 
13-part series is designed to inspire creative listening and show that all 
sounds can be musical. 
</P>
<P>
Does it all work? Surprisingly, no. It's watchable, the Muppet creations are as 
wild and wonderful as expected and the guest stars even more so -- they all but 
steal the show. (Future guests include Ry Cooder, Dizzy Gillespie and Ladysmith 
Black Mombazo.) 
</P>
<P>
But entertainment and education here are a lumpy mix; the pot needs more 
stirring. LYNNE HEFFLEY
