MINTON: THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF DESIGN &amp; PRODUCTION By Joan Jones
Swan Hill Press Pounds 70 391 pages
ON APRIL 30 1851 Queen Victoria enjoyed a preview of the Great Exhibition in
London's Hyde Park. She noted in her diary: 'We walked the whole round of
the galleries. We saw beautiful china from Minton's factory and beautiful
designs.' The Queen also maintained her well-established patronage of her
favoured Staffordshire pottery by purchasing an extravagant Minton dessert
service.
In many ways the Great Exhibition represented the coming of age of Herbert
Minton's company. His spectacular display was widely acclaimed for the
quality and diversity of his products and the new ranges, parian porcelain
figures and colourful majolica glazed earthenwares for example, provoked
excited comment.
International fame, business success and a clutch of medals were the fitting
rewards for a manufacturer who had been deeply involved in the planning of
this great event. Minton's enthusiasm for the venture was underlined by his
sponsoring it to the tune of Pounds 10,000, a risky investment that, in the
event, paid off handsomely.
Herbert Minton, that prime example of the Victorian enlightened
entrepreneur, died in 1858 but the company founded by his father Thomas in
1793 lived on, and is now celebrating its bicentenary. The event has been
marked by the publication of Joan Jones' history of this remarkable company,
a book that makes it seem extraordinary that this great pottery should be,
in relative terms, so little known.
Minton has been poorly served by history. This is only the third major book
written about the factory while Wedgwood has inspired over 50. Yet, in its
day, Minton was by far the better company whose products, more exciting and
more diverse, were respected worldwide.
This book is a rich survey of what Mrs Jones, curator of the Minton Museum,
optimistically calls Minton's 'first two hundred years' but the emphasis is
clearly on the Victorian period and this fills the bulk of the book.
The early Thomas Minton years of fine tableware production, in spite of
their obvious appeal to collectors, merely set the scene for the dramatic
expansion that followed, first with Herbert Minton and then in the hands of
his nephew, Colin Minton Campbell. These two showed how inspired leadership,
the pursuit of individuality and the willingness to take risks, backed by
adventurous design, were the perfect way to guide a business and keep its
products at the forefront of the international marketplace for over 60
years.
Even after they had gone, the impetus they had built up kept Minton at the
top of the pile for some time before the inevitable decline set in, a slow
downward spiral that led to Minton becoming a part of the Royal Doulton
Group in 1968. It has to be said that, from the evidence of this book,
Minton's second century, to 1993, does not look nearly as good as its first,
and it takes up only a fraction of the pages. Whether anyone will find
anything interesting to say in 2093 remains to be seen, but the signs are
not all that promising
What makes this book unique is the quality, and quantity of its colour
plates, and these are a constant seduction away from Mrs Jones' excellent
text. However, the point made again and again by both text and plates is the
power of design as a marketing tool.
Minton's strength in the past, and its commercial success, was due to a
series of remarkable marriages between art and industry. Some brides were
well known, the sculptors John Bell and Baron Marochetti for example, or key
figures such as AWN Pugin and Dr Christopher Dresser, along with Minton's
French imports, notably Leon Arnoux, their part director throughout their
most dynamic period. Others are little known today, unjustly buried in the
backyards of ceramic history.
The prime example is John Wadsworth, an inspired designer whose distinctive
style spans the Art Nouveau, Art Deco and post-war periods, a man whose
rightful place is with the great names of 20th century design.
Wadsworth also seems to have been the last outpouring from that
extraordinary well of creativity that made Minton what it was in the
Victorian period. What remains is, sadly, a glorious past of originality and
dynamic leadership submerged in modern concepts of brand name management.
