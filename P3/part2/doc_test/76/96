monetary conference delegates 'walk on air'

'Nice one, knight,' said the chief executive of an American bank to Sir
Dennis Weatherstone, the British chairman of the US bank JP Morgan. Sir
Dennis was walking down the aisle of a coach full of bankers as it prepared
to leave Buckingham Palace, where they had met the Queen.
In his speech at the dinner that followed, under the Rubens ceiling of the
Banqueting House in Whitehall, Sir Dennis said the assembled heads of the
largest banks in the world were 'walking on air' after being greeted by the
Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on Tuesday night.
Few passers-by would have realised that the 300 occupants of the five
coaches which had swept down The Mall from the palace were soinfluential.
The annual meeting of the International Monetary Conference was on another
leg of a discreet journey round the world's financial centres.
Last year Stockholm, this year London, next year Seattle. The heads of 103
of the world's largest banks use their annual meetings as an opportunity to
discuss their industry and to hobnob in private discussions and at dinners.
As they control several trillion dollars in assets between them, they are
also used to being treated royally. In Madrid in 1989, they were received by
the King and Queen of Spain. The reception at Buckingham Palace was
generally held to have topped that.
The conference is a meeting for bankers' spouses, too. In practice this
means wives, since the heads of the member banks are all male. The partners
have a chance to gain some excitement from their marital link to what many
privately say is a boring industry.
Thus, on Tuesday evening, the chairmen of two European banks were to be
found sipping champagne in a palace stateroom, jocularly comparing notes on
which bank had a higher return on equity. Their wives were standing nearby
discussing the best shops in the world to buy pearls.
In spite of its growing international membership, the conference has an
American feel, owing to its roots as an organisation formed in the early
1950s by American bankers to educate others in the profession about
international finance.
The conference has remained a favourite meeting for senior bankers because
of its small size. It is easier for heads of banks to find and chat to each
other in corridors and at lunches than at the vast annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
The last formal session was chaired by Mr Richard Thomas, chairman and chief
executive of First National Bank of Chicago.
Like others, Mr Thomas was in a cheerful mood yesterday in spite of the
fears over the future of banking expressed during the week.
This was because bankers were in a more optimistic frame of mind about their
economies than last year although he did not discount the effect of the
'very special' visit to Buckingham Palace. 'I contrast the tone with a year
ago, when everyone was very down about unemployment in Europe,' he said.
It will not just be Buckingham Palace that may linger in bankers' minds, but
a subtle British effort to persuade them that many UK traditions are worth
keeping. That was reinforced in a song by the King's Singers, composed for
the occasion and sung to the bankers on Tuesday.
'Glory be to the Deutschemark, and to the Yen, but mostly to the holy pound.
As it was in the beginning, before all this talk of a single European
currency, is now and ever shall be, Amen,' sang the group. The German and
French bankers laughed gamely at this harmonised propaganda.
