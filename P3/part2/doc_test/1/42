BRITAIN'S 'GONG SHOW' IS BOTH PRAISED, DAMNED; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: THE ESTABLISHMENT LOVES THE HONORS SYSTEM. CRITICS ARGUE THEY ARE RANK 
POLITICAL PATRONAGE.

Insiders call them "gongs." The Establishment says they are recognition for 
service. Critics argue they are rank political patronage. The Times of London 
writes that they are "a regular British farce." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the view, the venerable British honors system is still going strong -- 
and controversially. It is praised by some as rewarding endeavor for the 
nation; damned by others as a corruption at the heart of government. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refueled the running argument in her 
Resignation Honors List in December by naming to the House of Lords people 
whose chief virtue was the size of their monetary contributions to the 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
She also recommended for honors Fleet Street editors whose newspapers are 
distinguished solely by the fervor with which they supported the prime minister 
when she was in power. 
</P>
<P>
As the Times described the Thatcher list: "It was an odd mixture of financial 
and media backers and cronies, together with hard-working assistants, the 
'honor' done to the former tainting that was done to the latter." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Thatcher (who can be addressed as Lady Thatcher since her husband was 
made a baronet), apparently avoided a scandal like that which attended the 
infamous 1976 resignation honors list of Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson, 
who ennobled and knighted men later indicted for various crimes. 
</P>
<P>
British honors are regularly awarded twice a year by the monarch, with the vast 
majority of nominees made by the prime minister and at the New Year and on the 
queen's official birthday. The lists sometimes number more than 2,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent, announced late Sunday, included a life peerage for mystery 
novelist P. D. James and a knighthood for actor Ian McKellen. Romance novelist 
Barbara Cartland was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight. 
</P>
<P>
Additional honors lists come when a prime minister resigns or Parliament is 
dissolved. Most honors are accompanied by medals, hence the nickname "gongs." 
</P>
<P>
People are nominated for honors through a complicated system of civil service 
committees, which act before the names reach the prime minister's office and 
ultimately the palace. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, of course, is not unique in dispensing honors and gongs to deserving 
(or undeserving) citizens: Most countries have such sought-after baubles. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, for instance, has the Medal of Freedom and lesser awards for 
recipients, who range from former Presidents to Nobel scientists to 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
The French have varying degrees of the Legion of Honor, created by Napoleon, 
who said that men would fight and die for bits of ribbon. Germany has replaced 
the famed Iron Cross with the Federal Service Cross, in several degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no country has quite the array of honors that a British queen can bestow 
upon her subjects -- and also upon nationals of other nations, people like 
former President Ronald Reagan and Ireland's Bob Geldof, a rock musician and 
famine-fund raiser, who were awarded honorary knighthoods. 
</P>
<P>
Honors range from peerages and knighthoods at the top of the scale to MBEs 
(Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) and BEMs (British 
Empire Medal) at the lower level. 
</P>
<P>
When the Beatles received MBEs in 1965, other recipients of the award sent back 
their gongs in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Peerages (usually life barons) and knighthoods (known as a "K") generally go to 
retiring political, government, and military officials as well as heavy 
contributors to the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
From a certain British point of view, one virtue of a peerage (Lord Smyth) or 
knighthood (Sir John Smyth) is that the wife of the recipient may formally be 
addressed as Lady Smyth instead of Mrs. Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in between orders of knighthoods come those awards more truly 
concerned with achievement: the Order of Merit, limited to 24 members, and the 
Companion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
Towards the lower end of the scale, awards are given to sports figures like 
snooker champ Steve Davis and England soccer coach Bobby Robson, and to 
government retainers for a lifetime of dedicated service: a doorman at No. 10 
Downing Street or a personal maid at Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most numerous awards in the Queen's List go to middle-level 
government employees: heads of city government, assistant ministers in 
departments, serving officers and diplomats, postmasters, police officers, 
senior teachers and those involved in charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
All recipients of awards are entitled to put the initials after their names in 
descending order of precedence. Hence, former Foreign Secretary Lord 
Carrington, KG (Knight of the Garter), CH (Companion of Honor), KCMG (Knight 
Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George), MC (Military Cross), PC 
(Privy Counselor). 
</P>
<P>
Most royal orders have several degrees: The Order of the British Empire, for 
instance, has Knight (or Dame) Grand Cross, Knight Commander, Commander, 
Officer, and Member. 
</P>
<P>
When author Nancy Mitford was given a CBE, she remarked: "I didn't think there 
was a BE any longer." 
</P>
<P>
The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George is generally 
reserved for foreign service officers. The degrees are referred to around the 
Foreign Office, in ascending order, as CMG (Call Me God); KCMG (Kindly Call Me 
God); GCMG (God Calls Me God). 
</P>
<P>
The top order of knighthood is The Most Noble Order of the Garter, founded in 
1348, whose 24 members are personally selected by the queen, and include former 
Labor Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. 
</P>
<P>
One gruff old duffer who was a friend of the Royal Family, on being named a KG, 
reportedly remarked: "What I like about it is there's no bloody nonsense about 
merit." 
</P>
<P>
Most recipient of honors receive them personally from the queen in an 
investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace that may come several weeks after the 
announcement, depending on the numbers of the awards and her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Though egalitarian critics may deplore it, the honors system follows a hallowed 
British tradition: The aristocracy itself is based on the fact that monarchs 
have always rewarded favorites -- competent or not -- with titles, lands and 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the custom of awarding knighthoods can be traced back to the 9th 
Century under King Albert the Great. On inheriting the crown in 1603, James VI 
of Scotland created 906 knights within four months, dubbing 46 before breakfast 
on one morning alone. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this century, Prime Minister David Lloyd George openly sold honors as a 
way of raising funds for his Liberal Party. His bagman, Maundy Gregory, 
flagrantly listed the going rate for peerages at 100,000 pounds, then about 
$500,000; baronetcies (heredity knighthoods) at 30,000 pounds, and knighthoods 
at 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting uproar led King George V to declare Lloyd George's freewheeling 
style with honors an insult to the monarchy, and a Political Honors Scrutiny 
Committee was set up to evaluate submissions. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor governments also did not award heredity peerages but created only 
barons for life; the title does not pass through the male line as is customary 
for lords. 
</P>
<P>
Peers sit in the House of Lords and range from dukes, through marquesses, 
earls, viscounts and barons. Sir Winston Churchill, KG, was reportedly offered 
a dukedom but declined in order to sit in his beloved House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher restored the practice of granting honors for political service to 
faithful Tory party retainers and contributors, and she also recommended three 
heredity peerages: the traditional earldom for former Prime Minister Harold 
Macmillan (Wilson and Callaghan accepted only life peerages) and viscountcies 
for former Deputy Prime Minister William Whitelaw and former Speaker of the 
House George Thomas.
