MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday hit back at criticism in Lady
Thatcher's memoirs, and urged the media to stop comparing him with his
predecessor.
Speaking in Cyprus, at the end of the Commonwealth conference, Mr Major said
he had not read Lady Thatcher's book, The Downing Street Years.
But he said her claim that he 'drifted with the tide' as chancellor related
to the debate about joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System.
He said: 'If I was drifting with the tide, so was the Conservative party,
the Labour party, the Liberals, the CBI, the trade unions and most economic
opinion in this country and across Europe. So I had plenty of company on the
raft.'
In his strongest comments yet on the continuing friction with the former
prime minister, Mr Major virtually accused the media of creating divisions
where none existed. 'There is no doubt whatever that Lady Thatcher wants the
Conservative government to succeed,' he said on BBC Radio. 'She has made
that clear. I have made that clear.
'We both face a problem. Every time Lady Thatcher says anything, colleagues
of yours in the media crawl over it to see if some interpretation can be
placed upon it that causes difficulty for the government.
'Every action I take, people crawl over it to see if Lady Thatcher might
have done it the same way.'
In a conscious effort to place Lady Thatcher firmly in the past, Mr Major
said the world had 'moved on' in the three years since he replaced her as
prime minister.
He said: 'The problems we face have moved on and some of the ways we have to
address problems have moved on. Looking back over our shoulder all the time
is not the way to conduct government.'
Mr Major refused to say whether the party whip would be withdrawn from
Conservative MPs who vote against the government in the coming session of
parliament.
But he said the party had demonstrated clearly at this month's conference
that MPs were expected to support the government on 'principal areas of
policy'.
