FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: Major rethink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As their continental brethren survey the shards of the EMS, British
politicians have been exceeding even their usual propensity to rewrite
history with the latest round of 'I told you so's'.
Euro-enthusiast Kenneth Clarke indulged in it on the way to Brussels on
Sunday, while John Major recalled his warning last autumn of the
'fault-lines' which had led to sterling's ejection. Anyone would have
thought the lot of them had stage-managed Black Wednesday down to the last
second - instead of spending oodles of taxpayers' money trying hopelessly to
man the defences.
Lady Thatcher, by contrast, has something of a genuine claim to gloat.
Observer recalls an animated conversation with the Iron Lady more than three
years ago when she detailed how German reunification would rip the system
apart. But she will be disinclined to trumpet her prescience; it was, after
all, she who failed to talk her then chancellor, Major, out of the idea,
hence landing Britain in there in the first place.
