WAS at 3.33pm precisely that yesterday's keenly awaited Lords debate on
Maastricht began to crackle.
That was the moment when Lord Jenkins of Hillhead - in vintage form - took
his life in his hands and trained the full force of his inimitably caustic
wit on the Lady whom everyone had come to see.
Poking fun at the 'unusual assurance' with which the 'deadly' nature of her
speech had been trailed, the former Labour chancellor and SDP founder did
not mince words in describing her opposition to Maastricht as 'mystifying'.
Not only was she responsible for Britain's adherence to the invasion of
sovereignty known as the Single European Act, he ventured. But she had
pushed it through the Commons with 'the strongest of whips'.
In the hothouse atmosphere of the Commons, Lady Thatcher (for it was she)
would probably have intervened there and then. As it was, we had to wait a
few minutes for her inevitable riposte.
She was, she said, 'somehow under the impression' that things were less
lively, more courteous and much less robust in the Lords. 'I find it is not
so. And I'm delighted.'
That was what the crammed spectators' galleries, the peers squatting
inelegantly on the steps leading up to the linen-sheathed throne and the
groups of MPs including Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior minister, had come to
hear.
The former prime minister's speech - beginning just before 4pm and lasting a
densely-packed 25 minutes - was just the fifth contribution in a highly
charged debate expected to stretch deep into the small hours of Wednesday
morning.
With a record 130 or so requests to speak, the speakers resembled a
distinguished Who's Who of prominent figures in the Commons and beyond from
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s: Lord Thorneycroft, a former Tory party chairman,
was followed by Lord Jay, a former Labour Treasury minister. Former
Conservative cabinet minister Lord Parkinson, and former deputy prime
minister Lord Howe were followed by Lords Pym and Gilmour, themselves former
members of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.
With no vote expected until the committee stage later this month, the focus
was, unusually for a Maastricht debate, on what people said and not the
behind-the-scenes manoeuvring in the whips' offices.
It is during this committee stage that the acid-test for the government
posed by a Lords vote on a Maastricht referendum is expected to come.
If their lordships supported such a move, then the government - already at a
low ebb - would be forced into the highly embarrassing exercise of getting
MPs to vote the proposal back out again before departing for their summer
holidays.
The Commons has already voted against a referendum once during the more than
200 hours MPs devoted to scrutinising the Maastricht bill.
After her galvanising start, Lady Thatcher's speech was regarded by many as
less deadly than billed. Though by no means devoid of the usual martial and
pugilistic imagery, it was long on detail and short on soundbites - at least
prior to her concluding and passionate demand for a referendum.
'I think she lost the House at times,' said one Euro-sceptic peer, joining
the stampede out of the chamber that greeted Lord Boston of Faversham - the
unfortunate sixth speaker in the debate.
But Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, was on hand to
fly the Euro-sceptic flag. 'She outlined clearly and precisely that
democracy was dead if (Maastricht) goes through,' he said. For sheer
emotion, it was impossible to beat the succinct eight-minute contribution by
the 84-year-old Lord Tonypandy, the former Speaker.
'Britain wants a referendum and she deserves it,' he proclaimed, his arms
flailing. 'I believe the sovereignty of our country is at stake.'
