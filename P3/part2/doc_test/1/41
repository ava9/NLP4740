FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Docklands was Heseltine's, not
Thatcher's, vehicle

Sir, Peter Marsh has walked London Docklands and interviewed residents
('Tales from London's rebuilt river bank', November 26/27). However, if he
thinks that the London Docklands Development Corporation 'was established as
a Thatcherite vehicle', he still has some way to go. Mrs Thatcher was not
remotely interested in inner city regeneration.
It was Michael Heseltine in Docklands, just as it was in Liverpool; and he
deserves a place in history for it, because the alternative, probably much
dearer to the Iron Lady's heart, was to leave the place to rot.
The resident he quotes as gesturing towards Canary Wharf and commenting:
'It's all shit. I wish the IRA would blow it up,' can perhaps be left to
stew in his own can of beer, which Mr Marsh describes him as putting down to
give us the benefit of his views. But the others who complain that they
haven't received any advantage from the new jobs in Docklands deserve more
thought.
There is an impression in the article that it is the job of government to
persist with what cannot continue: that if docks close, then further
unskilled work should be conjured up, without people being required to learn
new skills, or indeed any skill at all for the first time. This is simply
not true. Unskilled work has dried up all over the west, and that includes
London Docklands.
The 1960s local authority architecture which Mr Marsh castigates is, indeed,
horrible. Unfortunately, it was a characteristic of Labour councils at that
time to employ architects who liked nothing better than to put up concrete
tower blocks, while taking good care to live in pretty Georgian houses
themselves. It is a matter of note that the LDDC, from its inception in
1981, has taken care to foster a more human scale of architecture.
