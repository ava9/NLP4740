US president Bill Clinton yesterday agreed to the deployment of Patriot
missiles to South Korea as a 'purely defensive' move and said the US would
defend South Korea against attack from the communist north.
Mr Clinton's assurances followed defiant statements from Pyongyang claiming
that US demands for further inspections of nuclear sites were 'perfidious
acts . . . creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula, which may
bring the Korean nation back to the phase of confrontation and war'.
Pyongyang's tough language has prompted concern in Seoul and accelerated
plans for the deployment of Patriots. But the US, while making a show of
toughness, is allowing time for a diplomatic solution. The Patriot missiles
will be sent to South Korea by sea, a voyage that could take as long as
30-45 days.
In response to the mounting tension with North Korea, Mr Clinton said: 'We
have agreed that it is in our national interests and the interest of the
people of South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to proceed
with the Patriot deployment. So we will do that.' Mr Clinton did not
disclose the dates of the deployments or the numbers of missiles involved.
In a letter to President Kim Young-sam, Mr Clinton also said that the US
would defend South Korea if it is attacked by the North.
Pyongyang yesterday maintained its defiant stance against concerted
international pressure to open its nuclear sites to full inspections. North
Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if
the US resumes its annual military exercise in South Korea and if the
International Atomic Energy Agency decides that North Korea has not complied
with its nuclear obligations.
The IAEA is likely to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN
Security Council today after Pyongyang last week blocked inspection tests by
the agency at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. The UN Security Council may then
consider economic sanctions on North Korea.
Leaving room for Pyongyang to avert an international crisis, the IAEA called
on North Korea to allow the agency's inspectors to undertake meaningful
tests at a radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon, north of the capital, and
at other sites.
After belligerent statements at the weekend, the North yesterday accused
South Korea of 'driving the North-South relationship into a situation of
confrontation and war', after the collapse of inter-Korean talks on the
proposed exchange of presidential envoys.
Seoul also resumed preparations for the Team Spirit military exercise,
although a decision on its timing has been delayed until President Kim
Young-sam discusses the situation on the Korean peninsula with Chinese and
Japanese leaders later this week.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said US policy would take
account of all the risks, but stressed that some form of international
action was necessary to combat nuclear proliferation. He insisted that China
would co-operate with US strategy because it was in its own best interest.
In Moscow, the foreign ministers of Russia and Japan added their countries'
support to the IAEA.
