  [Text] In his interview with the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN, Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], confirmed that North Korea is now 
constructing another nuclear reprocessing facility within the 
complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. 
  In an interview with the paper, Director-General Hans Blix, 
who is now staying in Japan, said that he could not know when 
the facility would be completed, but when it is built, North 
Korea's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used 
for a nuclear weapons program -- would double. 
  Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to 
inspect 
two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the 
IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal] of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.
