US officials expressed caution yesterday that the latest talks between
Washington and Pyongyang would find an acceptable solution to North Korea's
suspect nuclear programme. The open-ended negotiations resumed last Friday
after a month's suspension following the death of North Korea's President
Kim Il-sung.
Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, said on Monday
his government was prepared to freeze its nuclear activities in return for
being given light water nuclear reactors. These are more proliferation
resistant than North Korea's graphite moderated reactors which produce
plutonium that can be used to build atomic bombs.
However, a senior US official involved in the talks said yesterday that,
while the West had an interest in helping North Korea switch to a less
proliferation-prone nuclear technology, any help was conditional on
Pyongyang's full compliance with international nuclear inspections under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would include checks on two storage
sites which the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects may hold enough
undeclared weapons-grade plutonium to make a bomb.
The official said North Korea continued to oppose inspection of these sites,
at the Yongbyon nuclear complex north of Pyongyang, claiming it has
'suspended the effectuation' of its NPT membership. 'The North Koreans have
an obligation to fulfil their safeguards agreement' with the IAEA, the
official said. 'The world shouldn't have to pay for that.'
North Korea, which first indicated interest in LWRs during talks with the US
in July 1993, says it needs 1,000MW of nuclear generating capacity, about
half its power needs, at an estimated cost of Dollars 2bn. LWR technology is
widely available in the west and in Russia, and the US has already sounded
out Japan and South Korea for help with funding the programme.
To obtain the LWRs, North Korea would have to agree not to reprocess the
fuel rods already withdrawn from its small experimental nuclear reactor,
which the US fears could provide enough plutonium for four atomic weapons.
It would also have to agree not to reload the reactor with fuel and to halt
construction of two bigger graphite moderated reactors with capacities of
50MW and 200MW.
Mr Kang indicated on Monday that Pyongyang would seek compensation for the
power supplies lost as a result.
He also said North Korea had put forward proposals for treating the 8,000
spent fuel rods now corroding in a holding pond at Yongbyon 'in such a way
that can make the international community feel easy about it'.
The official said he thought Pyongyang was negotiating more seriously than
before as a result of the US push in June for United Nations economic
sanctions against North Korea. But 'they are difficult people to talk to,
these are complex issues to deal with, and I can't say I see the light at
the end of the tunnel'.
