SUMMARY 

                                Pyongyang has used the occasion of rejecting a UN statement on 
the North Korean nuclear inspection issue to reinforce its 
earlier hints of a willingness to negotiate with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue.  However, 
North Korea also warned that should the United States persists in 
applying "pressure" on the DPRK, it would resume reprocessing 
activities. 

                              END SUMMARY 

   Pyongyang seems to be underscoring an earlier hint that it might 
be willing to try to resolve its differences with the IAEA in 
talks with the IAEA itself.  This new hint of openness to DPRK- 
IAEA talks came in a 4 April DPRK-Foreign Ministry spokesman's 
statement ostensibly designed to reject a statement by the 
president of the UN Security Council calling on the DPRK to allow 
IAEA inspectors to complete their unfinished inspection 
activities in North Korea (Pyongyang radio, 4 April).  While 
accusing the UN Security Council of "politicizing" the North 
Korean nuclear issue, the spokesman's statement contended that, 
whatever "differences of views" that may have arisen in the 
course of recent IAEA inspections of North Korean nuclear 
facilities, they should be settled "strictly between" the IAEA 
and the "inspected country." 

   The 4 April North Korean statement, in line with most earlier 
North Korean pronouncements on the nuclear issue, also contained 
a threat that seemed designed to show that Pyongyang will not 
back down under U.S. pressure.  Thus the statement accused the 
United States and "some Western powers" of using the UN Security 
Council as a forum to apply pressure on Pyongyang, claiming that 
the Security Council based its discussions on the "unjust and 
biased" findings of the IAEA Board of Governors.  Once again 
blaming Washington for "deliberately aggravating" the situation 
in its quest to "crush" Pyongyang, the statement warned that 
Washington's "total reliance" on pressure tactics has given 
Pyongyang "no choice but to conduct" unspecified "peaceful 
nuclear activities" that it had "unilaterally frozen" in order to 
promote high-level bilateral talks with Washington.  Those 
nuclear activities presumably include the refueling of the 
controversial 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, with resultant 
spent fuel made available for plutonium extraction.  The 
statement, however, failed to call for concrete action on 
anyone's part.(SEE NOTE) 

   (NOTE: By contrast, the 10 April 1993 Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's statement that was issued in reply to an 8 April 1993 
UN Security Council president's statement on the North Korean 
nuclear issue called on the Security Council to take "practical 
measures" to promote direct negotiations between Pyongyang and 
Washington to resolve the issue.) 

   Implications     The absence of a call for specific action in the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement seemed designed to convey 
the impression that Pyongyang, having urged Washington to take 
unspecified steps to restore the "foundation" of bilateral talks, 
is awaiting Washington's next move.
