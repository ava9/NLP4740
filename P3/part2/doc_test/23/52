  [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- A team of three inspectors 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing 
for Pyongyang on Tuesday [17 May] to undertake inspections of a 
North Korean nuclear power station at Yongbyon. 
  The team is expected to monitor the refueling of a 
5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor and inspect a nuclear laboratory 
suspected of producing nuclear weapons at Yongbyon near 
Pyongyang. 
  Team leader Olli Heinonen disclosed little to journalists 
about his mission as he prepared to leave Beijing's capital 
airport. 
  "You know our rules are such that we have to evaluate the 
results, and we take samples and we analyze them and after that 
we tell what we think. So there will be no comment whatsoever," 
he said. 
  Heinonen said the inspections will last about a week. 
  The (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) said Saturday 
the fuel rod replacement has begun and the seals on the 
reactor's fuel rods have been broken. 
  Such moves would be in violation of agreements between the 
IAEA and North Korea, an IAEA official in Vienna said, and could 
signal the recall of the inspectors. 
  Removal of the seals would make it impossible to determine 
whether plutonium has been diverted to North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons program, experts said. 
  The inspection team has been sent "to see for ourselves," 
Heinonen said. 
  The IAEA and the United States have been involved in 15 
months of drawn-out negotiations with North Korea to verify the 
extent of its nuclear program and to confirm whether or not the 
Stalinist state has developed a nuclear weapon. 
  An IAEA inspection group also led by Heinonen were refused 
entry into the Yongbyon Laboratory during an inspection tour 
last March, which led to further calls for UN sanctions against 
the North.
