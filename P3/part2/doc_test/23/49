  [Text] Paris, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Hans Blix, 
secretary-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), said Sunday that the IAEA will reject a meaningless 
inspection that cannot confirm if North Korea has transferred 
its nuclear materials since the last IAEA inspection in Yongbyon. 
  The North Korean nuclear problem is not only the most 
sensitive issue related to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) but the most delicate issue politically also, the French 
daily LIBERATION quoted him as saying. If IAEA inspection is 
always blocked, like in North Korea, the problem is very 
serious, he said. 
  North Korea allowed the IAEA to inspect its seven declared 
nuclear facilities in January last year for the last time before 
it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty in March. 
  The IAEA is demanding from North Korea the same inspections 
of its seven declared nuclear facilities as conducted last year, 
and is discussing inspection of two additional nuclear 
facilities. 
  The IAEA is also demanding periodic inspections, Blix said. 
  It is certain that North Korea did not declare some 
plutonium 
although it declared that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon 
produced a minimal amount of plutonium, he said. 
  Inspections of the two undeclared nuclear facilities are to 
confirm if they produced plutonium, but the IAEA is still not 
sure if it can find how much plutonium was produced from the 
North Korean nuclear sites. 
  On the question of whether the IAEA can guarantee that North 
Korea is not pushing ahead with military nuclear programs after 
the inspection conditions are met, he said that there are always 
uncertainties. 
  Even if the IAEA does inspect the nuclear reactors in 
Yongbyon, it cannot rule out the existence of secret nuclear 
facilities, he said. He said that the monitoring equipment in 
North Korean nuclear facilities has not been operating for 
several months because film and batteries ran out and did not 
rule out the possibility that North Korea extracted nuclear 
material from the reactors. 
  North Korea has not allowed the IAEA inspection team to 
exchange films and batteries of the monitoring equipment since 
last August.
