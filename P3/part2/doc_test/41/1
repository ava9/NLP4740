PANEL GIVES REPORT ON COMPUTER PRANK

</HEADLINE>

A rogue computer program that crippled a nationwide computer network last fall 
was neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal, a commission at 
Cornell University has concluded. Cornell graduate student Robert Morris alone 
created the program that infected thousands of military and university 
computers, the panel's report said. Morris, 23, who is on a leave of absence 
from the school's doctoral program in computer science, refused to be 
interviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons 
Morris created the "worm," an independent program that endlessly duplicates 
itself once placed in a computer system -- as opposed to a "virus," which 
inserts itself into a host program to propagate. The commission found that 
Morris probably wanted to spread the "worm" without detection but that, once it 
had been unleashed, he made only "minimal efforts" to stop its spread.
