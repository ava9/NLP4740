  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
has begun to move on establishment of a commercial Internet 
group. The move is viewed as an attempt to gain a leadership 
role by establishing an industry group because of the expected 
rapid growth in new information-communications businesses. 
  Services connecting with the domestic commercial Internet 
system were initiated in November of last year. Two companies 
known as AT&amp;T Japan ENS (AT&amp;T JENS) and Internet 
Initiative 
(IIJ) have already begun offering services and Fujitsu will 
initiate services in June. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) is also 
considering the idea of joining in the competition because its 
operating base will be compromised if international telephone 
calls are routed through the Internet system. Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone (NTT) is also studying the situation. 
  Internet is a worldwide computer network created in the 
United States and its subscribers are estimated to total 20 
million. It can be used for electronic mail exchanges and to 
access remote data bases through the use of computers. It is 
projected to develop into a multimedia system for the 
transmission of voice and animated images. 
  In December of last year, MOPT began seminars attended by 
companies involved with Internet. The seminars have been 
attended by a total of 14 companies, including two commercial 
services firms, NTT, KDD, personal computer Communications firm 
Nifty, and communications equipment maker Japan Cisco Systems, 
and three academics, including professor Junsuke Murai of Keio 
University. 
  As stated in the prospectus for the seminar, its goal is "to 
aid in the growth of our nation's Internet system," but the 
collective opinion of several attendees say MOPT has an ulterior 
motive. The aim of MOPT is to operate an agency called 
Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) under its initiative to 
provide for the efficient interconnection of commercial networks 
and to use the seminars as a means to set up such an 
organization. 
  The seminars were originally scheduled to end in March, but 
a 
decision has been made to extend them beyond April. The seminars 
will soon progress into a discussion on the establishment of CIX. 
  The Japanese international communications market is valued 
at 
300 billion yen. Currently, fewer than 500 firms subscribe to 
Internet. However, when the services are expanded on a 
full-scale basis, the market situation could change drastically. 
Some sources take the view that, "MOPT has embarked on a program 
to regulate the market as a means to extend aid to KDD and 
existing communications companies that will be impacted by 
changes."
