Intrigued by glowing accounts of rich information resources and lured by the
promise of a free international electronic mail service, computer users are
signing up in droves to services that offer access to the Internet, a global
web of computer networks.
Already, the Internet links thousands of computers and an estimated 15m
computer users. One million new subscribers a month are said to be hooking
up their computers to 'the Net'.
Public awareness of the Internet has been raised in part by the Clinton
administration's promotion of the 'national information infrastructure' as a
development that will bring broad economic and social benefits to all
Americans.
The Internet is the precursor of the high-speed information superhighway
system. It provides free access to thousands of computer databases, the
opportunity to engage in a myriad of on-line debates or special interest
group discussions and the ability to exchange electronic messages with other
users almost anywhere in the world at little or no cost.
From its genesis in a 1969 US Defence Department project to provide computer
links between researchers at US universities and national laboratories, the
Internet has grown into a vast web of public and private computer networks,
about half of which are in the US. Although it lacks the speed and bandwidth
of future information superhighways, the Internet demonstrates the potential
value of data communications, as well as some of the challenges that lie
ahead on the information superhighways. By creating digital links to distant
information resources, for example, the Internet is beginning to eliminate
the constraints that geography places on access to education, jobs and
services.
'(Students) can now access Nasa, leave messages for the astronauts, browse
around in libraries larger than they will ever be able to visit . . . read
world and national news that appears in newspapers that are not available in
their small towns . . . change the way they feel about the size of their
world,' a teacher from a small Texas school district writes in 'The National
Information Infrastructure: Agenda for Action', a report by Clinton's
Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF).
Businesses are taking advantage of the vast libraries of research reports
available on the Internet. Small companies that cannot afford private
computer networks can use the Internet to link distant sites. Software
developers and insurance companies are using the Internet to shift
labour-intensive programming and data processing jobs to low-cost regions of
the world.
The growing use of the Internet also points to an urgent need for higher
capacity information highways. Already, there are data traffic jams on the
Internet as millions of new users explore its resources. New high-speed data
channels are essential if the whole system is not to become gridlocked.
Widening the 'roads' of the Internet may not, however, be sufficient to
provide broad public access to information resources. Indeed, the history of
the Internet would suggest that it may encourage even more traffic. The
establishment in the 1980s of the National Science Foundation Network, which
provided a high-speed 'backbone' for the Internet, spurred a vast increase
in its use.
The entire information infrastructure - 'bridges' linking different networks
and 'on and off ramps' providing access to individual computers - will have
to be upgraded if there is to be 'universal access' to information resources
as the Clinton administration is insisting.
The shortcomings of the Internet also raise questions about the design of
information superhighways. Despite its rising popularity, the Internet can
be fully exploited only by people with a significant degree of computer
expertise.
To be accessible to a broader spectrum of society, information superhighways
will have to be far easier to use. This will require the development of
interface software that hides the complexity of the network from its users.
The lack of any central control over the Internet has enabled it to grow
rapidly as thousands of regional and local area computer networks have
plugged in. However, the flexibility of the Internet also makes it far more
complex.
There is, for example, no catalogue of resources on the Internet. The
Internet is therefore difficult to use unless you know exactly what you are
looking for and where to find it. Similarly, the Internet lacks the
equivalent of a telephone directory. To send messages to another Internet
user you have to know their Internet address, but there is nowhere to look
it up.
Data security is another weakness. As numerous security violations have
shown, however, ensuring data privacy may prove difficult. The thorny
question of the rights of law enforcement officials to 'snoop' on the data
highway has also to be addressed.
Access to vast amounts of information is not the whole answer. The power to
discover the right information quickly and easily, to separate 'nice to
know' from 'need to know' information is essential if information
superhighway users do not drown in electronic 'junk info'.
Perhaps the most critical issues raised by the Internet relate to
intellectual property rights. On the Internet, anybody can copy any material
 -whether it be a newspaper article or a graduate thesis - without charge.
Essentially, this means an individual who posts information on the Internet
forfeits rights of ownership.
The IITF is currently evaluating the need for a system that enables
information providers to collect royalties for copyrighted products
delivered or made available through information superhighways.
The Clinton administration has acknowledged that unlike the Internet, the
information superhighways of the future will be built and controlled by the
private sector. However, the government will have a critical role to play in
determining that all Americans have 'universal service at affordable prices'
and in writing the 'rules of the road'.
Commercially owned, government-regulated, high-speed information networks
will be capable of delivering a myriad of services, ranging from interactive
television and on-line shopping to video-conferencing and information
services akin to those of the Internet.
Ironically, however, while newcomers to 'telecomputing' may welcome such
developments, veteran Internet navigators fear commercialisation and
regulation will doom the free-wheeling spirit that has enabled the Internet
to thrive.
