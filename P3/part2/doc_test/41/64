To communicate with my sister Joyce in North Carolina is simple. l can
telephone from a public call box using a plastic card. l can send her a fax.
When l was a student, l would use electronic mail.
Soon, l will be able to talk to Joyce face-to-face, using the latest in
video-conferencing systems. We can share access to current real-time and
on-line communication systems, such as Internet.
To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria
is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult.
Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992,
the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and
Europe was down for nearly a week.
In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact
my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part
of the new communications order.
Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications
technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone
or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global
communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for
granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use.
Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while
international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people.
By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive.
The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution
is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications
world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African
context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has
only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages.
The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the
world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only
Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire
African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national
telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone
lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does
not even feature.
At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society,
there is a danger that the developing countries will become further
marginalised and impoverished.
In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications
technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect,
created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the
developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to
be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of
the developed nations.
Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an
essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and
television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations
between north and south.
The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds
in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are
eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies,
Africa is largely an IT desert.
We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'.
This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the
gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under
international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern
industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to
help improve agricultural production.
