look at changes planned by Phillip Samper

For a company with a reputation for the kind of brashness and aggression
that frightens the giants of the computer industry, Sun Microsystems has
been uncommonly quiet of late.
That should change once Phillip Samper, appointed president of Sun's
computer systems division (SMCC) at the beginning of the year, gets his
business strategy for the division up and running. Multimedia and networking
are important elements in his plans.
Sun, a California-based workstation manufacturer, is already a key
contributor to the Internet, the global web of interconnected computers and
computer networks which has some 25m users. Sun was an early adopter of the
rules which have to be followed to transmit data on the Internet.
As a consequence, it reckons that as much as 56 per cent of Internet traffic
runs on its computers, while most of the software written to help users find
their way round the network - applications with names like Mosaic, Archie
and Gopher - was developed on Sun systems.
The potential of the Internet, however, is often lost on users who find the
business of making the connection difficult, expensive and time-consuming.
Last week, Sun announced new kinds of computers that it describes as
Internet servers which will make it easy for untrained users to find their
way on to and around the Internet. The servers - microcomputers costing
between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 13,500 - essentially take the user
step-by-step through the connection process. Sun has been a pioneer in
exploiting the commercial possibilities of the Internet and is a member of
CommerceNet, an industry consortium working on the creation of an electronic
marketplace over the Net. Now live, it is expected to offer electronic
shopping and banking soon.
There is a less serious side to Sun's Internet activities: recently it
worked with Thinking Pictures, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology Media Lab, to create an Internet database for the Rolling
Stones' 'Voodoo Lounge' concert tour. Stored on the database are concert
dates, video and audio clips of the band at work, and a library of
photographs.
SMCC is Sun's principal operating division, a company with no scruples about
telling larger competitors like International Business Machines and Digital
Equipment that it intends to grow by eating their lunch (taking market share
from them). Scott McNealy, founder and chairman, relishes what he describes
as the company's 'in-your-face' attitude. Samper is more moderate. He calls
it 'swashbuckling'. He is not the most obvious choice as leader of a
technical workstation manufacturer. Fifty nine in February, he was formerly
vice-chairman of Eastman Kodak. During his 28 years with Kodak he led the
photographic and information management division and managed Kodak's
operations internationally.
He does, however, have experience as a purchaser and user of corporate
computer systems, and has been on Sun's board of directors since 1991. Kodak
was at one point an investor in Sun.
The company is at a critical point in its development. Founded in 1982, Sun
grew rapidly and profitably through the 1980s by building workstations -
hugely powerful personal computers used by scientists and engineers - that
were demonstrably faster than the competition. The secret was a
microprocessor chip called 'Sparc'. Today, Sun is still the leader in
workstations with a 37.8 per cent share of the market - ahead of
Hewlett-Packard (19.6 per cent) and DEC (11.1 per cent).
Analysts worry, however, that other chips such as 'PowerPC' from IBM and
'Alpha' from DEC have leap-frogged ahead of Sparc. One answer from the
Californian company has been to seek an extensive alliance with Fujitsu of
Japan - a world leader in chip manufacturing technology - to design and
build faster and better versions of Sparc.
Samper, however, believes that management changes are just as important, as
the company moves past the psychologically important Dollars 5bn revenue
point. 'We have to find ways of keeping the spirit of a small company with
the management structure of a large one,' he says.
He makes two comments: 'First, Sun has to understand the global market
better. Silicon Valley companies often have two problems - understanding
there is a US market outside Silicon Valley and understanding there is a
world market outside the US. Second, Sun needs a different approach to
marketing and in particular to advertising and public relations.'
At present, it spends only Dollars 15m or Dollars 20m a year on advertising
and the like: a relic of Sun's origins in technical computing where
recommendations were passed on by word of mouth. Competitors spend up to 10
times more, and Samper is anxious to see a substantial increase in Sun's
advertising budget.
His principal role, however, is to inject experience and maturity into a
young and ambitious management team. 'We have to learn that swashbuckling is
not the answer to business; business is the answer to business.'
He argues that executives in fast-growing companies become expert at fire
fighting but do not spent enough time on fire prevention. An example: the
financial hiccough Sun suffered around the turn of the decade when, of all
things, its computer-based accounting system proved inadequate. The problem
has been rectified and the new system is continually upgraded. 'God willing,
we will never have that problem again,' says Semper with feeling.
He believes that Sun will be a leader in each of the key technologies over
the next few years. He argues, for example, that the likely winners of the
microprocessor wars will be Intel (probably in conjunction with Hewlett
Packard), IBM, Motorola and Apple with PowerPC and the Sun Sparc.
In operating systems, Microsoft will be represented by Windows NT or a
variant, IBM by OS/2 and Sun by Solaris, thepackaged version of Sun's Unix
operating software.
In the key area of object-oriented technology, which many see as the future
of computer programming, there will be Microsoft's Cairo, Taligent from IBM,
Apple and Hewlett Packard and NextStep from Steve Jobs' Next group. Sun has
a 10 per cent stake in Next.
However, the low-margin PC business is one battlefield that Sun seems
unlikely to invade. 'We keep looking at PCs, but I have to be certain we can
make money there,' says Semper.
