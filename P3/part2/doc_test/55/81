  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
voice support for the convocation of a national conference to 
seek a way for the great unity of the whole nation on the 
occasion of the forthcoming August 15 liberation day, which was 
proposed by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political 
parties and public organisations of April 11. They praise it as 
a patriotic initiative to promote the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  In a commentary titled "Patriotic Initiative for Great 
National Unity" NODONG SINMUN declares it is an urgent matter to 
achieve great national unity through the implementation of the 
ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in 
view of the grave situation caused by outside forces and their 
zealous followers, the flunkeyist traitors. 
  The news analyst says: 
  If our nation fails to achieve harmony and unity under the 
acute and strained situation, it will unavoidably suffer the 
disaster of a nuclear war and fall a victim to outside forces. 
  When a historic national conference is convened as proposed 
by the North, the convocation itself will mean a big stride 
toward reconciliation and unity and it will be possible to 
attain national unity and find a way of achieving peace in the 
country and reunifying the country in the 1990s through 
unconventional and open- hearted exchange of views. 
  If the conference is to be convened, it is important to 
create a climate and conditions for it. The South Korean 
authorities must renounce the policy of depending on outside 
forces, take the position of national independence and stop all 
sorts of confrontation and war moves aimed at hurting and 
attacking fellow countrymen with the help of outside forces. 
They must scrap the "National Security Law" and other fascist 
laws and give up such things as "unified channel of dialogue" 
intended to monopolize dialogue. 
  What position one takes toward the national conference, 
which 
would be an epoch-making event in the history of national 
reunification, is a criterion distinguishing whether one wants 
national unity and reunification, or not. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON emphasizes that if the South 
Korean authorities want the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country, they must positively respond to 
the proposal for the convocation of a national conference.
