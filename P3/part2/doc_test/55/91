  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A contact between Yu 
Mi-yong, chairperson of the Central Guidance Committee of the 
Korean Chondoist Association, and An Ho-sang, leader of the 
Tangun Taejonggyo in South Korea, was held in Beijing on March 
12 and 14. 
  At the contact, they openheartedly discussed matters of 
common concern, including the tasks facing the Chondoists and 
Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South of Korea in 
achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country through the great unity of the whole nation. 
  An agreement was adopted at the contact, which says: 
  "Considering that the great unity of the whole nation fully 
accords with the Chondoist idea of concord and the Tangun 
Taejonggyo's spirit of promoting human interests, the Chondoists 
and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North and South will make 
joint efforts to achieve great national unity on the principle 
of subordinating everything to national reunification, the 
common cherished desire of the nation, as Paedal (Korean) 
nationals, transcending the differences in ideology and social 
system, and to achieve the country's reunification, the supreme 
task of the nation, on the three principles of independence, 
peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  "The Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers in the North 
and South will make joint efforts to accomplish the cause of 
national reunification in the 1990s without fail through mutual 
contact and dialogue. 
  "The recent disinterment and scientific study of the Tomb of 
Tangun in Pyongyang was a historic event which confirmed that 
the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation that has developed a 
long history of five thousand years and brilliant culture, with 
Tangun, a real person, as its father. 
  "The chairperson of the Central Guidance Committee of the 
Korean Chondoist Association invited delegates of Tangun 
Taejonggyo in South Korea to visit Pyongyang and participate in 
the ceremony for the completion of the Tomb of Tangun after its 
reconstruction, and the leader of Tangun Taejonggyo invited 
delegates of Chondoists in the Northern half to visit Seoul. On 
that basis, the sides confirmed each other's willingness to 
dispatch their delegates to Pyongyang and Seoul in the 
convenient time. 
  "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist 
Association will deeply study the proposals of the South Korean 
religious leader -- the North and the South should jointly 
observe the national foundation day and other traditional 
functions as proposed by the religious leader of South Korea, 
define and restore holy places of Tangun in North and South and 
hold an academic seminar of scholars in North, South and 
overseas on Tangun in an appropriate time and the Northern 
headquarters of Tangun Taejonggyo be set up -- and then inform 
the competent organ of the result. 
  "The sides promised to make active efforts to carry the 
agreed points into practice."
