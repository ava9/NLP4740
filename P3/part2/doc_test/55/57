<F P=106> ["South Korean People's Cause of Independence, Democracy and </F>
National Reunification Is Invincible" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The people's struggle 
for independence, democracy and national reunification is going 
on unremittingly in South Korea in spite of brutal suppression 
and despicable intrigues by the fascist clique, and their desire 
will surely be realized, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined 
article today. 
  The article charges that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
under 
the patronage of the U.S. imperialists are intensifying fascist 
suppression of the South Korean students and other sections of 
people who rose in struggle, while resorting to wicked intrigues 
to disorganize their movement from within through its 
reformation. 
  The article reads in part: 
  The puppet clique are, above all, trying to decompose the 
fundamental nature of the South Korean people's movement as one 
for independence, democracy and national reunification. 
  They let their stooges, venal scholars and pseudo activists 
argue that there is no need to put up the slogan of 
independence, democracy and national reunification in the South 
Korean people's movement vociferating about the "change of the 
times", and even contend that there cannot and should not be a 
fight under the "civilian" regime. 
  Their argument that the slogan of independence, democracy 
and 
national reunification should not be put up in the South Korean 
people's movement is, in essence, an extremely wicked and 
cunning trick to deny and decompose the fundamental character of 
the movement as one for anti-U.S. independence, anti-fascist 
democracy and national reunification and to cut off the lifeline 
of the movement boasting of scores of years of their unremitting 
struggle. 
  The South Korean puppet clique also preach compromise with 
the "civilian" regime, not head-on confrontation with it or a 
fight for its overthrow. 
  Their talk that the Kim Yong-sam regime should not be 
overthrown, but a compromise should be made with it, is, in the 
final analysis, as good as saying the people should continue to 
meekly obey the U.S. imperialists' colonial domination, not 
complain about dictatorship and fascism and keep mum about 
whatever they do against national reunification. 
  They preach "petition" and "nonviolence", encouraging 
"dialogue" and "compromise", but it is a nonsensical talk under 
such fascist system as that of South Korea where suppression is 
going unhindered. 
  Their preach is an artifice to lull the anti-Kim Yong-sam 
sentiments of the South Korean people, keep them from rising in 
fierce struggles and, furthermore, to totally disarm their 
movement and make them submit to the principle of non-resistance 
and capitulationism. 
  The article stresses: 
  The South Korean people's desire cannot be realized so long 
as such sycophant traitors, fascist dictators as Kim Yong-sam 
are left alone. 
  The South Korean people, therefore, should kindle fiercer 
flames of struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime 
and establish a genuinely independent democratic regime.
