  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il received a letter sent by Guy Dupre, 
secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for 
Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), upon the successful 
conclusion of an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of 
the Cilreco in Paris on February 6. 
  The letter dated February 6 noted the participants in the 
meeting expressed deep apprehensions over the grave crisis which 
has been created by the unreasonable attitude of the United 
States in the process of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and strongly denounced the moves of the U.S. hardline 
conservatives who are laying artificial hurdles in the DPRK-USA 
talks. 
  The participants urged the South Korean authorities to 
abandon the policy of depending upon the outside forces and stop 
crackdown upon the South Korean patriots in their struggle for 
independence, democracy and reunification and expressed firm 
solidarity with all the patriotic forces of South Korea fighting 
for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, it 
noted. 
  It said that the participants decided to conduct a more 
powerful solidarity movement for supporting the historical 
proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of 
Koryo advanced by respected President Kim Il-song. 
  It pointed out that the enlarged meeting adopted the 1994 
action program of the international liaison committee to expand 
and develop the international solidarity movement to actively 
rouse the world people to action for a fair solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and support the cause of 
the reunification and peace of Korea. 
  The letter heartily wished Comrade Kim Chong-il good health 
and long life.
