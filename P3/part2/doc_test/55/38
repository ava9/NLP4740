  [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The Asian Regional 
Committee for Supporting Korean Reunification on March 14 called 
on the governments, social organizations and peaceloving peoples 
of all countries to launch a signature campaign supporting 
"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country" put forward by the great 
leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The appeal said that Korea could be reunified only when the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation based 
on the three principles of national reunification -- 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- 
was implemented and the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo 
founded. 
  It demanded that the U.S. troops immediately withdraw from 
South Korea with their nuclear weapons, the United States stop 
interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and the 
U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises be discontinued for 
good and all. 
  It expressed full support of the DPRK's stand for a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue and urged the United States to 
promptly give up its attempt to destroy the socialist system in 
the northern half of Korea under the cloak of the nuclear 
inspection.
