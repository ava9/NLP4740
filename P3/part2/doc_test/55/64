  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- Leaders of different 
countries referred to the question of Korean reunification when 
they received DPRK ambassadors. 
  John Samuel Malecela, prime minister of Tanzania, said that 
the question of Korean reunification must be solved entirely by 
the efforts of the Korean people themselves and that Tanzania 
would support the stand of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea for the country's reunification. 
  Anatole Kanyenkiko, prime minister of Burundi, said that the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation and 
formula of reunification through confederacy put forward by the 
great leader President Kim Il-song are peace-loving and 
patriotic proposals to reunify the split country and unite the 
divided compatriots into one through dialogue, not 
confrontation, and by peaceful means, nor war. 
  Anerood Jugnauth, prime minister of Mauritius, said he 
supported the Korean people's efforts to reunify the country by 
peaceful means and expressed the hope that the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula would be resolved peacefully.
