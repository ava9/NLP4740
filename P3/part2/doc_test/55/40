  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The 16th general 
meeting of the Josho district, Nagano Prefecture, Council of 
Japan for Support to the Independent and Peaceful Reunification 
of Korea was held. 
  The meeting reviewed the solidarity activities in 1993 and 
adopted an action programme for 1994 and a resolution. The 
action programme envisages the expansion of the movement for the 
establishment of the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo by 
confederacy formula based on one nation, one state, two systems 
and two governments. 
  It also expresses the resolve to invigorate activities 
urging 
an early normalisation of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations and an 
apology and compensation for the past crimes of Japanese 
imperialism and intensify the movement for support to "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" and the proposal for founding the 
Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and for the withdrawal 
of the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea.
