  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today, in 
editorials dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the March 1 
popular uprising in 1919, call on the compatriots at home and 
abroad to join in the struggle for smashing the moves of the 
separatists and reunifying the country with concerted efforts of 
the nation. 
  NODONG SINMUN says the thorough implementation of "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song is the key to making our nation repulse 
aggression and interference of any outside forces and accomplish 
the cause of national reunification in the '90s. 
  Noting that the desire of the March 1 uprisers to live in a 
land without aggressors and traitors has been realised only in a 
half of the country and the South Korean people are still 
languishing under the colonial rule of foreign imperialists, the 
paper says that if the country is to be reunified at an early 
date, it is imperative to achieve the great unity of the whole 
nation. 
  The paper continues: 
  Great national unity is never achieved by words. It is won 
and cemented when all the Koreans take a joint action by pooling 
their will and strength in the struggle for national 
reunification. All the political parties, organizations and 
compatriots of all strata in the North, South and overseas must 
keep pace and unite with each other organizationally for 
national reunification. The South Korean people must wage a 
relentless struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam group, which 
is standing in the way of national reunification and trying to 
plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust in league with 
outside forces. 
  The South Korean puppets must give up the foolish design to 
obstruct the country's reunification and slay the fellow 
countrymen in the North with the backing of outside forces and 
step down from power without delay as unanimously demanded by 
the people. 
  MINJU CHOSON demands that the United States renounce the 
moves to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea over the "nuclear issue" and keep to and implement the 
principles agreed on between the DPRK and the United States so 
that the nuclear issue may be resolved in a fair way on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  It says the Japanese reactionaries must apologize for the 
monstrous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in 
the past, make an adequate compensation, stop clamouring about 
the non- existent "nuclear threat" from the DPRK and refrain 
from doing things obstructive to the peace and reunification of 
Korea.
