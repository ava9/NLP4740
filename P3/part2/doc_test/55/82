  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address was carried by the Indian 
papers WORUM and INDEPENDENT, the Indian magazine SOCIALOOK and 
the Mozambican magazine TEMPO. 
  Seminars on the New Year address were held in Harare 
Province, Zimbabwe, and at the group for the study of the chuche 
idea of President Kim Il-song in Vienna, Austria, and a branch 
of the Malian Youth Revolutionary Front of Self-Reliance. 
  The reporters and speakers at the seminars said the Korean 
people last year made great achievements in socialist 
construction despite the unprecedentedly vicious machinations of 
the imperialists and fully demonstrated the superiority of 
Korean-style socialism, the embodiment of the chuche idea. 
  They estimated the confederacy formula of reunification put 
forward by President Kim Il-song as the most fair and aboveboard 
proposal for a peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  They demanded the South Korean authorities renounce the 
policy of depending on outside forces and choose to reunify 
Korea by confederacy formula. 
  The United States must immediately stop the anti-socialist, 
anti-DPRK campaign and fairly settle the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, they urged. 
  A meeting explaining the New Year address was held in West 
Mashonaland Province, Zimbabwe, and its reading session at the 
Guyana torchlight Taekwon-to group for the study of the chuche 
idea of Comrade Kim Il-song.
