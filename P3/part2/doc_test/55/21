Unity of Whole Nation"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorials to the first anniversary of the publication 
of the work of the great leader President Kim Il-song "10-Point 
Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the 
Reunification of the Country" (April 6, 1993.) 
  The ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation put forward by the great leader is a patriotic one which 
embodies the noble desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen to 
achieve the reunification and prosperity of the Korean nation 
with a 5,000 year-long history through the firm unity of the 
whole nation, transcending the differences in ideology, idea and 
social system; it is a great banner of national reunification 
which indicates a short-cut to tide over the difficulties in 
the way of reunification by the strength of the internal force 
of the nation and achieve the independent, peaceful 
reunification of the country, NODONG SINMUN says, and goes on: 
  An unprecedented danger of war is being created in the 
Korean 
peninsula by the adventurous anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of 
the United States and the South Korean puppets, its followers. 
  The United States reversed the agreed conclusion reached at 
the contact with the DPRK in New York, led the third-round of 
the DPRK-USA talks to a rupture, and brought the "nuclear issue" 
to the UN Security Council to produce a "presidential statement" 
and is now resorting to the military adventure to stifle the 
DPRK, more undisguised in a row of international pressure on the 
DPRK. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to the tune of war 
against the North turned by the United States, its master, is 
fanning up war fever, clamouring for "tough countermove" and 
"strong retaliatory punishment" against the DPRK. 
  The prevailing situation is making it more incumbent upon 
the 
Korean nation to unite in one mind to defend peace and security 
of the country at the risk of their lives, irrespective of 
residence, ideology and idea. 
  All the fellow countrymen in the North, the South and 
overseas should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to 
achieve peace and reunification of the country with the great 
unity of the whole nation transcending the differences in 
ideology, idea and social system, bearing deep in mind the high 
aim and noble patriotic idea of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song reflected in the ten-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. 
  The principle of national independence should be maintained 
in order to implement the programme and achieve peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  The South Korean people should never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
group which is hindering the great unity of the nation, trying 
to outlive in reward for selling off the dignity and interests 
of the nation to the outside forces, without independence. 
  The editorial calls upon the whole nation to hold in high 
esteem the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the centre of unity and 
leadership and achieve the great unity and thus open a new 
epochal phase in removing the danger of a nuclear war, 
preserving peace and hastening reunification in the 90s.
