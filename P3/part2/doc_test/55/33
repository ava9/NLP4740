<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Reviving Fighting Spirit of June </F>
Resistants" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary today says the desire of the fighters of the 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance in June 1987 for 
independence, democracy and reunification has yet not been 
realized in South Korea though seven years have passed since the 
resistance of the South Korean people. This is because of the 
U.S. policy of occupying South Korea and maintaining it as a 
colonial dependency, it adds. 
  The analyst says: 
  As long as South Korea remains a colony of the United States 
and fascist traitors stay in power, neither the desire of the 
people for a social change nor the reunification of the country 
can be achieved. This is the precious lesson gained by the June 
resistants and the South Korean people and the sum total of the 
struggle. 
  The South Korean students and people of all segments should 
wage a more valiant anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and 
build up fierce flames of massive resistance in all areas to 
overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish an 
independent and democratic government. 
  The South Korean people of all strata and Koreans overseas 
must wage a persistent nationwide struggle to reunify the 
country by the confederacy formula and, for the present, 
vigorously turn up in a joint struggle for the convocation of a 
national conference.
