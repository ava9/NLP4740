World leaders praised Richard Nixon at the weekend for his bold foreign
policy moves, with some of America's Cold War enemies most warm in their
praise, AP and Reuters report.
China's Communist leaders hailed Nixon as a man of 'strategic foresight and
political courage' in messages of condolences. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng praised Mr Nixon for his 1972 breakthrough visit to
Beijing that began rapprochement between China and the US and for his
efforts to improve relations even after he resigned. His last visit was in
April 1993.
Mr Nixon also was warmly remembered in Russia. President Boris Yeltsin said
he was 'one of the first major world politicians who have understood Russia
and understood what it was fighting for'.
Mr Yeltsin had refused to meet Mr Nixon during his 10-day trip to Russia
last month because the former president had met with some of Yeltsin's
political opponents. But Mr Nixon is credited with establishing the policy
of detente toward the Soviet Union during his presidency and, in recent
years, with pushing for US aid for Russia.
Even India, whose relations with the US reached an all-time low during Mr
Nixon's administration, commended the former president for taking bold steps
in international affairs.
'Although President Nixon's term was marked by a certain controversy, he was
well known in international affairs as having been courageous enough to take
bold steps such as normalisation of relations with China and steps towards
East-West detente,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Shiv Shankar Mukherjee said.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was ambassador to the US during Mr
Nixon's presidency, praised his support of Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War
'in the face of the opposition of most of the world'.
'I am convinced that history will recall the great role he played on the
international scene,' French President Francois Mitterrand said in extending
condolences to his family.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general of the United Nations, extending
his condolences, called Mr Nixon's impact in international affairs
'especially significant.'
Sir Edward Heath, who was Britain's prime minister in 1970-74, hailed Mr
Nixon's diplomatic skills. 'He discussed policies with all those likely to
be affected and took into account their views. One never felt one had been
stamped on or ignored,' he told BBC radio.
But Hanoi - where northern Vietnamese remember Mr Nixon as the man whose
bombers pounded them in 1972 during the Vietnam War - officially closed its
account with Mr Nixon with a terse five-word statement.
'May he rest in peace,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
