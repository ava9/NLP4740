HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his article "Beware Timidity in the Endgame" (Commentary, Sept. 23), former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger leads a debate on policy objectives in the 
Persian Gulf which centers on events in the Vietnam War. And it is not hard to 
see that he has mostly accepted the critics' view of history. 
</P>
<P>
"For economic and political reasons, I doubt a stalemate can be sustained." The 
official military policy in Vietnam became defensive in 1970, under President 
Nixon. "A prolonged stalemate is likely to undermine the domestic stability of 
our Arab associates." Does anybody remember Cambodia? 
</P>
<P>
Is it realistic to assume that there is no debate on the gulf crisis because we 
continue to measure our foreign policy by events which took place during the 
Vietnam War? Would the U.S. be isolated in a "military crunch"? Should we place 
our head into the lion's mouth again? Kissinger's most revealing statement 
concerns an "imperative to create the right conditions for an equally rapid 
withdrawal." And to that end I credit him with orchestrating the U.S. exodus 
from Vietnam, an event that could have been bloody and torturous, particularly 
in the final hours. We might not have such good grace in extricating ourselves 
from the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger has taken a good look at recent history and Vietnam when he calls for 
an outcome "more consistent with long-term stability." By this I take it that 
he means a policy not formulated by the hawks who want to bomb Baghdad. Or is 
it Hanoi? It's all too chillingly familiar to me, and quite probably to the 
former secretary.
