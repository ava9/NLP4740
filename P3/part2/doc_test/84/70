  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong 
Yiren met with Dr. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, 
today. They discussed bilateral relations between China and the 
United States and some international issues. 
  Rong first expressed his appreciation over the important 
role 
played by former U.S. President Nixon, who passed away recently, 
in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and in pushing the 
normalization of formal relations between the two countries. 
Rong Yiren said: Dr. Kissinger, as an assistant to Nixon then, 
has also made great contributions in this aspect. 
  Rong Yiren said that China hopes to see a peaceful and 
stable 
international environment and that differences between China and 
the the United States should be solved through discussions and 
consultations on an equal footing. 
  Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be 
improved and developed in a constructive way, and the trade 
between the two countries should also be separated from human 
rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries 
can cooperate in a friendly manner and in a still wider sphere. 
  The meeting proceeded in an extremely warm and friendly 
atmosphere.
