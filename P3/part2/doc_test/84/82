  [Text] Few among the Youth Congress supporters tossing a 
bloated effigy of Mr. Bill Clinton at Wagah last fortnight would 
have realised the symbolic significance of their protest. The 
image of Mr. Clinton being desecrated on the Indo-Pakistani 
border was a statement on how yoked relations between India and 
the United States remain to Pakistan. After all, it was not Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto's effigy being bandied around at Wagah. It was 
the U.S. head of state's. 
  Pakistan remains the thorn in India's side. The U.S. remains 
the prime agitator of that thorn in India's flesh. Consider how 
manageable Pakistan would be if the United States was taken off 
the scene. Handling Islamabad suddenly begins to appear so easy. 
None of that transcontinental arm twisting from Ms. Robin 
Raphel. None of those irritable "My dear Ghulam" letters from 
the Oval Office. None of those words of encouragement to 
secessionist elements in Kashmir and Punjab. 
  There was a time Pakistan looked manageable even with U.S. 
backing -- as long as the Soviet Union was around. Nothing 
deterred India from liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan, not 
Messrs Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger, not even the U.S. 
Seventh Fleet. 
  But things have changed since then. And South Block gives 
the 
impression it has not quite adjusted to these changes. The 
Soviet Union is a thing of the past. The great protector is no 
longer hovering behind India's shoulders. There is no longer the 
assurance of a Soviet veto at the United Nations security 
council to shield India from U.S. bullying. 
  Russia votes with Washington at the UN on resolutions deemed 
anti-Indian in New Delhi. On the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
and the missile technology control regime, Washington and Moscow 
have the same thing to tell India. Sign on the dotted line. 
Hence Russia's stalling the sale of cryogenic rocket technology 
to India under pressure from the United States. Even on Kashmir 
Moscow's position lies closer to Washington's than New Delhi's. 
  India can no longer behave like a foetus in a protected Cold 
War womb. It needs to brave the new world and walk a hard path 
alone. The Clinton administration has done little of late that 
would not leave India wondering about US intentions in the 
region. The pinpricks have not been limited to the outbursts of 
Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state for south Asia. 
Mr. Clinton himself has repeatedly left South Block aghast, most 
recently with his statement to the incoming Pakistani ambassador 
to the United States. 
  Often representations to Mr. Clinton, like the recent one on 
Punjab from a set of congressmen, have been products of myth and 
ignorance. The letter referred to Punjab as the "Republic of 
Khalistan" and spoke of 110,000 deaths in the state. If the US 
president responds to such propaganda with kind lines of 
cooperation, he is bound to raise hackles in South Block. 
  But then, like it or not, the US is in a position to get 
away 
with myth and ignorance. Such is the position it has come to 
enjoy, particularly after the demise of the Soviet Union. It 
does not serve to merely rail against a position, however false 
and unjust, that the United States takes. 
  The present lot of disconcerting noises from Washington has 
sparked a debate in the foreign office on whether the prime 
minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, should go to the United 
States for a summit meeting with Mr. Clinton. There are camps 
for either side of the argument. But the reigning opinion in 
South Block seems to be Mr. Rao should not make the trip unless 
he wants his "nose rubbed in the ground," unless he is 
"soliciting a blow to national honour". The debate is rather 
presumptuous, if not also self-defeating. 
  It is not as if the U.S. administration is waiting with a 
red 
carpet to welcome Mr. Rao, terribly anxious to get bilateral 
irritants out of the way. As it is Mr. Clinton has little time 
for foreign policy matters and India would figure fairly low on 
his list. It would hardly bother the White House if Mr. Rao were 
to decide not to go. It has been argued the prime minister's 
decision not to visit Washington -- and go to Moscow instead -- 
would send the right signals of annoyance to the United States. 
What is more likely to be the case is there will be nobody in 
Washington bothered enough to receive the signal. 
  Rightly or wrongly, the onus for correcting the current 
imbalances in Indo-U.S. relations is on India. If India can say 
it is not bothered about bad relations with the United States, 
Washington would be even less so. The question is what will 
India lose if its prime minister visits Washington for a meeting 
with the U.S. president. The situation does not become worse if 
a Rao-Clinton summit does not produce a positive turn in 
relations. 
  The truth is India does not matter to the United States as 
much as the United States matters to India. 
  Besides, as representatives of the U.S. administration, 
including the belligerent Ms. Raphel and the U.S. charge 
d'affaires in New Delhi, Mr. Kenneth Brill, have pointed out, 
there is more to Indo-U.S. relations than just Pakistan and the 
linked issues of Kashmir and human rights. If New Delhi chooses 
to look at Indo-U.S. ties merely through Pakistan-Kashmir prism 
it will only hurt itself. 
  As far as the United States is concerned India could only 
benefit from continuously intensifying its economic and trade 
relations. This is something the United States too appears keen 
on. The United States is sending a high level trade delegation 
led by the commerce secretary, Mr. Ron Brown, in August. The 
effort should be to use such opportunities to expand Indo-U.S. 
contacts in other spheres, rather than allow Pakistan or Kashmir 
to overshadow all aspects of bilateral ties.
