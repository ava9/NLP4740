Arnold M. Picker, former executive vice president of United Artists Pictures 
and a nationally prominent political fund-raiser for Democrats, has died at the 
age of 76. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday of pneumonia at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
As finance chairman for former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie's 1972 
presidential campaign, Picker became something of a political power broker. In 
1980, he was considered the driving force behind Democrats for an Open 
Convention, a group of businessmen and officials who tried to prevent the 
nomination of either incumbent President Jimmy Carter or Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of his work with Muskie, Picker was targeted by a 1971 plan of the 
Nixon White House to use Internal Revenue Service audits in what a memo called 
an effort "to screw our political enemies." According to secret memos given to 
the Senate Watergate Committee by John W. Dean III, counsel to President 
Richard M. Nixon, Picker was the No. 1 target on a priority list of 20 supposed 
"enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Picker gained respect in the film industry for his efforts to foster the medium 
as art. He helped form the American Film Institute and was a co-founder of the 
Holocaust Documentation &amp; Education Center at Florida International 
University in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
He also served as chairman of the board of the National Center for Jewish Film 
set up by the American Jewish Historical Society at Brandeis University in 
Waltham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Loews Theater executive David V. Picker, he began his career with 
Columbia Pictures in 1935 in its foreign department. Ten years later, he was 
named vice president in charge of foreign distribution for Columbia Pictures 
International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Picker switched to United Artists Pictures in 1951 as a partner and executive 
vice president in charge of international distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"No executive to my knowledge was more respected and admired by those who were 
privileged to work with him," Arthur B. Krim, former chairman of United Artists 
Corp. and now chairman of the board of Orion Pictures, told Daily Variety after 
Picker's death. 
</P>
<P>
President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Picker to the U.S. Advisory Commission on 
International Education and Cultural Affairs in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Picker is survived by his wife, two daughters, two brothers, and seven 
grandchildren.
