FT  13 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Haldeman - a new insight

<TEXT>
The diaries of the late H R Haldeman, written every night while he served as
President Richard Nixon's chief of staff and closest confidante, have been
published in the US in two formats - as a conventional book (G P Putnam, New
York, Dollars 27.50) and on CD-ROM (Sony Electronic Publishing Co, Santa
Monica, California, Dollars 69.95) as the Complete Multimedia Edition. In
his introduction, Stephen E Ambrose, author of the well-received three
volume life of Nixon, states he would welcome the opportunity to write an
entire book based on what is revealed in the diaries.
The printed version has instantly soared to near the top of the US
best-seller lists. Newspaper articles, analyses by columnists and lengthy
letters to the editor from Henry Kissinger have generated controversy. Was
Nixon anti-black and anti-semitic? Haldeman recounts Nixon's complaint to
the Rev Billy Graham about 'the total Jewish domination of the media', a
view previously confined to the lunatic fringe. Did Nixon and Kissinger
consider postponing an end to US participation in the Vietnam War in order
to increase Nixon's prospects for re-election? The diaries strongly suggest
an affirmative answer.
Can there be many better arguments against limiting a president to two terms
than Nixon, who violated constitutional norms in so many ways during his
first term, telling his subordinates that in planning for his second term
they should recognise that 'we will have awesome power with no discipline,
that there won't be another election coming up to discipline us?'
The Haldeman diaries are indispensable to any serious work on the Nixon
presidency or on Henry Kissinger. But the epoch marking fact is that real
research will require review of the CD-ROM.
As the book indicates in a preface, presumably to be read after purchase, it
is a condensed version of the diaries. The full text, which is available
only on disc, contains at least two and half times the words in the book.
The book has an inadequate name index, with, for example, well over 100
references to Kissinger without any indication of the subject discussed. It
is impossible to use the index for a subject such as wiretaps or Vietnam.
The disc, however, permits the reader to enter any word, or combination of
words, and move to the relevant passage with the selected keywords
highlighted on the screen.
Another useful feature of the disc is the ability to obtain instant
identification of any individuals mentioned in the text. If, for example, a
reference to a 'dragon lady' is obscure, a click of the mouse will produce a
short biographical sketch of Anna Chenault. The user of the disc can split
the monitor screen, with the diary entry on one side and the presidential
log book and newspaper headlines on the other.
Some of the remaining space on the disc is occupied by 700 still
photographs, 45 minutes of amateur movies taken by Haldeman, and a 120-page
unsent letter from Haldeman, then in prison, to James Neal, the prosecutor,
asserting Haldeman's innocence and giving his version of Watergate.
Research may never be the same again.
