  [Text] Havana, 1 Jan (EFE) -- It is difficult to expect a 
change in the relations between the United States and Cuba 
because "the circumstances are not favorable for an 
understanding," Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez 
asserted in an interview that was published in the official 
GRANMA newspaper today. 
  "There is enough time and the North Americans know this. If 
circumstances are not favorable to them, they will have the time 
to change, and that explains their attitude," the veteran 
communist politician, who has occupied important positions in 
Fidel Castro's government, observed. 
  Carlos Rafael Rodriguez noted that Bill Clinton's 
administration "has taken a stand based on the notion that Cuba 
could collapse in the immediate future. Additionally, it is 
under pressure from the most recalcitrant sectors of the 
Cuban-American community and its allies, and it is not pressed 
to make decisions." He pointed out that it is necessary "to 
show firmness and for our economic policies to be successful. 
Both concerns guide Cuba's thoughts currently. The U.S. policy 
on Cuba has had a weak international response as was 
demonstrated with the UN approval of the resolution condemning 
the blockade against Cuba." 
  Rodriguez also revealed that during the U.S. Democrat 
President James Carter's administration, Cuba and the United 
States had held high level contacts to initiate negotiations. 
However, he explained, the possible solution of the U.S.-Cuban 
crisis was interrupted at that time due to Carter's decision to 
accuse Cuba of being responsible for the internal conflict in 
Zaire between armed organizations which had retreated to the 
area bordering with Angola. 
  Rodriguez recalled that on the same day that hostilities 
started in the African country, he was to hold a secret meeting 
with the then Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in New York. Prior 
to the meeting, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez listened to Carter's 
speech and his charges against Cuba. Vance was meeting with 
former USSR Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko at the time, thus, 
when they met "it was I who informed (Vance) of Carter's 
statements." This is how the attempt to initiate negotiations 
ended. Evidently, Vance did not know that Carter had decided to 
make such an announcement and, embarrassed, he ended the 
meeting. The controversy ended when the truth emerged: Cuba had 
not participated in that adventure. However, the opportunity to 
initiate negotiations had passed," he said. 
  In his opinion, however, it was during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations "when we felt -- after the difficult days of the 
U.S. aggression during the Kennedy era -- the possible effects 
of a direct U.S. aggression against Cuba. We went through 12 
years of continuous hostility with badly feigned or direct 
threats," he explained. It is said that Republican governments 
threaten and Democratic governments act against Cuba. This was 
not the case with the Reagan and Bush administrations because 
only Cuba's firmness and international solidarity impeded a 
direct attack against our country during those 12 years," Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez asserted.
