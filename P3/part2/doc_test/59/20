  [Text] A drug trafficking group that transports marijuana 
and cocaine from southern Mexico to cities bordering Texas has 
extended its Mafia execution arm to Nuevo Leon, where five 
people have been murdered. 
  Of the six apparent narcotrafficker murders in 1993, five 
occurred in municipalities located close to highways and places 
where Federal Judicial Police [PJF] had previously discovered 
shipments of tons of marijuana. 
  The bodies of the murdered men were found in the towns of 
China, General Bravo, Cadereyta, and Santiago. Another murder 
took place in Mina, and according to investigations by the State 
Judicial Police, the suspects in that crime are linked to the 
murders in China and Cadereyta. 
  The Monterrey-Reynosa Highway is toll-free, and the PGR 
[Attorney General's Office] has seized tons of marijuana there. 
It is also a place where drug traffickers have "settled 
accounts" several times. Drugs coming from Oaxaca and Michoacan 
States usually go to Reynosa, Matamoros, or Ciudad Mier. 
  The PJF got involved in drug trafficking activities in 1993 
when Commander Jorge Guzman Torres, aided by "godmothers" 
["madrinas"], kidnapped Lauro Gonzalez Garcia. Police 
identified the kidnapped man as a drug trafficker, and he paid 
federal agents 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  The PGR has confiscated shipments of tons of marijuana on 
the 
highway between China and General Bravo and in country houses in 
Cadereyta and Ciudad Benito Juarez. 
  The PGR actions, which led to the confiscation of almost 5 
tons of marijuana, have taken place a few days before or after 
the body of a murdered man has been found. 
  Merchants Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval Rodriguez and Martin 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, were executed in 
January. The following month, the PGR seized 2.376 tons of 
marijuana in two actions. 
  On 9 February, just seven days after finding the body of 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, the PJF seized a ton of 
marijuana in a tractor-trailer operated by two people. The PJF 
also found 1.376 tons of marijuana in a house on the San Isidro 
de Cadereyta estate on 20 February. They also arrested two men 
who were loading the drugs into a Suburban. 
  On 28 February, Lauro Gonzalez Garcia, suspected of 
executing 
Sandoval Rodriguez, was kidnapped by PJF Commander Guzman Torres 
with the complicity of "godmother" Cuauhtemoc Labastida Salazar. 
The association between the PJF and the drug traffickers ended 
when Gonzalez Garcia paid 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  Lawyer Octavio Leal Moncada and physician Javier Salinas 
Perez are said to be suspects in the death of Garcia Rodriguez, 
alias El Guero Martin, for alleged joint business transactions. 
However, Leal Moncada told a Prosecutor's Office investigator 
that Garcia Rodriguez was his friend, and the physician asserted 
that the murdered man owed him 700,000 new pesos. During a 
special operation, the PJF unsuccessfully attempted to arrest 
Labastida Salazar, who was accompanied by Leal Moncada at the 
time, in his house in Colonia Las Brisas. The "godmother" and 
the lawyer are currently fugitives. 
  Although the PGR arrested in January 1994 two alleged 
members 
of a drug trafficking band in General Bravo, they were 
investigated as members of a marijuana and gunrunning group in 
June 1993. 
  This month, Francisco Garcia Martinez, an employee of Angel 
Avila Neri, came to EL NORTE to personally report that the PGR 
is persecuting his boss and three other people. 
  The PGR established that Avila Neri was a ringleader whose 
accomplices included Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La 
Pinina; brothers Martin and Jorge Arizpe Gonzalez; Jesus Antonio 
Gutierrez Gonzalez, alias El Zurdo; Juan Aguilar Gonzalez; and 
"Lalo" Solis. 
  On 9 August, Margarito Hernandez was murdered in Cadereyta, 
allegedly by Horacio Montelongo Salinas, during a discussion 
over drug debts. The alleged killer is the brother of Jose Luis 
Montelongo Salinas, a suspected drug trafficker who was later 
murdered in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Jose Luis Montelongo was 
also a suspect in the murder of Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval 
Rodriguez. 
  Almost a month after Margarita Hernandez's murder, the PGR 
confiscated half a ton of marijuana that they found buried in a 
trench in a Colonia Monte Bello house in Ciudad Benito Juarez. 
  Two other important actions carried out between 6 and 9 
November resulted in the seizure of 2.565 tons of marijuana; the 
first in Ciudad Benito Juarez and the other on a train heading 
for Matamoros. 
  Five days later there were two murders; one in General Bravo 
and another in Santiago. 
  The PJF found 396 kg of marijuana in the cellar of a house 
in 
Colonia Lomas del Solo in Ciudad Benito Juarez on 6 November. 
The PJF went to the house because two women reported the 
presence of the drug when they were arrested with a shipment of 
168 kg of marijuana in their vehicle. 
  On 9 November, the PJF seized two tons of marijuana in a 
train boxcar. 
  Those confiscations presaged the murder of Abel Salazar 
Martinez, who was found in General Bravo on 14 November. He had 
disappeared from his home in Weslaco, Texas on 8 November. 
  Fifteen days later, the body of Jaime Enrique Lopez Castillo 
was found at the 13-km marker of Santiago-Juarez Highway near 
the La Boca Dam. Lopes Castillo had also been murdered. 
  The year 1993 ended with a "war" among alleged drug 
traffickers and a "settling of accounts" in General Bravo. 
  The homes of Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La Pinina, 
and Martin Arizpe Gonzalez were strafed by AK-47 rifle fire. 
The Caballito de Mar Restaurant, owned by Angel Avila Neri, is 
also bullet riddled. 
  Fourteen days after the attacks in General Bravo, the PJF 
arrested two alleged members of the Avila Neri band that had 
been under investigation since June 1993. 
  Juan Jose Cantu Gonzalez and Raul Gutierrez Gonzalez were 
presented as members of the "Jabali guerrilla commando, which 
was planning terrorist actions in Nuevo Leon. 
  Later the PGR retracted and said they were only drug 
traffickers and gunrunners. 
  The Sixth District Judge ordered Gutierrez Gonzalez' release 
as he believed him innocent of storing weapons and cartridges 
and of illegally possessing and transporting marijuana with the 
intent to take it out of the country. 
<H5>  Houses searched </H5>
  The PGR continued its investigations in the state to 
discover 
the drug network headed by Matamoros Cartel chief Juan Garcia 
Abrego. 
  A special PJF group has searched several houses and country 
homes in Monterrey in the past months to find evidence against 
the partners of the so-called drug capo. 
  The state PGR delegation also wants to identify the safe 
houses and the marijuana and cocaine distribution centers. 
  So far, the searches have not resulted in the arrest of any 
of the alleged drug traffickers. Several people whose houses 
where searched assert that they have no ties with Garcia Abrego.
