  [Excerpt] Over eight tons of packed marijuana, distributed 
in a railroad car, a tank truck, buckets, drums, and nine 
vehicles equipped with special compartments, were seized 
yesterday by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel detailed to 
Sinaloa, Veracruz, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, and 
Tamaulipas States, where 15 presumed public poisoners were 
arrested. It is estimated that the drugs, intended to be sent to 
the United States for sale and consumption, were worth 
approximately 150 million new pesos. 
  According to a report submitted to the assistant attorney 
for 
local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, prominent 
among the seizures made by the federal agents is the one that 
occurred at the railroad terminal in the port of Mazatlan, 
Sinaloa. There, three tons of pressed marijuana were confiscated. 
  It was noted that the PGR [Attorney General's Office] 
representatives, in cooperation with the officials at that 
station, made a routine inspection on the train that runs from 
the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, to Mexicali, Baja California 
(with a stop in Mazatlan). Upon discovering that the seals of 
the freight car on which the drugs were being carried had been 
tampered with, the police agents intensified the search. They 
found the three tons of cannabis, bound for Baja California, 
contained in hundreds of packages. 
  At the order of the PGR representative in that state, Luis 
Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, PJF deputy commissioner Eduardo Salazar 
Carillo continued the investigation at the aforementioned 
railroad terminal. The local PGR offices in Jalisco and Baja 
California were also advised to continue the probe, capture the 
drug owners, determine whether any National Railroads employee 
was implicated in the incident, and take the appropriate action. 
  Furthermore, as was reported to the PJF's general director, 
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Jose Braulio Salvador Campos Beltran, 
Salvador Campos Beltran, Juan Manuel Espino Trejo, Juan Sergio 
Espino Chan, and Jose Salvador Francisco Campos Beltran were 
arrested in the municipality of Acayucan, Veracruz. They were 
carrying approximately two tons of cannabis indica on a tank 
truck, also bound for the country's northern border. 
  It was explained that the drugs in question had been packed 
in 280 plastic buckets which, in turn, were distributed in the 
tank of the vehicle. The latter is presumed to be owned by the 
Felem Company, which is being investigated by agents under 
orders from Deputy Commissioner Fernando Asiain Barriga.
