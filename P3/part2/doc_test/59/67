  [Excerpts] Another spectacular blow was dealt to the drug 
traffic yesterday by the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic] when, in antidrug operations conducted in several 
states of the Federation, it seized 4,164 kg of dried and packed 
marijuana. A gun battle occurred in one of them, without 
casualties. During the operations, Federal Judicial Police 
agents arrested 28 presumed drug traffickers. The value of the 
confiscated drugs exceeds 40 million new pesos. 
  The federal agents, under orders from Commander Adrian 
Carrera, also destroyed 90,420 marijuana plants located on five 
plantations in Sinaloa, Veracruz, and Nayarit States. 
  According to the police reports, the most significant 
operation took place in Sonora State, where federal agents 
arrested Roberto Palomera Hernandez, driver of a tractor trailer 
truck with Federal Public Service plates. Found in the vehicle, 
which had arrived from Guamuchil, Sinaloa, were 1,000 kg of 
marijuana, bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. 
[passage omitted] 
  One plantation was destroyed in Sinaloa State, and another 
in 
the settlement of Cospita, in the township of Baila, Culiacan.
