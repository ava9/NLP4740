strategy by seeking inquiry after series of rows with regulator

THE SIMMERING row between British Gas and the industry regulator Ofgas
erupted into the open yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, agreed to a comprehensive review of the UK gas market by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The surprise move, requested by British Gas, was triggered by disagreements
between Ofgas and British Gas over rates of return on the privatised
utility's pipeline and storage business. But it is the culmination of
several years of strained relations between British Gas and both Ofgas and
the Office of Fair Trading.
The utility said a series of regulatory changes imposed by the regulators
had 'made medium and long-term planning extremely difficult'. They had also
brought demands from customers and independent suppliers for more
consultation time on the effects of the changes.
Mr Cedric Brown asked Mr Heseltine for the referral yesterday morning - only
hours before he was due to take over as chief executive of British Gas
following the decision by Mr Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive, to
split the two roles.
It is the first time a privatised utility has opted to subject itself to an
MMC investigation.
British Gas is not the only utility to have had a turbulent relationship
with its regulator since the start of the privatisation process in the early
1980s. British Telecom, for example, has been to the brink of an MMC
referral but always drawn back.
For British Gas, it is a high-risk strategy which analysts suggested might
result in the break-up of the company. The government's decision to agree to
British Gas's request to be privatised as a single unit in 1986 is bound to
be questioned.
An MMC inquiry will mean nine months of intense scrutiny of all aspects of
British Gas's UK supply business and a period of prolonged uncertainty for
shareholders.
It was clear from the wording of the announcement that the government may
use the MMC report to change the terms of the Gas Act which privatised
British Gas in 1986. The Department of Trade and Industry said Mr Heseltine
would have powers to make changes 'in relation to conveyance and storage and
more widely'.
British Gas agreed to demands from the Office of Fair Trading earlier this
year to hive off its transportation and storage business into an arms-length
subsidiary by 1994, and to publish new pricing schedules for independent
shippers using British Gas pipelines by this September.
But it has insisted that tariffs should allow the company to earn a fair
rate of return on its pipeline assets  - which it says is 6.7 per cent on
existing assets, and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Otherwise, investment
in the pipeline by British Gas and its competitors could be threatened.
Mr Brown accused Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, of 'ducking
the issue' and refusing even to consider raising the rate of return above
the current level of 4.5 per cent  - a move which might mean higher prices
for gas consumers.
'I have held three meetings with Sir James McKinnon during which we did not
even begin talking about the rate of return issue. He suggested this was
something that should be handled by the MMC.'
Mr Brown said that without agreement on the pipeline issue, it was
impossible to implement other agreements reached with the OFT and Ofgas in a
'piecemeal fashion'. He had therefore concluded the MMC should review the
whole gas market.
Mr John Dorken, deputy director-general of Ofgas, last night denied what he
called British Gas's 'misrepresentation'.
'It was quite clear that British Gas's proposals were unacceptable to us.
Our view was that rather than have a long, long debate about this, it was
better to have them debated by the MMC.'
Ofgas itself asked the MMC yesterday to investigate the transportation and
storage business, but its request was overtaken by Mr Heseltine's decision
to widen the inquiry.
British Gas agreed earlier this year to OFT demands to surrender 50 per cent
of its share of the industrial gas market to competitors by 1995, and to
hive off its pipeline business into a separate subsidiary.
It was angered by Ofgas's subsequent insistence that it should submit to a
tough formula limiting price rises for domestic customers to 5 per cent less
than the rate of inflation  - a formula which Sir James enforced in May by
threatening legal action against British Gas if it did not cut its prices.
