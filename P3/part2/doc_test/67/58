Oyston's plan to sell stake may lead to a battle for control

Trans World Communications, the independent radio group where former
chairman Mr Owen Oyston's 24 per cent stake is for sale, reported a 54 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.74m for 1993.
But the shares slipped by 13p to 165p yesterday, having risen by more than
60 per cent in the last month.
Mr John Whitney, chairman, would not speculate on where Mr Oyston's shares
might go. 'Only time will tell,' he said.
Mr Oyston's plan to sell his stake may lead to a battle for control of the
company involving Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent
of the shares, and the Guardian newspaper group which has 20 per cent.
The Guardian is unable to increase its stake under current rules on
cross-media ownership. But these are expected to be relaxed later this year
following a review by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary.
At present, Trans World can own only one more major local radio licence and
will be applying for an FM licence for London in the spring.
Mr Whitney predicts the rules will be changed to allow newspaper groups to
own radio stations and that the market share limit will be raised to 25 per
cent.
Shares in radio companies have risen sharply over the last few months on
hopes of a wave of takeover bids and signs of a strong recovery in
advertising revenue.
Trans World recorded an 11 per cent increase for the year, pushing total
sales up by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 13.3m.
Operating profits jumped by Pounds 678,000 to Pounds 1.71m, but a return to
a near-normal tax charge of 28 per cent left earnings at 3.1p. A final
dividend of 1p lifts the total to 1.3p (0.8p).
COMMENT
Even after boiling over yesterday, Trans World shares are trading on a
frothy 53 times historic earnings. But the rating should fall sharply this
year. Given that three quarters of the company's costs are fixed, it would
require advertising growth of only 15 per cent - compared with industry
forecasts of 20 per cent - for profits to top Pounds 3m, reducing the
multiple to about 30. Relaxation of ITV ownership rules pushed television
ratings almost as high and that for a sector which is losing advertising
share, while independent radio is starting to make the inroads it has long
promised. Add Mr Oyston's stake to the mix and there may be life in the
shares yet.
