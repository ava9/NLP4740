matchmaker abused its market dominance

BRYANT &amp; MAY, the UK match manufacturer, faces a two-year price freeze on
its branded matches after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found
it had abused its dominant position in the UK market to make excessive
profits.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday the MMC had
found that Bryant &amp; May had been able to achieve high prices for matches as
a result of its very high market share. This had led to excessive profits
and higher prices for consumers.
This was the second MMC inquiry in four years into the UK market for matches
and disposable lighters.
Mr Lilley said he had asked the director general of fair trading to seek an
undertaking from Bryant &amp; May on match prices. Before the end of the
two-year price freeze, the director general would review the market to see
whether further controls were needed.
Mr Lilley said he also accepted the MMC's recommendation that Bryant &amp; May
should not in future conclude agreements with its customers on discounts,
exclusive sales, promotion and minimum stocking which were likely to
strengthen its position and weaken that of competitors. The match
manufacturer will also be required to give an undertaking on this.
In 1990 Bryant &amp; May accounted for 78 per cent of the UK match market said
to be worth about Pounds 100m a year, with brands such as Swan Vesta (21 per
cent) and Cooks Household matches (12 per cent).
Mr David Wheeler, managing director, said although disappointed by the MMC
report the company would co-operate with the Office of Fair Trading.
But the company felt the inquiry had been 'a waste of taxpayer's money' and
would have 'very little impact on the public interest.'
'A box of matches costs less than one cigarette and matches represent only
two pence in every Pounds 100 of consumer spending in supermarkets', he
said.
Mr Wheeler added that Bryant &amp; May believed its profitability was due to its
quality and efficiency. He pointed out that one Commission member had
dissented from the report because he felt companies bought from Bryant &amp;
May, as opposed to foreign competitors, due to the quality of its product
and the efficiency of its distribution network.
The MMC inquiry made no adverse findings with respect to lighters. Bryant &amp;
May is the largest supplier of both disposable and semi-disposable
(refillable) lighters. All disposable lighters sold in the UK are imported.
Bryant &amp; May is part of Wilkinson Sword, the consumer products company sold
in 1987 for Pounds 99.2m by Allegheny International of the US to Swedish
Match, the Stockholm-based conglomerate.
The MMC approved the merger saying that if the combined company attempted to
abuse its dominant position UK retailers would switch to foreign
competition.
Since 1987 Bryant &amp; May's profits have soared, although it has only raised
its prices in line with inflation, and the foreign competition has largely
fizzled out.
