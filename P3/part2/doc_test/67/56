MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday over-ruled
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, for the second time in
two weeks, and approved a proposal which would create a travel company with
30 per cent of the UK market.
Mr Heseltine's surprise decision to dismiss Sir Bryan's recommendation that
the Pounds 225m bid by Airtours' for its rival holiday company, Owners
Abroad, be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was attacked by
recession-hit independent operators which said it could force them out of
business.
The decision was also criticised by consumer groups, competition specialists
and Labour, which said the case for a referral to the MMC was overwhelming.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, described the decision as
'astonishing'. He said: 'For Mr Heseltine to disagree with the
director-general is a slap in the face and little short of a vote of no
confidence in Sir Bryan Carsberg.'
He called for an inquiry into 'behind-the-scenes activities' concerning the
bid in the Department of Trade and Industry. 'It is clear that the DTI
interfered with the Office of Fair Trading's pre-bid guidance as far back as
December,' he said. 'The public has a right to know why the DTI ignored the
pre-bid advice the OFT gave.'
Earlier this month, Mr Heseltine overturned a recommendation from Sir Bryan
that a merger of the infra-red defence components businesses of GEC and
Philips Electronics be examined by the MMC. Before that, the
director-general's advice to refer a merger had been over-ridden only 11
times in 20 years.
However, the OFT said that since Sir Bryan was appointed in June last year
Mr Heseltine had waved through 91 recommendations.
Mr Heseltine said the competition issues raised by the Airtours takeover
were not sufficient to justify a reference. Last Friday, he received a
report from the OFT saying that the proposed takeover warranted examination
by the MMC.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said: 'We are delighted by this
decision. We remain firmly of the view that the combination of Airtours and
Owners Abroad will prove beneficial to both consumers and shareholders
alike.'
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators, said: 'The Office of Fair Trading have investigated the situation
thoroughly and advised that the MMC be involved. We are extremely disturbed
that the views of those experienced in and knowledgeable about the industry
have been totally ignored by Mr Heseltine.'
Mr Heseltine's decision throws the spotlight back on to Owners Abroad, which
must produce its final defence against Airtours' bid this week. The
all-share offer currently values Owners Abroad at 114p and its partial cash
alternative at 110p, below the 129p level at which its shares closed
yesterday, up 13p on the day. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman,
yesterday repeated his claim that the Airtours offer undervalued his
company.
It emerged last night that Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister at the DTI with
responsibility for competition issues, stepped aside from looking at the bid
on February 15, after receiving a letter from Mr Crossland, who is one of
his constituents in Tatton, Cheshire. The DTI said Mr Hamilton stepped aside
to prevent people 'misinterpreting the situation'.
Mr Griffiths questioned the part played by Mr Hamilton. 'There must be an
investigation into the role of the minister and what part he played during
December, January and the first week of February,' he said.
'I understand he did not declare the interest formally, but his withdrawal
was the honourable thing to do. However, he will want to explain why no
conflict of interest was formally declared to parliament or made public.'
