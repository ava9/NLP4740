TWO OF the bids to take over British International Helicopters Ltd (BIHL),
Robert Maxwell's helicopter company now in administration, were yesterday
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Daniel Green writes.
Arthur Andersen, administrators of Maxwell's private companies, said the
decision would 'add to the uncertainty surrounding BIHL's future' and would
'have an adverse impact on the company's creditors.' The MMC has until
September 9 to make its ruling.
The referred bids, by Bond Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters, both UK
companies, would if successful reduce from three to two the number of
competitors in the North Sea helicopter services business.
If Bristow won control of BIHL's assets, it would have about 75 per cent of
the market, while if Bond won it would have nearly half.
It is understood that both the Office of Fair Trading and oil companies
operating in the North Sea objected to the bids.
