FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT says yes to Equifax offer

<TEXT>
UAPT-Infolink, the British credit reference company, has recommended
shareholders to accept the Pounds 51m offer from Equifax after the US credit
data group learned that its bid of 650p per share would not be referred to
the Monopolies and Merger Commission.
UAPT's board had previously recommended a 550p per share offer from Trans
Union, Equifax's main competitor in the US, because Trans Union had no UK
operations and so did not risk a referral to the MMC. Equifax already owns a
credit information business in the UK. However, UAPT's board later rescinded
its recommendation, effectively leaving the outcome of the bidding war to
the Office of Fair Trading.
