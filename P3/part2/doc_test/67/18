FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (1): Debt control takes cash
flow strain - As the UK economy recovers from recession, the need for good
credit management is greater than ever. Increasingly, companies are hiring
specialists - and an explosion of IT applications is making their task
easier

Not so long ago, a bank's guarded statement 'considered good' and two trade
references would have given suppliers sufficient comfort to start shipping
goods to new customers.
Credit management was frequently divorced from the sales process. The credit
controller was viewed as someone who impeded rather than the supported the
sales force. But the economic downturn has put paid to such quaint - and
arguably misguided - practices, ushering in a marked change in the way
companies manage their credit controls.
'The recession has seen company margins narrow so they cannot afford either
bad debts or very slow repayment,' says Trevor Phillips, chairman of the
Institute of Credit Management. 'There has been a push to bring in more
specialist employees to manage risk.'
Five years ago the position of credit manager might have been filled by a
company secretary, the finance director or even a clerk in the accounts
department. But in the last few years there has been a sharp increase in the
number of UK companies appointing very senior credit managers, many
reporting directly to the board.
Credit managers, both within companies and those who collate and supply
reports in the credit information industry, are also increasingly well
served by new information technology. 'A decade ago the operation was a
manual one,' says Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
leading credit information supplier. 'Reports were being typed out and that
barred a lot of companies from entering the business-to-business market.'
Now companies such as UAPT-Infolink and CNN are using technology to present
information in a manner which is breaking down the barriers to better
knowledge about customers. The explosion of technology coincides with a
withering assault on prices. Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the ICM agree that prices
in the last 10 years have halved. Selective services - for example, a search
to see if potential customers have any county court judgments against them -
can cost as little as Pounds 4, says Phillips.
While Dun &amp; Bradstreet remains the dominant supplier, with about 45 per cent
of the business-to-business credit information market in the UK, Infocheck
has leapt from nowhere in little more than a decade to control nearly a
fifth of the market.
Others to enter the market include Graydon (owned by leading credit
insurance groups NCM, Hermes and Coface), CCN and ICC Information Group.
One way in which companies have tried to combat these price pressures has
been to take the expensive keying-in of information to countries which have
lower labour costs. A number of credit information companies have set up
operations in the Philippines or Sri Lanka. UAPT-Infolink, a company better
known in the consumer credit market, but rapidly growing in the
business-to-business market, has recently set up in Harare, Zimbabwe.
However, cutting costs may not be enough. As technology has taken over many
of the most repetitive manual functions it is becoming increasingly obvious
that there is huge duplication of the industry's raw material: information.
Some form of consolidation within the industry would not only make sense,
but is likely.
'It is a recognised fact that there are too many players in the market and
there will probably be mergers within the next year,' says one senior
executive of newer credit information company. Many observers of the
industry share this view. Inevitably, attention has focused on what Dun &amp;
Bradstreet might do to retake some of the market share it has lost.
But what is the size of the market pool in which the six largest credit
providers are fishing?
In spite of the marked increase in demand for professional credit managers
and the increase in sales of the leading external credit information
providers, there still appears to be a sizeable market to go for. Philip
Mellor, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says that suppliers only seek credit
information for one in 19 transactions before they start to trade.
It is another mark of credit management's lack of penetration that of the
955,000 or so companies which file balance sheets (most of which offer
credit terms), considerably less than 10 per cent actually use the services
of an independent credit information service.
Trevor Phillips of the ICM says these figures are too low. Many smaller
companies take up credit references using their trade organisations or the
local chamber of commerce, he says. He estimates that any business with a
credit controller will be using external credit references for 60 per cent
of accounts where there is exposure of over Pounds 500.
Nevertheless, the ICM and the government have recognised the need for better
information. A brochure on credit management called 'Making the Cash Flow,'
published with the UK Department of Trade and Industry last year, sold like
hot cakes and is being rushed into a second edition.
But if technology is rapidly bringing down the price of credit information -
and turning into something of a commodity product - how are the providers
attempting to differentiate their products?
One way is more user-friendly presentation and on-line credit referencing.
Some groups are developing specialist knowledge; others are focusing on
packaging the information in a more user-friendly manner. And at least one
group is making software packages that allow a company's own credit policies
to be mixed with raw credit data on customers to produce credit
recommendations.
One of the most exciting developments in the area is CD-ROM technology.
According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Philip Mellor: 'It has really been able to
provide the delivery systems and format data in a way people can understand
and at a price they can afford.'
While falling prices, static profits and overcapacity might suggest an
industry with its tail between its legs, the reality is different. One
group, Infolink, could well be seeking a stock exchange listing in the near
future. The group, which has a number of venture capital companies on its
shareholders' list, had hoped to float before 1991 but was thwarted by the
recession.
The industry as a whole has also benefited from the debate about whether
there should be a statutory right to interest on debts paid late. While
remaining agnostic about whether legislation is necessary, credit
information suppliers have jumped - rightly - at the opportunity to point
out that their services can identify persistent late payers. By arming
suppliers with this information before the shipment of goods or provision of
services, companies can decide if they really want the business or whether
they want to renegotiate payment terms.
Furthermore, the industry might be about to receive a boost from the
clearing banks. In a little-publicised move, this month the clearers will
change the way in which they give the traditional credit references.
Until now, suppliers have been able to approach their own banks for credit
references on potential customers. Sometimes the service has been supplied
free, sometimes the cost is included in bank charges. From March 28, the
same supplier will have to approach the customer's bank for a reference
which will cost over Pounds 8. Some may find requesting permission of
potential clients to seek references the equivalent of commercial suicide;
others may examine what will still be a relatively perfunctory report, and
realise that credit information suppliers provide a more detailed service
for a similar price.
But probably the industry is going to expand its market best by talking more
loudly about what credit management can offer a modern manager. 'We have a
big educational process ahead of us,' says Martin Williams, Graydon's
commercial director. 'People out there do not understand or know what they
can get with a credit reference.'
