FT  03 SEP 94 / US burial group expands in UK: SCI to become Britain's
biggest funeral company with Pounds 193m takeover

Service Corporation International, the biggest funeral company in the US,
achieved the same status in Britain yesterday through a recommended Pounds
193m offer for listed funeral group Plantsbrook.
The announcement follows SCI's hostile but ultimately successful battle for
Plantsbrook's only listed competitor, Great Southern Group, and will give
the Houston-based company 15 per cent of Britain's funeral market.
Plantsbrook buries almost one in 10 Britons, and made a profit of Pounds 12m
last year. Its geographical strength is in northern England, whilst Great
Southern is strongly focused on the south, making it a logical fit. Mr Bill
Heiligbrodt, SCI's president, said the company intended 'to continue our
policy of vigorous growth within the UK'.
The bid for Plantsbrook was not unexpected. SCI had already purchased 8.4
per cent of Plantsbrook, and was known to be in discussions with the
company's largest shareholder, Pompes Funebres Generales (PFG), the French
funeral group which holds a 46.3 per cent stake.
SCI is paying 175p a share for PFG's stake, and the board of Plantsbrook has
recommended the offer to shareholders.
The offer represents a 10p premium to Plantsbrook's closing price on
Thursday, but a 113 per cent premium to the 82p a share price before SCI's
offer for Great Southern, on June 9. SCI has made no secret of its ambition
to spread beyond the UK, and it is understood that it has also discussed the
possible purchase of other PFG funeral businesses. 'We do want to be active
on the continent,' said Mr Heiligbrodt. PFG controls about a third of the
French burial market, and funeral businesses from Africa to Singapore.
SCI, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn), has
been the most acquisitive of the US funeral groups. It is set to invest
Dollars 250m this year in North America alone, with a further Pounds 306m on
its two UK purchases.
It also operates Australia's largest funeral business, and has a substantial
presence in Canada.
The UK funeral industry has consolidated rapidly, following a spate of
takeovers during the mid-1980s. About 25 per cent of the UK market is
accounted for by various branches of the Co-operative Movement, but SCI will
be the largest individual burial group, performing more than 80,000 burials
this year.
SCI's bid for Plantsbrook is unlikely to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, given the combined market share for funerals of 15 per
cent.
Any concerns would focus on pre-paid funerals, where Great Southern has a 65
per cent market share, and Plantsbrook a 15 per cent share. However, it is a
small market, with few barriers to entry. The offer for Plantsbrook is
contingent upon there being no MMC referral.
