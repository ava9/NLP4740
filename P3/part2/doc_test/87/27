EXCURSIONS IN THE REAL WORLD by William Trevor Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 201

THERE IS a deep unease that comes from reading William Trevor's fiction. It
causes one to be as glad to put down one of his novels or stories as one was
to pick it up. The reason for this is that people in whom he is interested
are doomed. There is no way out for them. None at all.
Being an Irish Protestant, his fiction is not priest-ridden like that of
Brian Moore, but that only makes the guilt from which his people suffer the
more immovable. His characters long to confess their guilt. They do so not
in the darkness and secrecy of the confessional, but out loud at a social
gathering or at a party. Often to a total stranger.
Inevitably such confessions tend to fall on ears that if not deaf are
bewildered. The recipient of the confession becomes defensive, or in some
other way hopelessly inadequate in response to the enormity of what is being
uttered to him or her. He can give momentary sympathy, or some kind of
practical help - like, say, the offer of another drink - to the sufferer;
what it is beyond his power to do is to grant him any lasting cure or
absolution.
The appearance of William Trevor: The Collected Stories on September 2
reveals the ubiquitous presence of these guilt-haunted individuals right
from the beginning. It was in the 1960s that Trevor's stories started to
appear in places like The London Magazine and The Listener. His first book
of stories, with its title-story The Day They Got Drunk On Cake, appeared in
1967, and Trevor was at once hailed by reviewers as a wizard in his handling
of this difficult form. He rapidly emerged as the successor to Maugham and
in Ireland to Sean O'Faolain.
Doom was everywhere in his early tales. There was the ex-RAF-man, now a
driving instructor whose pupil has crashed the car, drowning his sorrows
over several pints with a former colleague ('The Introspections of JP
Powers'); the elderly baby-sitter who finally becomes the baby ('In At The
Birth'); the schoolboy who in 'A School Story' announces his intention to
murder his father and step-mother. Most haunting of all was 'The Sins of
Edward Tripp'.
In this key story Edward T. is racked by guilt at having mercilessly teased
his sister when they were children. Now in middle age they live together.
Neither has married. Emily has her revenge on Edward by engulfing him in a
compulsive fantasy; she insists that each of their neighbours has, one after
another, been murdered. After each outburst Edward is forced to ring the
neighbour's bell and show her the person in the flesh to stop Emily's
raving. When Emily declares that Mrs Mayben has been killed 'in cold blood',
Edward decides to liberate himself from this intolerable situation by
confessing its root-cause to this woman when he enters her house.
It does not work out like that at all and the scene in which to her growing
horror Edward forces his confession upon the lady is typical of the
agonisingly hilarious tragi-comedy that is Trevor's trademark.
All these stories were England-based, as was Trevor when he wrote them. In
the later stories, masterpieces such as 'Attracta' and 'Beyond The Pale', he
returned to Ireland where he used his skill to reveal guilt not simply as
the product of individual fantasy but as the stuff of history. Although
Trevor has only rarely applied his gift for dialogue and incisive
character-sketching to the stage play, he has adapted several of these later
stories as plays for radio and television where they have proved extremely
effective in performance.
When he first began to experiment with the story-form Trevor was working in
London as an advertising copy-writer. Hitherto he has been reticent about
his own life but in Excursions in the Real World he breaks his silence about
himself. He is highly entertaining about his days in Hill Street, W1 and its
surrounding hostelries. There are tiny glimpses of colleagues who later
ceased to write copy and became poets or critics like Peter Porter, Edward
Lucie Smith, but the major portrait here in 'A Public House Man' is of one
Marchant Smith, a great copy-writer in his day and Trevor's immediate boss.
Trevor grew up in the 1930s in the seaside town of Youghal where his father
was a bank clerk. He describes his early education among nuns as almost the
only Protestant boy in the convent school; then less happily at Sandford
Park and St Columba's in Dublin. The author of The Old Boys is charitable
but penetrating about his earliest teachers. He suggests that frequent
visits to the cinema made a more lasting impact on his mind than the formal
instruction.
The sketches dealing with his youth in Ireland and period in the London of
the 1960s are more memorable than the later pieces on Venice, Stockholm, the
Ticino, New York, San Francisco and the brief appreciations of Yeats,
O'Casey, Beckett, Somerville and Ross. The overall mood is nonchalant, wry,
reflective: the style of a born raconteur whose timing is just a little too
perfect for his anecdotes to be completely spontaneous - but make no
mistake, they remain utterly riveting.
