THE LETTERS OF NANCY MITFORD: LOVE FROM NANCY edited by Charlotte Mosley
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 538 pages
IN THOSE country houses where bedrooms are always kept ready for guests,
this collection of Nancy Mitford's letters will make an appropriate addition
to the books thoughtfully placed there. One or two of these effervescent
epistles should provide an ideal nightcap. But consumed in bulk in the
belief that here is a volume comparable in readability to novels like The
Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate, The Blessing, or period-pieces like
Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire in Love, The Sun King, the reader is likely to
suffer rejection symptoms.
Nancy Mitford was a compulsive letter writer. For much of her life she was
isolated geographically from the people she loved most and she poured out
her thoughts to them in a ceaseless flow. The fact that so much of what she
writes seems at this distance of time gushingly trivial is not really her
fault. There was no thought of pleasing posterity when these letters were
written nor of eventual publication - only of keeping the gossip going.
Occasionally letters written for purely private consumption do have the
lasting worth to become literature. The classic instance is the
correspondence of the Marquise de Sevigne (1626-96). She wrote long chatty
letters almost every day to her daughter in another part of France. Nancy's
friend Violet Hammersley, 'the Wid' - to whom many of the letters in this
book are addressed - made an English translation of Mme de Sevigne.
The comparison is not to Nancy's advantage. The Marquise was involved in
much of what was going on both at the court and in the country. We owe to
her, for instance, an account of the trial of Fouquet; of Vatel's, Louis
XIV's chef's, suicide; of a performance of Racine's tragedy Esther. By
contrast Nancy seems often tediously absorbed in her own domestic affairs,
in buying modish clothes, and in keeping track of who among her wide circle
of well-born friends was currently liaising or quarreling with whom.
The war forced her to emerge from her shell; a wartime job in a Mayfair
bookshop gave her a sense of the workaday world, though many of the
customers were her own smart friends. On one occasion, just after the war,
her rapidly blossoming reputation as a novelist took her into the
hurly-burly of the theatre. She was commissioned in 1949 by HM Tennant to
make an English version of Andre Roussin's comedy The Little Hut. Nancy did
a fine job, gaining a long run on Shaftesbury Avenue for the piece and
providing Robert Morley with a juicy starring role.
Nancy was worried about what the author would say to her embellishments of
his piece. 'I guess' she concluded, 'so long as it goes well and makes money
he won't mind'. He didn't; but disappointingly we get no account of the
meeting between them or of the first night. Her friendship with the director
 -Peter Brook, aged 25, and already well-known - comes to a sudden
unexplained full-stop, and in spite of a handsome share of the gross, she is
turned off working for the theatre for the rest of her life. It is almost as
if even that degree of exposure to - in her eyes - a common environment was
too much for her.
What we have, then, is a high-level Aga saga; the Aga in her case being the
Aga Khan. Nancy meets him at a party given by Daisy Fellowes at her
apartment in Paris in 1948, one of thousands of similar gatherings she
attended. 'Mrs Rodd?' he greets her. 'Your grandfather was a great friend of
mine . . . I expect you know he just fell between two stools - it doesn't do
for brilliant people to be snobs or snobs to be brilliant'.
The Aga put his finger on it. For Nancy and her friends, snobbery was their
greatest commitment, transcending all other affiliations, professional,
political, religious. The extent of the name-dropping in these letters may
be gauged by the amount of work the editor Charlotte Mosley has had to do to
make them comprehensible to the reader who comes to them un-Debretted. It is
nothing short of heroic.
There have been two biographies of Nancy Mitford - a personal one by Harold
Acton and a comprehensive one by Selena Hastings; and we also have an
account of her within the context of the whole family-group in Jonathan
Guiness's The House of Mitford (1984). The Letters put more flesh on these
biographical bones: they give insights into her draconian childhood, her
disastrous marriage to Peter Rodd ('Prod'), whom she did not succeed in
divorcing until 1957. She met her great passionate attachment, the Gaullist
Free French diplomat, Colonel Gaston Palewski in London during the war, and
followed him to Paris afterwards. She never became his wife or his mistress
but enjoyed his company often and was in regular communication with him
until her death in 1973. Even at her most abject her letters to him have
unfailing high-spirits, her redeeming virtue.
He is always addressed in English; as 'Dear darling' or sometimes jokingly
as 'Dear Colonial'. Many of her friends and relations are likewise known by
their in-group nick-names. Those for her own family have become common
currency thanks to the books they have published about each other - Farv,
Muv (Lord and Lady Redesdale), Debo (Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire) Decca
(Jessica), Bobo (Unity, Hitler's admirer who attempted suicide and died in
1948), Bodley (Diana, Lady Mosley) to whom she wrote many of the letters
printed here. But who the heck are Keck, Lulu, Honks and Boots? Answer:
Cecil Beaton, Louise de Vilmorin, Lady Diana Cooper, Cyril Connolly. All
such sobriquets are explicated by Charlotte Mosley in a rash of square
brackets within the text.
Snobbery breeds deep enmities. Thus the full nickname given to Connolly,
perhaps the most brilliant, if not the most snobbish of them all, was
Smarty-Boots. When the tables are turned on him and Evelyn Waugh gives The
Unquiet Grave a stinking review in The Tablet, Nancy tells Waugh how much
she enjoyed his 'Boots-baiting'. Waugh was her great mentor and in her
letters to him she is at her most candid. 'You must remember' she tells him
almost in tears at his strictures on the manuscript of Love in a Cold
Climate, 'That I'm an uneducated woman (her emphasis)'.
Nancy also tells Waugh what happened when her mother dined with the Colonel.
She picked all the truffles out of her omelette and left them. 'The Col
delighted - Most people pick out the truffles and leave the rest, very
patrician of her'. Pace Lady Redesdale, I feel that the best way to read
this book is the non-patrician way. To pick out the truffles and leave the
rest.
