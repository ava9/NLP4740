RIDER HAGGARD AND THE LOST EMPIRE by Tom Pocock Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds
20, 263 pages
IN 1885 a young Norfolk barrister called Rider Haggard, who had an
adventurous spell in South Africa already behind him, took a bet from his
brother that he could not match a new best-seller called Treasure Island. In
the two years that followed, in a well-nigh unbelievable burst of creative
and imaginative energy, Haggard wrote and published King Solomon's Mines,
Allan Quatermain, Jess and She.
After that, it is hardly surprising that the remaining 38 years can sound
anti-climactic, although they were undeniably distinguished, successful and
lucrative. Tom Pocock, who is a veteran Fleet Street journalist and an
experienced biographer, has produced a brusque, no-nonsense, no-padding life
story of a fascinating man in which he acknowledges that his aim has been to
concentrate not so much on the novelist as on the public servant, above all
on the visionary of the British Empire.
This is the first biography for over ten years and it tells a fairly
familiar tale to good effect. The boy was denied a gentleman's education by
his Norfolk squire father and sent off to South Africa in 1875, in time to
hoist the Union Jack over Pretoria in the British annexation of the
Transvaal - and also to meet a certain Umslopagaas and fall for the Zulus.
He became the youngest Registrar of the High Court, farmed ostriches in the
middle of the first Anglo-Boer War, and came home to the boredom of
barristers' chambers where he found rapid fame and fortune with his
Africa-inspired fantasies.
After some years of this, Mr Pocock claims, Haggard realised he had
perfected a novelist's formula which was a licence to print money, and for
the rest of his life he churned out the fiction - he wrote 58 novels, most
of which are utterly forgotten today - while getting on with his real
interests. He was passionately concerned about agricultural reform, land
settlement, and the future of the Empire.
He was no blimp and certainly not a conventional Tory. But he believed in
'the divine right of a great civilising people'; he wrote, 'on only one
condition . . . have we the right to take the black man's land, and that is
that we provide them with an equal and just Government, and allow no
maltreatment of them . . . but on the contrary do our best to elevate them
and wean them from savage customs. Otherwise the practice is surely
indefensible.' His imperialism linked logically with his concern for the
health of British agriculture, which was central to the empire's economy.
His particular concern was to promote the (white) peopling of the Empire -
'the great house with the empty rooms', as he once put it in a vivid phrase
 -and he served, unpaid, on a long sequence of royal commissions and the
like, travelling the world to promote policies which were almost all
rejected by Westminster.
After the death of his beloved nine-year-old son, his life was gloomy:
Pocock is good on the pessimism, in the post-1918 years, of upper-class
imperialists like Haggard and his great friend Kipling. Meanwhile Haggard
supported Lily, the First Great Love so often glimpsed in his novels, in a
house in Aldeburgh (later to be occupied by Britten and Pears) as she
disintegrated, Ayesha-like, from the syphilis her husband, Haggard's rival,
had given her.
All of this is well enough done, but Mr Pocock must have realised that he is
in danger of having written Hamlet without the Prince. The truth is that
Haggard is principally interesting because he wrote a sequence of remarkable
fictions which, a hundred years later, continue to haunt our imagination
(Pocock's title, with its echo of Haggard's influence on present-day dramas
like Indiana Jones, suggests that he admits this). See Pocock's glancing
reference to She, where he merely footnotes a reference to the book's later
interest for Jungians and Freudians and then skidaddles away: this really
won't do, we deserve to be told just a little more. To ignore the books,
without whose existence we would not be reading this biography, becomes
perverse: I cannot believe that Haggard was so uninvolved in these tales
which he dictated every day, and I begin to doubt whether Mr Pocock has
actually read many of the novels he lists - but that, I am sure, is an
unworthy thought.
Let us remind ourselves, then, that Haggard was a popular novelist of genius
who also happened to be a Norfolk farmer and a man of public affairs. In
that order. Let's remember the best of his novels are unforgettable because
their resonances and references belong to the world of universal myth. As CS
Lewis once wrote, 'Haggard's best work will survive because . . . a great
myth is relevant as long as the predicament of humanity lasts.' Less
elegantly, VS Pritchett has written of Haggard letting down a suction pump
into the Unconscious. It would be good to read more about this and less
about Sir Rider's activities for the Royal Colonial Institute in 1916.
