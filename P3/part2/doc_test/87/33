You used to read him, in the late '50s, in the back pages of slim literary 
magazines in the Fiction and Literature Room of the Main Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
To be reading Charles Bukowski at all meant you weren't like the rest of 
"them." You didn't buy Frank Sinatra albums with the tinted singer posing 
against pale turquoise covers. You didn't watch Ed Sullivan. You turned up your 
nose at Milton Berle. You didn't have a television in the house! And you 
snickered at the middle-brow fiction of the day. Your parents may have invested 
in "By Love Possessed" by James Gould Cozzens, but not you. You put on your 
black turtleneck and hauled on out to the Fiction and Literature Room, waiting 
for the next monthly issue of whatever quarterlies there were, waiting for the 
next things that Bukowski had to say. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bukowski drank himself into an unattractive stupor on a regular basis 
and then wrote about it. He wasn't very fond of the ladies he slept with, but 
he slept with a lot of them, and then wrote about it. He was as old as our 
parents, it seemed: Even then, he was an old guy -- but he was as 
unregenerately messy as an unmade bed; bleary-eyed, his complexion a relief map 
of the Andes put together by a clumsy seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Even from his photographs, you sensed that he took baths only on Christmas and 
Easter -- or, more correctly, in the pagan fashion -- on the summer and winter 
solstices. He was a bum. He was poor. He was cantankerous. And he wrote like a 
17-year-old angel with pink sheets and golden wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, Bukowski's troubles deepened. He went from being the most obscure 
of poets to something of a media product. Hells Angels on their bikes idolized 
him. He got involved in some battle-of-the-sexes triangle that played out in 
the then-extremely popular Los Angeles Free Press. The girl he left behind 
mourned long and publicly -- and then wrote an embarrassing poem to her belly, 
lying low and slack out along her thighs. (It was the '60s. People did things 
like that.) Bukowski himself seemed to reduce, to disappear, under ever-thicker 
coats of lamination as Los Angeles' "Bad Boy." 
</P>
<P>
But one time, during a television documentary of his life, Bukowski, hanging 
out in a California bungalow in Silver Lake, or Echo Park, squared off against 
the ghost of his dead Prussian father: He was the kind of man, Bukowski 
remembered, who would send his son out to mow the lawn, demanding that the lawn 
be mowed this way and that way, and that way, and this way again, so that every 
single blade of grass would be cut at exactly the same height. After the young 
Bukowski had finished the lawn, his father would come out, lie flat down on the 
sidewalk, and sight along every square inch of grass. If he could find one 
blade that still grew higher than the others, Bukowski's father would beat him 
mercilessly. "But I'm not going to say too much about him," the sluggish, 
insolent, sloppy, drunken, cantankerous poet allowed, "because whatever I do, 
that Prussian blood still runs in my veins," or so I remember those words. 
</P>
<P>
The Prussian blood always showed, in Bukowski's perfect attention to craft. But 
now, in "Hollywood," a charming, elegiac novel, the poet turns his attention to 
the weird insistence and inevitability of the American Dream. If you work 
terribly hard in America; if you keep mowing that metaphorical lawn, if you do 
your work and do your work, then success is sure to follow, like a dog follows 
you to school. In spite of all the drink, all the diatribes, all the 
disgruntled ladies he's left in his wake, success has come to Charles Bukowski. 
The Establishment has even made a movie about his life, "Barfly," with genuine 
movie stars, Mickey Roarke and Faye Dunaway. The hard-working, hard-drinking 
poet finally "went Hollywood," and "Hollywood" is his gentle, self-forgiving 
novel about that phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
We see the poet as a real old guy, Hank Chinaski, married now to Sarah, a savvy 
Nora Charles of a wife, who is apt to interrupt her husband just as he gets 
conversationally wound up: "It's one of his favorite stories," she'll say. "I 
love him, but you have no idea how many times I've had to listen to that 
story." And, yes, when they go to the movies, Chinaski must go through the 
embarrassing, all-too-familiar ritual: Two tickets, "one senior." Sarah has 
weaned the poet, (for the most part) away from hard liquor, but both of them 
are devoted to good red wine. They live a pleasing, private existence until the 
fateful day when an independent producer asks Chinaski to write a screenplay 
about his own past life, and tosses in $10,000 as advance and incentive. 
Chinaski agrees: It sounds like fun and it won't be taxing enough to keep him 
away from what has become his real vocation, spending long, lucrative days at 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
The narrative then embarks on parallel courses. A movie is being made, and the 
former avant-garde poet finds himself in the thick of that process: He meets 
the creme de la creme of film land; a French "genius," for instance, who goes 
by the moniker of Jean-Paul Modard: " . . . We poured some more wine. It was 
all really excellent. Life was good. All you had to do in their little world 
was be a writer or an artist or a ballet dancer and you could just sit or stand 
around, inhaling and exhaling, drinking wine, pretending you knew what the 
Hell." 
</P>
<P>
But Chinaski can't be so pure and aloof about his own "art" anymore. That 
$10,000 brings him his very own tax man, who assures him he has to spend his 
money before the government gets it. He and Sarah go house hunting in a place 
where they think they "ought" to be -- Topanga Canyon. A grizzled lady realtor 
with a country accent you can cut with a butter knife tries to sell them a cozy 
little cabin where some of the Manson murders came down. They end up buying a 
car instead -- a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like that. The project's funding starts and stops a million times. 
The producer threatens literally to dismember himself in order to get the movie 
completed. But as the production begins, goes on, ends, Chinaski is hit by a 
terrible sadness. The movie is about barflys, and there was a time when 
Chinaski was a barfly. A time when there was only him and words and liquor, and 
nothing else. A time when -- all our current anti-alcohol rhetoric to the 
contrary -- Chinaski knows for sure he's done his best work. 
</P>
<P>
He and Sarah may go to screenings now, armed with their own separate bottles of 
wine, but they cannot be outrageous, because they are too successful. And 
Chinaski is old. He can watch his life re-enacted, but he can't get back in. He 
is left with the results of his life: a good woman who loves him and deflates 
him, a car that runs like a top, biker-fans who embarrass him; a respectable 
life and a distinguished body of work. Even Bukowski's exacting father might 
approve. "Hollywood" is strange, Bukowski tells us. But life is even stranger.
