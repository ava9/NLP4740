THE undisputed star of the Dublin Theatre Festival's first week is the Royal
Shakespeare Company's magnificent production of The Winter's Tale directed
by Adrian Noble. Its combination of verve and opulence and the sheer
excellence of the acting had audiences gasping with wonder.
Dublin's Gate Theatre has imported Karel Reisz to direct Niamh Cusack in A
Doll's House while the Abbey's artistic director Garry Hynes has chosen to
mark the end of her term there by directing Tom Murphy's 1968 play, Famine.
Both provide long evenings of serious theatre but fail to generate the
excitement that was around last summer when new plays by Brian Friel and
Billy Roche were staged.
It seems a rather unfestive festival, almost jinxed. A new play by Joe
O'Byrne has been withdrawn at the last minute, as has a one-man show by
Dubliner Mannix Flynn; the only big excitement left in the second week is
Rough Magic's production of The Way of the World in 1930s costume; and as I
write this I am told of the death of Cyril Cusack whose daughter plays the
lead in A Doll's House.
Karel Reisz has come to theatre direction from a long and distinguished
cinema career (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Morgan - a Suitable Case
for Treatment, etc) - his work shows the stamp of maturity in its precision
and its lack of gimmickry. Reisz realises that A Doll's House is not about
divorce or the rights of women, but about the romantic notion of self
fulfilment, and consequently the final scene in which Norah leaves her
husband and children to 'find herself' remains as moving if not quite as
shocking as in 1879.
Assheton Gorton's set is a stuffy, over-decorated, predominantly brown
bourgeois apartment with doll's house-like cut out ornaments among its
plaster work. Rupert Murray's atmospheric lighting works in conjunction with
the set's unusual perspective to change mood and highlight the drama.
It is generally the child-wife Norah who gains all the attention and
sympathy, but here equal weight must be given to her husband, Torvald,
impeccably played by Ian McElhinney. Torvald is not portrayed as an
unfeeling monster, but as a kind, affectionate and almost fun-loving
husband. True, he can also be bossy, insensitive and pompous, but these are
not the reasons why Norah is leaving: it is the conventions of society that
she is rebelling against rather than her husband who just happens to embody
these restrictions. When Torvald realises he is being rejected you feel
positively sorry for him. The tragedy is as much Torvald's as Norah's.
Niamh Cusack looks the right age for Norah - late 20s, say. Her rather
stagey mannerisms seem at odds with such a realistic play, and even
apparently impulsive movements appear carefully choreographed. She can
certainly hold an audience, but I missed the depths of angst which a more
intellectual (and almost inevitably older) actress could bring to the part.
Susan FitzGerald is wonderfully self-assure as the friend, Mrs Linde, and
Timothy Walker's Krogstad is slightly seedy as well as sinister. My only
reservation about this highly accomplished evening is the decision to play
the three acts with two intervals.
In fact, the Gate's production ran for only a quarter of an hour longer than
the Abbey's Famine, which had only the one interval. There is a school of
thought which believes that Famine is a neglected classic. It does not seem
particularly neglected to me, having had two previous productions in Dublin
and one in Galway, neither does it seem in any sense a classic.
Famine is written in a series of 12 scenes set in the village of Glanconnor
in 1846, the second year that the potato crop failed. It charts the effect
of hunger on a group of villagers. Some take up the only relief offered by
the landlord, a ticket to Canada. One man kills two policemen, hoping to
start an uprising. Others die or are dying.
The chief problem with the play is its schematic form. Peasants, priests and
landlords all represent particular reactions to events but never emerge as
real characters. It is more like watching a very violent pageant than a
play.
I hoped that Garry Hynes would do something new with it, but alas, no. The
set by Frank Conway, consists of a tumbled down stone circle which occupies
most of the stage and confines the actors to the centre or the wings to no
good purpose. They sometimes rant so hard that they become inaudible. The
lighting, which fails to illuminate the relevant faces, does not help. For
once here is a play which demands historical accuracy and instead we are
given pointless anachronisms - cigarettes, barbed wire. The degradation and
suffering of the famine's victims, the misguided government policy and the
consequent impotence of the landlords are clearly shown here, but they are
not made into theatre. We need a play about the famine, but this is not the
one.
