SUPERVISORS EXPLORE FUNDING ALTERNATIVES TO BUILD COURTS, JAILS 
</P>

<P>
With Proposition A and its $1.6 billion for new jails in legal limbo, the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday began exploring other ways to 
build courts and detention facilities -- and immediately encountered strong 
opposition to one of the most economically promising alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring the gloomy prospect of what one top county administrator termed "life 
without Proposition A," a half-cent sales tax narrowly approved by voters 
countywide last June, the supervisors reviewed a variety of funding options for 
new jails and courts. Among the possibilities were a utility tax, business 
license fees in the unincorporated areas, new sales taxes and a "bed tax," 
under which cities would pay a pro-rated share of jail costs depending on how 
many of their residents are housed in them. Most of the alternatives would 
require special state legislation and voters' approval. 
</P>
<P>
Though intrigued by some of the suggestions, the board voted unanimously to 
postpone action on most of them pending further study. However, the supervisors 
also directed Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey to preliminarily move 
ahead on three options: the jails' "bed tax," business license fee increases 
and the possible formation of a so-called Joint Powers Authority with the city 
of San Diego to share downtown jail and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deferred Action 
</P>
<P>
The board also deferred action on a recommendation by Hickey's office that 
$100,000 be allocated for preliminary design work on a new central pretrial 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Because of jail crowding, most people arrested on misdemeanor charges now are 
immediately released, and many of them fail to appear in court. Although 
correcting that situation is the county's top criminal-justice priority, the 
supervisors said Tuesday that it makes little sense to spend money to design a 
facility before a site is determined and until they review the county's overall 
budget later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Riverside County Superior Court judge threw the county's short- 
and long-term jail-building plans into disarray by declaring Proposition A 
unconstitutional on the grounds that its 50.6% voter approval fell short of the 
two-thirds margin for new taxes mandated by Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 
statewide property tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic About Tax 
</P>
<P>
Although county leaders profess optimism that the legality of the half-cent 
sales tax will be upheld on appeal -- a process that could last up to two years 
-- they also acknowledge that it would be imprudent to count on that happening. 
Accordingly, they described Tuesday's meeting as the first step toward being 
prepared if their worst fiscal nightmares become reality, forcing them to 
replace the estimated $1.6 billion that Proposition A would generate for new 
jails and courts over its 10-year life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, the county will have to continue building jails," Supervisor 
Susan Golding said. "It behooves us to move as rapidly as possible . . . so we 
can take additional steps when we find out the result of Proposition A." 
</P>
<P>
One of the major alternatives suggested by county administrators is a utility 
users tax that could be added to consumers' monthly gas and electric bills, as 
well as water, telephone and cable television charges. The surcharge would be 
collected by the utilities and forwarded to the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utilities Tax Appealing 
</P>
<P>
Needing hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade to meet the 
county's exploding criminal-justice demands, county administrators 
characterized a utilities tax as being one of the most viable options to raise 
such large amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the broad tax base, the tax can generate a significant amount of 
revenue," Rich Robinson, director of the county's Special Projects Office, said 
in a report to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under county estimates, a 1% utilities tax would raise $24.5 million annually, 
and a 5% surcharge would generate $122.5 million a year. Statewide, utility 
user tax rates average about 5%, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. official, however, told supervisors Tuesday 
that his company is "not enamored with the idea of being a collection agency 
for the county." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Fears Being Tarred 
</P>
<P>
"The public's perception would be a higher utility bill," said Art Bishop, a 
senior government affairs representative for SDG&amp;E. "Over time, people 
would not differentiate between what was being collected as a tax and their 
normal utility bill. They'd just think they were paying a higher utility bill . 
. . and blame us." 
</P>
<P>
Describing a utility tax as regressive, Bishop also argued that such a tax 
would be especially painful for low-income consumers -- a point echoed by 
Supervisor Leon Williams. 
</P>
<P>
To authorize the county to place a utility users tax on the ballot, the state 
Legislature would have to pass special legislation. Then, if the tax were to be 
used solely for the construction and operation of jails and courts, it would 
require a two-thirds public vote. If the county planned to use the revenue for 
general governmental purposes, only a simple majority vote would be required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5% Surcharge Inadequate 
</P>
<P>
Even a 5% utility surcharge would be inadequate to build and operate the 
facilities needed to alleviate the county's longstanding jail crowding problem 
and a badly overextended court system, county officials and others 
acknowledged. As of April 3, the inmate population in county jails totaled 
4,706 -- nearly twice the facilities' official capacity of 2,396. By 1998, 
Hickey's office estimates, the county will have to have more than 8,500 new 
jail beds to keep pace with the growing number of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"If the half-cent sales tax is ultimately declared invalid, the county will be 
put in the position of having to look at probably using a variety of these 
options at the same time," said Mark Nelson, executive director of the San 
Diego Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Concurring, Robinson explained that, should Proposition A's funds not be 
available, the county will have to resort to a "shotgun-type approach" aimed at 
relying upon multiple taxes and other methods to raise about the same amount of 
money. Other than the utilities tax, most of the alternatives being considered 
would generate only a fraction of what Proposition A would have generated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cities Would Share 
</P>
<P>
Under the "bed tax" option, the 18 cities within the county would be asked to 
share the operational costs of jails, based either on population or, more 
precisely, on the number of people arrested within their boundaries who are 
jailed. However, state law now precludes counties from charging cities for 
housing felony arrestees -- a barrier that could dramatically curtail that 
option's economic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, establishment of business license fees for companies operating in 
the unincorporated areas of the county, which also would require special 
legislation, would raise less than $2 million a year, county officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation authorizing a joint-powers agreement between the county and the 
city of San Diego to finance construction and operation of downtown jails and 
courts is already in place. However, that option would raise only about $3.8 
million annually in lease revenue, fines, so-called tax increment funds and 
state or federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
The other options being reviewed include: 
</P>
<P>
* A new half-cent countywide sales tax available for general governmental 
purposes, including jails and courts. In contrast to Proposition A, such a tax 
could be in place for longer than 10 years. Another major advantage, county 
officials said, is that, even if the courts scuttle Proposition A, local 
residents already would be accustomed to paying the 7% sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
* A $50 surcharge on the filing fee for civil lawsuits, which could raise about 
$1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Legislation specifying that a majority vote is sufficient for special taxes 
"to meet an urgent or emergency situation," such as jail crowding. Critics, 
however, contend that such legislation would seriously undermine Proposition 13 
by eliminating the two-thirds requirement for new special taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Passage of a statewide sales tax or bond issue for jails and courts.
