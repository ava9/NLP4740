Gov. George Deukmejian's blue pencil fell heavy on San Diego County Friday as 
he vetoed millions of dollars in local projects before signing the state's 
$49.3-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cuts, Deukmejian left intact legislation sponsored by Assemblyman 
Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to set aside $500,000 to help build migrant 
farm-worker housing in North County, a proposal that the governor disallowed 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely pleased that there is recognition that the homeless problem is 
much greater than the usual view of people wandering on the streets in the 
inner-city," Frazee said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Deukmejian vetoed the $500,000 migrant housing request after 
explaining that "there did not seem to be community support for the program," 
Frazee said. 
</P>
<P>
That observation prompted Frazee to pull together community activists and other 
local governmental officials in a task force to address the problem and send a 
message to the governor that San Diego County needs the housing to help farm 
workers now living in makeshift huts in North County ravines and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"They are economic contributors to our society, and there's a recognition that 
there needs to be participation by all levels of government in solving the 
problem," he said, adding that the one-time $500,000 appropriation is intended 
to be used as "seed" money for housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Out on Parks, Education 
</P>
<P>
While the county picked up money for farm-worker housing, it lost several key 
park and higher education projects in Deukmejian's quest to trim $489 million 
-- or 1% -- of the spending plan sent to him by the Legislature last week. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is $375,000 set aside by the Legislature to pay for restoration of Mission 
Bay, which has been bedeviled by a series of sewage spills in recent years. 
Also gone is $4.7 million lawmakers set aside for a new chemistry and geology 
building at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Another cut erased $2.7 million for the purchase of the Bohannon Pottery 
Village as part of the Old Town State Park, described by Assemblywoman Lucy 
Killea (D-San Diego) as one of the biggest losses in this year's budget wars. 
</P>
<P>
Killea and other legislators wanted to purchase the village property to create 
a formal entrance to the popular tourist attraction. "That's something we can 
come back on and recoup next year," Killea said. "I intend to work on it." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also deleted $1.2 million that state Sen. William A. Craven 
(R-Oceanside) wanted to buy 2.15 acres close to the Torrey Pines State Beach 
and Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Craven said Friday that the money was not a new appropriation, but 
was actually money left over from another, unsuccessful San Diego County park 
project that was included in the governor's proposed budget earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to keep the money in San Diego and he turned us down," said 
Scott Johnson, the aide. "We asked for a little and got less. We're disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
The scenic property, owned by former San Diego Charger Lance Alworth, is at 
Camino del Mar and Carmel Valley Road and has been openly coveted by 
environmentalists ever since Alworth announced plans to develop a restaurant 
and office building there. 
</P>
<P>
Other San Diego County items cut from the budget include: 
</P>
<P>
* $75,000 for the Regional Water Quality Control Board to help coordinate a 
multi-agency effort to clean up San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
* $55,000 to establish a temporary San Diego field office for the state's 
Public Utilities Commission, which will be considering the fate of the proposed 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger with Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
* $500,000 set aside to help the PUC pay for "public education, understanding 
and participation" in the proposed merger deliberations. The governor said the 
PUC's division of ratepayer advocates should handle such a task. "It would be 
inappropriate for a government entity to collect funds for the type of 
informational activities specified in this provision," Deukmejian wrote in his 
veto message. 
</P>
<P>
* Two appropriations to UC San Diego, one for $428,000 to research alternatives 
to animal experiments and the other for $300,000 to conduct aquaculture and 
fisheries research. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also slashed two-thirds of a proposed $75 million in extra money 
to go for mental health programs statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of San Diego County, that cut means local mental health programs will 
receive an estimated $3.2 million instead of the nearly $6 million in extra 
funds set aside by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian also took steps to help San Diego County -- and others that have 
been traditionally under-funded for mental health programs -- in the long run 
by making sure a special formula is used to help them catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The formula was written into state law three years ago and directs that at 
least half of all increases in the mental health budget go toward those 
under-funded counties. But a legislative conference committee, at the behest of 
Los Angeles lawmakers, changed that language to minimize the so-called 
equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian deleted the conference committee language and restored the special 
formula that favors the under-funded counties such as San Diego.
