STUDY TO CONSIDER WIDENING USE OF CAR-POOL LANES; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: THE IDEA WOULD BE TO ENTICE COMMUTERS TO DRIVE THE FREEWAYS BEFORE AND 
AFTER PEAK HOURS, WHEN THE HIGH-OCCUPANCY LANES WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL.

Orange County's car-pool lanes, long a point of controversy among beleaguered 
commuters, might be opened to all cars during non-peak hours if a study 
commissioned Monday recommends pursuing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The study, to cost $10,000, was ordered Monday by the Orange County 
Transportation Commission. Chuck Fuhs, a nationally recognized expert in 
high-occupancy vehicle lane issues, will perform the study, which will look at 
how similar lanes across the country are managed. Fuhs is expected to finish 
his work in November and present the report to the OCTC before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to see is whether we can encourage single-occupant vehicles 
to use the highways in off-peak hours," said Dana Reed, the commission's 
chairman. Reed added that officials want to know if opening the lanes after 
rush hour might encourage drivers to avoid the freeway until then. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Orange County's car-pool lanes bar all vehicles with fewer than two 
occupants 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Changing that restriction could have a spillover effect on other counties and 
is not likely to be made in the near future, officials said. But the study 
could provide ammunition to one side or the other in the longstanding debate 
over high-occupancy lanes, which exist on the Costa Mesa and San Diego 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the lanes argue that they encourage car-pooling, aiding efforts 
to curb traffic and air pollution. Opponents, however, view them as an 
unnecessary obstacle to commuting and argue that they worsen traffic flow 
rather than improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Caught between those vocal constituencies, some officials have searched for a 
middle ground, so far without success. County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who 
proposed the study, said Monday that he hoped that it could help "nullify some 
of the differences that we have in the community." 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials, who have previously expressed their 
support for 24-hour car-pool lanes, eyed the study's intentions skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
"People right now are just getting used to the fact that you can't go in those 
lanes unless you have two people in the car," CHP Officer Angel Johnson said. 
"It would be much more confusing if there were certain hours when you could, 
and others when you couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Drivers for Highway Safety, an organization vehemently opposed to 
the car-pool lanes, co-chairman Bill Ward greeted news of the study with 
cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better for those lanes to be open than for them to be closed," Ward said. 
"We'd like to see them opened all day long, but most of the day is better than 
none at all." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the study were to recommend ending the 24-hour-a-day restricted access, 
the county probably could not implement it without the agreement of governments 
in neighboring counties and cities, officials said. Otherwise, they noted, open 
lanes in one county could funnel directly into restricted ones as they passed 
over local borders. Drivers would be forced to switch lanes to avoid breaking 
laws in neighboring counties, adding to confusion and possibly increasing 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We fit into a regional context," said Tom Fortune, public affairs director for 
the Transportation Commission. "Whatever we do is probably going to need to be 
part of a regional policy." 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County debates the future of its car-pool lanes, officials 
released a report Monday indicating that enforcement of the lane regulations 
has dramatically improved in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Added patrols and new signs on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways have led 
to a sharp reduction in the number of motorists violating car-pool lane 
restrictions on those highways, according to the report, prepared by the 
California Department of Transportation for the OCTC. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that the number of single-occupant cars illegally using the 
high-occupany lanes has dropped by 50% on the southbound San Diego Freeway 
since May 1, when additional Highway Patrol officers were added to the route. 
Northbound violations during the same period have dropped from 6% of the cars 
using the lane to less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the increased number of CHP officers monitoring the San Diego 
Freeway, warning signs on the Costa Mesa Freeway also seem to have cut down on 
the number of violations. 
</P>
<P>
Signs notifying drivers that they can be fined $246 for a first offense were 
posted on April 25 in several places along the Costa Mesa Freeway. Since then, 
the violation rate has dropped by more than 50%, according to the Caltrans 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Ward, however, said that passenger counts are difficult to verify, as 
they require surveyors to gauge the number of people in a car as it crosses 
beneath an overpass, often at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Ward also questioned the relevance of the numbers, noting that violations drop 
off markedly after rush hours, since the highway becomes less congested and 
motorists have less incentive to cheat.
