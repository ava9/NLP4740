The coastal wetlands of Southern California are rapidly disappearing. At the 
turn of the century, there were about 53,000 acres of coastal wetlands between 
Morro Bay and Ensenada, Mexico, according to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. Only 
about 11,000 acres remain. These tidal wetlands are explored in a new exhibit, 
"Mud Flats: Cradle of Life," at the Cabrillo Museum in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 species of marine fish rely on this habitat for spawning and 
nursery areas. In addition, the wetlands serve as important feeding and 
wintering grounds for migratory and resident birds, including some endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Using changing displays and aquariums, the recently opened exhibit reveals the 
importance of these areas and the wide variety of life that can be found there.
