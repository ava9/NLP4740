About the only thing that could worry the Phoenix Suns at this point is that 
they might be peaking too soon. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to catch the Lakers for the National Basketball Assn.'s 
Pacific Division lead and home-court advantage in the playoffs, the Suns on 
Monday won their eighth straight game, routing the Sacramento Kings at Phoenix, 
140-85. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns trail the defending champion Lakers by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson scored 21 of his 24 points in a lopsided second period as the 
Suns scored the biggest victory margin in the NBA this season and improved to 
28-0 at home against Western Conference competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns were coming off a 137-91 home victory Saturday night against the San 
Antonio Spurs -- their most one-sided victory ever before Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-point loss was the second-worst in the Kings' 41-year NBA history, 
behind a 140-82 defeat at Milwaukee on Dec. 15, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers finished with 20 points, Armon Gilliam had 19, and Kevin Johnson 
scored 17 points and added 15 assists for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 104, New York 100 -- Michael Jordan scored 20 points in the fourth 
quarter as the Bulls ended a six-game losing streak by defeating the Knicks at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who finished with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists, took charge 
from his point guard position after the Knicks scored 17 consecutive points, 
wiping out a 10-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls entered the final quarter trailing, 75-70, but Jordan scored 13 of 
Chicago's final 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
A steal and layup by Jordan put Chicago ahead, 92-89, with four minutes left, 
and his dunk with 2:27 remaining gave the Bulls a five-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 113, Charlotte 108 -- Robert Parish scored 21 points and got 22 rebounds 
at Charlotte as the Celtics defeated the Hornets in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Shaw hit three free throws in the final 22 seconds of the extra period to 
seal the victory, Boston's fifth straight over the Hornets. Shaw, who had 12 
rebounds, scored all five of his points from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 99, San Antonio 91 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 20 of his 26 points in the 
second half and paced a fourth-quarter rally as the Rockets beat the Spurs at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs extended their club-record road losing streak to 19 games, dropping 
their record away from home to 3-37. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, who also had 16 rebounds, helped extend San Antonio's overall losing 
streak to six as his basket with 5:37 left put the Rockets ahead to stay, 
84-82. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 116, Golden State 109 -- Reserve guard Sedale Threatt made two baskets 
and two free throws in the overtime period as the SuperSonics beat the Warriors 
at Oakland to move closer to clinching a home-court advantage in the first 
round of the playoffs.
