What the Lakers need to do to come back and win the series from Phoenix: 
</P>
<P>
Acquire Patrick Ewing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Get 135 minutes from Magic Johnson just like the 45 he played in Phoenix 
Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Have Cotton Fitzsimmons say something nasty about them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Play Laker basketball instead of Laker team handball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bring back Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to give Vlade Divac a crash course in the sky 
hook. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Get Mark West to play like Mark West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trade the rights to Dancing Barry and cash to the Suns for the Gorilla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Collect as many floor burns as Kurt Rambis and Dan Majerle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Have Pat Riley coach like the coach of the year that he finally is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Get Jeff Hornacek to play like Jeff Hornacek. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remind James Worthy that he has to be more consistent in May to become Mr. 
June. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look at the films of Game 4 and notice that A.C. Green was the game's leading 
rebounder although he could hardly make it up and down the court in the second 
half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Get Byron Scott to play like Byron Scott. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't allow Kevin Johnson to drive in the diamond lane most of the time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Win at least three consecutive games for the 14th time this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Oakland Athletic second baseman Mike Gallego after the trade with the 
Dodgers for Willie Randolph: "It's going to be tougher for me to get a good 
table at a restaurant now, saying, 'I'm Mike Gallego, extra infielder.' " . . . 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many players he loses, Bob Rodgers always seems to have the 
Montreal Expos playing respectable baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It came as no great surprise to those who saw him pitch with the Dodgers that 
Matt Young tied a Seattle Mariners' record with three wild pitches Sunday. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Recently retired major league stars played a nine-inning game in Las Vegas 
Saturday that was taped by NBC, and now there's talk of a tour to include 
Hawaii and Europe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Glad they've slowed down the Indy cars so much that a mere 225.301 m.p.h. 
average was good enough to win the provisional pole. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You've got to be a horse racing buff to know that the Preakness is contested at 
the distance of 1 3/16 miles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cotton Fitzsimmons keeps saying Phoenix winning the series from the Lakers 
would be the biggest upset in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. The Lakers were 6-1 favorites over the Suns at the Barbary Coast 
Sports Book in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is beginning to look like the year the Detroit Pistons prove their 
greatness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Illegal defense rules should be ruled illegal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No member of the NBA all-rookie first team -- David Robinson, Tim Hardaway, 
Vlade Divac, Sherman Douglas or Pooh Richardson -- was drafted higher than 10th 
in the first round last year. Of course, Robinson was the first choice in 1987. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
What's the first thing Columbo does in the morning? Peter Falk says he reads 
the New York Knicks' box score. . . . 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Armstrong looks young enough to be the Chicago Bulls' ballboy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Being coach of a championship team doesn't guarantee a good TV commentator. 
Chuck Daly should check with Bill Walsh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, that well-known soccer factory, leads the nation with four current or 
former players selected to the U.S. team for the World Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Terry Donahue is among several football and basketball coaches who are 
discussing the state of intercollegiate athletes with the Knight-Ridder 
commission in Washington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Harness racing owner Len Corbosiero claims night thoroughbred racing at 
Hollywood Park eventually would kill Los Alamitos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ed O'Bannon, who recently said he will attend Nevada Las Vegas, will appear in 
the California Fabulous 44 Prep Basketball Classic June 24 at UC Irvine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Surest thing about the Jack-in-the-Box Invitational Sunday at Drake Stadium is 
that Steve Scott will run the mile in under four minutes for the 127th time. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Mike Tyson and George Foreman to fight one another after they 
dispose of their opponents next month. Another doubleheader is in the works. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the home-court advantage in tennis now that Boris Becker has lost 
the German Open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Does Edmonton's advancing to the Stanley Cup championship series justify the 
trade of Wayne Gretzky to the Kings two years ago? Not really. I have a feeling 
the Oilers would have made it to the finals even with Gretzky in their lineup.
