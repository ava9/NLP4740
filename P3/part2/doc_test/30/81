disposal of the city's majestic waterfront properties

Bangkok Bank is renovating No 7, the Bund, Banque Indosuez has signed a
letter of intent to purchase No 29, and the Bank of China is repurchasing
its old headquarters next to the Peace Hotel.
After a hiatus of more than a year, the Shanghai municipality is moving on
the disposal of the majestic properties on the city's waterfront, the Bund.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange has indicated an interest in purchasing the most
prominent landmark on the waterfront - the former headquarters of the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. The SSE's expression of interest may prompt a
bidding contest, as Hongkong Bank itself is keen to move back into its
27,000 sq m premises, now used as the mayor's office and communist party
headquarters.
The establishment of the Shanghai Bund Buildings Function Transformation
Corporation has created a vehicle for the sale of 37 properties in an area
the Chinese have taken to describing as Asia's Wall Street, although a
revolution in the financial sector will be necessary to realise the dream of
restoring the Bund to its former glory.
At the same time, across the Huangpu River, on the east bank, work is
advancing on creating a separate 'finance district' that will be linked with
the Bund by underground railway, pedestrian tunnels, and bridges to create a
central business district of Shanghai.
Mr Zhang Zhe, vice general manager of the Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and
Trade Zone Development Company, is confident that marriage between the old
and the new can be effected to the advantage of both. 'The two banks of the
Huangpu can help each other and pull each other forward,' he says.
Lujiazui Development was formed in 1992 to develop a 1.51 sq km site in the
Pudong development zone, including 69 buildings, among them offices of
China's big specialised banks, insurance companies and investment
corporations. A new securities exchange is also under construction, and
space is being set aside for residential facilities. Mr Zhang estimates
development costs for the site, including buildings and infrastructure will
run to about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Of this, Dollars 1bn has already
been committed. Twelve buildings are actually under construction, and 20 are
in the advanced planning stage.
The Lujiazui finance and trade zone, as the financial district will be
known, will be dominated by three skyscrapers, including a Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation structure rising 88 floors.
If the planners' dreams are realised, one of Asia's more remarkable
developments will rise from marshy ground in place of a gaggle of decaying
godowns, crumbling houses and the odd paddy field.
Western bankers in Shanghai welcome plans to create a central business
district spanning the Huangpu and envisage no great problems in the city
creating a business core bisected by a big waterway. The Huangpu, which runs
into the Yangtze near its mouth, accommodates an enormous amount of shipping
traffic.
Mr Fiepko Klug, chief representative in China of Banque Indosuez, sees no
reason why the 'heart of the city' should not span the Huangpu 'like the
left and right bank in Paris'.
But in common with his colleagues from other banks interested in returning
to their homes on the Bund, Mr Klug is extremely circumspect about prospects
of securing their old properties, and even more reticent on the issue of
price.
Banque Indosuez, he says, has signed a letter of intent which is no more at
this stage than an indication of an intention to discuss re-acquisition. 'We
would see our return to the Bund as an indication of confidence in the
development of Shanghai and in the future of China,' he says, 'but the final
decision has to be taken on the basis of price.'
Other organisations such as Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, eyeing their former
Bund properties covetously, are even less forthcoming.
Mr Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities,
said there were 'political sensitivities' over the prospect of companies
such as Hongkong Bank returning to their former 'hunting lodges' on the
Bund, from which they were unceremoniously ousted after the 1949 revolution.
Hongkong Bank is said to have been asked to pay between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m for its former headquarters, but there is also no doubt that
the symbolic value of acquiring the property would be almost incalculable.
However, Mr Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
said its present location was insufficient for its fast-growing business.
The SSE is at present operating from a converted former hotel, but is
building a new exchange in the Pudong area. According to a Chinese news
agency report, the SSE wants the old Hongkong Bank site to 'get a foothold
on the Bund, which is to become the symbol of Shanghai as an international
financial centre'.
While the larger western institutions continue to play a game of cat and
mouse with the Shanghai authorities over price and leasehold terms, a Thai
bank has quietly stolen a march. The Bangkok Bank signed a 30-year lease in
October, 1993 on No 7 and renovations are well under way.
Mr Chalit Tayjasanant, chief representative in China, said negotiations with
the owner, Chang Jiang Shipping, had been completed in a 'few months'.
Facilitating the sale was the fact that the building was solely owned by the
shipping company, avoiding ownership complications afflicting other
properties.
For most of the properties, the owner is the municipality, and complex
commercial and political considerations involved in the sale of these
historic sites have weighed heavily. Delays are attributable in part to an
argument within the local government over the best means of disposal  -
whether by auction, tender or private treaty.
One awkward issue not being addressed in talks on re-acquisition, at least
not publicly, is the curious happenstance that the former owners are being
obliged to lease back, for substantial sums, properties that belonged to
them in the first place.
