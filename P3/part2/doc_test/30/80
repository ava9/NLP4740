Introduction:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1994, the Xerox Corporation and other defendants to certain litigation entered into a settlement agreement which
requires, among other things, that Xerox Corporation guarantee the Plans' receipt of certain payments in connection
with the rehabilitation of Executive Life Insurance Company of California. Xerox Corporation also has undertaken
to make a similar guarantee with respect to certain of the Plans' participants who were not parties to the litigation
settlement agreement. Xerox Corporation is requesting an exemption to permit these guarantees, under the terms
and conditions described herein.
