BUSINESS appears to be booming in the relocation industry, with 1991 marking
a new peak in moves out of central London. Yet a downturn in activity now
seems inevitable over the next few years, as the recession takes its toll.
A recent survey by estate agents Jones Lang Wootton demonstrates the
changing circumstances graphically. Last year saw 36 organisations and
companies moving almost 14,000 employees out of the centre of London - the
highest level recorded since monitoring began in 1964.
But the survey also found that the number of moves in the pipeline was
falling. Only 14 organisations had announced a decision to relocate in 1991,
compared with 36 such announcements in 1990 and 42 in 1989.
At the time the survey was completed, only 25 moves were scheduled for 1992
and just two for 1993. The period of growth in relocation away from the
capital appears to be grinding to a halt.
The fact that relocation activity continued to grow until quite recently
despite the recession reflects the delays inherent in the process of moving
companies.
'Any company moving out of the south-east over the past three years probably
took the decision some time in the mid-1980s,' says Susan Dugdale of Black
Horse Relocation, the UK's largest relocation agency.
'That sort of planning has been less common over the past two years, and the
pace of moves is therefore likely to slow down during the next few years.'
Certainly the recession has eased some of the pressures which encouraged
relocation moves. With unemployment rates rising faster in London and the
south-east than in the rest of the UK, recruitment in and around the capital
is no longer the nightmare that it was in the overheated 1980s. Staff
turnover, which often prompted employers to relocate to regions where they
could expect greater stability, is down as the jobs market freezes up.
And with millions of square feet of office space lying empty in London, it
is a buyers' market for companies looking to relocate within the capital.
Labour costs remain higher in the south-east: allowances paid to employees
working in central London have not fallen in the recession and can exceed
Pounds 3,000 a year. And other overheads such as rates and transport costs
can be higher. But the economic case for relocation  - in the short-term at
any rate - is now less clear cut.
However, the attractions of relocation are almost certain to re-assert
themselves once the green shoots of economic recovery break through. The old
problems of high rents, shortage of skilled employees, costly staff turnover
and the overheads imposed on working in the overcrowded and congested
south-east will soon emerge again. And technological developments continue
to offer considerable opportunities for service organisations to follow the
example of the banks and insurance companies in moving back offices to
lower-cost areas while maintaining a shop window in London and the
south-east.
Even local government can take advantage of these opportunities, as the
experience of Windsor and Maidenhead district council shows. Finding itself
competing for computer staff with the salaries offered by high-tech
companies in the M4 corridor, the council in 1988 relocated its computing
development centre to Telford in Shropshire.
The centre maintains direct communications links to the council's mainframe
computer at the council headquarters in Maidenhead.
The long-term benefits of relocation continue to be recognised by government
departments and other public bodies which are largely immune to the
short-term financial constraints of the recession. With 12,000 civil service
jobs already moved out of London and the south-east in the last three years,
another 18,000 are due to follow by mid-1994 - and a further 24,000 posts
are under review for relocation.
Many of these government moves are significant in scale. Customs and Excise,
for example, is moving 1,250 jobs out of the south-east by relocating its
VAT central unit from Southend to a brand-new building in Liverpool's
docklands in 1993. With 400 other head office jobs already moved to
Manchester, Customs will have moved more than 30 per cent of its
headquarters staff out of the south-east.
The Inland Revenue is moving many of its head office functions out London
and the south-east to a purpose-built headquarters in Nottingham; 1,800 jobs
will go to Nottingham, with another 400 London-based tax office staff moving
to Cardiff, Bootle, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In the short-term, however, companies in the private sector struggling for
survival in today's tougher business environment are less willing to incur
the costs of relocation.
Jean Crawford of Jones Lang Wootton estimates that moving an employee from
London to the Midlands might save Pounds 9,000 a year in running costs,
rent, rates and labour costs. But the bill up-front can average Pounds
14,500 per employee in the cost of visits to the new area, temporary
accommodation, removal expenses and disturbance allowances.
The collapse in the housing market has added to this cost still further
where the company offers to provide bridging loans to employees who move
with the job. Not only may many months of bridging finance be required
before a house can be sold; the sale is often thousands of pounds lower
after such a delay in a falling market.
This has offered new opportunities to the relocation companies, according to
Tad Zurlinden of the Edinburgh-based Association of Relocation Agents.
Dealing with 'orphans,' the unsold houses of relocated employees, is now at
least as important a part of their package as providing assistance to
employees in making their moves.
When the economy picks up, one question facing all those in the relocation
industry is whether the traditional pattern of company moves from London and
the south-east to the north and west will return.
Last year's decision by Pilkington, the St Helens-based glassmaker, to move
the headquarters of its core business of flat and safety glass to Brussels
has sent shivers down the spines of those who hope to attract companies to
areas north of Watford.
For St Helens, it meant the loss of 750 much-needed jobs, but the reasons
for the move were an even bigger blow to a town which has worked hard to
attract business relocations. For Pilkington was finding it increasingly
difficult to manage its continental factories in countries like Germany and
Sweden from a peripheral location on Merseyside.
While the opening of the channel tunnel in 1993 will improve communications
between the UK and the rest of the EC, it could be into the next century
before the British railways are properly linked into the high-speed rail
network now being completed between the leading European centres. The fear
is that larger companies with operations in more than one country may find
it preferable to relocate to mainland Europe to be closer to their markets
and local plants.
Similar considerations may also be influencing the location decisions being
made by investors from countries outside the European Community. While the
UK clearly retains its supremacy as a destination for Japanese investors,
there is some evidence that Japanese firms are now looking to make
investments in other EC member-states, especially Germany.
Ian Dodwell of estate agents Weatherall Green &amp; Smith has noticed a similar
tendency among US companies seeking an EC base.
'I detect a much greater consciousness of the European options,' he says.
'The tendency to see the UK as the place to go is weakening and Brussels is
increasingly seen as the place to be.'
Those who wish to attract new businesses to their areas - whether from other
parts of the UK or further afield - are going to have to work much harder
over the coming years if they are to achieve success.
