CHANGES TO advance corporation tax that were proposed in the March Budget
will make the UK a more attractive location for foreign-owned multinational
groups to locate their European headquarters. That is the conclusion of a
report by the City Research Project, a three-year study into London's
competitive position in international financial services.
Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the project, said that before the
Budget a number of foreign-owned financial services companies based in the
UK had been considering relocating to other European countries.
US banks in London, for instance, are disadvantaged under the present ACT
regime if they remit profits from European operations through a London
headquarters to their US parents in the form of dividends. They cannot
reclaim or offset ACT payable on dividends.
Mr Chris Higson of the London Business School, one of the authors of the
report, said that under current ACT rules companies located in London
suffered a 7 per cent tax disadvantage compared with those located in the
Netherlands, the country regarded as the most tax-advantageous in Europe.
He said under the proposed rules companies which chose to locate in the UK
would have a 3 per cent advantage over those in the Netherlands.
The Budget proposed a system of 'foreign income dividends' under which
dividends paid out of non-UK income would not be liable to UK ACT.
Mr Higson said the benefits of the proposed changes were much smaller for
multinational companies with UK parents than for those with overseas
parents.
Commenting on the City's new security cordon, Mr Yassukovich said there was
no anecdotal evidence to suggest that security issues were much of a
determinant in companies' decisions to locate in London. He said all
countries faced some security problems.
