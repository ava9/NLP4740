conundrum

Few company announcements, short of a set of glowing profits, attract so
much approval from shareholders, employees and the media as declarations of
intent to slash the size and cost of corporate headquarters.
Yet few actually generate so little real action.
Take three large corporations which, over the past decade, have been seen as
management models: General Electric of the US, British Petroleum, and ICI.
They may be models in other respects, but only one of the trio, GE, ended
the 1980s with the really lean head office to which its chairman had
supposedly dedicated himself at the start of the decade. The other two left
much or all of the job to their successors; at BP, action was taken a year
ago, while ICI made another declaration of slimming intent only in February.
Back in 1982, when ICI was (as now) hit hard by recession, the incoming
chairman, Sir John Harvey-Jones, set out to cut its head office staff from
about 1,200 to around 150. But he managed to slim it only as far as 400 or
so in London, with several hundred more re-located elsewhere. The central
core has since edged up to 500, with another 480 on other sites, in and
around London.
In the same year, amid a veritable flood of supposedly swingeing head-office
cost-cutting from other UK companies, the new chairman of BP, Sir Peter
Walters, declared his intention to cut his head office from its 2,000-plus
level. By the end of his tenure in 1990, BP's head office was 2,200. It took
the new chairman, Robert Horton, to wield the necessary axe last year, and
get the core down below 400, though on the widest definition BP's head
office still employs almost 1,200 people.
Defining who does, and does not, work for a head office of a large company,
rather than for a division or 'business' beneath it, is difficult in these
days of advanced information technology and widespread job dispersal that
General Electric, despite its early successes, has given up talking about it
in public.
It may seem naive to wonder why most chairmen find it so hard to match brave
words with action so close to their own seats of power - and why, in
particular, it took ICI's Sir Denys Henderson, chairman after Harvey-Jones
since 1987, until February to herald a much-needed further cost-cutting
drive.
According to a senior executive at ICI, one reason is that its head office,
like most others, has always contained very powerful functional barons.
Unless the chairman of the day takes a very strong line towards them,
streamlining 'just won't happen'. ICI chairmen have declared their intention
to kick head office into shape, but only Harvey-Jones came anywhere close to
doing so.
Then there is the chairman's own style. It was all very well for Sir Peter
Walters to declare his intent to chop BP's headquarters sharply, but his
natural insistence on central control of most group activities meant that a
large head office staff was inevitable.
This degree of supervision was probably necessary in the early 1980s in
order to steer the transformation of BP's asset portfolio and to 'parent'
the group's inexperienced new divisions. But these 'second-guessing'
activities became increasingly redundant from the mid-1980s.
When Robert Horton virtually halved BP's corporate staff on taking office,
he also abolished about 70 of the head office committees which they served -
more than three-quarters of the total. He also began to introduce a much
more informal, and flexible, way of working. ICI, conversely has just been
forced by the under-performance of its divisions to introduce an extra
high-level control committee.
As BP's 'networking' approach works its way through the corporate system -
both at head office itself, and in relations with the group's constituent
businesses - its headquarters could shrink further. There could be added
pressure in this direction from the businesses, which want the group to be
clearer about the degree to which its headquarters contributes to
shareholder value.
Beyond personal and corporate style, the size of a company's head office is
influenced by some tricky structural factors. At BP, the traditionally
complex matrix organisation has been simplified drastically by giving
divisions (which BP calls 'business streams') primacy over geographic
regions.
Against the background of the new culture of openness and informality which
Horton is trying to establish, the result is that headquarters no longer has
to intervene constantly to iron out tensions between powerful divisional and
regional barons.
At ICI, by contrast, only in the past few months has a decision been taken
to relegate all 'geographic territories' to providing services to global
businesses, rather than sharing business decisions with them; the
consequences for head office staffing will not be decided until later this
year.
A further factor which influences the size of any large company's head
office is the extent to which a national corporate HQ is included within the
global headquarters. BP has moved further away from this than has ICI.
The fact that BP can now operate with a relatively small head office is also
due to the slimness of its portfolio - just three large businesses, and one
smallish one - and the fact that the inter-relationships between them are
relatively simple. GE, with over three times as many businesses,
nevertheless, has even fewer cross-business 'synergies' to manage.
ICI, in contrast, is a much more complex animal. The portfolio pruning which
it heralded last month may simplify things somewhat, but most types of
chemicals businesses are much more interconnected than are, say, BP's
exploration and nutrition divisions - and certainly more so than GE's
conglomerate-like portfolio of aero engines, household appliances, financial
services, TV stations, and so on.
To be fair to ICI, a small head office is not necessarily beautiful for
every type of company. Much depends on the 'parenting' requirements of
businesses in its portfolio.
One head office parenting role is right in some circumstances, but not in
others. Precisely the same goes for size. Just as most head offices are
probably still too large, and add more burden than value to the businesses
beneath them, some suffer from the opposite complaint.
