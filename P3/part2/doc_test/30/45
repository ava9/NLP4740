HUGHES Aircraft, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, said it would cut at least
4,000 production jobs and relocate 2,000 others, Reuter reports from
California.
The consolidation, which involves mainly missile production lines recently
acquired from General Dynamics Corp goes beyond the 9,000 job reduction the
company announced in June.
Mr David McPherson, a Hughes vice-president, said an undetermined number of
engineering jobs would also be cut. He would not comment on whether the new
round of consolidations would result in extra restructuring charges.
Southern California will lose at least 6,000 jobs in the consolidation, as
all missile production is consolidated in existing plants in Tucson,
Arizona.
LTV Corporation, the large steel group, confirmed it would relocate its
corporate headquarter operations to Cleveland and close its Dallas
headquarters at the end of the year.
