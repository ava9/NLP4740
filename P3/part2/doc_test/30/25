The smart entrance lobby to the Laurentian Life headquarters outside
Gloucester was buzzing at two o'clock, as dozens of employees returned by
coach from a shopping expedition to the city centre.
Coaches leave at noon and 1pm each working day, to enable the financial
group's staff to shop during their lunch break; and buses are also laid on
each morning and evening, to and from the city centre.
It is part of the company's package of policies to keep the workforce happy
in a purpose-built headquarters two miles from the city centre, following a
move from Guildford in 1986.
The financial sector has appreciated the benefit of relocating away from
city centres and the expensive south-east more than most, but
Gloucestershire has managed to persuade a wide range of organisations to set
up headquarters in the county. Among them are Colt Cars, Spirax-Sarco
Engineering, Nuclear Electric, Kraft General Foods, and the Countryside
Commission.
Laurentian traces its origins back to 1896 and the formation of Imperial
Life Assurance of Canada. UK offices were opened in 1931, and in 1977
Imperial merged its operations with Laurentian Group Corporation of Canada.
In 1987, the size of the UK operation was doubled when Imperial acquired
Trident Life, to form Laurentian Life. Imperial was based in Guildford and
Trident life in Gloucester, so the management had to decide where to base
the combined operation.
Three options were considered: locating everyone in either Guildford or
Gloucester, or choosing a new base such as Bristol, Southampton or
Bournemouth. 'It was quickly decided that an entirely new site would involve
too great a commercial risk, and there was only so much disruption the
company fabric should be asked to take. It became a straight choice between
Guildford add Gloucester,' says Mr lain Tweeddale, managing director of
Laurentian Life.
It was not an easy choice, however. The Guildford building could have
accommodated all the staff, but overheads were much higher. Office space in
Guildford in 1986 was Pounds 12 a square foot, compared with Pounds 5 in
Gloucester. A move to Gloucester would entail building a new headquarters,
but salary differentials and a much lower staff turnover would bring
substantial benefits.
The decision went in favour of Gloucester, to the irritation of many former
Imperial employees who thought they should have called the shots as the
senior partner in the merger. Around 150 of the 450 Guildford staff decided
to relocate to Gloucester, and a further 200 people were recruited locally
in a hectic six-month initial training period.
The original intention had been to relocate when the new headquarters was
built, but it was then decided to move immediately, because of the danger of
flagging morale in a long rundown period. Temporary offices were taken at
Mitcheldean, in the Forest of Dean, in premises made vacant by a Rank Xerox
cutback, and staff were bussed to and from Gloucester for two years.
The landscaped new headquarters in the Gloucester suburb of Barnwood now
houses not only the administrative staff but also the whole investment team,
who manage the Pounds 1.5bn investments from a purpose-built dealing room.
Among the factors that tipped the balance in favour of Gloucester were:
housing, with an average house Pounds 25,000 cheaper than in the south-east;
education, which was seen as being at least as good as in Guildford; and
availability of staff.
'We have had no difficulty in recruiting high calibre people, happy to live
in this part of the world . . . anything to get away from the M25,' says Mr
Tweeddale.
One advantage of Gloucester for financial services is that it is within easy
motorway range of both Birmingham and Bristol, with their well developed
financial sectors, and this makes specialist recruitment easier.
Another company that has found little difficulty in recruiting technical
staff in what has traditionally been regarded as a rural county is
Spirax-Sarco Engineering, specialists in the control of fluids.
The company moved to Cheltenham from central London in 1939, because of
apprehension about the outbreak of war, and now employs 1,000 at its
headquarters and 3,000 worldwide.
Mr Tim Fortune, group managing director, has found no employment problems,
partly because of skills acquired in the local aerospace and defence
industries. 'We find the workforce is particularly stable and loyal,' he
says.
The Colt Car Company, importers and distributors of Mitsubishi cars, did not
make quite such a calculated decision as Laurentian to set up head- quarters
in the county. It happened largely because a couple of the directors lived
in the area when the company was launched, and it seemed a more desirable
and cheaper base than London.
The company was founded in 1974, as a joint-venture partnership with
Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, and thefirst office was in four rented
rooms in Dollar Street House, a converted mansion in the heart of
Cirencester.
The historic market town was chosen partly for its convenience for the
directors, and partly because of its more general convenience as a natural
crossroads since Roman times. It has ready access to London and the
south-east, Wales and the south-west, the Midlands and the north.
By 1976 the company had outgrown the small offices, and moved to new
purpose-built accommodation in nearby Spitalgate Lane. A second move
followed 10 years ago, when the expanding company moved to its present
headquarters on a six-acre freehold site at Watermoor on the outskirts of
Cirencester.
Because of Cirencester's historic past, and the fact that the building is
the first the visitor sees when travelling from London and the M4, planning
restrictions were stringent. The main building, next to an old coaching inn
on the Roman Fosse Way, is restricted to two storeys and shaped like a W to
hide a big industrial warehouse. The complex houses all the company's sales,
parts, marketing, accounting and computer functions.
Colt ran its own dock and shipping compound at Newport, in south Wales, from
1974 until last August, but the operation has just been transferred to the
Royal Portbury Dock in Bristol, where larger vessels can be berthed and
unloaded.
Colt tries to make the most of its local connections, and uses local legal,
technical and support services as much as possible. It is currently
sponsoring the locally-based Badminton horse trials.
