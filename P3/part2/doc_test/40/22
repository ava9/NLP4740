Researchers said Thursday that they had isolated a human protein that in the 
laboratory was found to stop the growth of breast cancer cells without 
affecting other types of human cells. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the discovery may mark a significant advance in the search 
for a breast cancer treatment and may ultimately help lead to a strategy for 
prevention of the malignancy, which now strikes one American woman in 10. 
</P>
<P>
A team of University of Michigan scientists led by Dr. Max S. Wicha, writing in 
Friday's Science magazine, said it had isolated a human protein that it 
believes plays a key role in the body's own system for controlling cell growth. 
</P>
<P>
The team has dubbed the protein mammastatin and is now trying to produce it in 
sufficient quantities to test it in laboratory animals and ultimately in 
humans, Wicha said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Mammastatin, which is produced by normal breast cells, is a potent inhibitor 
of breast cancer cells growing in the laboratory," Wicha said. 
</P>
<P>
"It specifically stops the growth of breast cancer cells but not cells from 
other tissues." 
</P>
<P>
Wicha said he and his colleagues were now using genetic engineering techniques 
to try to clone the human gene responsible for producing the protein. 
</P>
<P>
Achieving this would enable them to make relatively large amounts of the 
compound in the laboratory, but it may take several years to accomplish this, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 142,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an 
estimated 43,000 will die of the disease this year, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
In normal breast tissue, cell growth appears to be controlled by a balance 
between growth inhibitors and growth stimulators, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
In cancerous tissues, abnormal cell growth may occur because a stimulator 
overpowers its inhibitor, creating an imbalance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they had developed a test to measure mammastatin in blood 
and found it to be present in all women, though at widely varying levels.
