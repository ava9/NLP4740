Two new approaches to the genetic treatment of cystic fibrosis, Britain's
most common inherited disease, will be developed at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School in London.
Bob Williamson, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics, yesterday
announced details of a Pounds 1m research programme, funded by a gift to the
Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust from the late Leopold Muller, a London
hotelier.
US scientists are planning to use genetically engineered human viruses
(either adenoviruses or retroviruses) to carry correct copies of the CFTR
gene, which is defective in cystic fibrosis, into the lungs of CF patients.
The St Mary's group will develop a different type of virus - bacteriophages
which normally infect bacteria rather than human cells - to carry the CFTR
gene into the lungs. A potential advantage of the bacteriophage approach is
that it removes some safety concerns associated with genetically altered
human viruses.
For the long term, the St Mary's scientists are working on a second, more
radical approach. They will construct artificial 'mini-chromosomes' to add
to the complement of 46 chromosomes which contain the natural genetic
material in human cells.
The mini-chromosome would be large enough to carry the CFTR gene and all its
associated control sequences, to ensure that the cells produce the missing
protein in the right quantities. Some of these control sequences have to be
removed when viruses are used, because there would otherwise be too much DNA
for the virus to carry.
If mini-chromosomes can be made to replicate alongside all the normal human
chromosomes when cells divide, gene therapy would treat the disease once and
for all; viral techniques, on the other hand, will almost certainly require
repeated treatments. And mini-chromosomes could in theory to expanded to
carry more than one human gene, to treat multiple genetic disorders
including heart disease.
