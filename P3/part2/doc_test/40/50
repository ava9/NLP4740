providing humans with a variety of valuable proteins

In the space of a few thousand years, animal breeders have genetically
engineered wild dogs into pugs, Pekinese and pit bull terriers. But this
week the idea of changing animals to please humans took its first step
towards becoming a high-technology industry.
Bayer, the German chemical giant, is paying Pounds 10m to a Scottish
company, Pharmaceutical Proteins, for the right to use a medically valuable
protein produced in the milk of a sheep called Tracy. She was genetically
engineered in a laboratory to make that protein.
The business even has a name: pharming, the use of genetically altered
animals as biological factories.
The close study of DNA, the molecule which controls inheritance, means that
the characteristics of an animal can be fine-tuned. Well-understood
fragments of genetic material can be taken from one species and put into
another. The result is a transgenic animal.
Tracy is a sheep like any other except that the combination of nutritious
proteins that make up her milk contains one protein that no sheep has ever
made before - alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT).
Humans make AAT to control the growth of internal organs, but one in every
2,000 people does not make enough. In 10 per cent of these cases its absence
leads to ever-larger holes in lung tissue because an enzyme, normally held
in check by AAT, is not functioning properly. Sufferers undergo long-term
treatment for emphysema.
AAT is difficult to make in a factory and there is a world shortage. Bayer
estimates that there are 100,000 people in Europe and North America
suffering from AAT deficiency. With a herd of transgenic sheep, sales of AAT
could rise to more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) a year. It will take at
least until 1997 for transgenic AAT to go through clinical trials and be
approved by regulatory authorities.
There are many proteins that transgenic animals can produce:
GenPharm in California is developing calves which produce the human milk
protein, lactoferin. It is antibacterial and may help patients with weakened
immune systems or be included in babies' milk. The infant formula market is
worth Dollars 600m in the US alone according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
Snow Brand Milk, a Japanese manufacturer of dairy products, has produced
human growth hormone with a relatively high concentration - 0.1 per cent -
in rat's milk. Snow Brand has said it expects to be producing drugs in such
rats on a commercial scale within five years and marketing them in 10. The
market for human growth hormone, today mostly made by genetically engineered
bacteria, is already worth more than Dollars 500m a year. Transgenic
Sciences of the US has also developed mice that make human growth factor in
their milk.
DNX of the US has transgenic pigs which produce human haemoglobin in their
blood. DNX intends to file an 'investigational new drug application' for a
human blood substitute with the US Food and Drug Administration in 1993.
This would allow human clinical trials to begin.
The French National Institute for Agronomy Research has rabbits which
secrete two human proteins into their milk. The proteins are Factor 7, for
treating haemophilia, and the anti-anaemia drug, erythropoietin. The size of
the Factor 7 market is difficult to estimate because of alternative
therapies available for haemophilia. Erythropoietin is a more exciting
prospect. The potential market size is Dollars 3.5bn by mid-1990s, according
to Lehman Brothers, which would make it the biggest-selling drug in the
world. It is currently made using genetically engineered mammal cells by
Amgen of the US and Celltech of the UK for Johnson and Johnson, the US
healthcare giant. Drug companies Bohringer Ingelheim and Chugai sell it in
Germany and Japan respectively. Sales are already Dollars 700m a year.
Pharmaceutical Proteins, the Edinburgh company which developed Tracy, is
also working on producing another blood product, Factor 9, in sheep. The
absence of Factor 9 causes Christmas disease, a rare form of haemophilia.
The first sheep with the gene for making Factor 9 are due to be milked this
spring. Pharmaceutical Proteins says the market is worth Pounds 40m a year
worldwide.
Genzyme, in the US, has goats making tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)
which tackles heart disease by dissolving blood clots. The potential TPA
market has been estimated at up to Dollars 500m a year, although other drugs
perform similar functions and some companies are making TPA by other means.
TPA sales are now less than Dollars 200m in the US and not growing. Volumes
from goats are still small and Genzyme says it is at least five years away
from commercial exploitation. A Japanese company has contributed a Dollars
7m research grant to Genzyme's work. Genzyme has also produced CFTR, which
can treat cystic fibrosis, in mouse milk.
The process by which Tracy was created is relatively simple, although the
techniques used are highly skilled.
Genes that instruct cells to behave in certain ways have two parts: the
instruction and the timing switch/location indicator. The former tells cells
what to do and the latter when and where to do it.
To make Tracy, scientists chemically isolated the part of the human gene
that instructs cells to produce AAT. They did the same with the sheep gene
that tells cells to make a milk protein called beta lactoglobulin (BLG).
The sheep gene's timing switch/location indicator was then separated from
the BLG-making instruction and attached to the AAT-making instruction.
This compound gene was injected into the centre of a newly fertilised sheep
egg using a microscopic hypodermic needle. In 2-5 per cent of cases, the
compound gene became incorporated into the sheep egg, which was then put
into a surrogate sheep mother in a manner similar to that used in in vitro
fertilisation (test-tube babies) of human eggs.
Five months later Tracy was born with every cell incorporating a fragment of
the human genetic material. The timer and the location indicator parts of
the gene told her cells to produce the protein in her milk after she gave
birth.
Genetically, Tracy is slightly human. And her offspring have a 50-50 chance
of receiving this piece of humanity.
Milk production is especially suitable for commercial exploitation. It can
be taken from the animal without ill-effects.
The only other method of producing many of these proteins is with animal
cell cultures in vats. However, cultures are prone to contamination and need
a delicately controlled environment to survive. Tracy comes complete with an
immune system and temperature regulator.
Unlike sufferers from AAT deficiency, Tracy and her flock live in luxury.
AAT costs Dollars 100 a gramme and Tracy makes up to 70 grammes in a litre
of milk.
'These are valuable animals. They will lead cosy lives,' says Ron James, the
managing director of Pharmaceutical Proteins.
