The government gave scientists permission Thursday to transfer foreign genes 
into humans for the first time, approving a test in which bacteria genes will 
be used to track the effectiveness of a new cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
After seven months of review, Dr. James Wyngaarden, director of the National 
Institutes of Health, gave a team of government researchers the go-ahead to 
begin the gene-transfer trials. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration approved the plan earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of biotechnology have argued against inserting foreign genes into 
humans, citing concern that such experiments might go awry and saying 
researchers should not "play God" with human genetics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to those people who raise objections that last year 485,000 
Americans died of cancer -- one every minute," said project director Dr. Steven 
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute. "We are trying to develop new 
treatments to help them and this is important to that effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone through an exhaustive inquiry into the safety of this trial . . . 
and we have found there is virtually no danger to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
In October, an institutes advisory panel approved the plan to put new genes in 
the cells of 10 terminally ill cancer patients. But Wyngaarden sent the project 
back to the committee after learning that the researchers withheld printed data 
due to fears that making it public might hurt their chances of publishing 
articles in scientific journals. 
</P>
<P>
In the new experiment, scientists from the cancer institute and the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute plan to collect cancer-fighting cells, called 
tumor-fighting lymphocytes, or TILs, from 10 patients with an advanced stage of 
a deadly type of skin cancer called melanoma. 
</P>

Results Unpredictable 
</P>
<P>
The researchers will then "insert marker genes from bacteria into the cells and 
return the genetically altered cells to the patients from which they were 
taken," said institutes spokesman Frank Mahaney. 
</P>
<P>
The tool used to insert the bacteria gene is a mouse leukemia virus that has 
been "disarmed" so that it cannot cause disease, Mahaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers hope the genetically altered TIL cells will allow them to 
determine why a promising new form of cancer treatment that uses such cells 
helps some cancer patients but not others. 
</P>
<P>
In TIL therapy, scientists remove tumors from cancer patients and use a human 
growth factor, called interleukin-2, to produce large amounts -- up to 10 
trillion -- of the cancer-fighting TIL cells. The cells are then put back into 
the cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers think it should be easy to trace the activity of the genetically 
altered TIL cells because they are designed to be resistant to an antibiotic 
that kills normal cells. Blood or tissue samples will be used for those 
tracking tests. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said he hopes the test will pave the way for therapy in which TIL 
cells can be genetically altered to produce substances that will improve their 
efficiency in killing cancer cells.
