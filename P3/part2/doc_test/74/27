At 8:30 on Friday evening, at the same time as I was pressing between the
ranks of Krukke, the Dutch marching band, to gain assess to the Guildhall
and the Human Chain within, octogenarian altoist Benny Carter was preparing
to join Saxomania in the Market Hall. Meanwhile, swinging bassist Ray Brown
was already warming up a trio in Christ College. Across town, the open air
bandstands emanated a mixture of trad, mainstream and the smell of myriad
griddles. Two hours old and Brecon Jazz was already cooking. In prospect was
a feast of attractions including Slide Hampton, George Shearing and Jon
Faddis as well as a packed 'stroller' programme with gems like tenorist Andy
Hamilton or clarinettist Kenny Daverne teamed with trumpeter Warren Vache.
The cleverly contrived anarchy of Django Bates' small band set the tone well
for the fringe aspect of the best little festival in the UK. Bates himself
alternated crazily between peck horn and trashy sounding electric keyboard,
his quartet's eccentric sound describing a tableau of circus and music hall
quirkiness. Frenetic songs with titles like 'Food For Plankton' and 'Dancing
on Frith St' were tossed between saxophonist Iain Bellamy and the leader
making a delicious musical nonsense from the clouds of notes and manic
rhythmic complexity.
On Saturday afternoon the same space was filled with the exhilarating sound
and spectacle of the Trevor Watts Moire Music Drum Orchestra. Consisting of
a battery of Ghanaian traditional drums, a supercharged but otherwise
straight kit, a bubbling fretless bass and an unstoppable soprano sax, the
orchestra was an overflowing cauldron of colourful energy.
For two blissful hours waves of percussive patterns flowed from congas and
djembe, carried on rolling basslines. Weaving a continuous line of
improvisation throughout, Watts remained seated and serene behind white
beard and granny specs. The counterpoint of mbira thumb pianos and
crisscrossing of flute with soprano sax in Ghanaian folk tunes was exquisite
and the booming version of Rocky Road to Dublin, quite extraordinary.
A couple of hours' interval to munch a taco accompanied by the flamenco
washed guitar of Eduardo Niebla at the Museum Car Park bandstand was all
that was needed to make the geographical leap from West Africa to the US,
via Panama. Assembled in the Market Hall was the New York Latin Jazz
Allstars led by pianist Danilo Perez. Directed by Perez and propelled by
Ignacio Berroa (drums) and Larry Grenadier (bass), ace Cuban altoist Paquito
D'Rivera, Brazilian trumpeter - Claudio Roditi and rising young tenor star
David Sanchez picked up where Dizzy Gillespie's UN Big Band left off.
Battling with BBC technicians for attention (the view of the music was
obscured by three cameramen and a constantly swinging 25ft jib which some of
the audience found hard to take), the Allstars won through, but only just,
with spreading rhythms and radiant solos from the leaders.
Guitarist Jim Hall, appearing in the tranquil setting of the Christ College
theatre, had no such interference. So distilled is the guitarist's technique
and so pure the semi-acoustic sound that on such a day - long and full of
hot jazz - he might have trod the wrong side of the thin line between
elevation and enervation. But, first in duet with protege Peter Bernstein
and then unobtrusively backed by Allan Ganley (drums) and Dave Green (bass),
Hall applied his understated and intimate technique to a series of
shimmering pieces from Lunceford to Gilberto and finally his old boss
Rollins.
Outside, in the sunshine, Brecon continued to boil over with beer, bonhomie
and bebop. Roll on next August.
