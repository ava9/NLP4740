SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: AVANT-GARDE WILL FIND ITS PLACE IN THE 
SUN AT ELARIO'S

<P>
In a radical departure from the status quo, Elario's will play host to a 
one-night visit by jazz space cadet Sun Ra and his 15-piece Arkestra next 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance by an avant-garde jazz artist is the first shake-up by San Diego 
Jazz Festival founder Rob Hagey since he took over as talent coordinator last 
month, replacing Steve Satkowski. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hagey who first brought Sun Ra to San Diego, for a sold-out show at the 
Old Globe Theatre's Festival Stage in 1980. This time around, Ra will tame his 
act in deference to the slightly more conservative surroundings, playing a 
tribute to Big Band leaders Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Hagey acknowledges that the progressive show is an experiment; he said he needs 
to sell 150 tickets between the two shows to break even. Shows are at 8:30 and 
10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Ra, whose real name is Herman (Sonny) Blount, was weaned on traditional jazz in 
Chicago, played with Henderson's band, and arranged Big Band charts for 
Henderson and Benny Goodman. He started his Arkestra in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Today his band's collective improvising isn't so shocking, but it turned a few 
heads in the early days as probably the first Big Band to depart from 
traditional structures. 
</P>
<P>
There is some degree of mystery surrounding Mr. Ra, if we can call him that. He 
claims to have arrived from Saturn, and has no legal birth certificate. He is 
purported to be in his late 70s, and lives in Philadelphia. The Arkestra's most 
recent album is last year's "Blue Delight." 
</P>
<P>
Rusefest '90, which brought a rare dose of experimental jazz to town this 
spring, including a performance by the Bay Area-based Rova Saxophone Quartet, 
closes Friday night with a concert by pianist Joe Garrison with the Ruse Brass 
Ensemble and featured soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The group will dish up new music by Garrison, who has titled this suite "My 
Brothers, My Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
"My point of departure was, I'm really tired of musicians using music as a way 
to justify their lives," Garrison said. 'I want to take care of my life. I want 
my life to work. It used to be enough to worship music. A lot of musicians do 
that, and they hurt a lot of people in the process. They hurt their families; 
they don't care enough about other people; they put music above everything. I'm 
trying to join the human race, put people first. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I was thinking about while I wrote. I also noticed I was letting 
go of my iron grip on the compositions and thinking of the strength of the 
players. Some of these pieces will only work because of the specific 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Among Garrison's band mates for this date will be trombonists Louis Watkins, 
Will Martin and Jeff Bernard and trumpeters Derrick Cannon and Bill Caballero. 
Featured soloists will include Frank Lamarca on tenor sax, David Millard on 
soprano, Turiya on bass clarinet and flute, plus Caballero. Several of the 
players, including Garrison, are also members of Turiya's Immediate Freedom 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison said the music is designed specifically for this Big Band lineup, but 
with a more abstract approach than is typical of Big Band charts. Some of the 
music is quite formal in structure, some virtually free-form, according to 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear traces of Latin in the music, but nothing like what Garrison and 
the Immediate Freedom Band produce; this band doesn't have a percussion 
section. 
</P>
<P>
The music starts at 8 p.m. in the San Diego City College Theatre on C Street 
between 13th and 15th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard player and studio wiz Spencer Nilsen, whose debut album, "Architects 
of Change," enjoyed moderate success last year on light jazz and new age radio 
stations, is ready to perform live for the first time. Nilsen will mix tunes 
from the album with new compositions next Wednesday night in the Catamaran's 
Cannibal Bar in Mission Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nilsen said his post-album compositions are heading in a new direction. In 
addition to playing keyboards, he's been singing, and he hopes to reach a 
broader audience with a sound he calls "global pop," influenced by artists such 
as Sting and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the live act is trumpeter and wind synthesizer player Mitch Manker, 
who has backed Ray Charles. Manker uses the synthesizer to duplicate lead 
melodies produced on Nilsen's album by a variety of instruments, including 
violin. Rounding out the group are Brad Kaiser on drums, Dave Curtis on bass 
guitar and former Flight 7 guitarist Mark Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
For next Wednesday's performance, Nilsen has sculpted a tight 90-minute show 
that includes new material and seven songs from his album. He'll play it twice, 
at 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
