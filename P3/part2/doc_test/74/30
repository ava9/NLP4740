Dixie, not turkey, will be the traditional Thanksgiving feast for San Diego 
jazz fans, courtesy of the 11th annual San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Sunday at the Town &amp; Country Convention Center in Mission 
Valley, 25 bands from throughout the United States will keep 10 stages hopping 
with music. Last year, 14,000 jazz fans attended, roughly 60% of them came from 
distant locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown from a little over 1,000 people the first year," said Len Levine, 
who has been on the board of the America's Finest City Dixieland Jazz Society 
since 1982, when it was formed to take over the festival started by the Town 
&amp; Country. "Sacramento was the original Dixieland festival, and they're way 
beyond everyone. They draw 150,000. After that, out of about 150 festivals, we 
are among the top few in attendance, and, based on what we hear from musicians 
and in fan letters, quality." 
</P>
<P>
Dixieland encompasses several forms of jazz from the period between the 1890s 
and 1930s. Bands at the festival represent a variety of these styles. Local 
groups appearing include: High Society, South Market St. Jazz Band, Tami Thomas 
and her Jazz-Ma-Tazz, the Chicago Six and the Yankee Air Pirates. Out-of-town 
bands include Buck Creek, the Golden Eagle Jazz Band and the Rent Party 
Revellers. 
</P>
<P>
How to decide what to hear? A few highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Uncle Yoke's Black Dog Jazz Band from Kissimmee, Fla., combines music with a 
canine sense of humor. Led by Steve (Hot Dog) Yocum, and including members with 
other doggish names, the group purportedly prefers woofing and howling to 
applause. In addition to a fetching sense of humor, band members are sound 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
* Buck Creek is known for strong ensemble and solo work, plus a selection of 
tunes other bands don't play. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rent Party Revellers is composed of musicians from all over the country 
who only get together a few times a year. 
</P>
<P>
* The 9-year-old High Society band, led by cornet player Larry Channave, 
concentrates on Chicago-style jazz, which peaked in the late 1920s and early 
'30s. Characterized by a four-beat format (as opposed to two), this is the 
upbeat swing music originally popularized by bands like Eddie Condon's. 
Channave's 13-year-old nephew, Matt Lair, will make guest appearances on 
cornet. 
</P>
<P>
* Led by Dominic Addario, the Yankee Air Pirates is a 12-piece ensemble fronted 
by four banjos. 
</P>
<P>
* Sunday morning at 8:30, Night Blooming Jazzmen -- the only group that has 
played the festival every year -- opens the day with religious hymns in the 
Presidio Room. 
</P>
<P>
* South Market St. is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Since 1965, about 20 
musicians have passed through the eight-piece band. Original band members 
reunited for a set at 5:30 p.m. Saturday in the Presidio Room. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make very much off the festivals," said the band's banjo player Carol 
Dendle, whose husband, Bill, started the group. "We did 10 this year, and the 
main reason is they're so much fun. It's great to have a full audience that 
wants to hear what you play. It's not like when we get hired to play 
conventions, and we're just background music." 
</P>
<P>
* Mission Bay High School, which offers a Dixieland jazz program within its 
music deparment, is sending a band, as is Escondido High School. 
</P>
<P>
Festival hours are 7 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving; noon to 1:30 a.m. 
Friday; 10 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. Saturday; and 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Badges 
good for the entire four days cost $55; $45 gets you a Friday-through-Sunday 
badge; $20 admits you for the day Friday or Saturday, and $15, on Thursday or 
Sunday only. For more information: 297-JASS.

<P>
Local 325, the musicians union, regularly locks horns (or basses or drums) with 
players who don't live by its rules. One of the most frequently violated bylaws 
prohibits union members from playing dates with non-union members. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Jim Plank, both union members, are 
on probation with the union because of two incidents earlier this year. In 
April, they invited non-union saxophonist Daniel Jackson to join them behind 
fluegelhorn man Art Farmer at Elario's, and the union warned them not to work 
with non-union players again. 
</P>
<P>
After backing saxophonist James Moody with non-union pianist Harry Pickens a 
few weeks later, Magnusson and Plank were each fined $100, with the fines "in 
abeyance for one year pending future conduct," according to a letter to Plank 
from Earl J. Smith, Local 325's secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's talent coordinator Rob Hagey can't be faulted much. His top priority 
is top talent. Jackson is an under-utilized local saxman with excellent skills, 
and Pickens, a former New Yorker, is nationally recognized. 
</P>
<P>
But the union has other priorities than just talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members make the rules," said Local 325 president Joe Pallazola. "Our 
prime purpose is to stick together to make conditions better for our lot in 
life." Benefits include low-premium medical, dental and instrument insurance, 
credit union membership, access to contract forms, $1,500 in life insurance, 
and use of the union's rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
That's still not enough to entice Pickens, Jackson, and such local jazz 
fixtures as drummer Chuck McPherson and saxophonist Joe Marillo to join. 
</P>
<P>
"It has good points and bad," McPherson said. "If you have a monetary 
discrepancy (with a club), they're a good intermediary. But the bad side is 
that most jazz rooms here, including Croce's, are non-union. If you work with 
non-union musicians, they fine you. How are you supposed to make a living? What 
are we supposed to do, not pay our bills? Not eat? To me, the bottom line is 
music."
