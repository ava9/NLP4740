Trumpeter Miles Davis, ex-bassist John Heard and pianist Les McCann are but 
three of the jazz musicians who double as artists, and/or artists who depict 
jazz images, whose works are part of "Jazz Is Art/Art Is Jazz," a sparkling 
exhibition showing at Museum of African American Art at the Crenshaw Plaza 
through April 8. Also included in the enterprising showing are remarkable 
photographs from Bob Douglas, who documented the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 
'40s and '50s; bassist Milt Hinton, whose pictures go back to the late '30s; 
and noted jazz shooter Charles Stewart. A series of free Sunday concerts, held 
in conjunction with the exhibit, begin Sunday, 3 p.m., on the mall level of the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, 4005 Crenshaw Blvd. McCann kicks off the series, 
followed by sorely underrated saxman Wilbur Brown's quartet, Feb. 18, and Billy 
Childs' trio, Feb. 25. Information: (213) 294-7071.

Singer Ernie Andrews and violinist Papa John Creach join forces with pianist 
Floyd Dixon, guitarist Lowell Fulson and others in "Bring the Blues Back Home," 
two free concerts to be held at the California Afro-American Museum (600 State 
Drive, Exposition Park), Saturday, 4 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are required for the 
evening performance and are available at the museum. The concerts, sponsored by 
the Ford Dealers of Southern California, help celebrate the exhibit, "Blues 
Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism," which continues at the museum through 
March 4. Information: (213) 744-7432.

Saxophonist Ernie Watts, who teams up with bassist Charlie Haden and 
keyboardist Peter Manning Robinson to debut their trio at LeCafe in Sherman 
Oaks Friday and Saturday, says the three will offer a distinctive musical take 
on things, particularly since there is no drummer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing all original material in a style that I call 'contemporary 
improvisation.' The music's sort of compositionally oriented, giving the trio a 
chamber group aspect," says Watts, a regular on the "Tonight Show" orchestra 
and a member of Haden's Quartet West. "And I thought the lack of drums would 
keep the group clear, take it into another area." 
</P>
<P>
Watts, who is currently rehearsing with the Meeting -- a band that includes 
bassist Alphonso Johnson, drummer Ndugu Chancler and keyboardist Patrice Rushen 
-- for an upcoming MCA LP session in April, has been active of late, traveling 
to Japan as a soloist, teaching clinics at colleges and working on a project 
with long-time collaborator, guitarist Lee Ritenour. Still, Watts says, he'd 
like to spend more time leading his own band. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to keep doing that," he says, adding that a new GRP project for his 
group, which plays "acoustic contemporary music," is in the works.
