SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JIMMY HEATH, AT ELARIO'S, BRINGS 40 
YEARS OF GROWTH

Jimmy Heath made his reputation as an alto sax man in the be-bop tradition of 
Charlie Parker. But he's evolved into much, much more during his more than 40 
years in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
During two weeks at Elario's, which began Wednesday night, Heath is 
concentrating on tenor sax, but he also has a flute and soprano sax in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping up his talents on several instruments, Heath is a serious 
composer. He is working on commissioned original works for the Montreal Jazz 
Society and the Jazzmobile project in New York. He has also been writing new 
material for himself, much of which he plans to unveil at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Heath hasn't released a solo album for about two years, but last month he 
collaborated with several other jazzmen on a session under the leadership of 
Bill Cosby. Yes, that Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the Cos has a real thing about jazz. He chose a few tunes and brought 
together some of his favorite people to play them under his direction, 
musicians like Heath and hot young pianist Mulgrew Miller. 
</P>
<P>
With his roots in be-bop, Heath is a living treasure of jazz who survived a 
'50s battle with drugs and went on to a long, productive career. At Elario's, 
he will be joined by former San Diegan Rob Schneiderman on piano, Bob Magnusson 
on bass, John Guerin on drums the first week and Sherman Ferguson the second. 
</P>
<P>
Denver pianist-singer Ellyn Rucker is in town for her annual summer stay, which 
combines nights playing the tiny bar in the Beach House restaurant in Mission 
Beach and days of working out. 
</P>
<P>
This year's visit is especially welcomed by Rucker, who toured Europe three 
times the past year. In June, she returned from two months in France, Germany, 
Scotland and the U.K. She stopped in several small towns, such as Plymouth on 
the English Channel, where jazz fans seldom have a chance to hear live music. 
</P>
<P>
In such places, they clamored to buy copies of her albums, including last 
year's "This Heart of Mine." Sometimes, Rucker traveled by train, a shopping 
bag full of CDs in tow. 
</P>
<P>
As is generally true of European audiences, they treated her with a reverence 
rare stateside. She did a live interview and performance on BBC radio and made 
an appearance on "Music Friends," a live radio music hour. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker has two albums in the works: a duo with bassist Red Mitchell, already 
recorded; and a collaboration with saxophonist Spike Robinson, a close friend 
who also lives in Denver. She is a first-rate pianist whose swinging 
improvisations are full of surprises, and she uses her sultry voice as a jazz 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker will play Tuesday through Saturday nights through Aug. 18, except for 
this Friday and Saturday nights, when she joins flutist Holly Hofmann in the 
Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown. 
</P>
<P>
One thing jazz purists find dislikable about commercial jazz is the emphasis on 
simple, choreographed melodies instead of fiery improvisations. 
Guitarist-keyboardist Russ Freeman and his band the Rippingtons, who play 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay Friday night at 7 and 9, claim to leave more 
improvisational space in their songs than most pop jazz groups. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman is a high-tech guitarist for the 1990s, feeding his instrument through 
all manner of synthesizers and electronic equipment. Sometimes the results are 
the same kind of nondescript lush music produced by many of his light jazz 
peers. But Freeman is a first-rate musician, and the group's newest album, 
"Tourist in Paradise," has won some good reviews, especially for its 
Brazilian-flavored songs. 
</P>
<P>
At press time, there were still plenty of tickets left. 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz benefactors Bob and Gretchen Geib are taking a two-month hiatus from 
the shows they present at Diego's Loft and other venues. 
</P>
<P>
With their Society for Straight Ahead Jazz, the Geibs have produced 38 shows 
the last year, dipping into their own pockets when ticket sales weren't 
sufficient to pay musicians. Bob Geib will spend some time scouring Los Angeles 
for new talent and sorting through more than 200 hours' worth of tapes he has 
made during the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he hopes to combine the best of these on a CD. The Geibs' shows 
will start again in October, with tentative bookings including former John 
Coltrane bassist Art Davis, saxophonists Gary LeFebvre and Rod Cradit and 
guitarist and alto sax man Al Kaye. The Geibs' last definite show before their 
break will be an Aug. 4 appearance by guitarist Peter Sprague at Diego's Loft, 
but Geib is also thinking about a Salmon House date for Ellyn Rucker with a 
small ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The last three Sundays of brunch cruises aboard the MV Entertainer on 
San Diego Bay have been canceled, including this Sunday's scheduled appearance 
by Windows. The series opened May 13 with Doug Cameron, but scheduling problems 
with some acts, combined with poor attendance, brought things to a halt this 
week.
