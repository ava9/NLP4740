  [Text] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled Malawi as a 
one-party state for 30 years, has been defeated in the country's 
first democratic elections. 
  By last night, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, of the United Democratic 
Front, the UDF, had received 960,000 votes in the presidential 
election, compared with Dr. Banda's 418,000. In the 
parliamentary election the UDF had taken 74 seats compared with 
56 won by Dr. Banda's Malawi Congress Party. The Alliance for 
Democracy had won 36 seats. The results of 11 constituencies 
were still outstanding. The UDF said it needed 89 seats as a 
minimum to gain a working majority of 51 percent. This meant 
that the party needed 15 more seats. The official results are 
expected today. 
  Preliminary results of the presidential election put UDF 
leader, Bakili Muluzi, ahead -- with President Kamuzu Banda only 
third behind the Alliance for Democracy's Chakufwa Chihana.
