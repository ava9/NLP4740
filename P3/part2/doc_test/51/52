  [Text] In Malawi the consensus seems to be that the 
election campaigns have gone off without conflict, but concern 
has been expressed over allegations of voter intimidation 
involving the traditional Nyau groups in the rural areas. From 
Malawi Andrew Meldrum reports: 
  Those drum beats and war cries are the trademark signs of 
Malawi's much feared Nyau dancers. The Nyau dancers have become 
a controversial element of Malawi's election campaign. There 
are charges that the dancers have been intimidating rural people 
from attending opposition rallies and from registering to vote. 
The numerous Nyau societies costly guard their secrecy and it 
is taboo for the dancers to be seen without a mask completely 
covering their faces. Some Nyau masks are covered with 
feathers, others are of large grimacing faces. 
  For the past 20 years Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda 
and his Malawi Congress Party [MCP] have used many Nyau dancers 
for their political purposes. The Nyau would force villagers to 
attend a congress party rally, for instance, or would attack a 
rural person who had been criticizing the ruling party. 
  Now there are many complaints that the Nyau dancers have 
been 
intimidating rural voters in Malawi's election campaign. 
Charles Joya, spokesman for the Independent Electoral 
Commission, explains why his group launched a formal complaint 
against the Nyau dancers. 
  [Begin recording] [Joya] The Nyau dancers have been used to 
disturb meetings of other political parties. It has been mainly 
confined to those districts in the central region, but in the 
past few weeks we haven't had any major problem in that area, so 
maybe the parties who were using the Nyau dancers have stopped 
using them, but that was a problem particularly about a month or 
two months ago. 
  [Meldrum] Charles Joya said incidents of Nyau intimidation 
significantly decreased after the Electoral Commission issued a 
report in April making specific allegations. Nyau dancers are 
colorful and exciting, but the Electoral Commission says the 
secret society should not be frightening or otherwise 
influencing Malawi's rural voters. [end recording] 
  Well, if there is anyone in Malawi who should have their 
finger on the policy regarding some of these allegations of 
intimidation and vote-buying it is the Reverend Aaron Longwe. 
Director of a local human rights organization, he was inspired 
to start the group in 1992 after various spells in prison, and 
after a year of operating in secret, he received government 
recognition. Well, his organization has been monitoring the 
election campaign. Andrew Meldrum asked him if these 
allegations were indeed true. 
  [Begin recording] [Longwe] These are true stories. One of 
our field officers has been to quite a number of places 
following up such cases. It is indeed true, most specially in 
the central region, where the Malawi Congress Party leadership 
have gone out with the chiefs to confiscate or to buy 
registration certificates from voters. It is indeed that the 
Nyau dancers as well have threatened or disrupted the rallies in 
many places, also in Dowa, Kasungu and Nchinji. We have also 
had cases of the Young Pioneers who have been going disguising 
themselves as MCP opposition members and disrupting other 
people's meetings. 
  [Meldrum] So, you do believe that human rights issues are 
very important in this first multiparty election that Malawi is 
having in 30 years? 
  [Longwe] Human rights is quite very important. So far, we 
have been issuing press releases condemning all these atrocious 
things that are taking place in this country. We are condemning 
the leadership both from the ruling party, as well as the 
opposition, and we have been trying to raise an awareness 
through the media, explaining to them of the importance of human 
rights. 
  [Meldrum] Do you think Malawian people, particularly in the 
rural areas, have an appreciation for human rights, and that 
they are willing to work to maintain the human rights that they 
have won? 
  [Longwe] They are very ready. We had some ladies who came 
from the rural areas, it was so encouraging to hear them express 
themselves by saying that now we have got our own freedom, and 
we shall never lose it, and we shall fight for it. 
  [Meldrum] You believe that tribalism and regionalism is a 
problem here in Malawi? 
  [Longwe] These are two main big problems. Even now in our 
campaign trails, we assume these are becoming more and more 
clearer that even the leaders themselves they are advocating 
regionalism and tribalism, which is very sad. 
  [Meldrum] Now, there are many people who say that because of 
Malawi's long history of repression, whoever wins, either the 
MCP, or the Aford [Alliance for Democracy] or UDF [United 
Democratic Front] will take on the same strong measures, the 
same repression that had been used before. Do you think the 
Malawi people will allow that, and what will your organization 
do? 
  [Longwe] So far, as a human rights organization, we have 
simply asked for a commission of inquiry, and what we want is 
simply accountability and scrutiny to the past atrocities. We 
don't want to incriminate anybody, but we simply want to address 
these issues, so that they are not repeated, through the human 
commission, which I believe, soon after the general elections 
shall be placed. We shall make sure that no one is deprived or 
is arbitrarily thrown back into prison, or that there is 
vengeance in this country. We shall make sure that we control 
the whole situation. [end recording]
