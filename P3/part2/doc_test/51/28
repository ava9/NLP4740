  [Text] Malawi's new President Bakili Muluzi and his United 
Democratic Front, the UDF, have lost little time flexing their 
muscles after ending the Malawi Congress Party, MCP's, 30 years 
in power in last week's elections. Directors of state-owned 
corporations have been sacked, most are seen as political 
appointees sympathetic to ex-President Banda, but it looks like 
there is going to be a delay before the election result can be 
finalized. From Blantyre Rachel Rawlings reports: 
  There is a question mark over all five seats in Nsanje 
District, which was said to have been owned by Dr. Banda's 
Malawi Congress Party. The results in three will stand because 
there has been no special complaint received by the electoral 
commission, but the other two, which include that of MCP Vice 
President Gwanda Chakwamba have been declared void. A number of 
people including the powerful local chief Tengani, said to be a 
close associate of Mr. Chakwamba, are being taken to court over 
the matter. 
  Meanwhile, former President Banda has been given until the 
end of the month to move out of Sanjika palace here in Blantyre. 
It it rumored he will move into another house in Blantyre which 
was also used as an official presidential residence, but is in 
fact Dr. Banda's personal property. It is just one of a number 
of large houses he owned personally, which the government paid 
him to use as official residences. Civil servants here are 
awaiting confirmation of their new bosses as President Muluzi 
makes his ministerial appointments. A large framed picture of 
Dr. Banda still hangs in the entrance to the building which 
houses the office of the president and Cabinet. It was a 
requirement to have his portrait in public places. Some shop 
owners have taken the pictures down, but others still remain.
