  [Text] The man often assumed to be the power behind the 
throne in Malawi is Minister of State in the Presidency's Office 
John Tembo. On the line last night, I asked him whether him 
whether the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] had yet conceded defeat. 
  [Begin recording] [Tembo] Actually, depending on the figures 
which were coming in yesterday, UDF [United Democratic Front] 
were ahead in polling. The figures were in their favor; but 
naturally the final figures were not out yet. We should be 
getting them sometime this morning or late afternoon today. Our 
reaction to it is that there is a normal electoral process and 
we accept the victory of the UDF or any other party which wins 
in this election. It is part of a system which we set in motion 
to do. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But surely, if this trend does 
continue and the UDF indeed win, it must come as rather a bitter 
blow to you that the MCP has suffered such a heavy defeat? 
  [Tembo] Well, naturally any party which loses, it feels sad, 
but if you accept, in a multiparty system, a democratic process 
and the right for people to choose a party of their choice, you 
must also accept that you can lose or win and the Malawi 
Congress will accept. 
  [Reporter] So, why do you think the results have been so bad 
in fact? 
  [Tembo] Well, I don't consider them that bad. I mean, 
considering the fact that the Malawi Congress Party has been in 
power for the last 30 years. It is natural that people in the 
transition we are going through, not only in Malawi but 
elsewhere, have the right to choose the party they want to 
govern them at that time. So, it is not really a shock or that 
bad. 
  [Reporter] Overall, have you been happy with the conduct of 
the election, that it has indeed been a peaceful and free and 
fair vote? 
  [Tembo] Yes, so far as the process is concerned, it has been 
very free and very fair. There has been no problem. No report 
of any intimidation. There is no report of any problem at any 
station. There has been some report of confusion in some polling 
stations because of the existence of two (?discarded) boxes, but 
otherwise it has been very, very quiet, and the atmosphere has 
been extremely good. [end recording]
