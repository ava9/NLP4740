  [Excerpt] President Kamuzu Banda of Malawi who had brain 
surgery in South Africa last year has fallen ill again. A 
newspaper owned by his ruling party reported today that 
President Kamuzu Banda yesterday failed to attend traditional 
dances prepared for him at the State House in Lilongwe due to 
illness. The newspaper quoted the secretary general of the 
ruling Malawi Congress Party, Mr. Gwanda Chakuamba who presided 
over the dance ceremony, as saying the elderly leader had a 
slight leg problem. Government officials were not available for 
comment. [passage omitted]
