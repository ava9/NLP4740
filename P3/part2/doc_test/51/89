  [Text] The Egle Party has urged opposition parties in Ghana 
to show political maturity even if they differ politically so 
that they may be accorded respect. This is contained in a 
statement issued in Accra and signed by the co-chairman of the 
party, Dr. Ako-Brew, congratulating President Nelson Mandela of 
South Africa and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for ensuring successful elections in their 
country. 
  The Egle Party also congratulates the outgoing president of 
Malawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda, for conceding defeat in his country's 
presidential elections. According to the statement, the 
examples of South Africa and Malawi should be a light to other 
African countries where opposition parties, unable to accept 
defeat in a free and fair election, have resorted to verbal and 
physical violence to achieve political power. 
  The statement said whilst the NPP [New Patriotic Party] sent 
congratulatory messages to political party leaders in South 
Africa, who have made true dialogue a cornerstone of their 
politics, the same party has backed out of dialogue here at 
home. The statement said having failed to participate in 
elections which would have given it a presence in parliament, 
the NPP is doing everything it can to obstruct and discourage 
investments, undermine and discredit the government, and sow 
seeds of discord in the country. Whilst reminding the NPP of 
the proverb that charity begins at home, the statement urges all 
political parties to prevent the events in Liberia, Burundi, 
Rwanda, Somalia, and Angola from happening in Ghana.
