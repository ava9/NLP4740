MALAWIAN exiles and critics of President Kamuzu Banda's government hold a
conference in Lusaka today to discuss prospects for democratic change in
their country, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
The three-day meeting in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, which follows calls
within Malawi for democratic reform, will bring together exiles from a
number of countries, including Europe and North America.
'The economic, social and political order in Malawi is. . . in a state of
paralysis,' one of the Lusaka conference organisers, Mr Mapopa Chipeta of
the Southern Africa Institute for Research and Policy Studies in Harare,
said yesterday. 'The atmosphere is pregnant with expectations of major
changes.'
Malawi, a small state with a population of 8.5m, has been tightly ruled by
Mr Banda, 93, since independence from Britain in 1964. He outlawed all
opposition parties shortly after taking power.
Roman Catholic bishops in Malawi issued a pastoral letter on March 8
criticising the government's human rights record and calling for democratic
reform. Mr Banda on Tuesday said Malawi guaranteed freedom of religion but
warned that churches should stay out of politics.
Mr Chafukwa Chihana, general secretary of the Southern African Trade Union
Co-ordinating Council and one of the Lusaka meeting delegates, called on all
churches in Malawi to join the Catholic bishops in criticising the
government.
