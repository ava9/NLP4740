  [Text] The president of Malawi, Hastings Banda, facing 
challenges from three presidential contenders in multiparty 
elections on Tuesday, says that his work as the country's ruler 
is not yet finished. Speaking on state radio, he said that 
Malawi needed an experienced leader and politicians of ability, 
honor and good reputation. Accused of being responsible for 
serious human rights abuses during his three decades in power, 
he said that he would respect human rights and uphold good and 
accountable government.
