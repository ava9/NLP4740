  [Text] Blantyre, April 17 (AFP) -- Malawi's independent 
electoral commission on Sunday [17 April] named President 
Hastings Kamuzu Banda's ruling party as the main violator of 
electoral law. 
  In a press statement the commission, headed by High Court 
Judge Anastazia Msosa, charged that Malawi Congress Party 
officials had been seizing or buying voter registration 
certificates, to be used in presidential and parliamentary 
elections on May 17. The commission said it had gathered its 
own evidence that the party had been doing this in nine of 
Malawi's 24 districts. It said chiefs -- who play an 
influential role in rural politics -- and MCP officials were the 
main culprits in snatching voter certificates. 
  "Voters have either been told to surrender their 
certificates 
and come to a central location on election day to retrieve them 
so that everyone votes for the same candidate, or they have 
simply been taken without promise of return," the commission 
said. 
  The commission also reported two cases of opposition parties 
violating the electoral law. It said an official of the 
Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) was apprehended while attempting 
to seize registration certificates and another official of the 
Malawi National Democratic Party bought voter certificates to 
secure the election of presidential candidate Tim Mangwazu. 
  The commission, which has pledged to prosecute violators of 
the electoral law, said campaign violence and intimidation had 
been noted in several districts. "Tit-for-tat campaign meeting 
disruptions resulting in a number of injuries have occurred 
between the opposition United Democratic Front and the ruling 
party," the commission said. 
  This was the first time that the commission, set up by 
parliament had openly accused Banda's party of breaking the 
electoral law. 
  If convicted, offenders face up to two years imprisonment or 
a maximum fine of 5,000 kwacha (800 US dollars).
