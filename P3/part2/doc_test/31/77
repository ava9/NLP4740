  [Text] San Jose, 26 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres today said he will review a U.S. proposal 
presented to Central American nations concerning Haitian 
refugees. Under the plan, the Central American nations would 
receive Haitian refugees "temporarily" while a solution is 
sought to the current crisis in that Caribbean nation. 
  Figueres told ACAN-EFE that Washington is working with the 
UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in an attempt to "assist 
those Haitian citizens who feel politically threatened." 
  Figueres added: "The idea is for these people to stay here 
on 
a temporary basis, until they can be returned to Haiti." 
  Although Figueres stressed that "all of us are concerned" 
about the situation in Haiti, "so far, we have yet to make a 
decision." He added, "We will be evaluating the request within 
the next few days." 
  Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo 
confirmed Washington had indeed presented the request to Costa 
Rica, but he explained that it would affect only political 
refugees, not economic refugees. He added that the issue would 
be studied jointly by the United States and Costa Rica.
