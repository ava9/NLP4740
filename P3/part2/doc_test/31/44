  [Text] Managua, May 4 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui said here Wednesday [4 May] that his 
country will continue helping Nicaragua in its push for economic 
development. 
  Li made the pledge when meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, shortly after Li's arrival in 
Nicaragua Wednesday afternoon for a two-day official visit. 
  Chamorro expressed her heartfelt thanks to Li for Taiwan's 
assistance in Nicaragua's economic reconstruction. In return, 
Li thanked Chamorro for Nicaraguan support of the ROC's bid to 
gain a seat in the United Nations. 
  Nicaragua is one of Taiwan's seven Latin American allies 
that 
together submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, asking the United Nations to put the ROC's UN bid 
on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly last September. The 
request was voted down. 
  Li and Chamorro also exchanged a wide range of views on 
issues of mutual concern. Raymond Tai, spokesman for the 
Presidential Office, said the meeting was held in a "friendly 
atmosphere." 
  Li stressed in a welcoming reception held in his honor later 
in the day that the ROC is willing to share its successful 
"Taiwan experience" with Nicaragua. 
  The first ROC-Nicaraguan ministerial meeting was also held 
Wednesday, during which Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal 
Sanchez vowed to continue to support the ROC politically, saying 
there is no reason to continue keeping Taiwan and the 21 million 
people in Taiwan out of the UN. 
  Attending the meeting on Taiwan's side were Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chien Fu, Central Bank of China Governor Samuel C. 
Shieh, council for economic planning and development chairman 
Hsiao Wan-chang, Executive Yuan adviser Jeffrey Koo, and Tai, 
who is also vice presidential secretary-general. 
  The second ministerial meeting will be held Thursday, during 
which an extradition treaty, bilateral economic cooperation and 
Taiwan investment in Nicaragua will be discussed. 
  A joint communique will be issued on Thursday before Li 
leaves Managua for Costa Rica, where he will attend the 
inaugural ceremony for Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria 
Figueres on Sunday.
