  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Presidents 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Rafael Angel Calderon of 
Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement in Mexico 
City. The treaty will expand their economic exchange as of 
1995. Salinas de Gortari and Calderon signed the document at a 
ceremony in Los Pinos presidential residence after the Costa 
Rican president's arrival in Mexico for a two-day visit that 
will end tomorrow. 
  Costa Rica is the first Central American country to sign a 
free trade agreement with Mexico. The latter is holding similar 
negotiations with Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and 
Honduras. 
  "This treaty will allow a greater flow of commerce and 
investments between our countries" and will strengthen the ties 
of friendship and cooperation between Mexico and Costa Rica, 
Calderon said in a speech he gave at the event, which was also 
attended by Salinas de Gortari. Calderon said: "The 21st century 
begins for Costa Ricans" with the signing of this treaty. He 
said the agreement represents "a great step toward" Costa Rica's 
future integration into NAFTA, signed by Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico, which has been in effect since January.
