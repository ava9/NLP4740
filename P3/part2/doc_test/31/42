  [Excerpts] Mexico City -- Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari and Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon 
yesterday signed a treaty that establishes a free trade zone 
between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The Free Trade Agreement [FTA] covers issues such as access 
to markets, norms of origin, agriculture, technical hours, 
phytosanitary issues, protection measures, disloyal actions, 
government purchases, investments, services, intellectual 
copyright, and settlement of controversies. The agreement will 
allow a better flow of trade and investments, and it will entail 
growth and welfare for the two countries. 
  According to political and business leaders, this is the 
most 
advanced agreement signed to date between two Latin American 
nations; and it will have particularly beneficial effects for 
Costa Rica, whose trade balance with Mexico has a 90-million 
colones deficit. 
  Certain Mexican newspapers said the treaty was not timely 
and 
prompted by the two countries' political interests. 
Nevertheless, the deep emotion that prevailed during the 
ceremony where the document was signed proved the need to 
reassert historical and cultural ties with Latin America after 
joining the great northern trade bloc -- NAFTA with Canada and 
the United States. 
  Samuel Yankelewitz, president of the Chamber of Industries, 
emphasized the treaty is very technical and includes all the 
necessary elements for things to work correctly. Although he 
admitted it was certainly necessary to hasten things because the 
current administration is about to end, he warned that things 
were done correctly despite the haste. This resulted in a fair 
and balanced treaty for the two nations. 
  Doris Osterlof, executive director of the Chamber of 
Exporters, referred to this issue and said businessmen are ready 
to face the challenge of competing with the Mexicans. "We have 
an industry that is ready because we have experimented and 
competed in the Central American market for 30 years. Now our 
industry will expand its limits to the Mexican market," she said. 
  According to Costa Rican businessmen's estimates, the 
country 
may quintuple its current exports to Mexico in five years -- 
from 60 million colones to 250 million colones. 
  Carlos Alvarado, president of the Chamber of Commerce, 
announced that businessmen began their contacts this week to 
attract foreign investments from Costa Rica to Mexico. 
  The Mexican and Costa Rican stock exchanges signed an 
agreement after the FTA was signed, opening the market to new 
financial opportunities; and the International Bank of Costa 
Rica (BICSA) announced it will open a new support office in 
Guatemala to study the possibility of going to Mexico. This way 
the bank can continue to support everything dealing with foreign 
trade, BICSA Vice President Arturo Cuevillas noted. 
  According to official sources, the FTA signed yesterday will 
allow investments in Costa Rica to increase by approximately 10 
billion colones. The possibility is a result of the attraction 
Costa Rica will have as a point of access to a market of 90 
million people. Mexican businessmen will be able to install 
their factories here and export to their country. Currently 80 
billion colones, approximately 8 percent of the GDP, in Mexican 
capital has been invested here. 
  Meanwhile, businessmen from other countries who are seeking 
access to the Mexican market through the tariff advantages that 
the agreement grants products manufactured in Costa Rica, will 
be able to do so. Hitachi, National Batteries, Ticatex, Cocoa 
Products, and Salas Lizano are included in that category. 
  The agreement foresees the immediate elimination of tariffs 
for 70 percent of the Mexican exports; for 20 percent in five 
years; and for 10 percent in 10 years. Also, 75 percent of 
national exports will be cleared immidiately; 15 percent will be 
cleared in five years; and 10 percent will be cleared in 10 
years.

  The Mexican authorities accepted last minute changes to the 
FTA, allowing Costa Rica the possibility of exporting 5,000 tons 
of powdered milk per year to that country." Meanwhile, "Mexico 
will be able to freely export condensed and evaporated milk to 
Costa Rica.
