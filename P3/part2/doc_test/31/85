  [Text] San Jose, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani said today that Central America is en route to 
political stability and that he believes that with the change in 
governments in the area the integration process will receive new 
impetus. 
  In a statement to ACAN-EFE, Cristiani said that Honduras, 
Costa Rica, and El Salvador "have consolidated their 
democracies" with their recent electoral processes and that the 
countries that still "give reason for concern" are Guatemala and 
Nicaragua. 
  Notwithstanding, the Salvadoran president emphasized that 
last year Guatemala was able to solve, "within the framework of 
constitutional legality," the self-inflicted coup of Former 
President Jorge Serrano Elias, after which Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
became president. 
  Cristiani, who signed peace agreements with the former 
Salvadoran guerrilla forces in January 1992, is confident that 
the peace negotiations to end the armed conflict in Guatemala, 
which dates back to 1960, will end successfully and emphasized 
that "the science of peace is patience." He emphasized, 
however, that it is difficult to predict when the government and 
the Guatemalan guerrilla forces will sign a peace agreement, 
because "negotiations are sometimes slow and difficult and one 
cannot be hasty in something so delicate." 
  With respect to Nicaragua's political situation, Cristiani 
said "there are still some details" to clear up, but "little by 
little the Nicaraguan people are overcoming their problems." "I 
believe Central America is headed toward stability; there are no 
destabilizing elements," stated Cristiani, who on 1 June will 
turn the presidency over to President-elect Armando Calderon 
Sol, leader of Cristiani's own right-wing Nationalist Republican 
Alliance party. 
  Cristiani is confident that changes in Central American 
governments will give new impetus to the region's integration 
process, which in recent months have become bogged down due to 
the general elections being carried out in most of these 
countries. 
  He said that, since the beginning of the integration 
process, 
governments of different ideologies have participated and made 
satisfactory headway, and that, because of this, he does not 
believe there will be any delay in this issue as a result of the 
administrative changes going on in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa 
Rica, and, just around the corner, in Panama. 
  Cristiani said he spoke of this with Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina, and with Costa Rican President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres, who will be sworn in on Sunday, adding: "The two 
are willing to continue the integration effort." In El 
Salvador's case, the president said his party's policy "is in 
favor of integration." 
  Cristiani admitted that the major advances in the Central 
American integration process have centered on economic issues, 
but he did not rule out that in the coming years the social 
aspect might climb higher on the agenda. In addition, the 
president believes it improbable that his country's peace 
process could suffer a setback as a result of the internal 
crisis of the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN), because the five groups that comprise the FMLN 
signed the accords that put an end to the 12-year war. 
  Cristiani believes the differences that arose within the 
ranks of the FMLN one week ago are "logical" given "their 
different leftist ideologies," which may have united them for 
the armed struggle but could lead to their break up in the 
political arena. 
  "The only problem I consider delicate is the internal 
threats 
that could deteriorate into violence within the FMLN, but the 
government will be ready not only to try to prevent this, but, 
in case violence does occur, to apprehend those responsible and 
put them where they belong," Cristiani said. 
  A clandestine group of dubious ideology threatened the life 
of various former FMLN commanders, including Joaquin Villalobos, 
for having "betrayed revolutionary principles" by negotiating 
with the government on the make-up of the Legislative Assembly 
Directorate.
