  [Text] San Jose, 14 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that his government is still 
standing firmly behind Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus' candidacy 
for the OAS secretary generalship. 
  He concurrently warned that Washington may eventually exert 
pressure on the small countries that support Costa Rica's top 
diplomat. "My government will not withdraw or change Niehaus' 
candidacy under any circumstance," added Calderon, recalling 
that he had rejected a request from Mexico that he seek the 
position. 
  Calderon said he has not received any information to the 
effect that the United States, which supports Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, is exerting pressure on small countries 
to force them to withdraw their support for Niehaus, a 
52-year-old expert in international relations. "If pressure was 
exerted we would denounce it and all the countries on the 
continent would regret it," Calderon said. 
  The president made these remarks in response to questions 
concerning reports of an alleged weakening of Niehaus' candidacy 
in light of the emergence of Gaviria, whose nomination is not 
official as yet. Meanwhile, Fernando Naranjo, a ranking 
spokesman for the social democratic National Liberation Party 
(PLN), who has been mentioned as the next foreign minister, 
spoke today in favor of Niehaus' nomination. 
  Local newspapers have suggested over the past few days that 
support for the Costa Rican foreign minister is deteriorating. 
Within the framework of these rumors, several names were 
mentioned, including that of Oscar Arias, a former president and 
Nobel Peace Prize winner; Sonia Picado, a judge at the 
Inter-American Human Rights Court; Gonzalo Facio, the Costa 
Rican ambassador to Washington; and former Foreign Minister 
Rodrigo Madrigal as possible alternatives for Costa Rica in the 
event of Niehaus' withdrawal. 
  Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said shortly 
before the 6 February elections that his government would 
support the current foreign minister. 
  Meanwhile, President Calderon announced that Niehaus today 
initiated a tour of Caribbean nations to confirm the support 
offered to him by 13 nations in that region. The foreign 
minister claims to have 23 votes, five more than are needed to 
win the position in the first round, which is scheduled for 27 
March. Niehaus asserts that he is the leader of a Central 
American candidacy and believes that it would only be fair for 
this area to have an OAS secretary general because thus far all 
of the secretaries have been from large South American 
countries. The principle of rotation must be observed, he 
recently asserted during an interview granted to DPA.
