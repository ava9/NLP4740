  [Text] San Jose, 13 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central American 
presidents today demanded a solution to the Cuban situation 
within the framework of the inter-American system, but ruled out 
taking this issue before the fourth Ibero-American summit, which 
will be held in Colombia tomorrow and Wednesday, or that it will 
be the subject of an agreement. 
  At the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Costa Rica, 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said that this is a 
regional stand, although there may be details that they might 
not agree on. Reina said that Central America would like to see 
a "democratic transition" in Cuba, but attributed the 
responsibility of seeking a solution to the OAS. "It is a 
problem of the (inter-American) system, and we must find a 
solution to this special case," Reina pointed out when consulted 
on this issue, which was not included in the final document of 
the Central American meeting. 
  The Honduran president and Costa Rican President Jose Maria 
Figueres agreed, however, that the solution of the Cuban problem 
"must come from within the Cuban family." Figueres said that 
now that the bipolar world is a thing of the past and the Cold 
War is over "we have an obligation to assess" our foreign 
relations, among others, with Cuba, a country with which Costa 
Rica broke relations in the 1960's, as did most of the Latin 
American countries. "In these new times we want to be sure of 
what we are doing," the chief of state said. He added that all 
efforts must be made to ensure that Cuba will be able to move 
forward "in a peaceful manner." 
  The chiefs of state, however, refused to say whether they 
want to reestablish relations with Cuba, request an end to the 
economic blockade imposed by the United States for more than 30 
years, or call for Cuba's reinstatement into the OAS, from which 
it was expelled in the 1960's. 
  A diplomatic source that requested anonymity, however, said 
that the Cuban case could bring a surprise at the Ibero-American 
summit, which will take place tomorrow and Wednesday in 
Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), but refused to elaborate.
