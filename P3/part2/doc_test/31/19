  [Text] In a sign of respect and hospitality for President 
Li's visit, Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of Costa Rica, 
specially convened a joint news conference on the morning of 7 
May local time, at which the leaders of the two nations answered 
correspondents' questions. Because of the imminent changeover 
of government in Costa Rica, the conference hall was packed with 
correspondents from various countries who came to cover the 
inauguration. Asked about democracy in Costa Rica and what we 
can learn from Costa Rica's experience of democracy, President 
Li said: Costa Rica has been a model democracy of late, because 
all the institutions in Costa Rica are founded on the idea of 
power belonging to the people. Power is being transferred 
peacefully in Costa Rica from the outgoing president to the 
incoming president, and there is no uneasiness over the 
changeover of political power. 
  Aware of the presence of a XINHUA correspondent, President 
Li 
changed the subject by pointing out: The foremost problem on 
mainland China is who is going to be the successor. Looking at 
the democratic institutions in Costa Rica, we should know that 
lasting peace and stability must be founded on institutions. It 
would be ideal for politics to be founded on institutions. 
President Li said: 
  "The expression that power belongs to the people is an old 
saying; it is, as a matter of fact, also very timely. Let us 
talk about it. I believe a representative from mainland China 
is present here. The biggest problem facing mainland China is 
who is going to be the successor. [words indistinct] will tell 
you that the democracy we are promoting is such an institution. 
We should know that lasting peace and stability refers 
precisely to the establishment of such institutions. The 
establishment of institutions [words indistinct]. I believe 
that this is the best and soundest approach." 
  At this point, President Li said with emotion that he has a 
dream. His dream is avert transferring power only after his 
death. He would be happiest to oversee a peaceful transfer of 
power while he is still alive. 
  "I have a dream. I hope that some day I can hand over power 
to another person. I would be happiest doing that. There has 
never been a president in China, in the ROC, who has handed over 
power to another a person while he was still alive. In the 
dynasties of old, a new emperor would emerge only after the old 
one died. I hope this will not happen again. This is precisely 
the goal of our constitutional reform. Only then will the 
country enjoy stability. Development is possible only when there 
is stability." 
  [Words indistinct] his ideas of democracy and power 
belonging 
to the people and his wishes to establish a political system of 
lasting peace and stability, the XINHUA correspondent present at 
the news conference told ROC correspondents that what President 
Li said was very sensible. China indeed needs to become more 
democratic and scientific. The practice in the past of one 
person designating another as his successor should never be 
repeated. 
  (Shu Chih-cheng), director of the Secretariat of the 
Presidential Office who was a member of the government 
delegation, also told the XINHUA correspondent that the 
president's words were from the bottom of his heart, saying that 
he hoped that they would give full coverage to his remarks.
