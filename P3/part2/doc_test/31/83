  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of

January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Exports and Investments Center of Costa Rica on 28 
December reported that sales of products and services to foreign 
nations increased more than 50 percent between 1990 and 1993, 
although the trade balance is in deficit. According to the 
Central Bank, imports in 1990 amounted to $1.98 billion, whereas 
in 1993 they reached $3 billion. The same source added that the 
1993 trade balance has an $800 million deficit. (Mexico City

  Finance Minister Carlos Munoz announced that interest rates 
in 1994 will be lower than in 1993. Higher rates will continue 
to be used for several months while some adjustments are made.

  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier 
reported 
on 3 January that inflation during 1993 was 9.05 percent. 
Economy Minister Roberto Rojas explained that this was due to a 
reduction in the prices of many items after some taxes were 
lifted in April. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0007 GMT 4 Jan
