FT  13 JUL 94 / Figueres bends to fiscal reality: Costa Rica's new president
is forced to be more pragmatic

The fierce campaigning against economic liberalisation that won the Costa
Rican presidency for Mr Jose Mara Figueres has given way to a more pragmatic
approach since he took office in May.
Mr Figueres, a 39-year-old engineer with a master's degree in government
from Harvard University in the US, promised to renegotiate a structural
adjustment programme with the World Bank and pay greater attention to social
needs.
But the difficult fiscal position inherited by his government means Latin
America's youngest president will have to seek external financing to fulfil
social programmes.
That will oblige his government to remain in favour with the
Washington-based international financial institutions.
'His challenge is how to harmonise the relative satisfaction that there is
with the development of macro-economic policies with the level of
dissatisfaction that there is on social issues, fundamentally in health and
education,' says Mr Carlos Sojo, a political analyst.
The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have been receptive
to proposed changes to programmes suggested by a government delegation last
month, says a finance ministry adviser.
The government rejected a demand by the World Bank to reduce the public
sector by 25,000 job-holders, and has said it will implement a plan for
'state rationalisation' instead. The new government has said it would not
remove the state insurance company's monopoly in the short term and would
keep an open mind on the control by the state oil company Recope of refining
and distribution of petrol.
But Mr Leonardo Garnier, planning minister, says progress will continue on
opening the banking sector so as to let private banks offer cheque accounts,
now the preserve of state banks. The government also remains committed to
the sale of state cement and fertiliser companies.
The new economic team has been keen to stress that there will be no big
changes in a broad policy of economic liberalisation despite the campaign
rhetoric.
'We agree with the international banks' concern to liberalise the market and
make the state more efficient,' says Mr Garnier.
'But we want to find the best instruments to do so,' he added.
Costa Rica's heterodox liberalisation policies were initiated by two
governments from Mr Figueres's National Liberation party (PLN) from 1982-88,
and senior members of those administrations are now back in cabinet posts.
Since taking office on May 8, Mr Figueres has been sharply criticised by
former government ministers for reiterating campaign attacks on his
predecessors whom he accuses of leaving the state coffers empty.
Mr Rafael Angel Calderon, the previous president, has pointed to
single-digit inflation, healthy foreign exchange reserves, 6 per cent
growth, and low unemployment as the achievements of his administration. His
government also signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico, and oversaw sharp
growth in exports and tourism, reducing traditional dependency on coffee and
bananas.
But economists say that, in the run-up to the election, the previous
government, in keeping with traditional priorities at such times,
artificially held down prices and let the fiscal deficit run, leaving Mr
Figueres with a legacy of debt and repressed inflation. 'If I were the
finance minister I would sit down and weep,' says Mr Dennis Melendez, an
economic consultant.
A close examination from the International Monetary Fund, which is expected
to send a mission this month, is immnent for the government. It is keen to
re-establish a stand-by agreement with the fund as an indication to lenders
that it is following sound macro-economic policies.
Mr Carlos Manuel Castillo, who combines the role of central bank president
with that of economic supremo, went on national television recently to say
that the government hoped to reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.8 per cent of
gross domestic product by the end of 1995. This is unlikely to impress the
fund.
Mr Figueres took over the presidency 46 years after his father, Jose 'Pepe'
Figueres, overthrew Mr Calderon's father and set off a brief but bloody
civil war. A victorious Mr Figueres abolished the armed forces and
implemented extensive social reforms.
His son's efforts to emphasise social issues will be hampered by the split
in his party over his nomination, which followed accusations that his
alleged involvement in the murder of a small-time drug dealer in 1973 made
him an unfit candidate.
His government's slim margin of victory in the election in February also
means he does not enjoy a strong mandate, and acrimony with the opposition
party does not augur well for future negotiations with Congress, where he
will require opposition support.
