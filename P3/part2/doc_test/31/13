</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Costa Ricans go to the polls today to choose a successor to President 
Oscar Arias, they will be among the most expensive voters in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The two major political parties, the incumbent social-democratic National 
Liberation Party (PLN) and the conservative Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) 
have spent a combined total of about $12 per voter to capture the presidency of 
Latin America's most stable democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures of an increasingly expensive campaign -- foreign funding is 
permitted and unregulated -- have led both parties to accept funds from 
questionable sources. 
</P>
<P>
An experienced Costa Rican political analyst said, "The mobsters and gangsters 
of the international drug cartels are always looking for a small country as a 
haven. They practically controlled Panama and they're moving in on Costa Rica . 
. . . The fact is both political parties have been indirectly in touch with 
people who are laundering money or have actually been smuggling drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the connection between prominent Costa Rican politicians and 
functionaries of the drug cartels has not been exactly "indirect." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, front-runner Rafael Angel Calderon, the conservative PUSC 
candidate, saw a comfortable lead over PLN candidate Carlos Manuel Castillo 
almost evaporate, in part because of evidence that PUSC has received nearly $1 
million from two sources now hostile toward each other -- Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega and the U.S. Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews, sworn congressional testimony and documents indicate that since 
1985 both Noriega and two Republican administrations backed Calderon, the man 
perceived as more willing to support their regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 elections, Washington saw the pro-peace PLN candidate Oscar Arias 
an obstacle to pursuing its proxy war against Nicaragua. Calderon, on the other 
hand, threatened to break diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, send Costa Rican 
guardsmen to fight the Sandinistas and forge closer U.S. relations. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega allegedly had other motives for helping Calderon, a 
wheeling-and-dealing politician who might more likely turn a blind eye to 
drug-related activities in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
More embarrassing for Calderon was testimony presented to a U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee in 1989. In a sworn declaration, Jose Blandon, a former 
Panamanian diplomat, said that during 1985 Noriega made two cash donations of 
$250,000 each to Calderon's campaign, one directly to the candidate. The funds 
were not party-to-party, but came from a special military account controlled 
personally by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Until January, Calderon enjoyed a comfortable 10-point lead over Castillo, in 
part because the Liberation Party had been tainted, early in the campaign, with 
ties to drug traffickers. Last July, the Special Commission on Drug Trafficking 
of Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly issued an explosive report implicating a 
former PLN president, Daniel Oduber, and other party officials in drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
PLN aspirant Castillo, an experienced but rather colorless economist, 
immediately plummeted in the polls, although the legislative report produced 
scant evidence that he had personally accepted drug money for his campaign. In 
testimony to the commission, however, Castillo admitted that while running in 
the Liberation Party primaries in 1985, he had received two checks, totaling 
about $2,000, from a Cuban subsequently implicated in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon told the commission that during the last campaign, he accepted 
political loans totaling about $100,000 from two wealthy foreigners later 
linked to drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
But the drug charges stuck more firmly on Liberation, which has been in power 
for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1990 campaign, Calderon's chief ad man and image-maker is Roger Ailes, 
the Republican media consultant who worked on George Bush's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Manuel Chacon, who handled Calderon's two previous unsuccessful 
presidential campaigns, says Ailes has recommended many changes and "has given 
a lot of confidence to Mr. Calderon." 
</P>
<P>
The Ailes-inspired changes are apparent. Gone are Calderon's controversial, 
hawkish statements about Nicaragua and arming Costa Rica. Few interviews are 
granted and public appearances are carefully controlled. The 1989/90 PUSC 
campaign has been long on image, short on substance. 
</P>
<P>
Republican efforts to put Costa Rica in more conservative hands began several 
years ago. The Association for the Defense of Liberty and Democracy in Costa 
Rica, a PUSC political think tank, promoted Calderon's candidacy and opposed 
Arias' peace policies. Since 1986, the think tank, according to its critics, 
has received $434,000 in U.S. government funds from the National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED). Documents show this included almost $50,000 in salaries to 
Calderon, its executive director for two years. The grants have been channeled 
via the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, a Republican 
Party entity set up to receive NED funds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. contributions raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill, since NED is 
specifically barred from involvement in partisan politics. Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa) called it "mind-boggling" -- that U.S. taxpayer money would fund "the 
opposition of the strongest democracy in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
Association President Luis Chacon denies that funds have been improperly used, 
noting the seminars, conferences and public-opinion polls designed "to do 
political upgrading of the country." He adds that his association is now 
concentrating on monitoring "democratic processes" in Nicaragua and Panama and 
that NED funding is being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Latin America and much of Europe, it is common for political parties 
to make donations to sister parties in other countries. But it is quite another 
matter for U.S. government funds to be applied in the partisan politics of a 
friendly country. 
</P>
<P>
Between elections, cocaine trafficking through Costa Rica, and other Central 
American countries, has soared. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins this time will have to deal with that problem over the next four 
years.
