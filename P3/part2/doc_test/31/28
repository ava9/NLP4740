  [Text] Panamanian President Guillermo Endara and Costa 
Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier spoke to 
Telemetro about topics of national and international interest. 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] Specifically, we had nothing to 
discuss regarding bilateral issues. We discussed problems with 
our banana policy toward Europe and the possibility of 
banana-producing countries meeting in Panama in the next 10 or 
15 days to establish a joint position toward Europe. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How would you assess the work done 
by 
your administration at the conclusion of your presidential term? 
  [Calderon] I am very satisfied with the work I did. The most 
important thing is not how I view it but how the people view it. 
In recent polls, 70 percent of the population said government 
action was satisfactory, 9 percent thought it was bad, and the 
rest of the population did not comment. This is really 
extraordinary. 
  [Reporter] In what condition will the government be when you 
transfer it to President-Elect Figueres? 
  [Calderon] We had the highest growth rate for Latin America 
last year. Unemployment is at 4 percent and there was a 
reduction of poverty levels. With this, I will pass the 
government on to him in an exceptional condition to continue 
moving toward development. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, are you confident [Costa Rican] 
Foreign Minister Niehaus will be elected to the post of OAS 
secretary general? 
  [Calderon] I have never been confident of any election. I am 
used to fighting to the end to win. We have received, in 
writing, the formal support of 22 nations of the continent. 
Only 18 votes are required to win, and we trust the 22 nations 
that have supported us. We are certain none of them will let us 
down. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, President Endara assessed the talks held with his 
Costa Rican colleague. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Costa Rica has asked Panama to 
invite the other Latin American banana-producing countries to 
meet here to see if we can reach an accord on this issue because 
no agreement had been reached. I think Calderon's visit was 
very positive from the standpoint of banana production. [end 
recording] 
  After a three-day visit to Panama, Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier returned to his country today. 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara Galimany, accompanied by 
Vice President Guillermo Ford, bid Calderon goodbye at the 
Marcos Gelabert Airport in Paitilla. The Chamber of Commerce, 
Industries, and Agriculture invited the Costa Rican president to 
Panama to inaugurate the 12th version of the Expo-Comer 
Commercial Exhibit.
