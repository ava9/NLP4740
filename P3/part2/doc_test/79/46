The Fairway group of automotive dealerships has agreed to pay about $80,000 to 
settle a civil lawsuit that alleged it fail to tell car buyers that they were 
getting former rental vehicles, the Orange County district attorney's office 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway Lincoln Mercury, Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford were accused of violating 
a state Department of Motor Vehicles regulation by failing to tell more than 60 
customers that they were buying used rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities also claimed that some salespeople had told used-car buyers 
that they were purchasing former company cars or demonstration models when they 
were really former rentals. 
</P>
<P>
"Salespeople were picking things out of the air to tell people," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. William J. Feccia said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, it did not admit 
to any wrongdoing. The Fairway group agreed to refund 5% of the purchase price 
of each car, or a total rebate of about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway defense attorney John D. McGuire said that the dealerships were not 
aware of the cars' histories and that a prior DMV hearing failed to prove that 
they were knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are settling this case because it makes economic sense," McGuire said. "The 
restitution to the customer is a gesture of goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
Fairway Lincoln Mercury -- now known as Fullerton Lincoln Mercury -- and 
Fairway Toyota are both in Fullerton. Fairway Ford is based in Placentia and 
Fairway Volkswagen is no longer in business.
