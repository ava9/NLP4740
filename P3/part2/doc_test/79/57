 -- Most members of Congress say it's time for a change in change. But others 
think the idea isn't worth a plugged nickel. At least 260 House members and 66 
senators are co-sponsoring legislation to change the "tail" sides of coins, 
replacing such pictures as Thomas Jefferson's home and the Lincoln Memorial 
with themes celebrating the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The "heads" would 
still carry portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
George Washington and John F. Kennedy, although the portraits would be revised. 
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) blocked similar legislation in the House last 
year. "On a scale of importance from one to 10, coin design change rates a 
zero," he said. And U.S. Mint Director Donna Pope said there is no evidence 
that anyone who doesn't collect coins "is dissatisfied with current coin 
designs, or even favors new ones."

 -- Famous fans sang the praises of Irving Berlin, "a legendary man whose words 
and music will help define the history of our nation," in the words of 
President Bush. Bush joined a Boston crowd of thousands in singing "God Bless 
America," one of the classic songs by Berlin, who died Friday at age 101. 
Ginger Rogers, longtime partner of Fred Astaire, said working with Berlin in 
the 1935 film "Top Hat" was "like heaven." Morton Gould, president of the 
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, said Berlin's works are 
"part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul." Former 
President Ronald Reagan expressed his sorrow in a statement that called the 
composer "a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred 
millions, and will live on forever." John Wallowitch, who had organized 
Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan townhouse for more than two 
decades, said he and three friends went to the home after Berlin's death. 
Wallowitch said: "We just stood there and cried a lot and sang: 'I'll be loving 
you always.' "

 -- Two rare books written or printed by Benjamin Franklin were stolen from the 
University of Pennsylvania library, police said. Franklin printed "A Sermon on 
Education," by Richard Peters, in 1751. It includes a pamphlet by Franklin 
called "An Idea of an English School" and is worth $10,000. The second book, "A 
Log of Books to Be Sold," was written by Franklin in 1744 and is worth between 
$25,000 and $50,000. DAVE JOHNSON
