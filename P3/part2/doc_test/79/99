FT  21 MAY 93 / Management: The Major problem with quiet leadership

VISIONARY, charismatic, inspirational, extrovert, relentlessly energetic and
assertive, even autocratic and arrogant. That, in a cliche-clad nutshell, is
most people's picture of the effective leader, whether in politics, the
military, or business.
Consider a representative list of such leaders: Churchill, Kennedy, De
Gaulle, Thatcher, Montgomery, MacArthur, Alfred Sloan, Jack Welch, Lee
Iacocca, John Harvey-Jones, Anita Roddick.
But what about Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman? To quote the
inimitable Peter Drucker, they were singularly effective yet 'possessed no
more charisma than a dead mackerel'. Nor, in the usually accepted sense of
the word (charisma, not mackerel), did Abraham Lincoln, Clement Attlee -
Britain's first post-war prime minister - or Konrad Adenauer. In our day the
same goes, for such manifestly successful and 'transformational' business
leaders as Donald Petersen, ex-chairman of worldwide Ford, Geoffrey Whalen
of British Peugeot-Talbot, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher (UK
Woolworths) and - arguably - Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters.
All are shy and at best are average communicators on a public platform. Some
are downright grey: the remarkably successful Mulcahy has been dubbed
'Mogadon Man'. Most are keener to listen and consult than to hold forth and
believe strongly in team leadership.
Which brings us to the unfortunate and accident-prone John Major, Britain's
nice prime minister. Over the past fortnight he has been vilified as never
before - for possessing what appear, at first sight, to be similar
characteristics and style of my second group of heroes.
How come the paradox? Does what works in business fall flat in politics? Or
is Major a Petersen or Mulcahy in the making, if only his critics will get
off his back?
Sadly for Major, he is less similar to the second cast-list than his
admirers might think. The most obvious contrast is with Hogg.
Hogg may be 'ultra-cerebral and terribly reserved' as a UK academic puts it,
and he certainly inclines to consensus rather than assertive
leadership-from-the-front. Yet he conforms completely to a description of
outstanding leaders given by Peter Senge, a US academic expert on the
subject. Rather than conventional charisma, 'What distinguishes them is the
clarity and persuasiveness of their ideas, the depth of their commitment and
their openness to continually learning more,' says Senge. 'They instil
confidence in those around them.'
To some extent, Whalen and Mulcahy also fit this picture. They may be
reticent, but at the same time their manifest drive and sense of strategic
direction - even if not quite a vision in the usual sense - create a sort of
charisma, at least among close colleagues.
Petersen had that too, but also something rather different. His 'vision' was
as much to do with reforming Ford's internal structures and processes -
creating what he called 'a teamwork dynamo' - as with achieving distinction
in the US car market, though he did that in spades. Every account of his
tenure during Ford's remarkable revival in the 1980s stresses his collegial,
listening, and 'enabling' style.
In theory, that makes Petersen the closest parallel to John Major - or,
rather, to the way Major tries to operate. Which brings us to what academics
would call the 'systems differences' between political and business
leadership.
Andrew Kakabadse, a Cranfield professor who studies business leadership in
nine countries, boils the usual long list of key attributes down to three:
'visioning'; good communications; and a 'team orientation'.
Visioning involves a degree of creativity, but also the ability to make
sense of immense 'systems detail', he says. Communications must be
consistently excellent, both internally and externally. Teamwork is more a
matter of open, thorough dialogue, than whether the final decision is taken
by consensus or autocratically.
Few leadership experts would score Major highly on clarity and consistency
of vision. Most would agree with Philip Sadler, the former head of Ashridge
Management College, that Major's goals are 'unstrung beads'. They lack the
unifying thread which a good business leader finds vital.
On the second attribute, communications, Major has demonstrably failed to
perform. Unlike reticent chief executives, who can delegate much of their
external relations downwards to specialists, or upwards to an extrovert
chairman, political leaders are only as effective as their own ability to
communicate.
It is a moot point whether Major deserves a high score on the third key
attribute, teamwork, in spite of his belief in it. Given the poor quality of
so many of his government's decisions and subsequent climbdowns - or
inconsistent refusals to compromise - it is far from clear that he is
stimulating a sufficiently thorough team dialogue. Moreover, instead of
allowing his more headstrong colleagues to take ill-considered decisions, he
should, in common with Attlee or Petersen, show he has the steel to overrule
them from time to time.
In politics as well as business, leaders who want to have staying power must
tailor their style to changing situations. At US General Electric, Jack
Welch has done that, becoming more consultative than a decade ago. Thatcher
could not recognise or accept the need and suffered the consequences.
In Major's case the question may be more whether a halfway adequate manager
can transform himself into someone who, however quietly, can galvanise
others into cohesive action. Mulcahy had a decade to do so, Petersen two.
Major has no such luxury.
