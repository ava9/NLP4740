VOLATILE SOVIET SITUATION NEEDS NO 'HELP' FROM OUTSIDERS 
</P>

Early in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln wrote Horace Greeley that "my paramount 
object . . . is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy 
slavery." 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position on the crisis in the Soviet Union's minority 
republics is similar to Lincoln's in 1862. "Perestroika," he said, "is not 
breaking up the national structure of the country. We are against that." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln failed to hold the Union together. Gorbachev's present policy will fail 
to keep the Soviet Union together, too, unless he backs it up with brute force. 
Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people in five non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union have been 
in ferment for months. Georgians, and before them Latvians, Estonians, 
Lithuanians and Armenians have all taken their complaints against Moscow out on 
the streets. Troops have been called in twice, and there has been bloodshed, 
most recently in Tbilisi. It has been easy for the Kremlin to paint all this as 
the work of ethnic hotheads out to settle a score with Moscow or with other 
national groups. A Kremlin spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said as much, 
adding disdainfully "they have no program." 
</P>
<P>
But what are they really after? The question is the more complex since these 
are the Soviet Union's five richest republics. By comparison, Russians live 
like paupers. And herein lies the problem. Knowing they can live better in the 
non-Russian republics, Russians by the millions have flocked to them. 
Naturally, the non-Russians object, especially when their native language 
disappears from street signs and in schools through a process of Russification. 
The "ethnic" component of their program is thus to preserve their language and 
culture by reversing the influx of Russians. 
</P>
<P>
Their other concerns are equally pointed. Members of several of the Soviet 
nationalities believe that the Russians are draining them economically. All 
want the benefit of trade with the Russian market but they also demand greater 
control of their local economies so they will not be forced to sell goods to 
Moscow at artificially low prices. To gain this control, they demand greater 
home-rule. Independent political movements have sprung up in all five republics 
to press for rule by elected representatives of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these political groups are socialist, others anti-socialist. Still 
others are composed of factions from both sides. All, however, stand for 
expanded civil rights, including freedom of speech, assembly, religion and the 
press. All seek an independent judiciary. All are convinced, too, that only a 
multiparty system can protect these rights in their land. 
</P>
<P>
The tactics used by these embryonic parties go far beyond yelling in the 
streets. Nearly all the candidates they backed in the recent national elections 
won. Now they are organizing for regional and local elections, scheduled for 
autumn. The parties issue position papers and newsletters. Most are organizing 
down to what we call the precinct level. At the same time, they maintain close 
ties not only with movements in other non-Russian republics but with 
sympathizers among the independent Popular Front and Democratic Front 
organizations in Russia proper. The Baltic states are even building ties abroad 
-- Latvia with Sweden, Lithuania with Poland and Estonia with Finland and 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
What do these movements really want from Moscow? Some in each group want to 
exercise the right to secede from the Soviet Union, as guaranteed in the Soviet 
constitution. Most, however, would settle for less. After all, geography will 
link their fate to their Russian neighbor whatever political arrangements may 
exist between them. Given this, most stop short of advocating disunion, calling 
instead for a loose federation in which all rights not explicitly assigned to 
Moscow remain with the local republics. 
</P>
<P>
Given the programs and tactics of the national movements, Gorbachev's brusque 
effort to stonewall them is puzzling. Moscow has taken no steps to mollify or 
co-opt the home-rule movements, let alone to introduce a true system of 
federalism that would meet their demands. There are many successful models of 
such a system, including more than a few schemes devised by Russians during the 
century before Lenin took power. Gorbachev has ignored them. In the absence of 
such measures, radicalization is proceeding apace, both in the Caucasus and the 
Baltic regions. Increasingly, the minority republics are a tinderbox that could 
be ignited by the smallest spark. 
</P>
<P>
What position should the United States take on all this? Americans naturally 
respond with sympathy to the image of democratic Davids taking potshots at the 
Russian Goliath who thwarts their self-determination. But the dangers of 
outsiders -- even well intentioned ones -- toying with so volatile a situation 
are huge. No one can foresee whether events will lead to a crackdown from 
Moscow or to the institution of new constitutional structures that protect 
pluralism. One thing is for sure. An explosion would prove as disastrous for 
further reform in the Soviet Union as a whole as the bloody rebellion of 
Russia's Polish subjects in 1863 did for the "Great Reforms" being instituted 
at that time by Czar Alexander II. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has no interest in fanning chaos in the Soviet Union. 
Instability there would slow or stop reforms that are changing totalitarian 
rule. It would make the Soviet Union a less reliable partner in efforts to 
resolve conflicts in the Third World. It would reduce Soviet interest in arms 
control, and hence hurt our efforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Far better would be to maintain our present policy favoring measured, 
controlled change in the Soviet Union. This means keeping up steady contact 
with authorities in Moscow and, informally, with public movements in the 
republics. It means exercising patience and a willingness to look beyond 
short-term excesses that might be committed either by Gorbachev or by the 
various national movements. Above all, it means suppressing our national 
passion for "getting involved." In the end, we cannot resolve this grave 
dispute among neighbors.
