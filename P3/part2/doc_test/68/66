Hungary yesterday hardened its opposition to international action against
the Serbs, saying it would bar overflights by Nato surveillance aircraft in
the event of an air strike against Bosnian Serb positions.
Awacs airborne radar aircraft have been flying over Hungary since late 1992,
but the Budapest Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Hungary had agreed to
overflights only for aircraft monitoring the no-fly zone over Bosnia.
'Awacs aircraft cannot be present in Hungarian airspace if it (an attack)
takes place, that is natural,' Mr Peter Boross, the Hungarian prime
minister, said yesterday. 'Hungary will not take part. We have to live with
Serbia and the Serbian people for hundreds more years.'
Mr Boross also said that sanctions against Serbia were ineffective, adding
to bitter government complaints that the embargo had cost Hungary Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), for which the international community had failed to make
compensation.
Mr Boross's statement, which western diplomats described as a 'departure',
coincides with a warming in Hungary's relations with Serbia. At the end of
January, Mr Geza Jeszenszky, the Hungarian foreign minister, met President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade. Hungary said it was taking a
'pragmatic' approach to relations with Serbia, but Belgrade hailed the visit
as a breakthrough in bilateral relations.
Hungary maintains that its policy is unchanged and strenuously denies the
suggestion that it is breaking ranks with the international community to
conclude a separate tacit arrangement with Serbia.
The Foreign Ministry said Hungary was seeking integration into western
institutions and could not risk its 'clean record and credibility'.
A rapprochement with Serbia, however, would ease the plight of the 400,000
ethnic Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Hungary fears they
are vulnerable to 'silent ethnic cleansing'.
Budapest has also asked Serbia to allow shipping to travel unhindered down
the Danube to guarantee landlocked Hungary's vital waterway access to the
Black Sea.
