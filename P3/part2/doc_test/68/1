The holidays are a traditional time of giving, not only to our friends and 
family but to those we consider less fortunate than we. We receive the usual 
requests to help the hungry and homeless during this time of celebration, and 
we respond with our predictable annual generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this holiday pattern reinforces the thinking that we can make 
occasional gestures of good will and support but cannot have a real, lasting 
impact in the lives of the estimated 350,000 hungry men, women and children in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Through an unprecedented collaborative effort by ABC, NBC, CBS and the End 
Hunger Network, we all have an unusual and timely opportunity this holiday 
season. 
</P>

While all of us abhor hunger and homelessness in our affluent county, very few 
of us recognize the critical difference our own individual action will make. 
That is the focus of the seven prime time network television shows 
participating in "Prime Time to End Hunger." This extraordinary project which 
starts Monday involves seven of the top prime time programs: "Designing Women," 
"thirtysomething," "Head of the Class," "Jake and the Fatman," "The Cosby 
Show," "Cheers" and "Golden Girls." The episodes during this week will be about 
hunger, homelessness, poverty, and illiteracy, with the emphasis being on the 
impact of volunteerism on these local, national and global problems. 
</P>
<P>
The very existence of this partnership between such fierce competitors as the 
three television networks is a demonstration of a new mood in our nation. It is 
becoming a priority to do something that will make a difference in and for our 
communities. Hopefully viewers will share this commitment as Prime Time goes 
beyond entertainment and education in our daily lives and asks that we act. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each program viewers can call a 900 number announced by the 
show's celebrities. Orange County respondents will receive an Ending Hunger 
Handbook, customized with volunteer opportunities at local organizations. This 
is made possible by another unimaginable partnership between AT&amp;T, MCI and 
Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
The triads of network television stations and telecommunications companies are 
examples of the unpredictable alliances that occur when solving a complex 
problem becomes a priority. Our history books are filled with other examples of 
the leadership, creativity, unexpected support and accomplishment that is 
called forth by a priority being created. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally and globally public opinion is on the move; ending world hunger is 
becoming a priority. President Bush, on Oct. 25, held a press conference to 
encourage Americans to watch the Prime Time to End Hunger shows on television 
this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
No one is fooled into believing that ending hunger, globally or just here in 
Orange County, will be simple or easy. Hunger is a complex issue that can be 
discussed in terms of a variety of "ologies", "ics" and "isms": sociology, 
psychology, ecology, politics, economics, racism, communism and socialism. 
Hunger has plagued mankind for as long as we have been organized as 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to end it. How? Not by feeding people endlessly at soup 
kitchens or in famine camps. To end it sustainably, we must provide hungry 
people with the opportunities they need to end their own hunger. If any 
community has the resources to provide the opportunities hungry people need, we 
do. It is only for the lack of a priority that 17% of our neighbors struggle 
for adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Is the problem of hunger complex? Undoubtedly. Is the solution to hunger 
complicated? Without question hungry people need a wide variety of 
opportunities to end their hunger, some more difficult to provide than others. 
This is why hunger will be ended only when we have made it our priority, and 
express that priority with our time as well as our money. What better time to 
do that than on the eve of the last decade of the 20th Century?
