<TEXT>
<P>
The collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe is stirring hopes and fears in 
Austria, which for nearly 40 years has seen itself as a neutral bridge between 
East and West. 
</P>
<P>
The hope for new economic and cultural opportunities as the artificial postwar 
barriers dissolve is tempered by fears among Austrians of an unmanageable 
influx from their eastern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The government is also weighing how the reshaping of the Continent's economic 
map will affect its own top foreign policy objective -- steering Austria into 
the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Franz Vranitsky reflected the optimistic school of thought in an 
ebullient New Year message to his 7.5 million countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
"In one stroke, the expression 'country in the heart of Europe' does not just 
have a geographic sense but gains a political, economic and cultural 
dimension," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected the idea that Austria might be some form of political 
hermaphrodite. 
</P>
<P>
"It is often said Austria lies politically between East and West. That is 
false. In a political sense Austria belongs to the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Economically it does, too, with trade dominated by exchanges with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although Vienna and the Czech city of Bratislava were once linked by a tram 
line, the Austrian capital has become effectively the terminus of West European 
rail and road links. 
</P>
<P>
Austria is the only country from which Soviet troops actually withdrew after 
World War II and, unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, it has 
maintained its multiparty democracy, free press and largely private economy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the government applied to join the European Community, which it 
considers vital if it is not to be shut out of the single European Community 
market after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But, reflecting a line in the national anthem that the country is "like a 
strong heart at the center of the region," it has taken its pivotal role 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Austria is the host for several East-West security conferences, a United 
Nations headquarters and other institutions and it is arranging -- with Hungary 
-- a World Exhibition in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Michael Lingens, publisher of the weekly magazine Wochenpresse, spoke of 
a potential for Viennese culture to recapture the glories of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, when it drew inspiration from Prague and Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
The end of Communist control and opening up of borders across the region "offer 
us the greatest opportunities since the collapse of the monarchy (in 1918)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not because, as some people may imagine, we could again become the center of a 
great world empire but because Austria could re-emerge as a cultural power in 
the world," once again drawing on its diverse roots across the region. 
</P>
<P>
While political commentators waxed lyrical about the chances for the Alpine 
state, the response within the overwhelmingly bourgeois society, which has 
grown rich while its Communist neighbors languished, has been ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
As tens of thousands of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles and East Germans 
took advantage of new freedoms to take a peek inside the well-stocked stores of 
Vienna's consumer society, many in the capital became defensive and possessive. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll showed that 63% of Viennese found the peaceful invasion across 
the dismantled Iron Curtain unwelcome and only 22% said they felt good about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Warm-hearted gestures to offer free transportation and theater tickets to their 
less well-off Eastern visitors drew angry protests from some Viennese, who 
complained of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that we don't exactly have a great sensitivity for historic 
moments," said public opinion researcher Rudolf Bretschneider. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vienna telephone directory is dominated by non-German names and 
many of the city's 1.5 million people are themselves refugees from Communist 
countries, resentment toward foreigners from the East is always near the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
A Polish woman in her 30s who has lived in Vienna for more than four years was 
told sharply by a native Viennese during a dispute over a parking place: "Go 
back to your homeland." 
</P>
<P>
A special Cabinet session on the anti-Communist revolution at Austria's 
northern, southern and eastern borders confirmed that the country should retain 
its role as a transit and asylum country but tighten its checks on illegal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many politicians, including Vranitsky, believe that Austria, with its stability 
and economic success, could be taken as a model by the East Bloc states as they 
rebuild their economies. 
</P>
<P>
"We, too, had to start from nothing (after World War II), and today we receive 
general recognition and respect for our neutrality, our political freedom, our 
economic success and our social security system," the chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
Other commentators, such as veteran conservative politician Erhard Busek, who 
has long cultivated central European links, was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Although Busek saw an opportunity for Austria to assert itself as a key player 
in the heart of Europe, he warned of the danger of the German-speaking country 
being viewed as "a third German state" or an historic part of the German 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
He also referred to half-joking assessments that Austria, much of whose heavy 
industry and banking is at least part state-owned, could itself become "the 
last East Bloc country" if it did not bring in economic and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned specifically the immense social and economic power of the two big 
political parties -- the Socialists and the conservative People's Party -- and 
the monopoly of the state broadcasting system.
