  [Text] Beginning Tuesday Viktor Luchin, a judge on Russia's 
Constitutional Court [CC], has announced a hunger strike due to 
the unwillingness of the Constitutional Court's judges to make 
any decision regarding his authority, Luchin's consultant 
Mikhail Moyseyenko reported to Interfax. 
  The authority of Viktor Luchin, as well as that of Valeriy 
Zorkin, was suspended December 1, 1993, due to accusations of 
political activity, which is inadmissible for CC judges. In 
particular, Luchin was accused of his participation in the 
congresses of Russia's communist party, at the congress of 
former People's Deputies, and in the election campaign waged 
last autumn. However, last November 15 Luchin removed his 
candidacy from lists of the Agrarian party, and there have been 
no congresses of the communist party or former People's Deputies 
of the USSR in the course of the previous year. Luchin believes 
that there are no grounds to suspend his authority. 
  According to Moyseyenko, Luchin intends to continue his 
hunger strike until the court passes a decision. As far as 
Valeriy Zorkin is concerned, he disapproves Luchin's decision, 
reported Moyseyenko.
