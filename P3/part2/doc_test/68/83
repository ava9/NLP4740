<F P=106> [Article by David Fink: "Wiretaps Restricted by New </F>
Law--Parliament to Reform Law Enforcement Rules"] 
  [Text] For the first time in Hungary's history, police will 
need a judge's permission before placing a wiretap on a 
suspect's telephone or engaging in undercover sting operations. 
  The new laws are part of sweeping legislation agreed to this 
week that is designed to establish a legal framework for law 
enforcement activities in postcommunist Hungary. Agreed to after 
months of debate, the proposed law attempts to balance a respect 
for civil liberties with a need to create an effective police 
force able to combat a growing crime problem. 
  "It is a philosophical dispute," said Hungarian Democratic 
Forum MP Fabian Jozsa, under secretary in the Interior Ministry. 
Conservatives had sought to give more police more authority, 
while liberals fought for more individual liberties. 
  The compromise is viewed by many analysts as a step forward, 
bringing Hungary in line with Western law enforcement standards. 
  Law enforcement is an issue that many emerging democracies 
are grappling with. Under communism, Hungary and other Soviet 
bloc countries were virtually police states, where laws 
regulating wiretaps or sting operations were secret. In other 
words, police had extraordinary powers and citizens had little 
recourse. 
  After the political changes, police were confused about 
their 
roles and had difficulty in dealing with crime without specific 
guidelines. The proposed legislation will also set parameters 
for a variety of undercover operations, such as setting up dummy 
companies, opening mail and conducting secret searches. 
  Government and opposition MP's clashed over how best to 
control police activities. The government, taking a tougher 
law-and-order approach, originally argued that prosecutors 
should be able to authorize secret actions. But the liberal 
position, court authorization for wiretaps, prevailed. 
  The bill requires a two-thirds majority to pass since it 
deals with basic rights. The bill could be passed as early as 
February. 
  The legislation also attempts to decentralize police 
control, 
but in a very limited way. During the communist era, the police 
force was tightly controlled by the national government and 
local authorities had virtually no police powers. 
  The bill would maintain the national police force, but would 
give local towns and villages the ability to control police 
services and personnel within the local areas. For example, 
local governments could obtain specific services and additional 
personnel by paying the national police for them. 
  Opposition MPs sought to give self-governments the authority 
to select local police commanders, but the government rejected 
that proposal. 
  "This could bring a political influence into the police," 
Jozsa said.
