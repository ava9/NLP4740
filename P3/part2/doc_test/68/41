  [Excerpts] Some 6,000 Palestinian prisoners serving 
sentences in Israeli prisons and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
lock-up facilities have declared a hunger strike starting 
tomorrow and until further notice to protest the fact that they 
are not being released from jail. The leaders of the prisoners 
called on the inhabitants of the territories to boycott the 
celebrations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival and to hoist black 
flags on the day of his visit in solidarity with the prisoners. 
Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin Amir recording] The Palestinian prisoners decided to 
overtly fight the Israeli decision not to release them from jail 
and to protest the way Palestinian leaders have been dealing 
with their case. The leaders of the prisoners announced through 
the Palestinian Prisoner Club in Bethlehem that all the 
prisoners will go on a hunger strike tomorrow and called on the 
inhabitants of the territories to help them in their struggle. 
'Isa Karaki, head of the club, said the relatives of the 
prisoners will stage a demonstration outside the gates of the 
al-Aqsa camp in Jericho this coming Friday in solidarity with 
the prisoners. He added that the prisoners, including Fatah 
members, called on the inhabitants of the territories not to 
take part in the celebrations the day of 'Arafat's visit to 
Jericho, which may take place on 2 July. [passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that at least 1,300 Palestinian prisoners 
were given the choice to get out of prison by virtue of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, but they refused to sign a declaration 
that they recognize the agreement and undertake not to use 
violence against the peace process. [end recording]
