  [Text] The street clashes that took place yesterday have 
ended and there will be no demonstrations in La Paz today. 
Moreover, the hunger strike sponsored by the COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] is beginning to lose strength. 
  Health workers reached an agreement with the government 
yesterday for a 12 percent salary increase for this sector. 
Thus, their hunger strike has ended. Approximately 600 people 
throughout the country returned home happy after several days on 
a voluntary hunger strike. This will cause difficulties for the 
COB in view of the possibility that other sectors follow suit, 
thus weakening the united struggle. Right now the COB is holding 
a nationwide meeting to assess the situation. 
  [Begin unidentified COB representative recording] The 
nationwide meeting will assess the current state of events and 
decide what course the conflict will follow in view of the 
prospects of a solution. I want to point out that during last 
night's meeting, the COB reiterated its willingness to 
negotiate. We are aware that this conflict must be solved for 
the country's sake. The solution is in the government's hands. 
[end recording] 
  It is quite likely that during today's meeting, the COB 
might 
decide to suspend street demonstrations as a sign of its 
willingness to negotiate.
