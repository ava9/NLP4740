  [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Criticism of the Slovak 
Government by Miklos Duray, one of the Hungarian minority 
leaders, was today rejected by chairman of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) Deputies' Club, Milan Ftacnik. 
  "(Ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar and Duray need each other," 
Ftacnik said, commenting on the Egyutteles chairman's accusation 
this weekend that Jozef Moravcik's government was not fulfilling 
its promises towards the Hungarian parties. The SDL is part of 
the coalition government. 
  Ftacnik denied the "endless speculations about the existence 
of secret agreements" with Hungarian parties which the present 
cabinet had allegedly concluded in return for a promise of 
support from these parties. 
  The undertakings which the Moravcik government made when it 
arose were part of its manifesto, and were being fulfilled, 
Ftacnik said. Proof of this was the passing of the law on 
personal names last week by the Slovak Parliament (which allows 
Hungarians to register their names in the Hungarian form and not 
to use the ending -ova for womens' surnames) and the fact that 
on Wednesday [1 June] the "signpost law" on the bilingual names 
of towns and villages is to be passed. Other issues which the 
coalition government had promised to solve by the end of its 
temporary term were being worked on, Ftacnik said. 
  However, at the weekend Duray had accused the government of 
hesitation over the promised approval of the European charter of 
local autonomies and minority languages. 
  Ftacnik countered today that the government had only 
undertaken to create conditions for the future implementation of 
these norms. "The agreement did not read 'approve' but 'create 
conditions for'. It is unreasonable to tie a future government 
to models with which it would not necessarily agree," he said. 
  On another demand of the Hungarian minority leaders, that a 
law be passed on the transfer of property with no known 
restituent into the ownership of the community, Ftacnik 
commented that it was "at first sight sympathetic and 
democratic," but that there could be no debate on it without the 
consequences of such a law first being analysed.
