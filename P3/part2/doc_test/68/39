RIOT police clubbed four women unconscious and fired shots into the air in
Nairobi's central Uhuru (Independence) Park to disperse a group of women
hunger-strikers and several hundred supporters, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Witnesses said police waded into the group of about 50 women - many of them
mothers of prisoners - who began a hunger strike on Friday with an appeal to
Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, to release 52 people they say are in
jail for political offences.
AP adds: New US development aid to Kenya has ended under US legislation
which halts all but food aid to countries six months late on loan payments.
