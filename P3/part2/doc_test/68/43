  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Council for National Security of Mongolia has discussed the 
current political situation established due to the hunger strike 
at the D. Suhbaatar and Erh Choloonii Squares and their possible 
aftermath and taken a decision in this connection which provides 
for that it would be expedient to keep the Great State Hural 
informed about the political situation settled in the country 
with hearing during its discussion at the parliament's session 
of the demands put forth by those participating in the hunger 
strikes. 
  Then it goes on to say that the demands by the participants 
of the hunger strike at the Suhbaatar Square are not to be 
accepted as being groundless. Taking into account that the 
hunger strike and the following political crisis might be of 
adverse consequences for the national interests the council 
considers it is necessary to call upon the hunger strikers to 
stop their actions. 
  Then the council also recommended to submit for 
consideration 
to the Great State Hural for approval the draft law on 
procedures of holding demonstrations and meetings. 
  In this connection it is thought to be necessary to work out 
in immediate future proper law on the press and until its coming 
into force it recommended to the government to carry on the 
radio and television "Tribune of Political Parties" programme as 
well as to settle urgently all the topical issues of concern to 
be regulated in terms of the press.
