<F P=106> [By Silvio J. Mendiandua: "Visit by Carlos Salinas Will </F>
Strengthen Cuban-Mexican Relations"] 
  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (PL) -- Mexican Ambassador to Havana 
Carlos Tello said here today Mexican President Carlos Salinas' 
visit to Cuba will strengthen relations between the two 
countries, and as a result, new forms of cooperation may emerge 
and current programs of cooperation may be strengthened. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Mexican diplomat 
said: Salinas is expected to arrive on 13 June and will stay on 
the island for 24 hours, and his presence here will be further 
evidence of the strength and solidity of our relations. 
  Tello, who began his mission in this capital this year, 
affirmed: The talks between Salinas and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro will produce new ideas and initiatives for promoting 
bilateral exchanges. 
  The ambassador said the two leaders will discuss in general 
political, economic, cultural, and commercial relations during 
their dialogue as well as programs of scientific and 
technological cooperation, all of which have been developing in 
a firm and cooperative manner. 
  He said: No specific agreement is expected to result from 
this encounter, because negotiations between the two countries 
on issues of economic or commercial interest are so fluid and 
dynamic that agreements may be signed at any moment, not 
necessarily during a visit. 
  He recalled that in recent years Mexico's presidents had 
visited the island during their respective administrations: 
Luis Echeverria (1975); Jose Lopez Portillo (1980); Miguel de 
la Madrid (1988); and now Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  To reciprocate, he said, Cuban President Fidel Castro had 
visited Mexico on three occasions during the past five years. 
These exchanges at the highest level are a direct and 
straightforward way of manifesting the solidity of relations, he 
said 
  Tello also mentioned the recent visit to Mexico of U.S. 
Democratic Representative Robert Torricelli, who has meddled in 
the domestic affairs of Cuba and Mexico and who was told during 
his visit to Mexico of the independent nature of the foreign 
policy of the country of the Aztecs and Mayas. 
  Torricelli is the author of the bill, which the U.S. 
Congress 
later approved, that establishes a tightening of the economic 
blockade against the largest of the Antillean islands. 
  The Mexican ambassador said his country's foreign policy is 
a 
state, not a government, policy and one of its main permanent 
principles is recognizing the people's right to 
self-determination. 
  In another part of the interview, Tello revealed the Mexican 
Government team that will organize Salinas' visit with Cuban 
officials will arrive in Havana today. 
  Ambassador Ricardo Ampudia, director general of the Mexican 
Foreign Secretariat Protocol Office, will head the Foreign 
Policy Cabinet, which the Mexicans call these advisers, which 
will include a group of individuals from various backgrounds 
that will decide between today and 8 June the agenda of the 
visit. 
  Salinas' visit on 13 June, the day before the beginning of 
the meeting of the Ibero-American presidents, is a way of 
manifesting solidarity with Cuba, Tello said. 
  Tello also revealed that during the summit, the chiefs of 
state of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela will sign a free trade 
agreement. Mexico has signed similar documents with Chile, Costa 
Rica, Canada, and the United States, and it is negotiating 
others with the Central American countries.
