<F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Garcia from "The Nation Radio Newspaper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The National Police [PN] confirmed this afternoon 
that two people have died and two others were seriously injured, 
all Hondurans. A police report states the dead as Carlos Mejia 
and an unidentified Honduran woman, and the injured as Hondurans 
Abel and Lorena Dubon Pazos. 
  The tragic accident occurred 7 km on the Northern Highway, 
which was blocked by a bus belonging to the Unidos 
Transportation Cooperative, license plate GB-0109. The bus was 
participating in a three-day-old strike called by transportation 
personnel against the Chamorro administration. The name of the 
bus' owner that caused the fatal accident is still unknown. 
  Commander Franco Montealegre, PN inspector general, 
presented 
a final count of those arrested in the wake of violent 
disturbances involving transportation carriers, which started 
early today and lasted until noon today at the PN Station No. 6, 
when the relatives of those arrested opposed their transfer to 
police installations. The police leader reported 206 arrested so 
far. He added that 19 minors, between the ages of 13 and 14 
years old, were released. 
  The cooperatives with the largest number of arrested members 
are: the 2 August Cooperative with 12; Jorge Salazar 
Cooperative, 22; Ricardo Morales Cooperative, 31; (Arlensiu) 
Cooperative, 36; and Democratic Efforts Cooperative, 20. The 
police report states that 12 of those arrested do not belong to 
a cooperative. 
  Commander Montealegre categorically denied that the police 
fired on the relatives of those arrested at noon today at the PN 
Station No. 6. He also denied the police attacked media 
representatives: 
  [Begin Montealegre recording] [Words indistinct] it is said 
they used excessive force. Quite the contrary, they faced heavy 
resistance during the operation [words indistinct] there are no 
injures, as they claim. That is, the police acted prudently. The 
police acted in a legitimate fashion. The transportation 
carriers' actions [words indistinct] they violate the rights of 
others. [end recording] 
  There are still roadblocks in front of the Sandinist 
Barrales-Vallejo Cooperative headquarters at this time. A police 
cordon, which was established about 100 meters from the 
roadblock erected by the Sandinist cooperative, is still in 
place. The military controls the main roads. Police checkpoints 
are still in place, and groups of transportation strikers are 
still picketing the area.
