<F P=106> [From Herman Allan Padgett's "Radio Column" segment] </F>
  [Text] Since yesterday there have been commentaries on the 
news that the military sector of the executive branch plans to 
denounce the reciprocal military assistance agreement that our 
country signed with the United States several years ago. Two 
protocols were added to it, but as far as we know, the National 
Congress of Honduras never ratified them. 
  Before we say anything else, we must point out that this is 
not the Armed Forces' prerogative. The president of the Republic 
is the leader of our foreign policy; he should establish the 
country's policy, which should then be implemented by the 
foreign relations minister. The sovereign National Congress has 
the power to approve or reject international treaties and 
agreements. 
  We do not know if President Reina is interested in seeing 
the 
end of military aid to our country and the departure of U.S. 
troops and U.S. advisers and military observers in our Armed 
Forces and the police. 
  President Reina was interviewed on the presence of U.S. 
troops at Palmerola, but he did not give any direct answers. You 
might even say he purposefully evaded that question, which leads 
us to think that--at least at the time that he was asked the 
question--he had neither considered the issue nor established 
any criteria for it. 
  Hondurans grows less interested in military matters every 
day, so they would not miss U.S. military aid. One could 
predict, however, that the Washington administration would have 
a negative reaction toward other issues in which Honduras is 
certainly interested. 
  Although U.S. aid to Honduras, the rest of Latin America, 
and 
the world has decreased in the past few years, it is still 
significant in relative terms. We must say that all U.S. aid to 
our countries is given under very strict conditions. In our 
particular case, we would dare say that we have never felt more 
dependent or more colonized by the United States than in the 
past 15 days. 
  This peaceful colonization of Honduras by the United States 
has been felt more strongly since the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall and the unexpected fall of Soviet imperialism. There is 
virtually no aspect of national life for which the United States 
has not established guidelines for us; in fact, it even demands 
specific behavior from us. 
  Following the military assistance treaty that brought the 
Nicaraguan contras here and forced the Honduran Government to 
lease our territory--with all the ominous consequences that we 
are still suffering--the agents of Washington have infiltrated 
every institution in order to direct their policies, programs, 
and objectives. 
  The pretext has been to supervise the correct use of funds 
granted by Washington to those institutions and programs. Thus 
the report drafted by two aides of Senator Helms is untrue and 
humiliating. There has been an attempt to pass this report off 
as coming from the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The 
report reflects the U.S. complaint that Honduras denies justice 
to U.S. citizens, who are supposedly the subject of unlawful 
expropriations. 
  In the next few days we will talk a little more about the 
report drafted by two of Sen. Helms's employees, who came here 
and also visited Nicaragua, although they did not do any on-site 
investigations. They went back with data, gossip, and 
speculation that interested parties in Honduras reportedly 
provided them during their visit to our territory. 
  It was nothing serious or concrete, but it was indeed 
harmful 
and slanderous to Honduras' international image. Based on those 
alleged expropriations, none of which has been specifically 
brought before our country's judicial branch or based on legal 
grounds, the threat of cutting all aid to Honduras is being made 
again. In fact, authorities and citizens of Islas de la Bahia 
have already had their U.S. visas revoked as punishment for 
defending our country's island possessions from the illegal 
ambitions of U.S. citizens. 
  In short, if it were not for the military agreement, other 
kinds of aid would be used to subject Honduras and its 
government to the constant humiliation that constitutes an open 
assault on our national sovereignty. We cannot defend ourselves 
adequately because we are a small, poor, and weak country. 
  On top of this report drafted by Sen. Helms's staff, there 
are a number of complaints about alleged acts of corruption 
committed with the aid granted by Washington. If such acts of 
corruption have indeed been committed, this corruption would 
have necessarily involved the complicity of U.S. agents who are 
present in every government office and program to supervise 
expenditures and the management of the money. 
  By virtue of the operational funds granted by U.S. AID, AID 
personnel are in the judicial branch, the Public Health 
Ministry, the police, the Comptroller General's Office, and the 
Council of Private Enterprise, and it even has its hands in the 
labor movement under the pretext of conducting training. 
  We do not yet know the basic reasons behind the Honduran 
military's plan to reject the military agreement, given that 
U.S. officials have served as some sort of demigods to our men 
in uniform. They were constantly present and worshipped by all 
units at countless ceremonies and parties. 
  We do know, however, that Pentagon and CIA relations with 
Honduran servicemen have not fared well during the tenure of 
Ambassador Crescencio Arcos. Arcos had frequent and notorious 
confrontations with our military hierarchy. Arcos planted the 
seed here for a systematic campaign against the Honduran Armed 
Forces. 
  Crescencio Arcos coined the phrase--or, perhaps, he 
plagiarized--that in Honduras justice only bites those who are 
barefoot. His open meddling in Honduran domestic affairs clearly 
proved that the United States has assumed worldwide leadership 
and a hegemonical role to control not only the economies and 
armies but also the day-to-day life in our countries. 
  There is imperial Caesarism in Washington following the 
death 
of ideological bipolarism--a death that was rung in by the 
collapse of the Soviet Empire. Since then, clocks in Washington 
have been used to set time for everyone else in the world, and 
the peoples of the world, especially those in the Third World, 
remain helpless because they can do nothing but lower their 
heads in resignation or expose themselves to being beleaguered 
by extreme economic reprisals, diplomatic isolation, and blatant 
international ostracism. 
  We are poor because we are poor, and hunger--as our 
grandparents used to say--is a poor adviser.
