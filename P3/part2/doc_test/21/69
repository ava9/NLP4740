<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National </F>
Assembly of the People's Government, by special correspondents 
Blanche Petrich, Josexto Zaldua, and Emilio Lomas at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias on 14 June] 
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 15 Jun -- Not as good 
as Guadalajara in 1991, but not as bad, either. Evaluating 
Cuba's performance at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP], concluded that "our satisfaction is 
greater" because we were able to overcome more significant 
threats than before. 
  One threat to Cuban diplomacy is the shadow cast by the 
Clinton administration's initiative to hold a hemispheric summit 
in Miami at the end of this year with all the continent's heads 
of state except Cuba's. 
  On this occasion, the threat took the name and shape of a 
woman, Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to the OAS, who 
yesterday appeared in the president's session hall sitting very 
seriously beside Rosario Green, Mexican under secretary to the 
United Nations. According to Alarcon, Babbitt was able to "slip 
in," but her presence neither annoyed nor cheered the Cubans. 
"Just as long as she knows how to conduct herself," he commented 
sarcastically. 
  Today there was another noteworthy person; an unidentified 
diplomat, but one whom everyone identifies as high-ranking and 
responsible for organizing the "other" meeting in Miami. The 
uneasiness felt by many heads of state was noticeable since the 
diplomat, along with Ambassador Babbitt, was wearing a badge on 
his lapel that gave him access to the most restricted areas, 
where today only heads of state and their ministers were free to 
go. The badge is only given to very high-ranking officials. 
"Prerogatives of the host," an uncomfortable diplomat resigned 
himself. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, who has been beside Fidel Castro since the 
first Ibero-American summit, granted an interview and stressed 
that there was neither more nor less tension prior to and 
following the unexpected speech by the Cuban president during 
the final minutes of yesterday's plenary session. Alarcon also 
denies that Castro's complaints about the presidents' compliant 
position toward the U.S. blockade were "out of place." 
  Alarcon believes that those heads of state who alluded to 
Cuba's internal system were out of place and he said they should 
keep in mind "the principle of national sovereignty at least 
once in a while." That oversight was indeed "an unfortunate 
slip." 
  Alarcon added that the takeover of diplomatic missions in 
Havana over the past few days by groups of Cubans demanding 
visas to leave the island is on the verge of becoming a "daily 
practice," that could even signal the end of the diplomatic 
system unless governments clearly stipulate that this is not a 
means of obtaining travel documents and the United States ceases 
to encourage the illegal departure of Cubans. 
  [LA JORNADA] President Fidel Castro's unscheduled statements 
caused an uproar yesterday afternoon... 
  [Alarcon] I would not say that it was outside the agenda. I 
think it was necessary for a country that was mentioned several 
times during this meeting to say something about that. In fact, 
President Itamar Franco, speaking for the second time, said it 
was necessary that he clarify his position with respect to the 
issue mentioned by other speakers. Their statements were indeed 
outside the agenda because they made comments that they 
considered necessary but which were inappropriate for an 
international conference. 
  [LA JORNADA] Sovereignty is perhaps the oldest principle of 
international law in Latin America and should be remembered at 
least now and then. That principle is truly sacred on this 
continent. Speaking outside the agenda constitutes a serious 
slip because this sacred principle is overlooked. 
  [Alarcon] The international community is inclined to deal 
with internal issues such as democracy, crime, drug trafficking, 
multilateral diplomatic actions... 
  The idea of democracy as such comes from a democratic 
concept 
called plurality, but lately there have been attempts to link 
the idea of democracy with certain events [torneos], 
appearances, and formalities. In the Ibero-American community, 
we repeat daily that we share a common language. Let us look in 
the dictionary for a definition of democracy. If memory serves 
me correctly, the academy describes democracy as a political 
system in which the people participate. It does not say it is a 
political system that every now and then must change colors or 
pay millions for television advertisements to sell candidates as 
if they were toothpaste. 
  [LA JORNADA] What is Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to 
the OAS, doing here? How do you assess that? It is the first 
time the United States has attended an Ibero-American summit 
meeting. 
  [Alarcon] I imagine that she slipped in because she has no 
right to be here. 
  [LA JORNADA] And nobody told her so? 
  [Alarcon] As far as I know, there was no meeting to discuss 
whether observer status would be granted to a country that is 
not Ibero-American. I thought of a whole list of countries more 
appropriate to attend that are not doing so. I am talking about 
other Portuguese-speaking countries or countries that speak 
neither Spanish nor Portuguese but which are Latin American as 
they are part of our history, such as Haiti or Jamaica. 
  [LA JORNADA] Is her presence healthy? 
  [Alarcon] It is all the same to me. I just want her to 
behave properly and not make any noise. She is involved in 
another conference, the orientation of which could contradict 
the orientation of this conference. 
  [LA JORNADA] Could the Miami summit in December interfere 
with the course of this Ibero-American summit? What could this 
entail for Cuba? 
  [Alarcon] It is a summit with particular characteristics. 
There is no preparatory work, no program, and no discussion 
topics. It seems to be something for fortune-tellers. It should 
definitely be a source of great concern. 
  [LA JORNADA] Certain people, President Cesar Gaviria and 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, for example, have established a 
certain relationship between the changes being demanded of Cuba 
and the fact that Fidel donned a guayabera instead of his 
military uniform. There has been, let us say, a lot of mental 
masturbation to give meaning to your guayabera. What is your 
opinion on Fidel Castro's guayabera? 
  [Alarcon] We learned that informal clothing would be worn 
here. Formal wear in Cuba is a shirt and tie. Informal for 
some is a short-sleeved shirt. For us, it is a guayabera. It 
is the national dress. As for the changes, some people insist 
that we must change to look more like a democracy. When one 
really believes in democracy, one must believe in plurality 
above all and in diversity to ensure that each country's people 
decides their own fate. The mental masturbation you mentioned 
is a reflection of manipulation. 
  [LA JORNADA] What does the successive occupation of 
diplomatic missions in Havana suggest to you? 
  [Alarcon] It is a reflection of the U.S. manipulation of 
emigration. The people occupying those diplomatic missions do 
not want to go to Antwerp or Brussels. 
  The United States is the only country that has two 
immigration laws; one for the world and the other, the 
adjustment law, which gives priority to Cuban citizens who 
arrive in their territory claiming to be politically persecuted 
in order to block the legal entry of those who wish to emigrate. 
This law simultaneously promotes illegal departures. The 
adjustment law for Cubans will be 30 years old. It dates back 
to 1966. I do not know what would happen in another country if 
there were a similar law for them. 
  Another suggestion is that a generalization of actions such 
as this one would bring about disaster. There are millions of 
potential economic emigres in the world. A generalization would 
mark the end of the diplomatic system, the law of the jungle 
would prevail. 
  [LA JORNADA] Three missions were occupied in past days; the 
Belgian, German, and Chilean Consulates. Could this become 
widespread? 
  [Alarcon] We can solve this problem in a civilized manner. 
We have said that the people who violated diplomatic missions 
will not be punished. Those embassies must recognize that this 
is no means to travel to those countries. If we do not make 
this clear, this could indeed become normal practice. This will 
not end as long as the United States continues to implement its 
immigration policy. Part of the solution is to convince these 
people to use peaceful means. The other part is to allow them 
to emigrate normally if they wish to do so
