<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron on interview with </F>
Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar by unidentified 
reporters at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] Voz de Honduras listeners, we approached Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar to ask him about changes in the 
foreign service. He said that no decision has been made and 
that the government will allow those ambassadors whose children 
are studying in the country where they are accredited to remain 
in office until the school year is over. At that time, changes 
will be made. Let us hear what the foreign minister has to say 
about changes in the foreign service. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz Aguilar] No changes yet. The 
president will announce these changes at the appropriate time. 
On several occasions I have said the changes suggested have 
been on the president's desk for the past several weeks. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, Ambassador William Pryce has said 
that [words indistinct] analyze the 1954 treaty [word 
indistinct] military protocol [words indistinct]. 
  [Paz Aguilar] We have said the 1954 treaty was signed as a 
result of the Cold War. The treaty was signed 40 years ago and 
it is necessary to revise it according to our current situation. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] It will take a long time to discuss a 
revision. 
These talks would start when the president decides. 
  [Reporter] The Congress and the Armed Forces have already 
started talking about revising the treaty. Is a congressional 
ruling enough to revise the treaty or is a presidential decision 
necessary? 
  [Paz Aguilar] International law sets the procedures for 
revising a treaty. First, we must negotiate the revision. The 
negotiations are conducted by the executive branch. Then the 
Congress must ratify the treaty. After that [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] I do not think all is bad. They have said that 
they hope the talks between Honduras and the United States 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] We do not know. The president must decide. 
[end recording] 
  Those were statements made by Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz 
Aguilar on the revision of the 1954 Military Assistance Treaty 
with the United States. The minister explained the procedures 
for a situation of this nature. He was emphatic in stating the 
government has not made changes in the foreign service.
