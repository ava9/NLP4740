It sounds as if some of Argentina's overseas ambassadors may be an even
worse credit risk than the country they have been chosen to represent.
Buenos Aires' newspapers have been filled with reports that some of
Argentina's departing ambassadors have left behind hundreds of thousands of
dollars in unpaid debts.
Admittedly, part of the explanation has to do with confusion over
ambassadors' private and official expenses. Even so, the list of
ambassadorial debtors has set tongues wagging.
Ambassador Carlos Mandry, former ambassador to Bonn, is alleged to have left
Deutsche Bank with a Dollars 300,000 overdraft after he was recalled last
year. Ruben Cardozo left Paraguay and Dollars 230,000 in IOUs and the former
ambassador to The Hague, Julian William Kent, owed banks Dollars 100,000.
The Foreign Ministry is investigating but says that 'where spending was for
official functions, the debts were checked and paid by the ministry. But in
the case of personal debts, that's each ambassador's problem.'
Or, rather, each ambassador's creditor's problem.
