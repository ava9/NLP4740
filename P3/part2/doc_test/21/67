  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Mr. 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, the 
charge d'affaires of the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo, has stated 
that operations at the embassy are back to normal today. He 
said that all employees and diplomats have entered their offices 
and have resumed their duties after an understanding was reached 
with the former ambassador, 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, to allow them 
to enter. 
  Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, a northerner who supports 
the Yemeni Socialist Party of the south, had shut the embassy 
doors last Wednesday and prevented the staff from entering to 
protest Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's 
decision to dismiss him and appoint the charge d'affaires, a 
northerner, to run the embassy's affairs. 
  'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id said in a statement to MENA that the 
monthly allowances of Yemeni students studying in Cairo were 
disbursed today. These allowances were supposed to be disbursed 
last week. In addition, consular services are being provided for 
the Yemeni community in Egypt. 
  He added that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan is 
still at his home, which is located above the embassy. The new 
permanent representative to the Arab League, Ambassador Luqman, 
today is also operating from his office at the embassy without 
any problems.
