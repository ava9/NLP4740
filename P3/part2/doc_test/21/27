The Mexican government has decided to accept the nomination of John D. 
Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico despite widespread criticism from 
opposition political parties and the Foreign Ministry. Negroponte, who served 
as American ambassador to Honduras at the height of the Contra war against the 
Nicaraguan government, has been critical of Mexican foreign policy. While 
Mexico is not happy with President Bush's choice for the post, it decided to 
accept Negroponte to avoid confrontation with the Bush Administration, Foreign 
Ministry sources said.
