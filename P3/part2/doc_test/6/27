WATES CITY of London, the property company, yesterday announced a 40 per
cent fall in its net assets in 1990, from 250p per share to 151p. The
pre-tax profit was Pounds 8.17m, down from Pounds 30.5m, which was boosted
by an exceptional item of Pounds 22.1m.
The worst affected part of the portfolio was the development properties
which fell by 44 per cent, while the value of investment properties fell by
18 per cent.
The decline in assets was 'clearly a most disappointing outcome', said Mr
Dundas Hamilton, chairman, although he hoped that asset values had reached
their low point. Companies were delaying office relocations and investment
purchases until after the election.
Net rental income increased from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 15m, as rent reviews
and the acquisition of an additional investment property compensated for the
continued loss of rent on properties held for development.
At the year end, the company's borrowings were Pounds 91.2m, giving gearing
of 50 per cent. The net debt of its joint venture companies was Pounds
39.3m. Earnings per share fell from 23.19p to 4.43p. A final dividend of
2.96p is proposed giving an unchanged total of 3.73p.
COMMENT
To judge by the yawning gulf between Wates' net assets and its share price,
shareholders do not believe that the halving of the net asset value over the
last two years is the end of the story. The share price, having fallen by 14
per cent over the past three weeks to 70p, is on a 54 per cent discount to
net assets. In part, this reflects concern about the difficulties in
securing tenants for development properties, although the pain will be
shared with its joint venture partners. More generally, Wates is hemmed into
virtually the worst property market ever seen in the UK. The square mile is
suffering disproportionately from the building bonanza of the late 1980s,
the recession in the financial services industry and the evaporation of
foreign investment which pushed up prices on trophy buildings. Many analysts
do not expect a re-emergence of capital growth until 1994. Even though Wates
is largely seen as a well managed company with good tenants and good
buildings, investors are unlikely to be drawn to a stock where recovery
prospects are so distant.
