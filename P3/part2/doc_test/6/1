FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Inoco cuts annual deficit to Pounds 4.31m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inoco, the USM-quoted property investor, reduced losses from Pounds 6.82m to
Pounds 4.31m pre-tax over the 12 months to December 31.
The outcome was struck after a profit on the sale of investments of Pounds
111,000 (losses of Pounds 3.1m) now treated as an exceptional rather than
extraordinary item.
Losses of Pounds 2.46m on sale of fixed assets, Pounds 96,000 on sale of
trading stocks and a provision of Pounds 1.6m against carrying value of
trading stocks were also taken above the line.
Losses per share were 2.06p against a restated 3.29p.
