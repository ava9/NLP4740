FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Loss of Pounds 120,000 at London &amp;
Clydeside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Clydeside Holdings reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 120,000 for
the half year ended March 31 1992. The interim dividend, however is again
1.8p.
The USM-quoted housebuilder said volumes were down 17 per cent on last year
and margins remained depressed. Property development made a smaller
contribution and that meant a 58 per cent reduction to Pounds 697,000 in
operating profit.
Turnover came to Pounds 10.8m and included Pounds 2.5m in respect of a sale
of a development property. Last year it was Pounds 8.65m and generated
pre-tax profits of Pounds 855,000.
Since April 1 house sales remained below target and price reductions and
discounting were continuing. Losses per share came to 0.6p (earnings 6.1p).
