ABERDEEN TRUST, the financial services group which secured a Stock Exchange
listing last year, suffered a fall of more than 55 per cent in pre-tax
profits in the year to September 30 1991 because of exceptional items
related to rationalisation.
While operating profit was down by 6 per cent at Pounds 2.58m (Pounds
2.75m), exceptional items totalling Pounds 1.36m cut pre-tax profit to
Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 2.75m).
During the year Aberdeen Trust disposed of the insurance broking, life and
pensions and membership activities of the Country Gentlemen's Association,
acquired in 1989. This entailed redundancy provisions and costs relating to
vacant properties. There was also a net extraordinary loss of Pounds 76,000
(loss of Pounds 417,000) comprising net profits of Pounds 224,000 from the
sale of the CGA, and Pounds 300,000 flotation costs.
Aberdeen's turnover fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 10.8m, largely
reflecting the change in its activities with the sale of CGA. During the
year it acquired investment management responsibilities from Argosy Asset
Management which added Pounds 125m to funds under management.
It also bought Saltire Insurance Investments, an investment trust
specialising in insurance. This brought a 47 per cent stake in Cheval Asset
Management which manages fixed interest funds for Lloyd's syndicates. After
the year end it bought the remaining 53 per cent of Cheval, adding Pounds
300m to funds under management.
Aberdeen Trust now derives about 70 per cent of its turnover from fund
management and the rest from providing accountancy services to CGA members.
Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said that the quality of the company's
profits had improved with more from recurring management fees and less from
dealing.
The company said that 1992 should be clear of exceptional costs, but warned
that the outlook was uncertain because of political and economic worries.
A final dividend of 1.5p is proposed for an unchanged 2.5p total out of
earnings per share of 3.06p (4.43p).
