FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Greenwich Comms cuts loss to Pounds 57,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 57,500 were announced by Greenwich
Communications, the USM-quoted television services and property rental
group, for the year to August 31 1992. Previous losses amounted to Pounds
768,200.
Mr Alfred Stirling, the chairman, said that, as indicated last year, the
company's revenue sources had been reduced to two - Tex House rental income,
still not fully let due to the glut of property on the market in the
Woolwich area, and Greenwich Satellite Portugal, the 80 per cent owned
Portuguese subsidiary which had produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000
(Pounds 21,000 losses).
Turnover improved from Pounds 288,700 to Pounds 421,700 and there were
exceptional losses of Pounds 99,800 (Pounds 524,200).
Losses per share were cut from 10.9p to 0.9p.
