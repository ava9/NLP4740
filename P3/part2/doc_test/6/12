BRIERLEY INVESTMENTS Limited, the New Zealand Investment company traded on
the USM, yesterday posted the offer document detailing its Pounds 11m
hostile bid for Gibbs Mew, the USM-quoted brewer and property development
group.
Although nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by the Gibbs family and
directors, Mr Stephen Bellamy of BIL, said he was confident that the 200p
per share offer would prove tempting to some members of the family.
'We believe some of them, controlling 18 per cent of the shares, may accept
our offer,' he said. He is also targeting non-family board members such as
Ms Tessa Brook, who controls about 9 per cent of the shares.
BIL owns 19.7 per cent of Gibbs after the group's biggest shareholder,
Scottish Amicable, sold its 7.8 per cent stake in July.
The offer document says Gibbs' property profits had proved transitory. The
commercial property subsidiary, which contributed Pounds 1.4m in pre-tax
profits between 1988 and 1990, made aggregate pre-tax losses of more than
Pounds 700,000 in 1991 and 1992.
The pre-tax profit amounted to Pounds 633,000 (Pounds 673,000) for the 12
months to March 28.
Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman of Gibbs said: 'BIL's offer significantly
undervalues Gibbs' assets and prospects. It represents an unwelcome attempt
to obtain the ..company's assets on the cheap.'
