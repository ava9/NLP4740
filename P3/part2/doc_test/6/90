GEORGE WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, moved back into profit
in the first-half and said that a significant upturn in UK housing sales
earlier this year would be reflected in second-half profits.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.1m against losses of Pounds 24.6m, restated
for FRS 3, after a Pounds 11.2m loss on disposals.
Earnings per share were 0.17p (losses of 8.48p) and the interim dividend is
being maintained at its reduced rate of 2p per share - it was halved at the
interim stage last year.
Operating profits were Pounds 7.3m, against losses of Pounds 1.1m, on
turnover down from Pounds 730.7m to Pounds 700.2m.
The results were accompanied by cautiously optimistic comments from Mr Joe
Dwyer, chief executive, who said: 'We now have evidence of a change in the
underlying trading environment for our business. The barometer is moving
gradually towards a more favourable climate.
'Our housing sales are running well ahead of last year and these will come
through to profit in the second half.' However, he also warned that 'the
overhang of recession will take a long time to clear'.
Worldwide house completions fell slightly to 3,251 (3,343) during the first
half reflecting the slow start to the year. However, the spring upturn in
the UK housing market expanded rapidly and meant that by the end of June
total UK house sales, including housing association homes, were 59 per cent
higher at 4,961 (3,125).
Housebuilding contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.6m) to total trading profits
of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 1.2m losses) on turnover of Pounds 195.4m (Pounds
215.7m). Construction edged back into trading profits of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
1.5m losses) although the value of the construction order book fell slightly
to Pounds 590m (Pounds 600m).
In property, further lettings lifted the percentage of let space to 61 per
cent and the division reported reduced trading losses of Pounds 300,000
(Pounds 1.9m).
Trading in the group's principal UK and North American aggregates markets
remained tough but trading profits for the minerals side were Pounds 4.5m
(Pounds 900,000) helped by a one-off Pounds 6.7m profit in the waste
management business.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 12.2m) reflecting reduced
year-on-year borrowings and lower interest rates. Net borrowings at the end
of June were Pounds 158m, representing gearing of 36 per cent.
COMMENT
Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue in June has provided the funds to bolster
the balance sheet and to make ready for the recovery by extending the land
bank and providing cash for the minerals businesses which could begin to
deliver good returns a few years down the line. More immediately the core
housebuilding business is on target to benefit from cheaper land and an
improving mix which should begin to boost margins. With luck the group could
make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 29.5m this year, rising to Pounds 60m
next year. Based on yesterday's share price of 184p this year's prospective
p/e of 20 looks lofty, but for longer term investors the shares are trading
at a slight discount to the sector.
