resources / Investigation into the investment career of Clive Smith

MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midlands entrepreneur known for his involvement in the
flotations of several natural resource companies in London in the 1980s, is
no stranger to litigation. Two legal actions have been taken out against him
in the last six months.
Mr Smith has been involved in companies such as Butte Mining, Geevor,
Petranol, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum, formerly called Far East
Resources.
The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into two, Richmond
and Butte, following a raid on the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey
accountant which once managed some of Mr Smith's offshore interests.
A self-made millionaire, Mr Smith played various roles in the resource
companies, from shareholder to board executive, and even chairman.
The degree of his involvement in many of these companies is unclear, as
virtually all of his interests are held in offshore trusts. 'My entire
affairs are dealt with offshore by different administrators,' he said
yesterday.
The share prices of all but one of these resource companies have collapsed,
hit by a variety of factors from failed ambitions to the sharp decline in
fuel and mineral prices. The exception was Petranol which was taken over by
Mr Hubert Perrodo, the French investor, and renamed Concorde Energy.
The first piece of litigation to come to light in recent months concerned
Butte Mining, which Mr Smith helped to float in 1987. The latest relates to
the Big Sinking Field, a Kentucky oil property which was eventually sold to
Globe Petroleum, a UK company in which Mr Smith was an investor. Globe has
been suspended at 4 1/2 p since March.
On March 13 1991, Sun Glow Joint Ventures of the US sold the Kentucky
property to Proctor Investments, which is registered in the British Virgin
Islands, for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.2m) in cash and Globe shares.
Proctor's ultimate ownership is unclear, but Mr Smith actively negotiated
the purchase. He also personally guaranteed Proctor's promise to buy back a
Dollars 450,000 tranche of the Globe shares.
Proctor failed to do so and Sun Glow is seeking payment from Mr Smith. He is
contesting the legal action and last night said Proctor 'is certainly not
connected to me'. However, he added that with so many interests overseas, it
was difficult even for him to remember all the details.
Immediately after the purchase, Proctor transferred the field to Kingsway,
another British Virgin Islands company, which had been formed four months
earlier and owned just one other, smaller asset in Texas.
Globe agreed to buy Kingsway for Dollars 19.5m on March 27, just two weeks
after Proctor had paid Dollars 2.3m for the Sinking Field. The next day, a
prospectus for Globe's full stock market listing valued the Kentucky
reserves at Dollars 26.7m and the Texas asset at Dollars 4.5m.
The prospectus does not mention Mr Smith's role in the transaction, although
he was a Globe shareholder through Supernal Services, his Jersey-based
vehicle, and his two daughters were also investors, or the price which
Proctor originally paid for the assets.
Five months after the sale to Globe, the company's auditors, Moore Stevens,
expressed concerns that Mr Smith 'may, in effect, exercise such influence as
to be deemed a shadow director of the company within the definition of the
Companies Act'. Their anxieties were communicated in a letter addressed to
Mr Michael Plant, managing director.
Mr Arthur Davy, who was in charge of the Globe account at Moore Stevens,
said last week he had not been aware of Mr Smith's association with Proctor
at the time of the transaction.
Mr Smith's past has been the subject of some controversy in the City of
London. He left Petranol, the resources group where he had been chairman, in
April 1986 but kept his 25 per cent shareholding.
In May, the Takeover Panel ruled that Mr Smith had been working in concert
with a hostile predator, Inoco, which was bidding Pounds 21m in shares for
Petranol. The Panel ordered Inoco to include a cash element in its offer,
but instead it dropped the bid.
Mr Roger Jeffries, an Inoco director and known to Mr Smith from the days of
Petranol's flotation, subsequently resigned. Mr Smith said he had no idea at
the time that Mr Jeffries was on the Inoco board.
In 1987 Mr Jeffries helped to bring Far East Resources to the market,
eventually becoming a director of the company. Mr Jeffries also held a wide
range of natural resource interests, including stakes in Richmond and Butte.
Mr Smith is also currently contesting US litigation by Butte, which claims
damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 184m) from about 70 individuals and
companies. Butte is alleging fraud, and misrepresentation on the part of
various defendants, involving, among other things, the purchase of US
assets. Butte is also asking for damages to be trebled under US
anti-racketeering legislation.
When the allegations were first made in May, Mr Smith said: 'I have never
been involved in any racketeering. Any claims are frivolous.' He said his
family's shareholding in Butte remained at the same level as when the
company was floated in 1987, some 19m shares.
Butte shares were placed at 100p each in 1987, rose to 140p in 1988, but
subsequently collapsed. Last night they languished at 2p each.
Among the many allegations made by Deutsch and Frey of New York, Butte's
contingent-fee lawyers, is that in 1988 Butte paid Pounds 51m, mainly in
shares then priced at 125p each, for a company whose sole asset in Montana,
had cost Dollars 90,566 only a short while before.
No trial date has yet been fixed but Butte believes the case might reach
court at the end of 1993.
In 1987, Mr Smith's Supernal Services took a 26.5 per cent shareholding in
Geevor, the Cornwall tin miner with an 85-year history and a London quote.
Supernal paid 125p a share. Mr Smith sold a 9 per cent stake to Mr Eric
Grayson, formerly of Burnett &amp; Hallamshire, who moved in as chairman with
plans to turn Geevor into an international mining group.
After Mr Grayson's arrival Geevor bought coal mining assets in the US and
the UK, but they failed to live up to expectations. New management was
installed in the middle of 1990.
However, attempts to revive Geevor foundered early last year when its bank,
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, withdrew the mining company's
facilities. Geevor's shares were suspended at 4 3/4 p in January. Attempts
have since been made to rescue the company via a reverse takeover.
Mr Smith has also been linked to Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, where creditors
recently foreclosed on the last of the main assets it had when it came to
the market in June 1989.
Floated at 105p, Richmond's public offer was a failure, when would-be
investors questioned the valuations of Texas assets purchased for about
Dollars 2m and valued in the offer documents a month later at Dollars 30m.
Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken up. Immediately following the
flotation, 30 per cent of Richmond was held by companies registered in
Liberia.
Richmond has suffered a series of mishaps since flotation, including the
abandonment of a property in Louisiana, a dispute over the Texas assets, and
a failed Pounds 31m rights issue in October 1990, when 25 per cent of the
issue was left with underwriters, County NatWest, and brokers Girozentrale
Gilbert Elliott.
The shares, which were 173p in 1990, closed at 7p last night. Richmond's
main remaining assets are two joint ventures, one in Siberia and another on
Apache tribal lands in New Mexico.
Richmond's broker at flotation, Corporate Broking Services, of which Mr
Smith held 11 per cent, went into liquidation last year. It also acted as
broker to Geevor and Globe.
Other directors of CBS were Mr Jeffries, and Mr David Wilkinson, joint
managing director of Richmond. Mr Wilkinson, a former director of Butte and
Far East Resources, is also named in the Butte litigation.
