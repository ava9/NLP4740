The once moribund Notre Dame baseball program has been a regular member of the 
Collegiate Baseball Top 30 poll this season under Pat Murphy, who is in his 
second season as coach after spending two seasons at Claremont-Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is jazzed up about baseball," said Murphy, whose team is ranked 27th 
this week with a 24-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 30, might not make anyone forget Knute Rockne, or Lou Holtz for that 
matter, but he already has achieved several notable milestones -- including the 
signing of pitcher Pat Leahy, the grandson of Notre Dame football coaching 
legend Frank Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who in 1986 led Claremont-Mudd to its first Southern California 
Interscholastic Athletic Conference championship in 11 years, inherited a team 
that was 15-29 in 1987 and engineered a 39-22 finish last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Murphy arranged for the Miami baseball team to accompany its 
football team to South Bend for what Murphy promoted as, "The Battle before the 
War." 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish swept a two-game exhibition series and then proved it was no 
fluke by defeating the 14th-ranked Hurricanes, 4-2, in Miami last month. 
Tentative plans have been made for the USC baseball team to accompany the 
Trojan football team to South Bend in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame also has a 12-9 road win over 10th-ranked Texas to its credit. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the Notre Dame tradition will aid him in recruiting despite the 
built-in handicaps of the school's rigorous academic entrance requirements and 
funding for only four scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"We're recruiting 365 days a year in all 50 states," Murphy said. "Don't tell 
me I can't come to Los Angeles and get a top kid because I'm going to do it. 
You watch." 
</P>
<P>
Sweet stuff: Pat Sweet said he elected to attend Texas A&amp;M over Cal State 
Long Beach and Pepperdine because he wanted to "get away and try something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the weather in College Station, Tex., and his own musical tastes, 
not much has changed for Sweet, a junior left-hander from South Gate who was 
19-4 with a 3.39 earned-run average in two seasons at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet is 7-1 with a 2.95 ERA for Texas A&amp;M (40-1), which is ranked No. 1 in 
the nation for the seventh straight week. 
</P>
<P>
"The humidity gets terrible sometimes down here," Sweet said. "The first time I 
threw here it was like pitching in a steam room. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also into country music now. I used to like new wave bands like Depeche 
Mode and Erasure. But the only thing my roommates play is George Strait and now 
I'm hooked on it." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend Texas A&amp;M plays host to Texas, which has won or shared 10 
consecutive Southwest Conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
Strikeout king: Rick Davis never really considered himself a full-time pitcher 
until he struck out 11 batters in Cal State Dominguez Hills' season-opening win 
over Arizona in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of opened my eyes," said Davis, a senior right-hander who played 
shortstop last season. "At that point I was still thinking about shortstop . . 
. The next thing I know, I would never see the field again." 
</P>
<P>
Good thing for Davis, who batted .220 and committed 27 errors last season. But 
bad news for opposing hitters who have been unable to handle Davis' knuckle 
curve. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who went to Upland High and transferred to Dominguez Hills from Mt. San 
Antonio College, leads the nation in strikeouts with 126 in 104 innings. He is 
5-4 with a 2.84 ERA and has allowed 74 hits and 47 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Have a nice weekend: During Cal State Fullerton's three-game Big West 
Conference series at UC Santa Barbara last weekend, Fullerton first baseman 
David Staton got 10 consecutive hits, which tied the school record shared by 
Brent Mayne and Tom Thomas. Staton's hit parade included five home runs, two 
doubles and 14 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't looking for any particular pitch," said Staton, a junior from Tustin 
who is batting .364 with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs. "Anything that came up 
there, I hit. It's that type of situation where it didn't matter what they 
threw. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I came up in the box I knew I was going to do it. You can't explain 
it while you're going through it." 
</P>
