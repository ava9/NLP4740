After all these years, Iowa's Ed Horton still gets a kick out of playing the 
Big Ten Conference team from his home state. 
</P>

Facing Illinois for the seventh time in his college career on Sunday, the 
6-feet-8 senior from Springfield, Ill., scored 26 points and grabbed 17 
rebounds to lead No. 9 Iowa to an 86-82 victory over the No. 2 Illini at Iowa

"All of those guys out there are my friends," Horton said of the Illinois 
players. "It gets me going." 
</P>
<P>
Horton, getting 20 or more points for the 10th time in the past 11 games, made 
10 of 17 shots, including two consecutive baskets midway through the second 
half after Illinois had pulled into a 57-57 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's B.J. Armstrong scored 24 points, and Roy Marble had 18.

first time since tearing ligaments in his left knee on Dec. 12. Bullard had 
eight points, including a pair of three-pointers, and six rebounds as the 
Hawkeyes, 17-4 overall, pulled into a second-place tie in the Big Ten with 
Illinois and Michigan at 5-3.

the Wildcats (12-10, 3-6) in a Big East game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
