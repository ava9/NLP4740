Notre Dame officials have informed the NCAA of a university investigation of 
possible misuse of a telephone credit card number by members of the football 
team, according to a newspaper report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone charges reached thousands of dollars and could involve several 
players, the South Bend Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz refused to comment but hinted several players may be 
disciplined for reasons he declined to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"We never discuss disciplinary matters within the university," he said. "When 
we practice, a certain number of individuals will be confined to study hall." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal was out of town and could not be reached 
for comment.
