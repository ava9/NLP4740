Most members of the Woodland Hills West American Legion team started a mental 
victory countdown after taking a five-run lead in the top of the 10th inning of 
Sunday's District 20 championship game, figuring that a berth in Thursday's 
Area 6 playoffs was in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the pitcher's mound in the bottom of the inning, however, West 
right-hander Ryan McGuire was counting down in reverse. What seemed an 
elementary exercise in recording the last three outs soon became an exercise in 
elementary math for McGuire, a countdown to near-meltdown in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire surrendered four runs and allowed the tying run to reach first before 
he recorded the last out in top-seeded West's 12-11 victory over second-seeded 
Panorama City at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a mess in that inning," West Coach Gary Gibson said, "but he finally 
nailed it down." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the term nailed down is a bit strong. Just say McGuire thumb-tacked this 
one, because he almost blew a 12-7 lead. With the tying run on first and the 
lead cut to one, McGuire retired Sean Henson on a called strike to end the 
4-hour, 15-minute marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept putting guys on base and I was thinking, 'OK, that's only two runs.' 
And then, 'OK, that's only three runs,' " McGuire said. "And the next thing I 
know, Roland De La Maza is up as the tying run." 
</P>
<P>
Add District 20 final: There were dramatics aplenty, though defensively, it was 
a clankfest at times. West committed four errors and Panorama City made two, 
which allowed a total of six unearned runs to score. A handful of other runs 
were tainted, coming as a result of wild pitches or passed balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that from a fan standpoint, it was a great game to watch," Gibson 
said. "But from a baseball standpoint, no way." 
</P>
<P>
Del Marine's two-run single helped West (23-3) score five times in the top of 
the 10th to break a 7-7 tie. After Marine's single gave West a 9-7 lead, Paul 
Geller lofted a bases-loaded fly ball to right that John Langley dropped. One 
run scored on the error, and one out later, Jason Mitchell lined a two-run 
single to left to give West a 12-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Panorama City (21-6) didn't roll over. Shane Wight singled and Joe Cascione 
walked to open the 10th, and one out later, Herman Merchan lined a run-scoring 
single to left. McGuire followed with a walk to Joe Chaparro to load the bases, 
bringing the red-hot De La Maza to the plate as the tying run. De La Maza 
homered and doubled in Saturday's 9-7 win over Woodland Hills East and earlier 
had singled in a run. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started thinking, 'I better start doing something right now,' " 
McGuire said. "I thought I'd better start throwing the ball by somebody, and I 
ended up throwing it by my catcher." 
</P>
<P>
Facing De La Maza, McGuire fired one to the backstop, allowing Cascione to 
score from third and the runners to advance. One out later, facing Langley, 
McGuire skipped another pitch to the screen, and Merchan scored to make it 
12-10. Langley followed with a bad-hop single to center that drove in Chaparro 
and cut the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
It came down to pitcher against pitcher. McGuire recovered and fanned Henson -- 
who pitched the 10th inning in relief of De La Maza -- on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping those fielders awake: Now-infamous junk bond king Michael Milken 
attended Birmingham High, site of the District 20 playoffs. In an elimination 
game on Saturday, pitchers Rich Shapiro of Woodland Hills East and Doug 
Maggiora of Newhall-Saugus shared a junk bond, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
With both teams running short on pitching, Maggiora and Shapiro were used as 
starters in East's 10-3 win. Overpowering, they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Maggiora, a 6-foot-3, 160-pound right-hander who will be a junior at Saugus 
High, pitched 7 1/3 innings and struck out none. Shapiro, a 5-foot-7, 130-pound 
right-hander who graduated last month from Taft High, pitched eight innings and 
struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
Atten-shun: The American Legion is the largest veterans association in the 
world, with approximately 2.7 million members. When District 16 champion 
Westlake-Agoura opens play Thursday in the Area 6 playoffs, look for a pair of 
its Legion baseball vets to play front-and-center roles. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bob Grandpre and infielder Mike Suarez have been on the team since its 
formation four years ago, and the two 1988 Westlake High graduates are 
providing leadership and firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Grandpre, a right-hander who has also been employed in the outfield and at 
first base, third base and designated-hitter, is 9-0 with an earned-run average 
of 3.15 and is batting .384 with 29 runs batted in. Suarez, who plays second 
base, is batting .416 with an area-high 18 doubles, 23 RBIs and 31 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Win a few, lose a few: Encino-Crespi was eliminated from the District 20 
playoffs with a 5-1 loss to Woodland Hills East on Friday at Pierce College, 
but Encino-Crespi Coach Scott Muckey exacted a small measure of revenge later 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, who also coaches the Crespi High team, led a group of Crespi players to 
the championship of an area tournament featuring undergraduate high school 
players. 
</P>
<P>
.... And my wife, she treats me like dirt: Birmingham High Coach Wayne Sink has 
long played baseball organ music over the public-address system between 
innings, but during the District 20 playoffs -- with Van Nuys-Notre Dame Coach 
Jody Breeden handling the P.A. chores -- the music went a step further. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it went from the familiar strains of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," 
to, "Take My Wife, Please." 
</P>
<P>
For Saturday's doubleheader, organ music was soon replaced with the Beatles, a 
segue to the Beach Boys, followed by Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
And then to. . . . "I tell ya, my wife is something else. I just bought a used 
car -- and found one of her dresses in the back seat.... My luck's nothing to 
brag about, either. I found a wallet the other day -- it had a picture of my 
two kids in it.... 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, Rodney Dangerfield kept fans and players alike in laughs during 
three innings in what might be called a comic relief appearance. No word yet on 
what's planned, auditory-wise, for the six-team, 6th Area playoffs, which begin 
Thursday at Birmingham.
