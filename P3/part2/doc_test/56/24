<F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Ballestas from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Captain Jose Delgado, the deputy director of the 
General Consular and Ships Directorate, reported to RPC that 
Panama has the largest merchant marine fleet in the world 
because it offers many facilities. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] Panama occupied second place for a 
long time. However, due to our aggressive policy, Panama was 
able to take first place from Liberia in June 1993. [end 
recording] 
  Capt. Delgado explained that the flagging of ships dropped 
considerably when Panama suffered its economic crisis in 1989. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] We lost a bit less than 2 million 
tons during the crisis. Immediately thereafter, in 1990, 
however, we started an aggressive program and visited the main 
ship owners, participated in the main international maritime 
events, and more importantly, attended events at the 
International Maritime Organization. This organization is 
seated in London, and all the international maritime agreements 
and norms are debated there. Our program prompted ship owners 
to regain confidence in us, and they have given us their 
support. [end recording] 
  The principal countries that request Panamanian flagging are 
Japan, Greece, Hong Kong, and Korea.
