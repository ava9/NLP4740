FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (1): Yards that
stay ahead - Even without the benefits of direct cash subsidies from
government, the Danish shipbuilding industry has developed into the biggest
in Europe (and the world's third largest). Its growth has been aided by a
recovery in Denmark's merchant fleet

DANISH shipyards have never received direct cash subsidies from the
government. When they found themselves in difficulties in the late 1970s,
and again in the mid-1980s, they had to improve their productivity or go to
the wall, which was indeed the fate of three of the larger yards.
The six big yards which are left have demonstrated their fitness for
survival. With an order book at the end of 1991 of 1.9m gross tonnes, the
Danish shipbuilding industry is the world's third largest after Japan and
Korea, and the biggest in Europe.
Nobody in the industry seems to have any regrets about Denmark's policy on
subsidies. On the other hand, they are extremely concerned by the subsidies
paid to yards in other countries.
'Denmark is a special case,' says Mr Kurt Andersen, managing director of the
A. P. Moller group's Odense Steel Shipyard, at Lindo on the island of Funen.
'This is the only country in Europe where everyone in the industry wants the
abolition of all subsidies.'
That consensus goes deep, since it is shared by the government and the
industry's trade unions, as well as the ship owners and shipyard
managements. Danish yards have, of course, been subsidised, but the
subsidies have always been rather lower than in other countries and the
subsidies have not gone directly to the yards but through the ship financing
system, which means that the yards have always had to maintain a competitive
edge in order to win orders. 'We have had to run a little faster,' as Mr
Andersen puts it.
The yard at Lindo is a good example. It is widely acknowledged as one of the
world's top-rank yards, perhaps more advanced than any of its competitors in
the use of computer-assisted design and manufacturing systems. It has
demonstrated its efficiency by the fact that it is the only yard in Europe
to have built very large crude carriers since the early 1970s.
In February this year it won an order for three tankers of about 300,000 dwt
each for Saudi Arabia's Vela International, thus showing that it is able to
compete with the Asian shipbuilders.
If the Danish shipyards are doing well at present, it is because Danish
shipping, with which the fortunes of the yards are inextricably mixed, has
also enjoyed a recovery. This, of course, has much to do with international
demand conditions, but the Danish maritime industries would not have survied
the 1980s without some sensible policy decisions.
Rising costs caused a dramatic decline in the fleet under the Danish flag in
the mid-1980s. The decline was stopped by the establishment in 1988 of the
Danish International Ship Register (DIS). Since then, the number of ships
under the Danish flag has increased by 35 per cent and employment on board
by 50 per cent, says Mr Peter Bjerregaard, managing director of the Danish
Shipowners' Association.
Personnel on board DIS-registered ships are paid a net wage or salary, ie,
they pay no income tax and receive wages approximately equal to what a gross
salary less income tax would be. DIS ships can also employ non-Danish
seafarers.
The DIS terms were strongly opposed by the Danish Seamen's Union, but
according to Mr Bjerregaard, employment of Danes on board has increased
since the DIS was established, especially of officers, but also of seamen.
The Danish Seamen's Union disputes that claim, but, says Mr Bjerregaard,
that is because owners are taking on more and more skilled workers,
typically members of the Metal Workers' Union, instead of traditional
seamen, so there are fewer members of the Seamen's Union on board.
A second important change took place when the DIS was established. Manning
scales were dropped and instead the authorities now approve manning levels
on the basis of the safety and operating requirements of the individual
ships. This means that most modern large container vessels sail with a crew
of seven or eight as opposed to 13 or 14 before. 'We operate under good and
flexible legislation,' says Mr Bjerregaard.
The maritime complex, or 'Blue Denmark' as a Ministry for Industry report
called the sector last year, has a total turnover close to DKr50bn and
employs about 35,000 people in shipping, shipbuilding and associated
manufacturing and service companies.
The Danish fleet at the beginning of this year comprised 600 vessels,
totalling 5.3m grt and 7.9m dwt. In 1991, there was a net increase in the
fleet of 43 ships totalling 285,000grt/478,000dwt. The tonnage under the
Danish flag was 1.35 per cent of the world gross tonnage.
Danish owners had on order at Danish yards on January 1, 1992, 58 ships and
one coal barge totalling 1.34m grt, plus 21 ships, two oil drilling rigs and
two barges totalling 313,000 grt at foreign yards. The orders at Danish
yards were worth about DKr11.6bn and at foreign yards DKr5.6bn. In addition,
leasing companies had on order at Danish yards 13 vessels totalling 356,000
grt, worth about DKr4.1bn.
Gross income by Danish shipping in foreign trade increased from DKr23.29bn
in 1990 to DKr27.57bn in 1991 and net income increased from DKr4.75bn to
DKr8.21bn. Net shipping earnings last year accounted for about a sixth of
Denmark's DKr50bn trade surplus.
The fleet under the Danish flag includes 42 container ships with a TEU
(20-foot container unit) capacity of 113,000, or 6.5 per cent of world
container capacity and the sixth largest container fleet. This, however,
underestimates the real size of the Danish container fleet: A. P. Moller's
Maersk Line fleet alone has a container carrying capacity of about 150,000
units; the East Asiatic Company operates 33 container vessels, with a total
capacity of 28,000 units, but only six of these vessels are under the Danish
flag.
Another jewel in the merchant fleet is the J. Lauritzen fleet of
refrigerated cargo vessels, totalling about 50 vessels, including the
world's largest, with a cargo capacity of 765,000 cubic feet, but with such
advanced computer controlled operational systems that they sail with crews
of only seven. They were built at the Lauritzen Group's Danyard shipyard at
Frederikshavn, Jutland.
The Danish shipyards had an order book worth about DKr18bn at the end of
1991, but this was increased by about DKr2.5bn when the Odense yard gained
an order to supply three 310,000 dwt tankers to Saudi Arabia's Vela
International this spring.
The yards have a turnover of about DKr7bn a year. Employment in the
shipyards is about 9,500, a third of what it was 20 years ago, but an
improvement compared with the low point of only 8,400 in 1989. Only about 10
per cent of the work carried out at the yards is repair work; the rest is
new building.
The six larger yards - Odense Steel Shipyard, Danyard, Burmeister &amp; Wain,
Svendborg Shipyard, Orskov Shipyard and Aarhus Flydedok - are able to build
a wide variety of ships.
In addition to large tankers, the Odense yard has built a large number of
container-carrying liner vessels for A. P. Moller. Bulk carriers are
Burmeister &amp; Wain's speciality. Danyard's recent programme has includes the
largest refrigerated cargo vessels (reefers) in the world, Orskov's current
programme is for smaller container carrying vessels (feeders) and Aarhus is
building chemical carriers.
The shipping and shipbuilding companies are backed up by around 100
companies with a turnover in maritime-related business of about DKr6.5bn,
according to the Industry Ministry. They include such diverse companies as
Soren T. Lyngsoe, a supplier of electronic equipment, Hempel's Marine
Paints, Aalborg Ciserv (marine boilers), Sabroe for refrigeration equipment,
MAN-B&amp;W for large two-stroke marine diesel engines, and Nordisk
Gummibaadsfabrik, which produces and supplies 80 per cent of the lifeboats
on board Danish ships as well as exporting all over the world.
