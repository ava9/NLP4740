SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BOWLING JOINTS WANT YOU TO STRIKE THE WORD ALLEY FROM YOUR

<P>
I am doing penance for referring to bowling alleys. I recently posed the 
rhetorical question: Would you rather live in an area known for its golf 
courses or its bowling alleys? 
</P>
<P>
I got a hot response from Diane Elliott, marketing director for Leisure Time 
Sports Inc. of El Cajon, which runs six bowling alleys/centers/lanes/places/ 
establishments in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott wrote that I'm obviously outdated, biased and sexist. All of this from 
my comments regarding golf versus bowling. Wow, wait until she hears my 
political ideas! 
</P>
<P>
She invited/challenged/dared me to visit North County Lanes in San Marcos to 
see how things have changed. I accepted/acquiesced/knuckled under. 
</P>
<P>
North County Lanes is one of Leisure Time's newest: a clean, well-lighted 
place, with 60 lanes, video games, cable television and free child care. (Try 
asking your golf pro for that.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, a lounge, snack bar and, this being the holiday season, a fully loaded 
Christmas tree. The chandelier is a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
There are senior leagues on most afternoons and junior bowling on Saturday. 
Nearly all leagues are co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Murtishaw, the teaching pro at North County Lanes, is constantly correcting 
people who say alleys. 
</P>
<P>
"Bowling has an image problem it is trying to shake," he said. "Some people 
just refuse to believe that bowling is no longer a bunch of beer-bellies 
smoking cigars and knocking down pins in some cellar." 
</P>
<P>
That image is obsolete at North County Lanes. Like pool halls before them, 
bowling alleys have been converted to "family fun." 
</P>
<P>
I remain retrograde, however. I worry that something has been lost in the 
sanitizing and wholesome-izing. The old hairy-knuckled alleys had their place 
in the social order. 
</P>
<P>
As either Mike Royko or Joseph Campbell once said, there are several hundred 
thousand social workers in this country but only one Minnesota Fats. 
</P>
<P>
There is wisdom there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
New and Improved? 
</P>
<P>
The political whirl. 
</P>
<P>
* Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt held a fund-raiser Sunday at the La Jolla home 
of investment broker Michael Hands. She needs to pay off a campaign debt of 
$140,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aren't you glad the "new politics" has given us council members who don't need 
to run expensive campaigns and beg for money from the well-heeled? 
</P>
<P>
* Here are names being floated as possible contenders for Lucy Killea's 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats: former Killea aide Chris Crotty; school board member Susan 
Davis; San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner; attorney and former Fair Board 
member Byron Georgiou; Rich Grosch, former aide to Mike Gotch; community 
college Trustee Evonne Schulze, and attorney Howard Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Among Republicans: one-time Killea opponent Earl Cantos Jr; Jeff Marston, 
former aide to Gloria McColl, and Wayne Raffesberger, aide to Ron Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
But It's Supposed to Be Fattening 
</P>
<P>
Tres mas. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Truffle Works is working on a chocolate Truffle Lite. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires food to have 30% fewer calories to be called "lite." Truffle 
Works owners Todd and Karen Keegan have trimmed only 20% off the usual 375 to 
425 calories per 2-ounce confection. 
</P>
<P>
Research and development continues. I'll keep you posted. 
</P>
<P>
* The Navy hopes to airlift the 300 officers and sailors from the destroyer 
Kinkaid back to San Diego by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid had been due back this Friday, before it collided with a merchant 
ship Nov. 12 off Malaysia. Repairs in Singapore and then Subic Bay will take 
until early spring.
