THE GOVERNMENT last night awarded a Pounds 200m contract for ammunition to
Royal Ordnance, ending a period of uncertainty for the British Aerospace
subsidiary.
The move, which was announced in the Commons by Mr Jeremy Hanley, the armed
forces minister, will help safeguard nearly 1,000 jobs over five years.
Royal Ordnance said it was 'delighted' at the news.
The announcement came as it emerged that the 5,000-strong Ministry of
Defence police has been earmarked as the next MoD unit to be proposed for
agency status. Officials said that work on the transition would begin within
a year, but said the move was unlikely to be a stepping-stone to
privatisation.
Opening the second day of a Commons defence debate, Mr Hanley announced that
Britain was sending a ship to Haiti to help in the enforcement of United
Nations sanctions.
He said the vessel would work 'in very close co-operation' with the US Navy
and others.
The move came within a day of Downing Street's acknowledgement that the
transatlantic dispute over the west's handling of the Bosnian crisis was
placing Britain's relationship with the US under strain.
Mr Hanley attacked recent press reports criticising high staffing levels at
the MoD. There had been a 48 per cent reduction in the number of UK-based
MoD civil servants since 1979, he said.
Other announcements made by Mr Hanley included:
The full integration of the Women's Royal Naval Service with the Royal Navy
from next month in a move aimed at enhancing career opportunities for women.
Mixed staffing at sea had proved to be 'a real success story'.
The completion of a study concluding there were enough UK seafarers
available to crew merchant ships required by the MoD in times of crisis. A
review last year said there were still enough merchant vessels on UK
registers for defence purposes.
The publication of a code of practice for submarine operations in shallow
waters.
The closure of the Royal Naval Engineering College near Plymouth.
The withdrawal of so-called 'Z berth' status from seven sites used for
occasional visits by nuclear submarines. Approved locations for visits by
nuclear-powered warships would remain at 25 to 30 UK locations.
