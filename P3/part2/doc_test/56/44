Driven by shore-bound winds, the slick from a 300,000-gallon oil spill reached 
miles of new beaches in Orange County on Friday, threatening major wildlife 
refuges and confounding cleanup crews working frantically to contain the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The brown and black goo was reported washing ashore as far north as Seal Beach, 
near the sensitive Bolsa Chica wetlands and a federal wildlife reserve at the 
Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. Both are prime nesting habitats for dozens of 
birds, including some of the state's largest concentrations of least terns and 
light-footed clapper rails, both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of it is here," said Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays after 
touring the coast by helicopter at dusk Friday. "When I was flying over the 
city between Beach Boulevard and the lifeguard headquarters, it looked black 
down on the beach as the stuff rolled in." 
</P>
<P>
Oil was reported washing ashore at various locations along a 12-mile stretch of 
coastline as portions of the widening slick broke away. Several fingers of the 
slick were within two miles of Long Beach Harbor, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor remained closed, but by late Friday the 18-square-mile slick had 
reversed its course, heading north toward the wetlands at Huntington Beach and 
Seal Beach where officials feared that protective booms might not contain the 
advancing oil. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers were used to build a sand dike at the Santa Ana River mouth near the 
Huntington Beach wetlands, and flushing channels that lead to the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, farther north, were sealed shut. Biologists warned that the oil could 
devastate wildlife in the nesting areas if any infiltrates the fragile coastal 
estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for damage and harm is enormous," said Victor Leipzig, executive 
director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Experts also predicted that the spilled oil may also start emulsifying, thereby 
doubling in volume. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators revealed Friday that an anchor punctured the hull of 
the tanker American Trader at least twice as the 811-foot vessel positioned 
itself to connect with an oil pipeline in water so shallow that the ship could 
have struck the bottom. However, no oil leaked from the second gash in the 
tanker, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it (the ship) rode up over its anchor and punctured on it," 
Coast Guard Adm. J. William Kime told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said divers late Thursday found the second hole near the 
starboard bow of the U.S.-registered tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, laden with millions of gallons of oil, attempted to position itself 
off Huntington Beach to unload its cargo of crude to send to a mainland 
refinery when one of its 12-ton anchors punctured the hull, exposing two of the 
oil-filled holds. 
</P>
<P>
Marine experts said Friday that a ship striking its own anchor is the mariner's 
equivalent of shooting oneself in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty embarrassing when you hit your own anchor," said George 
Oberholtzer, director of the National Spill Control School at Texas State 
University in Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the American Trader, supervised by Coast Guard officials, were 
pumping out the remaining oil in the damaged holds Friday to prevent further 
spillage. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn Friday, professional cleanup crews in gloves and yellow slickers were 
scattered along a half-mile stretch of sand near Newport Pier. Many residents, 
angered at the tanker accident and the threat to local beaches, joined the 
effort, wading into the surf line and dabbing the fouled waters and sand with 
absorbent cloth pads. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, volunteers outnumbered paid workers, creating problems and 
prompting officials to issue a public plea to stay away from local strands, 
most of which were closed from Newport to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very disturbing to see this and to experience it," said Patti Harris, a 
Costa Mesa resident. "I feel as though my personal environment has been 
violated. Now, maybe with all the (media) coverage, politicians will get off 
their duffs and protect us." 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court on Friday, two state 
sportfishing organizations blamed British Petroleum and tanker owner American 
Trading Transportation Co. for causing more than $1 billion in damage to 
wildlife and beach property. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportfishing Assn. of California and United Anglers of California alleged 
that the shipping company and British Petroleum were negligent and have held 
back resources in the cleanup effort to save money. The suit seeks an 
unspecified amount in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Lehman, a risk manager for British Petroleum, denied the allegations 
Friday night, contending that "both companies have committed substantial 
resources to clean up the oil spill." 
</P>
<P>
At least nine skimming vessels worked to recover the oil. But by late Friday 
only 7% -- about 500 barrels -- of the oil patch had been scooped up, and 
experts predicted that at some point, much of it would probably come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 60% of the slick was still drifting off the coast, and it would 
take days -- if not weeks -- to clean it up under the most ideal conditions -- 
if ocean waters stay relatively calm and winds light. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident is tragic," said John Turner, director of the U.S. Interior 
Department's division of wildlife services, who was at Huntington Beach State 
Park. "There's a considerable amount of spill out there. You don't ever become 
adequately prepared to clean up the area. Nobody could ever become adequately 
prepared to clean up real stuff. It's that hard." 
</P>
<P>
At least 49 birds were found fouled by oil and taken to a wildlife aid station 
as of Friday. A dozen or so of those have died, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
During a press tour Friday morning, about 30 oil-fouled seals were perched on 
some of the cylinders in the pipeline mooring area, which contained some of the 
thickest and most concentrated portions of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials said they have not determined who is responsible for the 
spill. But the investigation is continuing into the events surrounding the 
mooring of the 21-year-old tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Tanker crew members told investigators that the American Trader drifted back 
over the anchor, and the chain apparently wrapped around the bow, according to 
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver. As the crew raised the anchor to try another 
mooring, officials believe it struck the hull on the starboard side, leaving a 
three-foot gash and two other holes. 
</P>
<P>
Mooring a tanker for unloading is a two- to three-hour process that involves 
coaxing the ship into a 700-foot-wide, U-shaped cluster of seven buoys. During 
the operation, the ship typically cuts across the mouth of the "U," laying one 
anchor, then the other, before reversing its engines to swing the stern into 
the slot. 
</P>
<P>
A mooring master, the equivalent of a pilot, directs the procedure from the 
bridge of the tanker and is assisted by a mooring launch cruising the waters 
around the ship. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Keon, 41, of San Jacinto was the mooring master aboard the American 
Trader when the spill occurred. Coast Guard officials said that Keon and Capt. 
Robert La Ware tested negative for alcohol use and that results of drug tests 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Keon, who is self-employed, has worked as a pilot at the Huntington Beach 
mooring for five years. He has been a sailor for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you one thing, the guy wasn't drunk," said Bill Freese, who lives 
half a block from Keon. "I have never seen him with anything stronger than a 
cup of coffee. He is very dedicated, a real family man and a churchgoing guy." 
</P>
<P>
La Ware, who has worked for American Trading Transportation Co. for 30 years, 
is an experienced captain on the West Coast. Contacted at the ship Friday 
afternoon, La Ware declined to comment except to say, "I'm holding up just 
fine, thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Friday that the draft of the tanker was 42 to 47 feet below the 
water level. Its anchors are at least 10 feet long, and the ship was attempting 
to moor at low tide just before 5 p.m. Wednesday when the water depth was 
"50-plus feet," a Coast Guard official said. "It had the potential of being 
right on the bottom.' 
</P>
<P>
The water's depth around the mooring can range from 52 to 75 feet, depending on 
the swell and tide. Tidal charts indicate that the low tide was 1.3 feet below 
normal at 4:06 p.m. Wednesday, shortly before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum, operators of the vessel, said Friday that its crews had 
already gathered 800 trash bags full of oil-soaked cleanup pads from the beach. 
Spokesmen said they may ask volunteers to stop helping in the cleanup because 
of liability problems. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, federal and state officials ruled against the use of toxic 
chemical dispersants to break up the slick.

HOW THE ANCHOR HIT 
</P>
<P>
The American Trader was maneuvering into a sea berth off Huntington Beach to 
offload oil when it apparently smacked its anchor, ripping two holes in its 
hull, spilling 300,000 gallons of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
1. Swells rocked ship in shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
2. The vessel drifted over port anchor, wrapping the chain around its bow. As 
crew raised port anchor, officials believe it struck starboard side of hull, 
leaving three-foot gash and another hole. 
</P>
<P>
3. Some veteran pilots suspect the tanker struck the anchor as it rested on sea 
floor in shallow water.
