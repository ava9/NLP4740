Notice is given that a complaint filed by Amzone International, Inc. and Universal Cargo Management, Inc. (``Complainants'')
against Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd. (``Respondent'') was served August 4, 1994. Complainants allege that
Respondent violated sections 8(c) and 10(b)(12) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;&sect;1707(c)
and 1709(b)(12), by failing and refusing to make available, in response to ``me-too'' requests, the essential terms
of a service contract to Complainants, both of which are alleged to be similarly situated shippers, on the same basis
as made available to the original contract shipper, and by granting another Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier's
``me-too'' request for the same service contract.

This proceeding has been assigned to the office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,

by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by August 4, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
