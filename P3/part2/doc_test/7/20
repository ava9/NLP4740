AMERICA NO LONGER EXPECTS THE MOON

The first landing on the moon, 20 years ago, was supposed to point a path to 
the future. Today we are living in that future, and that feat appears as part 
of the heroism of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Despite President Bush's announced support for establishing a base on the moon 
and sending a manned mission to Mars, such ideas are likely to remain in the 
realm of plans and programs rather than of policies and funded projects. There 
are excellent reasons why. The Apollo moon-landing program, for all its 
self-conscious futurism, stands as a monument to vanished attitudes of its 
time. These attitudes dealt with government and with technology, and stand in 
sharp contrast to what we expect today. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo had its start in the early 1960s. At the time, there was sweeping 
enthusiasm for the ideal of government that brought Apollo into being. The 
ideal was that our government should feature a charismatic leader as President, 
who would push forward in a widespread program of governmental activism. John 
F. Kennedy gave America the very embodiment of this ideal, and the Apollo years 
-- the decade that followed his death -- can readily be viewed as a search for 
someone to replace him. Kennedy not only initiated Apollo but made it a 
centerpiece of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, our expectations have changed. We are far less likely to give 
our hearts to vibrant and exciting new leaders, or to put our hopes in grand 
governmental programs with names like "New Frontier" or "Great Society." With 
Republicans having a virtual hammerlock on the White House, it is doubtful that 
John Kennedy could even be elected today. The contrast between George Bush and 
Kennedy illustrates something important: Americans no longer expect their 
Presidents to give them everything, including the moon. 
</P>
<P>
A second major attitude that drove Apollo, and which we no longer hold, was 
that government action could usher in the future. Government agencies would 
seize the opportunities of the time, lavish massive funding on them, and bring 
them into bloom. In particular, government could identify the most promising 
and significant new technologies, such as space flight, and turn dreams into 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, we put our hope not in government but in small companies and 
entrepreneurs. We expect that the technologies of the future will emerge, not 
through programs in Washington, but from the work of inventors in centers such 
as Silicon Valley. There is little interest today in "industrial policy," which 
was a Wash-ington catchword only a decade ago: Thenotion that government should 
select technology's winners and losers. This idea was at the core of Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo was pursued amid a widespread concern over national goals. In the '60s, 
opinion-makers often asserted that the nation should spend its effort and 
treasure on the pursuit of specific achievements: going to the moon, abolishing 
poverty, winning the war in Vietnam. Today we appreciate that the world is too 
complex to be neatly encapsulated in such government plans, and few such 
proposals come forth. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo also went forward amid a vague but widely held expectation that space 
flight would be the key to the future. Today, electronics holds the hope that 
formerly attached to astronautics -- and the difference between a desktop 
computer and Cape Canaveral illustrates the difference between these 
technologies. No entrepreneur could build a rocket for the Cape, but no federal 
program could put a computer on the desktop. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo also engendered the expectation that there would be major follow-up 
efforts of similar scope. The closest comparable activity was Synthetic Fuels 
Corp. of Jimmy Carter's Administration. This was a lavishly funded effort to 
seize the future by pursuing a new technical goal: that of producing gasoline 
and other synthetic fuels from coal. This project was soon abandoned under 
Reagan, and few lamented its demise. Though far less dramatic than Apollo, it 
drew from the same mind-set and exemplified the same attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, will we not soon return to the moon or go to Mars? We will not do 
these things for the same reasons we will not fight an overseas war or launch 
far-reach-ing new efforts aimed at social change. Our expectations are 
different, more modest -- and more realistic.
