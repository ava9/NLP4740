  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today confirmed the government's decision to transform the Falda 
del Carmen facilities into "Argentina's space activities center." 
  Menem thus stressed that the facilities where the 
controversial Condor-2 missile was developed and built will be 
used for "the production of civilian goods and services alone." 
  The president made these remarks in opening this morning the 
2d Euro-Latin American Space Forum [II Jornadas 
Euro-Latinoamericanas del Espacio] at the Libertador Hotel in 
Buenos Aires. Representatives from European and American space 
agencies, research institutes, universities, and companies are 
attending this forum. 
  Representatives from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico 
will lecture on the development of their space programs. 
Teledialing [telediccion] -- the remote gathering of data, 
using satellites -- especially for the exploitation of natural 
resources and environment conservation, will be among the main 
issues for discussion. 
  During the opening ceremony Menem was joined by Conrado 
Varotto, the National Commission for Space Activities [CNAE] 
chairman; European Space Agency Chairman Michael Lefevre; and 
Senator Jose Figueroa. 
  In his speech, the president emphasized "the peaceful" goals 
of the space projects, and noted that an Institute for Higher 
Space Studies [Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales] would be 
operating in Falda del Carmen, in Cordoba Province. 
  After emphasizing the importance of science and technology, 
Menem noted: "Historically, and especially over the past 
decades, Argentina has not been using its gray matter, and given 
the reduced possibilities for development existing here we, 
incredibly enough, became exporters of brains." 
  The president said: "We are proud to say that this trend has 
been reversed now." He then noted that space activities have 
been enhanced. 
  Menem pointed out: "The CNAE was legally established in 
1991. A National Space Program [Plan Espacial Nacional] is 
being drawn up now, and must be completed in September. This 
program will establish long-term strategic planning. This 
planning is now possible thanks to the economic stability." 
  Menem noted: "In a breach of trust, I can say that one of 
the 
program's key points involves using the so-called light 
satellites [satelites livianos] that are able to supply a number 
of scientific and practical services to our territory and to 
third countries." 
  Menem said: "The Satellites SAC-B and SAC-C must be 
described as pioneer." He noted: "Argentina is gaining 
experience, and has great potential in the field of space 
activities." 
  Before delivering his speech, Menem met European Space 
Agency 
astronaut Claude Nicolier, a member of an expedition that spent 
11 days in space to service the Hubble space telescope.
