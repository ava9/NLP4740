<F P=106> [Interview between Yuriy Sigov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI </F>
correspondent, and Academician Roald Sagdeyev, at College Park, 
Maryland, date not given: "Did Russia Sell Out to the United 
States"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Academician Roald Sagdeyev scarcely requires 
introductions. For many long years he was the leader of space 
science in the USSR and was at the center of development in our 
country of the most modern types of rocket technologies. Now 
Roald Sagdeyev is an honorary professor in the Physics 
Department of the University of Maryland and is living and 
working in the United States. We asked him to evaluate the 
present-day status of Russian-American space and rocket 
cooperation. 
  Sigov: Over the course of many years the USSR and 
the United States actively cooperated in the cosmonautics field. 
How are these relationships developing now? 
  Sagdeyev: The breakup of the USSR also had a 
negative effect on the development of space science in our 
country. The number of launches has been reduced to one-third 
and there are neither workers or clients for space programs. The 
political stimulus also has fallen away: it is clearly 
unrealistic to participate in a space race with America in order 
to prove the superiority of our social system. 
  Cooperation with the United States is today helping Russia, 
in a time difficult for our country, to maintain its positions 
in the world market in those sectors where for the time being 
they are still strong: in rocket construction and cosmonautics. 
However, mere programs for space cooperation with America will 
not save us. The Americans have cooperated in only a few 
programs, which cannot begin to cover even a small part of the 
capabilities of our space complex. 
  With respect to Russia's use of its commercial potential in 
the space field, the demand for such services in the world 
market is now shrinking. For Russia, even now under the pressure 
of the leading world space powers, quotas have been set which 
simply cannot be changed. Precisely for this reason the contacts 
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RSA) and the creation 
of a unique Russian-American space station, which may carry our 
cooperation to new limits, are encouraging. 
  Sigov: Russian opponents of cooperation between 
NASA and the RSA say that we seem to be selling our leading 
space technologies to America for a pittance. Is this actually 
the case? 
  Sagdeyev: To think that America is buying us for a 
pinch of snuff is oversimplified and erroneous. It is impossible 
to give America things free -- that is opposed by the American 
aerospace business, which in the case of Russian dumping loses 
its own orders. It was precisely American companies which were 
successful in setting quotas for Russia in order not to allow 
inexpensive Russian space technologies on the world market. 
  Sigov: It is assumed that under pressure from the 
United States Russia has reexamined or frozen many of its 
projects with other countries. In this sphere to what degree is 
Moscow actually dependent on Washington? 
  Sagdeyev: I feel that there is no political 
pressure by the United States on Russia along these lines. To be 
sure, there is the form of conclusion of exclusive deals between 
companies in the two countries from which Russia, when something 
is disadvantageous to it, has the right to refuse. However, 
there also are extremely advantageous proposals. For example, a 
joint enterprise was recently established with the participation 
of Russian, American and French companies for the development, 
sale and production of a new generation of plasma engines. 
  Such contracts will help Russia to enter the world market 
with the minimum losses to it. But at the same time Russia today 
is simply obligated to cooperate with the United States also in 
another direction -- nonproliferation of rocket technologies, 
especially those which can be used for military purposes. 
Precisely this cooperation also in the last analysis exerted an 
influence on the fate of the Russian-Indian contract for 
cryogenic engines. 
  Sigov: Did not Moscow sell out by breaking the 
extremely advantageous contract with Delhi and how, in general, 
will such Russian behavior be interpreted in other "third world" 
countries desiring to cooperate with Russia? 
  Sagdeyev: With respect to the Indian contract 
there was no simple and unambiguous solution. In Moscow, 
evidently, it was decided that in comparison with the 
"friendship of a friend" (with India), the principles 
(nonproliferation of rocket technologies) were more precious. 
International strategic stability also is preserved due to these 
principles. 
  Unfortunately, the protocol on the nonproliferation of 
rocket 
technologies was signed by the seven leading world powers, but 
Russia was not among its initiators, although we had a moral 
right to this as the homeland of cosmonautics. 
  In the case of the Indian contract I feel that Moscow acted 
correctly, although that type of cryogenic engines which we 
promised India is too exotic for real application in military 
technology. It also is necessary to take into account the fact 
that at the height of the debates on the contract India, with 
the assistance of France, launched its own communication 
satellite, letting it be understood thereby that it had no 
intention to be oriented only on Russia in space cooperation. 
  Looking at this example, the countries of the "third world," 
potential clients of Russia, wishing to receive its rocket 
technologies for use for military purposes, probably have been 
frightened away, which is good. But since in Russia there is 
much which can be proposed for the world market other than 
cryogenic engines, there will be no shortage of customers. For 
example, plans are now being made for a deal between Russia and 
China for the sale of our rocket technologies to them. 
  Sigov: And what other countries are showing an 
interest in Russian rocket technology? 
  Sagdeyev: There is now an oversupply of space 
services on the world market. Russia, the United States and 
France scarcely will allow newcomers from the "third world" to 
enter this market. In addition, as experience shows, these 
countries are striving to acquire specifically military rocket 
technologies (China, Iran, Iraq, and to a lesser degree 
Argentina and Brazil). They all have their national rocket-space 
programs and may potentially be interested in broad-scale 
cooperation with Russia. 
  Sigov: How necessary, in general, are large-scale 
space projects with foreign partners to Russia when the economy 
is in crisis and there is insufficient money even for the most 
insistent needs? 
  Sagdeyev: Today Russia does not have its own 
resources, nor customers abroad, which could "feed" our space 
complex even equal to a third of the former capabilities of the 
USSR. But the creation of a joint orbital station with the 
United States may assist in solving some problems. 
  Sigov: What is the attitude in the United States 
toward space cooperation with Russia? Insofar as I know, many 
American congressmen have an extremely skeptical attitude toward 
it... 
  Sagdeyev: For the time being there is no unanimity 
of opinion with respect to space cooperation with Russia. NASA 
directors feel that cooperation with Moscow is advantageous and 
necessary (although there also is criticism there of such a 
partnership). The White House also is supporting the idea of 
cooperation with Russia in space. At the present time NASA has 
no other recourse than cooperation with Russia. 
  With respect to congress, senators are speaking out who fear 
that cooperation with the Russians will result in a loss of jobs 
and orders for American aerospace complex enterprises. But the 
Americans, I repeat, have no alternative (and they understand 
this): either there will be a station with the Russians or there 
will no station at all. 
  In America there is also the fear that long-term cooperation 
in the space sphere with Russia may become a pawn of political 
instability in our country. But in any case this cooperation is 
not only advantageous to both countries, but also is in the 
interests of world science. 
  Can Russia fully participate in this cooperation with 
America 
when in our country there are many plants on the verge of 
closing, state orders are being lost and functioning of the 
Baykonur cosmodrome is being threatened? I believe that the 
revitalization of our space complex is a matter of honor for 
both the government and each of us individually. Now there is no 
longer need for lofty slogans, but specific actions. 
  Sigov: On what, in our opinion, should the Russian 
leadership be oriented: on commercial gain from the development 
of space and rocket technology or on obtaining political 
dividends in the international arena? 
  Sagdeyev: In my opinion these concepts are 
inseparable. Without effective agreements making it possible to 
exercise control over rocket technologies it is difficult to 
cooperate with the civilized world. But it also is necessary to 
take into account the difficult economic situation in which 
Russia finds itself and therefore where this is possible it also 
necessary to fight for foreign exchange. 
  The strengthening of the positions of Russia in the world 
space market requires close cooperation of all our concerned 
departments -- diplomats, rocket builders, scientists and 
practical workers. Only in such a way will we not only be able 
to maintain already existing positions, but also to reach new 
limits of space partnership with the leading world powers. 
  Postscript. The interview with Academician Roald Sagdeyev 
scarcely is the last word in the discussion of priorities of 
Russian rocket-space diplomacy. In any case the agreements 
signed in the United States on the joint development of the 
orbital station Alpha (successor of the Freedom station, which 
is not to be) give no basis for such an unchallenged evaluation. 
The contribution of Russia to the Alpha project is virtually 
everything which has been developed for the Russian Mir-2 
station and all this work has cost us a sum far greater than the 
400 million dollars allocated by the American side for three 
years. If we ourselves are not going for manned cosmonautics, 
why then should we continue this work no longer for ourselves, 
but for others?
