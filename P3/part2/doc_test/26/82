AMONG Silicon Valley's 'hot' high-growth companies, Cisco Systems is a
sizzler. The networking equipment manufacturer's revenues have soared over
the past four years with rising demand for products that link incompatible
computers and local area networks (LANs) into enterprise-wide
'internetworks'.
Cisco and others in the internetworking field provide solutions to the
problems of companies and organisations that find themselves with a muddle
of different types of incompatible computers that cannot 'talk' directly to
one another. While there is broad recognition of the advantages of linking
computers into a single 'internetwork' the task is like that of sorting out
a Tower of Babel.
'It is as if you had people trying to communicate by telephone speaking
different languages,' explains Mr John Chambers, Cisco senior
vice-president.
The obvious solution would be to demand that all computers adhere to
standards so that they can share data directly and all 'speak the same
language'.
This, in fact, is the ultimate goal of 'open systems' advocates. In the
meantime, however, computer users are seeking ways to exploit the full
potential of their existing computer systems as well as tying them in to new
equipment.
Rather than attempting to force computer users to buy only computers that
comply with a particular set of data communications protocols, Cisco aims to
enable users to link any and every type of computer on a single
'internetwork'.
'The network should be chosen to suit the computing technology - not the
computing technology to suit the network,' Cisco maintains.
Cisco's 'routers', 'bridges' and 'communications servers' are used to sort
computer data into 'packets', regardless of the data communications
protocols, and then to find the most efficient and economical route to
deliver them to their destination on the network. They also assign
priorities to different packets, delivering the most urgent ones first.
The market for such 'internetworking' products has grown rapidly over the
past few years as corporate computer users have looked for ways to connect
different types of computers and LANs into a single internetwork.
Sales of internetwork equipment will increase from Dollars 344m in 1989 to
Dollars 892m in 1994, according to International Data (IDC), a US market
research group.
Cisco's roots, like those of Sun Microsystems, the leading computer
workstations manufacturer, lie in a Stanford University project to build a
campus-wide network connecting all departments and laboratories.
Work on this experimental network, in the late 1970s helped to establish
several networking standards.
The Stanford group worked closely with the Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency (Darpa) task force assigned to defining a new
network protocol for use in the international defense research network,
Arpanet. This work led to the development of the Transmission Control
Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) which have become de facto standards
internetworking.
The Stanford network became one of the world's largest LANs in the 1980s,
linking thousands of terminals, personal computers, workstations and
mainframe computers. Recognising the commercial potential of their work, Mr
Len Bosack director of computer facilities for Stanford's Computer Science
Department and Sandy Lerner, director of computer facilities in the Graduate
School of Business, formed Cisco in 1984.
By late 1987, Cisco's monthly revenues were approximately Dollars 250,000.
Five years later, they are running close to Dollars 38m per month.
For fiscal 1992, ending in July, the company reported sales of almost
Dollars 340m, up 85 per cent from 1991, with net income of over Dollars 84m
an increase of 95 per cent from the pervious fiscal year.
One of the biggest challenges - and opportunities - facing the
internetworking industry is developing ways to link systems based upon
International Business Machines' proprietary networking protocols into
PC-based LANs.
Over 60 per cent of large US companies use IBM's Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) as the primary method for tying their computers together.
These networks form the backbone of data communications for many companies,
but they are based upon an hierarchical computing model that is rapidly
becoming outdated by 'peer to peer' networks of PCs and workstations.
Last March IBM made what it called its 'most important networking
announcement since the introduction of SNA in 1974'.
Big Blue unveiled its plans for an Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN)
scheme that will give mainframe computers an equal footing with other
computers, even PCs, on a network.
IBM promised to make its new APPN protocols available to other computer
makers so that they could build products that can talk to IBM networks.
Rather than play second fiddle to IBM, however, Cisco is establishing a
consortium of companies involved in networking to develop 'open' standards
for linking SNA networks to LANs.
Taking on the computer industry giant, Cisco is promoting its competing
Advanced Peer-to-Peer Internetworking (APPI), as an open, free-of-charge
standard available to all users and vendors.
This bold bid to usurp IBM's traditional role as the computer industry's
'standards setter' may determine whether Cisco can continue to set industry
records for growth.
