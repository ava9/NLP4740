Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not make a previously announced 
visit to the Hoover Institution during his trip to Stanford University next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials decided that Gorbachev's schedule during his June 3 and 4 
visit to the Bay Area "was just too tight," Bob Freelen, Stanford vice 
president for public affairs, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During the Stanford visit, Gorbachev will meet with University President Donald 
Kennedy; former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, now a professor of 
international economics at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, and with 
students and other faculty members at the school of business. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, a longtime bastion of 
anti-communism, has one of the world's largest collection of material on the 
1917 Russian Revolution, including "mug shots" of known revolutionaries that 
came from the secret police files of the czarist days.
