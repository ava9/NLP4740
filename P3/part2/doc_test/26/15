INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: ENTREPRENEURIAL GAP AT LOCAL UNIVERSITIES

Caltech, UCLA and USC are three excellent research universities. But when it 
comes to generating innovation and entrepreneurship in Southern California, 
give them an F. 
</P>
<P>
Glance north to Silicon Valley and you find Stanford University at the hub of a 
vibrant, entrepreneurial regional economy that grows on the leading edge of new 
technologies. While Southern California's universities have successfully 
crafted ties with local aerospace firms, they've become virtually irrelevant 
when it comes to spawning new high-technology industries. Granted, aerospace is 
one of the region's biggest employers, but these days it takes more than planes 
to make an economy fly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're concerned about," acknowledges Richard Kaplan, USC's vice 
provost for research and academic computing. "What happened here in the 1950s 
was that the normal paradigm of engineering was building a Spruce Goose or a 
B-29. Engineers were taught a trade and not so much the skills that now 
characterize being an engineer. By and large, we were involved in the 'large 
systems' area -- not so much in the small, entrepreneurial-type technology. 
Aerospace doesn't inspire the David Packards (of Hewlett-Packard) or (Apple 
Computer's) Wozniak and Jobs." 
</P>
<P>
So while Silicon Valley exploded with entrepreneurial electronics and 
biotechnologies culled from Stanford and other nearby schools, this region's 
universities took a more laid-back attitude. "We haven't had the same spirit," 
says Kaplan ruefully. "We always feel we're lagging Stanford by 10 years or 
$500 million." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if these universities don't have the smarts and the technologies to 
offer. But, outside of aerospace and defense, they've historically been 
reluctant to support emerging industries in the way that a Stanford has. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not UCLA? -- I don't know," says UCLA Vice Chancellor for Research Albert 
Barber. "We don't have the kind of policies and procedures that facilitate it; 
we don't hire for it. When people do come on board, there are no peers or 
mentors doing this. While we do have an extremely good industrial affiliates 
program, we don't have very much participation from smaller industry. We don't 
have the kind of programs they participate in." 
</P>
<P>
While Caltech has several professors actively involved in entrepreneurial 
ventures, there has been very little institutional support until recently. 
"It's certainly one of the things I've noticed," says Caltech trustee Benjamin 
Rosen, a top-notch venture capitalist. "It's an interest of mine to stimulate 
that process." Rosen points out that Caltech recently added legendary venture 
capitalist Arthur Rock to its board and that the school wants to play a more 
active role in spurring new ventures locally. Ironically, two of the school's 
sharpest professors -- Carver Mead in chip design and Leroy Hood in 
biotechnology -- ended up co-founding companies in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have universities interested in economic development," says 
Carnegie-Mellon President Richard M. Cyert, who has moved aggressively and 
successfully to turn the Pittsburgh school into a vehicle for regional growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The school also really has to be interested in entrepreneurship. You have to 
be teaching it, fostering it in your student body. You have to have an 
environment where people are on the lookout for new ideas. The results from the 
Southern California universities would indicate that they have not viewed it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
As schools such as Stanford, MIT and Carnegie-Mellon prove, academic excellence 
and economic development are not mutually exclusive. Why shouldn't Southern 
California universities have both? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Barriers 
</P>
<P>
The issue transcends public/private questions and, as former University of 
California President and retiring MIT Chairman David S. Saxon points out: "When 
you talk about biotechnology and information sciences, you are talking about 
enterprises that are knowledge intensive, so that the key resource is people, 
not energy or raw materials." 
</P>
<P>
The real barriers seem to be cultural. Admittedly, Stanford had a brilliant 
provost like Frederick Teman to spot the Hewletts and the Packards and build a 
culture that warmly encouraged university-industry ties. 
</P>
<P>
MIT's Saxon argues that perhaps there have been too many rules and restrictions 
on faculty consulting and participation in new ventures. USC Professor Everett 
Rogers, who has studied patterns of innovation and written extensively on 
Silicon Valley, notes that Los Angeles "is so big that the whole high-tech idea 
gets swallowed up in the smog." 
</P>
<P>
More explicitly, he points out that, unlike Stanford or MIT, "there isn't a 
frontier space" for new companies to grow. "If there were nine square miles 
lying between UCLA and USC then I bet we would see our own version of Silicon 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Exploring 
</P>
<P>
Pick any reason you like -- the reality is that this will become a crucial 
problem for Southern California's universities. Why? For one, we're at a time 
when new ventures are as critical to the advancement of key technologies as 
universities. Simply to stay at the forefront of knowledge, research 
universities have got to create links to innovative firms. Stanford and MIT get 
a lot out of their relationships with new ventures. Entrepreneurial 
environments tend to stimulate basic research as well. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that, as universities continue to raise tuitions and cry for 
more funding to "remain competitive," the community will want to see more for 
its investment than a bunch of graduates and winning football teams. By 
becoming a resource for new industries, universities can play a vital role in 
the region's economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these are issues that the area's universities have already begun to 
explore. If they are gutsy enough, these universities will be simultaneously 
boosting both the quality of education and the quality of life. If they falter, 
they may find themselves slipping further behind Stanford in reputation, wealth 
and influence.
