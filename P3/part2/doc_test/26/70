The first jointly published American-Soviet campus magazine, to be called 
Montage, is expected to make its debut early next year, a Stanford University 
organizer of the project said. "It's an idea whose time has come," said Susan 
McKean, 20, an editor at the Stanford Daily who next month will fly to Moscow 
for the quarterly magazine's first editorial meeting with organizers at Moscow 
State University. The brainchild of McKean and Scott Talcott, 21, a student at 
Pepperdine University, the magazine will be published out of a rented office at 
Stanford, with a first run of 40,000 copies to be mailed to campuses and 
bookstores across both nations.
