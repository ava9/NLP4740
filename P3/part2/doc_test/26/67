The time for expanded U.S. health insurance has come -- and gone -- more than 
once in this country's recent history. Yet the last decade of this century may 
at last see all Americans obtaining the kind of universal coverage that 
citizens of other countries have enjoyed for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the idea of universal care goes back many years. Even the American 
Medical Assn., which torpedoed President Harry S. Truman's 1949 national 
health-insurance plan by labeling it "socialized medicine," saw virtue in it, 
briefly, before World War I. There were other efforts, but pressures for 
universal coverage eased following the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
Now private corporations and public opinion both demand major change, and the 
Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care is developing 
recommendations for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be done? 
</P>
<P>
Our top priority should be better access to care for the uninsured, who may 
number as many as 37 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the leading current proposals, and the best of many market-oriented 
schemes, is the Consumer-Choice Health Plan by Alain C. Enthoven and Richard 
Kronick of the Stanford University School of Business. Its core idea involves 
organizational "sponsors," both private employers and public agencies that 
would be set up by state governments. Sponsors would contract with health-plan 
providers -- mostly health maintenance organizations (HMOs) -- to offer a range 
of coverages at varying prices. Sponsors would pay 80% of the cost. Consumers 
could choose the plan that best matched their needs and would pay the remaining 
20% for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the existing employment-based system, Enthoven-Kronick would 
require that all employers cover full-time employees and pay an 8% payroll tax 
on the earnings of uncovered employees. The tax would help subsidize 
health-care costs for those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line. For 
people below the poverty line, the subsidy would be complete: no premium. 
</P>
<P>
With the subsidies, Enthoven and Kronick expect to achieve nearly universal 
coverage. They claim a strong cost-control component for their program because 
there would be price competition among provider plans. 
</P>
<P>
But every panacea has problems. The emphasis on stimulating market competition 
also stimulates, as the authors acknowledge, competitive strategies "that could 
destroy efficiency and fairness" in pursuit of profits and position. Continuous 
monitoring would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Asking employer sponsors to monitor their own plans forces private businesses 
to make sophisticated judgments, medical and financial, on details of health 
care. Not many firms are able to become health managers on such a scale. State 
sponsors would face the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that competing plans will be available in sparsely populated or 
poor areas is quite dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, many physicians are not likely to appreciate the possibility that 
large prepaid group practices could end up as the successful competitors. 
Available evidence also suggests that patients given a real choice display no 
great love for HMOs, except in the few parts of the country where 
long-established institutions of high repute exist. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Consumer-Choice plan may be an economist's theoretical dream but 
it could be a nightmare, in practice, for patients, doctors and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for a National Health Program, an organization of 400 doctors, 
offers a much different plan -- a universal program, nationally funded but 
state operated. Based on a program in Canada, private insurance would not be 
allowed for coverage duplicating the public plan. Each hospital would receive a 
"global budget" -- a fixed sum -- for the year, negotiated in each state. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents expect that, in the long run, funding for the program would come 
from a progressive national income tax. But for a transition period, a mix of 
national and local, public and private sources would finance the demonstration. 
As an eventual ideal, this proposal has much promise, since the Canadian system 
offers advantages in availability and cost. As a practical matter, within a 
time span that might help people currently uninsured, it is a dubious 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
A President and Congress, reading the public mood after the demise of the 1988 
catastrophic-care law, is unlikely to adopt universal health insurance all at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
The political problems of interest-group accommodation would also be enormous 
in the physicians' plan. Canada is ideologically more open to public-sector 
initiatives than the United States. The proposal acknowledges that elimination 
of private insurance plans would be "politically thorny," but claims it is 
"within the prerogative" of Congress. Legal prerogative is not the issue; 
political strength is, and the insurance industry has plenty of that. 
</P>
<P>
The most practical approach, one that might stand a chance of legislative 
approval in a time of stringent budgeting, is a middle way -- building on the 
employment-based tradition and gradually adding a federal-state public program 
for those uncovered in any other way. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has 
pushed a bill through the Senate Labor Committee that uses this approach. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's basic health benefits bill, S 788, requires employer-provided 
coverage for all full-time employees and dependents, but with financial aid for 
small businesses. For the uninsured, it would establish an income-related 
program phased in over the '90s, with those below the poverty line getting 
immediate coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Private employment would remain the core factor; we would not have to fight the 
battle of "socialized medicine" again. It would also ensure basic coverage for 
all persons in poverty, thus getting away from the complex categorical 
restrictions of Medicaid and Medi-Cal. And by requiring sliding-scale premiums, 
it would embody reasonable self-responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's proposal also has a political leg up: the American Hospital Assn. 
supports it and it fits the AMA's conditional approval of employer-mandating. 
</P>
<P>
A major disadvantage is that it would take a decade to reach all of the 
uninsured. But the phase-in pattern allows for incremental improvements along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy proposal would also complicate an already fragmented U.S. system, 
adding a new public program to Medicare and Medicaid. We need to meld those two 
existing programs, while making the new coverages an incremental extension of a 
unified public-sector health insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
That could make the 1990s the decade in which the right to health care becomes 
a political reality.
