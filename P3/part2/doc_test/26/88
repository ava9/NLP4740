</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford University has scored a recruiting coup by receiving a verbal 
commitment from the nation's highest-rated high school offensive lineman, 
according to reports published today. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Whitfield, a 6-foot, 7-inch, 275-pound tackle from Banning High School in 
Wilmington, notified Stanford of his decision on Tuesday, the San Francisco 
Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner reported. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford spokesman Bob Vazquez said today he could not comment on the reports 
until national letter-of-intent day next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen Wallace of SuperPrep magazine in Orange County, which rated Whitfield 
No. 1 among offensive linemen, called it "the recruiting coup of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"For Stanford to turn the corner, they had to get a player like this," Wallace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal finished 3-6-2 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield reportedly chose Stanford over Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama, Georgia 
and Miami (Fla.) and was influenced strongly by the school's Jan. 3 hiring of 
Dennis Green as head coach to replace Jack Elway.
