<TEXT>
<P>
Harvard University President Derek C. Bok, who during two tumultous decades 
broadened both the reputation and endowment at the nation's oldest university, 
today announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't yet had time to think about what to do next," Bok said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, who became president in 1971, said that "it is time for me to step down 
and allow a new president to provide fresh energy and continuity of leadership 
through the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Costa, a spokesman for the university, said he could not elaborate on 
Bok's reasons for the resignation, which will take effect at the end of the 
1990-91 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, a Stanford University graduate, earned a law degree from Harvard in 1954. 
He joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958 and became dean of the school 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, 60, is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and author 
of several books, including one on labor law that he wrote with Watergate 
prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as Harvard's president, Bok established both the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government and revived an undergraduate core curriculum based 
on the study of classics. 
</P>
<P>
Bok often made headlines with his conservative views on education and business, 
including a controversial stand against a movement for total divestment of the 
university's holdings in stocks of companies doing business in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Among his challenges, he headed the school during sometimes violent 
anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, and negotiated over the years with black 
students and professors arguing for better minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
But most of Bok's efforts were low-key as he worked behind the scenes to 
maintain traditions at Harvard, which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986 
and has one of the nation's richest endowments. 
</P>
<P>
There had been wide speculation in academic circles that Bok would step down 
following the celebration marking the Cambridge institution's founding. 
</P>
<P>
Bok is the son of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge, and his grandmother was 
the daughter of H. K. Curtis, founder of Curtis Publishing Co., which published 
the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
He married Sissela Myrdal, the daughter of Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, 
in 1955. He and his wife, who has a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard and 
teaches at Brandeis University, have three children.
