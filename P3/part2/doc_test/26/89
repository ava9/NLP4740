<F P=106> [Third of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F>
the Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"] 
  [Text] We have now reached the third part in this trilogy 
of articles on Zedillo's team. We began with Salinas' 
associates, continued with Colosio's associates, and now we will 
introduce the most loyal Zedillo associates. This is the group 
that has created the most expectations because it is the closest 
to the candidate and the least known. Once again, these people 
share an impeccable university education and steady progress in 
the government apparatus. 
  For starters, there is Fausto Alzati Araiza, currently 
director of National Council for Science and Technology. He 
studied law at UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] 
and received a master's degree and a doctorate in political 
economics and government from Harvard University. He has worked 
in the energy sector, including Secretariat of Energy, Mines, 
and Parastate Industry and Mexican Petroleum, and has served as 
economic adviser at National Finance, Inc., the Planning and 
Budget Secretariat, and Institute for Political, Economic, and 
Social Studies. 
  Another of Zedillo's cronies is Antonio Arguelles Diaz 
Gonzalez, who studied arts and economics at Stanford University 
at the same time that Cordoba Montoya was working toward his 
master's degree. Arguelles Diaz is now deputy coordinator for 
administration and finance of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential campaign. 
  Hector Morales Corrales, the federal government's spokesman 
in Chiapas, was Zedillo's classmate at the Instituto Politecnico 
Nacional. He has worked in the field of press and public 
relations at System for Complete Family Development, National 
Consumer's Institute, Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, 
SPP [Secretariat for Planning and Budget], and SEP [Secretariat 
for Public Education] with Zedillo. 
  Miguel Antonio Estrada Meza, Zedillo's former private 
secretary while at SEP, has held administrative positions at 
this secretariat and at Baja California's Autonomous University. 
He graduated as a teacher from the Mexicali Teacher's School 
and received a degree in political science from the Baja 
California Autonomous University. In addition, he holds a 
master's degree on pedagogical discipline from California 
University and a doctorate in sociology from UNAM. 
  Another of Zedillo's cronies is Pascual Garcia Alba 
Idunatec. 
Garcia Alba, born in Hidalgo, currently holds the post of deputy 
secretary for educational coordination at SEP. He has a 
master's degree in economics from the College of Mexico and a 
doctorate in economics and a master's degree in arts and 
philosophy from Yale University. 
  There is also a woman, Aurora Pierdant Grunstein, who now 
holds the post at CONAFE [not further identified], an agency 
that supports SEP. She has a degree in economics from ITAM 
[Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico], a master's 
degree in planning from the Social Studies Institute in the 
Netherlands, and a doctorate in economic policies which she 
received in the United Kingdom. She distinguished herself by 
founding the Institute for Peasant Studies. German Andres 
Fernandez Aguirre is a lawyer and has held juridical positions. 
He is linked to Zedillo through SPP, SEP, and, particularly 
through the Banco de Mexico. 
  Fernando Solis Camara y Jimenez Camet played a significant 
role in Zedillo's academic development. Solis Camara has even 
been mentioned in connection with Zedillo's doctoral thesis. 
Solis Camara is an economist who graduated from Anahuac 
University, holds a master's degree in public policy and a 
doctorate in public policy from Harvard University and a 
master's degree in economics from Boston University. 
  Sonora-born Eduardo Guadalupe Almeyda Armenta, the current 
director of professions at SEP, graduated from UNAM's Law 
School. He worked as private secretary and technical secretary 
at SEP, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, the Chamber of 
Deputies, and SPP. 
  A very important young politician and Zedillo's crony is 
Carlos Mancera Corcuera, only 31 years old. He is an economist 
who graduated from ITAM, and he is the son of Miguel Mancera 
Aguayo, the first governor of Banco de Mexico. Zedillo 
appointed him associate director for scientific and 
technological policy at SEP thanks to the man's direct 
relationship with Mancera Aguayo. Zedillo is grateful because 
Mancera Aguayo helped him secure the position of economic 
technical adviser and a scholarship to study in the United 
States. 
  There are other Zedillo associates. Pascual Garcia Alba, a 
classmate at Yale; Raul Talan Ramirez, deputy secretary for 
education, who graduated from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional 
just as Zedillo did; Jose Angel Pescador, Jose Cordoba's 
classmate at Stanford and related to Zedillo through Cordoba; 
Gilberto Guevara Niebla; Olac Fuentes; Antonio Gago Huget, an 
education technician who joined Zedillo's group through SEP; 
German Fernandez Aguirre, lawyer at UNAM and Banco de Mexico; 
Elias Calles, Perez Correa, Juan Rebolledo, Dionisio Perez 
Jacome, and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Zedillo's liaisons with 
the Army, old PRI members, and certain political factions 
outside the PRI. 
  From the profile of these men, probable assistants to the 
probable president of the republic, we can see that the economic 
aspect is adequately covered by experts in the field. The good 
news is that we can predict that the team will be particularly 
sensitive toward social and educational aspects. If the vote 
count favors Zedillo, we will see the presidential ribbon on his 
chest, and in his cabinet we will see many of these names which, 
for the good fortune of Mexico, are not at all improvised or 
inexperienced.
