Irresistible rage; immovable object. A haunted, doomed, hard guy (Lee Marvin, 
at his best), shot down during an Alcatraz robbery, tracks down his betrayers 
mercilessly, inexorably -- through gleaming L.A. offices, vast white storm 
drains, sterile penthouses, hillside bungalows -- only to find that his enemies 
are faceless, unaccountable, buried within the recesses of a huge, impersonal 
organization. This movie plays like some weird mixture of Kafka and Jim 
Thompson, Alain Resnais and Don Siegel ("L'Annee Derniere avec les Killers"?), 
and back in 1967, many critics were bewildered by it. It's an obvious morality 
play: five years before "The Godfather," it posits that big business and big 
crime are identical in their methods. It's also a dreamy rumination on anomie, 
film noir, modern architecture, vendettas and the links between desire and 
death. Director John Boorman fills it with haunting, unforgettable, often 
astonishing images. (Wide screen, cropped.)MICHAEL WILMINGTON
