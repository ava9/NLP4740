  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Otari Kvantrishvili, 
47-year-old Moscow businessman and supposedly a godfather of 
local mafia was killed today, a reliable source told ITAR-TASS. 
Kvantrishvili was shot at 20:30 today when he was leaving 
prestigious Krasnopresnenskiye baths and died while being 
transorted to hospital. The baths were reportedly included in a 
zone of his clan's control. 
  Police obtain no data on possible motives of the killing, 
neither investigators could identify the attacker so far. 
Kvantrishvili, formerly well-known Georgian athlete and coach, 
headed the charity Lev Yashin Foundation protecting interests of 
retired athletes. A year has not passed yet since his elder 
brother Amiran was shot dead at Moscow shootout between domestic 
and outside Chechen mafia clans.
