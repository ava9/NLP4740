"Mainstream world-famous TV Middle America," Peter Falk says slowly, arranging 
the words as if on a banner in his mind that might describe an actor identified 
with one of the most popular characters ever seen on television. "But he's an 
actor who has this kind of schizophrenic existence. A little bit like Charlie 
Chaplin. He's a millionaire by day and a drunk by night. He gets involved with 
things that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The head shakes slightly, the sentence breaks off, and a brief silence fills 
the converted Beverly Hills garage. Falk drops a smoldering cigarette butt to 
the floor and steps on it while his visitor is left to fill in the blank -- 
most likely with memories of some of Falk's many feature films or at least with 
some of their titles. For, in fact, Peter Falk is talking about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This disease of mine, it goes way back, back to when I first came to 
Hollywood," he says, referring to one of his early movies, 1963's "The 
Balcony," based on the absurdist play by Jean Genet. Around Falk are tables and 
easels bearing the charcoal figure drawings he does when he is not in front of 
a camera. "I did that with Shelley Winters and Lee Grant and the fellow from 
the spaceship (Leonard Nimoy). It was directed by Joe Strick. We all worked for 
nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
And where audiences were concerned, it came to nothin', which bode a pattern 
for his film career. Never mind the Oscar nominations Falk had received for his 
first two film roles -- in "Murder, Inc." (1960) and "Pocketful of Miracles" 
(1961) -- what followed were such offbeat, commercially lackluster films as 
"Robin and the Seven Hoods" (1964), "Penelope" (1966), "Luv" (1967), "Machine 
Gun McCain" (1970), "Husbands" (1970), "Mikey and Nicky" (1976) and, more 
recently, "Big Trouble," "Wings of Desire," "Happy New Year," "Vibes," "Cookie" 
and "In the Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Falk runs a title check through his mind and observes, "These are not 
traditional, mainstream, big-budget action pictures. I don't know how you would 
characterize them. I guess you would say they're unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The newest addition to Falk's "unusual" filmography is "Tune in Tomorrow . . . 
" (which opens Friday), a radically altered adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa's 
modern Peruvian novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," which has been reset 
in 1950 New Orleans and directed by the Englishman Jon Amiel from a script by 
the Scot William Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
In this transcultural comedy, Falk plays an eccentric Irish-Mexican writer of 
radio dramas, Pedro Carmichael, who is newly relocated to the Deep South, where 
he is packing his newest plot with details of a May-December romance between a 
20-year-old protege (Keanu Reeves) and the young writer's 35ish aunt (Barbara 
Hershey). 
</P>
<P>
"Tune in Tomorrow . . . " is a seriously odd movie that merges the real events 
going on in Pedro's New Orleans with lifelike dramatizations of Pedro's soap 
operas. It does offer Falk a chance to dress up like a rabbi, a surgeon and a 
French maid ("a very specific French maid"), since Pedro is a writer who needs 
to put on costumes to fully understand his characters. But is it going to 
change his luck on the big screen? 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was like the spiritual godfather of 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty,' " Falk 
says, explaining why he said yes to the role after once rejecting it. "David 
Lynch, 'Twin Peaks,' they owe a debt to Pedro Carmichael, who as early as 1950, 
before television, knew that people had a desire to know about other people's 
hidden sexual preferences." 
</P>
<P>
In Llosa's 1982 book, however, Pedro was less of a con man than he has become 
in the screen version, which has Falk playing him as a wacky sage who 
deliberately fuels the fire between Aunt Julia and the young scriptwriter for 
his own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Irish, the Blarney, the manipulator, that mischievous sense of 
humor, that flamboyant artistic thing," Falk says, citing the things he liked 
about Pedro Carmichael. When producer John Fiedler first sent him the script, 
he turned it down because "I knew that part was a terrific part, but I had a 
problem: I didn't know how to play it." 
</P>
<P>
When Fiedler, who had been working at Columbia, re-submitted the script to Falk 
a year later, Amiel was attached as the director and the project was looking 
for a studio (eventually landing at Cinecom). Amiel asked Falk to think about 
the character's name. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he's half Mexican and half Irish. When I heard he was Irish, that rang 
a bell. There were certain lines that I didn't know how to say, that if you 
said them with a trace of Irish or an Irish feeling, they worked. Then I said 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
Falk, born in New York in 1927, began acting off-Broadway in the 1950s. It was 
after the Oscar nominations and "The Balcony" and assorted other Hollywood 
ventures that he first put on the moldy raincoat and quizzical smiles of Lt. 
Columbo in a 1967 made-for-TV movie. In 1971, "Columbo" became a series, and in 
the years since -- including a 10-year layoff between 1978 and 1988 -- the show 
has brought him four Emmies and defined him to the world. He insists that he 
still enjoys it -- "In terms of playing the character, I still get a kick out 
of it. I love it when it works" -- but it has not contained his ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the first year of 'Columbo,' 'Columbo' was Jesus Christ, No. 1, you 
know," he says in his raspy Long Island syntax, thrusting his arms skyward as 
if signaling a touchdown. "So during the day it was Charlie Chaplin, and at 
night I was with (John) Cassavetes and (Ben) Gazzara trying to get the money to 
make this picture 'Husbands.' And the second year of 'Columbo,' soon as I get a 
hiatus, I went and made 'Woman Under the Influence,' with Cassavetes and Gena 
Rowlands. The third year of 'Columbo,' the drunk came out and we made 'Mikey 
and Nicky' with Elaine May." 
</P>
<P>
Falk's kinship with Cassavetes, the late maverick director who relied heavily 
on improvisation and defied Hollywood conventions, is a clue that his instincts 
have never led him to play it safe. In 1963, he became the first American movie 
actor to work in the Soviet Union, traveling there against the advice of 
friends in Hollywood to make "Italiano Bravo Gente" because, he says, "I wanted 
to see Russia!" 
</P>
<P>
Falk acknowledges a debt to Cassavetes, whom he believes set "standards of 
immediacy" for acting and actors in his films. "He was concerned with emotional 
complexities and ambiguities that you don't find in movies." 
</P>
<P>
It was from seeing him in Cassavetes' pictures, as much as 'Columbo,' that 
German director Wim Wenders decided to cast Falk as an ex-angel in "Wings of 
Desire," his mostly black-and-white symphony on the unexamined joys of 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Falk never expected "Wings" to even reach the United States. "I was amazed it 
ever showed up here." It did not scratch the surface of Columbo's audience, but 
it was an art-house hit and easily the most critically respected movie Falk has 
had a sizable role in since 1974's "Woman Under the Influence." 
</P>
<P>
As for his other recent films, Falk has been, well, unlucky. They seem to be 
pictures that get held up in release, suffer from lack of promotion, are not 
widely seen or not very good. Among them, Elaine May's "In the Spirit," Susan 
Seidelman's "Cookie," John Avildsen's "Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
Have such misadventures been the result of deliberately sticking to "unusual" 
films, or are these the only movie offers that Falk gets? 
</P>
<P>
"I've said no," Falk says, lighting another in a long chain of smokes. "I also 
would have said yes if they had asked me for certain things. So we're talking 
about both. There are certain very popular pictures that I would die to be in, 
yet there were other very popular pictures that I didn't want to be in. And I 
don't want to get specific about naming them. But both things apply." 
</P>
<P>
Falk is looking ahead to another unusual project, "My Dog Stupid," based on the 
John Fante book and to be directed by France's Claude Berri. He will play the 
part of Fante, a late, neglected Hollywood novelist now being rediscovered. 
"It's about the relationship between John Fante and his kids during the '60s," 
Falk says, adding, somewhat superfluously, "It's not the same thing as 
'Columbo.' " 
</P>
<P>
On a table across the room, mostly covered with stacks of books on Degas, 
Matisse and other artists, two of Falk's Emmies can be seen. But only the lower 
halves of their golden torsos are visible, because they are currently serving 
as hat racks. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife found a use for them," Falk says.

Peter Falk's award-winning work as TV's Lt. Columbo has made him an 
international star, but his taste for quirky roles has kept him out of the film 
mainstream. His latest is "Tune in Tomorrow" with Barbara Hershey and Keanu 
Reeves.
