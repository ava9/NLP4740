JAPAN'S disgraced political godfather, Mr Shin Kanemaru, emerged from his
home yesterday after 35 days in seclusion, vowing never to break the law
again, and presuming that his period of isolation will allow him to return
as the powerbroker of Japanese politics.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, who presides over the largest faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, made clear that the rites of purification are officially
over, and that his violation of the Political Funds Control Law should be
forgotten.
Having illegally received Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a scandal-tainted parcel
delivery company, the 'godfather', as he is known, was summarily fined only
Y200,000 (Pounds 966) this week and had the luxury of drafting his
confession in his Tokyo home.
By remaining at home, and out of sight for a month, Mr Kanemaru has
attempted to outwit his opponents by outwaiting them. While petitions
circulated calling for his resignation, the godfather stayed behind closed
doors, portraying himself both as a victim of media harassment and as a
repentant one-time offender.
It is customary for the accused in Japan, particularly politicians, to seek
refuge in isolation, most often a 'sudden illness' requiring
hospitalisation. A Japanese tabloid yesterday favourably compared Mr
Kanemaru's strategy to that of the 'besieged samurai', waiting patiently for
the enemy to exhaust its energy.
But the public outcry over his lenient treatment has yet to disappear.
A manager at a Japanese cosmetics company said he was 'speechless' at the
antics of Mr Kanemaru, and a 26-year-old teacher said that she and her
parents had spent the last month 'amazed by the arrogance' of the godfather.
Some were struck by the irony that he chose 'Respect the Law Day' to make
his reappearance, which followed pleas from his fellow faction members that
they wanted him to remain at the helm, if only to prevent the faction from
collapsing under the combined weight of the potential successors' ambitions.
Mr Kanemaru announced a month ago that he received Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa
Kyubin, and said then he would resign as head of the faction and
vice-president of the LDP. But during his period of contemplation at home,
made bearable by his love of board games and telephone politicking, he
decided to hold on to retake the factional post.
'I am sorry for having caused trouble to everyone, including my neighbours,'
Mr Kanemaru said. His neighbours have suffered greatly over the past month,
as television vans, camera operators, police and protesters have crammed the
streets surrounding his home.
Mr Kanemaru said: 'I swear I will never repeat anything like this in my
life,' suggesting that he intends to remain politically active.
