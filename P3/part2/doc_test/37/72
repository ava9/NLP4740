WHAT ABOUT 'CATS'? 
</P>

<TEXT>

I take offense at some of the inane remarks made by Timberlake Wertenbaker in 
your " 'Angry Young Man' is a Woman" article of Sept. 10. So films are for 
children, and plays are the "real" intellectual voice? Might I suggest to our 
pompous playwright that Olivier made "Hamlet"; Welles made "Citizen Kane," and 
Coppola made the "Godfather" films -- all for adults. I guess "Starlight 
Express," "Cats" and, God-only-knows, how many dreary theater revivals are 
Wertenbaker's idea of stimulation for the mind.
