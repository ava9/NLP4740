film director Barry Levinson

CONSIDER THIS American career story. A man starts out writing sketches for
comedy shows on local TV. He graduates to scripting for Mel Brooks and gets
to stab Mr Brooks in the shower in a cameo role in High Anxiety. He turns
director with a cult teenage-recall film called Diner. He follows with two
giant box-office hits called Good Morning Vietnam and Rain Man. He turns
round and makes a tiny autobiographical film, Avalon. He then turns round
again and summons ten Oscar nominations with a big-budget, Warren
Beatty-starring gangster film called Bugsy.
That Barry Levinson, in both career and habitat, is a rule unto himself is
clear from his office at 20th Century Fox: lots of friendly clatter, plastic
coffee-cups and a tousled Mr L who eats out of takeaway Chinese cartons.
Levinson - I met him before Bugsy had opened, let alone won a Golden Globe
and Critics Prize for Best Film of 1991 - gives the impression of running a
cottage industry. But as a film-maker he is more and more fascinated by the
way humble human values are corrupted by dwarfing ambitions or cultural
tyrannies. Avalon was about the curse of TV on postwar family life. Rain Man
was about the potential curse of a yuppie's greed on an autistic brother.
And the potent black-comedy elements in Bugsy come from the inner clash
between Siegel's vestigial seam of charm and innocence and his giant streak
of malevolent ambition.
'What fascinated me is, here was a gangster who wanted to be a film star,
who used glamour to disguise his more sociopathic behaviour. I'd always seen
gangsters as East Coast: overcoats, hats, the Godfather look. I'd never seen
a 'Hollywood' gangster before, a man who needed that finesse and facade in
order to function.
'Bugsy Siegel wanted to be an actor. But he failed, so he became another
kind of star. He built the Flamingo Hotel, which was the foundation stone of
Las Vegas, and he took the Hollywood glamour to the desert where he played
host to the entertainers.'
But doesn't the film itself, especially in presenting Siegel in the
ladykilling form of Warren Beatty, risk glamorising evil? 'No, I don't think
so. The danger is that society itself allows these men to exist. A killer
doesn't walk around a party looking like a killer. He can be handsome,
debonair; the fact that he is among us and unobserved is what's
frightening.'
So is the volatile performance the director has coaxed from Warren Beatty.
Typically of a Levinson film Bugsy itself is as mixed-mood as its main
character. 'If it works, it's because we've totally broken up the gangster
genre. We're more humorous, more romantic, but along with that there's a
darker side. It might offend some people who think 'Oh you can only be a
comedy or a romance or a thriller.' We're all of those things.'
Bugsy, Oscars regardless, has paid for its sophistication by performing
unspectacularly at the box office. But then Levinson, with a few lapses, has
consistently seemed more interested in selling truth than in selling
tickets. Even when sucked into the rubbish zone, as with Young Sherlock
Holmes or the more empty-headed parts of The Natural and Good Morning
Vietnam, he has struggled out again and tried to renew his identity. His
Baltimore trilogy - Diner, Tin Men, Avalon - is a unique attempt by a
high-profile American director to make a plain-spun movie series about his
own home town.
The big films help to finance the small. 'There's nothing worse to a studio
than a director saying 'I want to do a personal film.' It's almost offensive
to them. So by doing a Rain Man, it lets you do an Avalon.' And Avalon is
all about the kind of processed thinking that mass entertainment encourages
and that the studios, Levinson implies, subscribe to.
'The key to that piece was television. TV, I believe, has had an effect we
cannot yet understand, in undermining families and all kinds of values. I
remember the TV coming into my family's house, all wrapped up like a
wonderful gift, and everybody gathered round. I remember visiting my
grandfather; he was all alone with the TV on in the background and I
thought, 'There is a story here.' An entire sense of communal living has
disappeared. People start having their trays in front of the TV; the family
dinner, that kind of togetherness, becomes a thing of the past.'
The curse of television doesn't stop with the family. 'Because of TV today
we want to understand everything instantly or we want nothing to do with it.
Take advertising. You have to sell your movie in a 30-second slot. How do
you do it? You can't. So you simplify and coarsen what it's about. I have a
fear we will end up with an age of Batmans and Terminators and whatever else
is high, high concept. I think we're seeing the death of complexity when
films like, say, Treasure Of The Sierra Madre won't get made any more.
'People have been brainwashed to want great simplicity. How else do you
explain that here in America in the 1990s abortion is a major political
issue? When there are so many world concerns - famines, wars, economic
crises - we're hammering away at abortion. It's because it's an emotional,
quick issue and everyone can take sides about it. It's the TV culture.
Everything has to march to the signal and tempo it sets.'
The same hatred of pre-fabricated ideas and rhythms influenced his direction
of Rain Man. Inheriting the project from Spielberg, who had worked on it for
months but was then obliged to go and make Indiana Jones 3, Levinson risked
studio odium by throwing out much of the stuff his predecessor had left
behind.
'The biggest change was getting rid of the adventure elements. Chases,
fights. I said, 'Let's just have two guys on the road.' There's ambitious
Charlie, who's got a soft centre. And Raymond, the immovable autistic. Let's
have the con man try to con the guy who can't be reached. At some point he,
Charlie, will have to turn back on himself because the other guy won't
respond. It's like hitting a ball at a wall. So that was what we did. Made
it a character study, pure and simple.'
Which is what at heart Bugsy is. The question is: what sort of character?
I'm still preoccupied with the glamorised gangster question. Bugsy is part
of a flood of Mafia and mobster films issuing from Hollywood during the last
twelvemonth. What is the attraction? And what does the phenomenon tell us
about the world or America itself?
'We are this young country,' answers Levinson after a pause, 'with no
history. We didn't have kings or queens. We didn't have King Arthur. So
we've invented our own mythology, which has become part of the genres we
work. It may be part of our sick society that we keep dredging up this
criminal past. But there is a fascination. Maybe we have to know ourselves
thoroughly before we can cure ourselves.'
