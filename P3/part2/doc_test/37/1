COPPOLA TO RESHOOT PORTIONS OF 'GODFATHER, PART III'

After spending $55 million and six months behind the camera, director Francis 
Ford Coppola will return to Italy to reshoot portions of his upcoming epic, 
"The Godfather, Part III," according to sources close to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 million in reshoots -- one week in Sicily in early September, followed 
by one week in New York, and involving stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton -- will 
boost the cost of the troubled production to more than $60 million, the sources 
said. Coppola has said that the film was budgeted at $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures President Sidney Ganis denied that there were problems with 
the movie. He said "any costs associated (with the reshoots) were absolutely, 
unequivocally budgeted" and involve "no major material whatsoever, only 
incidental scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Ganis declined to say whether Pacino and Keaton are involved in the new 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say the additional filming involves a love scene between Michael 
Corleone (Pacino) and his ex-wife (Keaton) and the clarification of a plot line 
about Corleone's connection to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather III" focuses on Corleone's attempts to legitimize his empire by 
acquiring a European real estate firm, his Vatican connection and his 
relationships with his estranged son and wife. When Corleone takes ill during 
the height of a renewed gang war, he passes the baton of power to his 
illegitimate nephew (Andy Garcia). 
</P>
<P>
Both Paramount and Coppola have a lot riding on the much-heralded project. The 
first two "Godfather" movies -- released in 1972 and 1974 -- together grossed 
more than $700 million at theaters and earned another $100 million in TV and 
video sales. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which has lost its historical dominance at the box office, could use 
another artistic and commercial success of that magnitude. The studio has been 
trying to get "Godfather III" off the ground since 1974, when the first sequel 
to Coppola's epic became a smash box-office hit and earned an Academy Award for 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
For Coppola, "Godfather III" is a chance to revive his sagging reputation as 
one of the country's premier filmmakers and to pay off debts that forced him to 
put his Zoetrope Productions into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He is being 
paid $6 million to direct the film, sources close to the project say.
