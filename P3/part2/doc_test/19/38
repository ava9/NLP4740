<TEXT>
Mr Menachem Begin, former Israeli prime minister who negotiated the Camp
David peace agreement with Egypt, was critically ill last night after a
heart attack at his Tel Aviv home, writes Hugh Carnegy. The condition of Mr
Begin, aged 78 and a near recluse since he resigned as premier in 1983, was
said to have improved during the day. But he remained unconscious and was on
a respirator. Mr Begin won the Nobel peace prize jointly with the late
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt for the 1979 accords.
