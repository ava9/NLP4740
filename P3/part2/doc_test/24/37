In successive years, Mt. Carmel went from holding the keys to the section to 
watching as the locks were changed. Now what for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 6, top-seeded Mt. Carmel (21-5) meets second-seeded Santana (24-4) 
in a rematch of the 1988 San Diego Section Division I girls' basketball final, 
which Mt. Carmel won, 57-47. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils danced with history then. But a year later, they tripped over 
their own feet, losing to Santana, 54-46, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was in a semifinal two years ago that Mt. Carmel was able to do something 
that hadn't been done in the section playoffs for three years and hasn't been 
done there since: defeat Point Loma. The Pointers had won three consecutive 
section, Southern California Regional and state Division I championships. The 
upset was one of the biggest of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday in a semifinal against Poway, a team it had beaten only once in four 
meetings this season, Mt. Carmel again scored a magical victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate drawing parallels," Mt. Carmel Coach Peggy Brose said. "Beating Point 
Loma, that was special and emotional for us. Poway was the emotion this year." 
</P>
<P>
It was so emotional that Santana Coach Wade Vickery said Mt. Carmel should be 
content with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should be satisfied with that, then take it easy on us," he said. 
"They won the Poway championship." 
</P>
<P>
And about that beachfront property in Arizona . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brose said she discussed the possibility of a letdown with her players at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
"We said let's not be content with that," she said. "We put Poway in 
perspective. You don't play just to get to the final. So there's no problem 
with motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the players in this final saw considerable playing time in 1988: junior 
Vicki de Jesus (5-8, 17-point average) of Mt. Carmel and three from Santana: 
senior Rebecca Aase (5-8, 19) and juniors Stephanie Thompson (5-10, 18) and 
Desiree Weimann (5-4, 18). 
</P>
<P>
Vickery said it will help to have three girls who are experienced and not in 
awe of reaching a section championship. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel is concerned with all three but especially Weimann. She was missing 
when Mt. Carmel defeated Santana, 58-54, in December. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the floor leader," Brose said. "She makes them go. I've seen them play 
with her and without her. They have a hard time carrying the floor without 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Santana primarily wants to keep de Jesus in check. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want de Jesus to go crazy on us," Vickery said. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE
