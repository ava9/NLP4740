ARMSTRONG IS NAMED ST. AUGUSTINE COACH

Jeff Armstrong has been named the new basketball coach at St. Augustine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Armstrong took over a Granite Hills team that had gone 1-21 
the previous season and proceeded to build a 43-29 record. But he wasn't a 
full-time teacher, and the St. Augustine job, vacant since Dick Hardick 
resigned after last season, offered a teaching position as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I will have an opportunity to teach, plus the fact that it 
sounds to me like the school really supports building the athletic program, are 
basically the two reasons I decided to take the challenge," Armstrong said. 
"They're building a new weight room, a new track, and they hired a new athletic 
director and football coach (Marty Martin) last year. They're basically 
rebuilding the athletic program." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' basketball team was 2-18 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaching changes: Tim Meinert is leaving as baseball coach at Christian 
High for a teaching job La Jolla Country Day, where he will likely assist Peter 
Ogle with the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going for the teaching job," Meinert said. "I was offered a job as the 
head of the math department and teaching three classes. It's a lighter load and 
more money. My wife just had a baby two weeks ago and quit work, so our income 
was cut in half. I knew then I'd have to look around. I know Peter wants me to 
work with him, but we haven't worked out the details yet." 
</P>
<P>
Meinert's replacement at Christian has not been named. 
</P>
<P>
In another baseball coaching change, Dave Heid has resigned at Fallbrook. His 
replacement has not been named, either. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, Chip Holmes is replacing Jan Chapman at Hilltop, and Steve Milke 
will not return as head coach at Bonita Vista. 
</P>
<P>
And Shawn Wirth, athletic director at Torrey Pines, is giving up some of her 
day-to-day responsibilities as the school's gymnastics coach and will hire two 
more coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal (Nancy Giberson) didn't want me to coach, because it took away 
from my primary job as athletic director (during the spring)," Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines gymnast Tasha Taylor finished 22nd out of 60 gymnasts Friday at 
the National High School Gymnastics Meet in Rolling Meadows, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Her best event was the uneven parallel bars, where she was 11th with an 8.85. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to compete two days in a row, so she just didn't do very well," Wirth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was an accomplishment that Taylor even arrived at the meet. She won 
the San Diego Section optional all-around title Thursday -- her second in two 
years -- and then flew all night to get to the national meet, which began at 11 
a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Scott Karl threw a three-hitter Saturday as Carlsbad beat Crawford, 
9-0, in a San Diego Section 2-A baseball playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But while Karl handed Crawford its first shutout this season, he didn't help 
the Carlsbad offense much: He was the lone Lancer to go hitless. And he bats 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can pitch like this, I don't care about batting," Karl said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Karl has pitched Carlsbad into this afternoon's championship game against 
Grossmont after recovering from a broken ankle. He broke it playing soccer this 
winter, and three screws were inserted during surgery on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
After a late start, Karl has made a pretty good recovery. He is 5-1 with a 0.00 
earned-run average in 38 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel second baseman Ed Cornblum hit a two-run home run in the third 
inning of Mt. Carmel's 5-4 victory over Mira Mesa in a San Diego Section 3-A 
baseball semifinal game Saturday at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
What have Cornblum's teammates called him all season? "Shortage," as in power 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Webb is attending a City Council meeting this morning to ask the city 
to help subsidize the section football championships in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A five-year agreement to use the stadium for the 2-A and 3-A championships, 
during which the city contributed as much as $8,700 each year, has expired. 
Webb is negotiating a new two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for last year's games was $17,787. That covered the cost of rent, 
lights, sound system and scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Three San Diego athletes own the top marks in the state going into this 
weekend's state track meet: Orange Glen's Lenny McGill in the triple jump 
(50-4), Fallbrook's Brent Noon in the shot put (69-8 1/4, state record) and 
Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen in the 1,600 (4:53.66).
