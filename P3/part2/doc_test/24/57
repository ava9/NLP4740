<P>
The girls' basketball game between Ramona and San Marcos Thursday night evolved 
into something resembling "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we were two different teams out there," Ramona's Kris Miller said 
after Ramona stormed back from a 29-9 halftime deficit to defeat sixth-ranked 
San Marcos, the Avocado League champion, 51-44. 
</P>
<P>
"All week," Miller said, "we were saying, 'We're not going to let San Marcos go 
undefeated in league.' " 
</P>
<P>
But visiting Ramona (18-3, 12-2) came painfully close to missing deadline on 
the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos came out in the first half and denied Ramona the chance to shoot, 
rebound, pass and score, taking a 13-6 first-quarter lead and extending it in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just comatose in the first half," said Miller, who was held scoreless 
before halftime but came alive, along with her teammates, after a brutal 
halftime talk by Ramona Coach Joe Bess to finish with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He usually never yells at us," Miller said. "But we've never been down by that 
much, either." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos (18-6, 13-1) was already assured of the league championship after 
Tuesday's victory over Oceanside, which at the time was tied for second place 
with Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos' Suzie O'Brien, the county's leading scorer at just under 30 points 
a game, was effective in the first half, scoring 15 points and pulling down 
eight rebounds. But as the game wore on, Ramona chipped away at the Knights' 
lead and that effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien scored just 11 points (with two field goals) in the second half. Four 
of her seven second-half free throws came after Ramona had taken a 47-38 lead, 
cutting the deficit to 47-42. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona took its first lead -- 39-38 -- with 4:26 remaining on Miller's shot off 
her own rebound. The Bulldogs scored then eight more points in a row to end a 
15-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard when you kill them in the first half," O'Brien said. "I don't 
know what happened. Nothing fell, and they played a great defensive game." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona slowed San Marcos with a second-half full-court press after playing 
man-to-man defense in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"They handled our press," Bess said, "but we were able to get control of the 
tempo." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE In other Avocado League girls' games: Oceanside 61, El

round, scored 12 points, had 11 rebounds and five blocks and Tiffany Booth had
