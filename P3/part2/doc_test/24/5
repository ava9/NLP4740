Arms folded and eyes staring straight ahead, Southwest High School Coach Steve 
Selland could only dream of a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could play them again," Selland said Wednesday night after Southwest 
lost to visiting Sweetwater, 61-53, in what may be remembered as the game of 
the season in the Metro Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra stopped short of wishing for a rematch, but said 
the teams could meet again and again, with an eventual victor unlikely to 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"We could play 10 more times," Ybarra said, "and we'd probably split five and 
five." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had much at stake. For fifth-ranked Sweetwater, it was the chance to 
redeem itself from its only loss to Southwest, 61-57, on Jan. 6 at Sweetwater. 
It would also give the Red Devils a chance to take over first place in the 
conference standings. Sweetwater (22-2 overall, 11-1 in conference) is now a 
half-game ahead of third-ranked Southwest (18-6, 10-1). 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater denied Southwest the victory with a third-quarter 20-11 run that was 
highlighted by Cortez Rice's seven points and Ruben Hernandez's six points. 
</P>
<P>
Add a basket by John Gilbert and the Red Devils had a 37-27 lead with 3:38 
remaining in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Cortez Rice was the difference for them tonight," Selland said. "He'd take 
those outside shots. My outside shooters just didn't do it." Rice finished with 
19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest came back to within six at the end of the third quarter on a 
controversial goaltending call that made Sweetwater's lead, 42-36. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Southwest tied the score, 45-45, with 5:41 remaining, 
when Sweetwater called a timeout. The Red Devils came back with a 9-0 run that 
left Southwest stunned. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tate, who led the Raiders with a game-high 30 points, said Southwest just 
wasn't playing like a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't get it together today," Tate said. "Our strength is good 
chemistry, and today we weren't in sync." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater held Adalberto Silva, the Raiders' leading scorer, to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ybarra: "They had a heck of a defensive game. Anytime they went inside, we 
double-teamed them. They played disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater, which made only 11 for 31 shots in the first half, trailed by 13-10 
after the first period and 25-22 by the end of the second quarter, when 
Southwest employed a spread defense to hold on to its slim lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to keep their composure," Ybarra said. "I told them that the shots 
they were taking were good, they were just missing on a couple." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Campbell had 16 points for Sweetwater.
