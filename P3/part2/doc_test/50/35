Two 1988 U.S. Olympic heroes won events Friday in the opening day of the Santa 
Clara International Swim Meet, but their times were well off world and American 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi, of Castro Valley, Calif., who won seven medals in Seoul, held off 
Bart Pippenger of Kamiah, Idaho, who was competing for the Las Vegas Gold, to 
win the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi was clocked in 56.06 seconds, which didn't threaten Pablo Morales' world 
and American standard of 52.84 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Triple gold-medal winner Janet Evans of Placentia, who attends Stanford 
University, bested Michelle Von Notze of Australia in the women's 400-meter 
individual medley. She finished in 4:57.13, nearly 20 seconds slower than her 
American record of 4:37.76. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other six individual winners in the first day of the three-day meet 
came close to the record books either.
