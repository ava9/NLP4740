Lynda Tolbert of Arizona State set a U.S. Olympic Festival record in the 
women's 100-meter hurdles Sunday, winning in 13.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second festival gold medal for Tolbert, who also won the event in 
1987. Her time broke the mark of 13.04 set by Stephanie Hightower seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hot and humid,"' Tolbert said. "I'm sweltering like a wet puppy, 
but otherwise it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
The temperature three feet above the surface of the John Jacobs track was 
measured at 103 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Tolbert, who lives in Washington, D.C., said she took it easy because of sore 
hamstrings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go much, much faster," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonie Campbell of Ontario, Calif., the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist, pulled 
away to win the 110-meter hurdles in 13.54 seconds. NCAA champion Robert 
Reading of USC was a close second in 13.57. 
</P>
<P>
Debbi Lawrence, the 1988 Olympic trials champion in the women's 10-kilometer 
walk, won the event in 49:21.80. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20-kilometer walk, Richard Quinn of San Francisco won in 1 hour 32 
minutes 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Scoggin of Austin, Tex., nailed his final two dives to win the 10-meter 
platform gold medal. Scoggin trailed Scott Donie of Houston by 24 points after 
eight dives, then received scores of 86.40 and 81.60 to finish with 581.85 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Donie was second. 
</P>
<P>
The women's platform championship went to Cokey Smith of Ann Arbor, Mich., her 
first victory in a national meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bela Karolyi's gymnasts took eight of 12 medals on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Zmeskal, 13, of Houston, who won golds for the all-around and team 
competition Friday, got a gold and two silvers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Scherr, 14, of Cincinnati won the vault, and Erika Stokes, 13, won the 
balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12-year-old Shannon Miller, of Edmond, Okla., broke up Karolyi's 
Gymnastics' dominance by winning the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
"The flame is burning in gymnastics," Karolyi said. "Fifteen and 16 are the 
best years for gymnastics. These kids will all be 15 and 15 1/2 (for the 1992 
Olympics)." 
</P>
<P>
Rowing gold medals were won by Allan Green of Barrington, R.I., in men's single 
sculls; Linda Muri of Danielson, Conn., in women's singles sculls; Tim Huller 
of King of Prussia, Pa., and Tom Ferlick of Wayne, Pa., in junior men's 
doubles; Marty Patton of La Jolla and Megan Webster of Carlisle, Mass., in 
women's lightweight doubles, and David Kosicz, now living in Canada, and Stefan
