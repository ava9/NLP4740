office

June is shaping up as a more than usually magical month for Walt Disney. The
US entertainment giant got off to a nice start this week when a Saudi
Arabian prince swept to the rescue of Euro Disney, its financially troubled
French theme park associate.
Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt
Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low-budget sequel to its
hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market - bypassing
cinemas - and this follow-up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big
hit.
It is the first time Disney has made a full-length film purely for the video
market, a sector dominated by cheap children's fare and exercise tapes with
inspiring titles like 'Buns of Steel'.
The gamble is paying off. Across the US, children under the age of 10 are
pestering parents for a copy, and industry experts suggest 'Jafar' could
become one of the 10 best-selling videos of all time.
But Disney's biggest June success has yet to come: in the middle of the
month it will release its latest full-length animated movie, 'The Lion
King', the story of a young lion that becomes king of the jungle after
fighting off a wicked uncle who kills his father. In other words, Bambi
crossed with Hamlet in an exotic African setting.
It has superb animation, music by British pop star Elton John, and a strong
cast of actors' voices, which includes Jeremy Irons, Rowan Atkinson and
Whoopi Goldberg. No wonder Hollywood is confidently predicting it will be
the runaway hit film of the summer.
That would be no small achievement, because the summer season is one of
Hollywood's most important periods of the year, accounting for some 40 per
cent of the annual American box office take.
But this year the season - which began with last weekend's Memorial Day
public holiday and ends with Labor Day in early September - is producing
much more than the normal quotient of hysterical Hollywood nail-biting.
There are two reasons. First, spring was unusually bad at the box office,
with so few American-made hits that a low-budget British comedy, 'Four
Weddings and a Funeral', briefly became the most popular movie in the
country.
Second, the studios are releasing an extraordinary number of films this
summer - about 60 - and they cannot all be hits. Films that do not perform
well over the weekend they are released, or during the subsequent weekend,
will be quickly and cold-bloodedly yanked from cinema schedules.
Hollywood will be hard-pressed to match the success of last summer, when
'Jurassic Park', the dinosaurs-run-amuck movie directed by Steven Spielberg
and backed by Universal Studios, broke all box office records and powered
the industry to an unprecedented Dollars 2.1bn in ticket sales. This paved
the way for a record annual Dollars 5.1bn at the US box office.
But at least half a dozen films could break through the Dollars 100m barrier
for total US box office sales which traditionally marks a film as a
blockbuster - and they will need to if the studios are to make a decent
profit, since some of the most ambitious movies cost Dollars 40m to Dollars
50m to make.
'True Lies', a spy adventure from Rupert Murdoch's Fox group, starring
muscle-man Arnold Schwarzenegger, is rumoured to have cost more than Dollars
100m. Schwarzenegger, reunited with the director who made his big hit
'Terminator 2', will be trying to put behind him one of last summer's
biggest flops, 'Last Action Hero'.
The season has got off to a strong start. 'The Flintstones', produced by
Spielberg and distributed by Universal, took a record Dollars 37.5m at the
box office over the Memorial Day weekend. That just topped the Dollars
37.03m taken in 1989 by 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. The film has
real actors playing characters from the 1950s cartoon series of the same
name, with its Stone Age setting and signature cry of 'Yabba Dabba Doo'. The
movie has been widely panned. Critics' barbed puns range from 'Yabba Dabba
Don't', to 'Yabba Dabba Doo-Doo'.
But it seems certain to maintain its strong run ('have legs', in the
industry jargon), thanks to a huge tie-in marketing campaign, involving
1,000 products ranging from McDonald's hamburgers to Flintstone catapults.
The success of the 'Flintstones' has overshadowed the strong start made by
Warner Brothers' 'Maverick'. Starring heart-throb Mel Gibson, this is
another in a long line of movies this year which revamp television series.
The trend has critics wondering about the paucity of Hollywood's
imagination.
Others with hit potential include 'City Slickers 2', a follow-up to the
success that comedian Billy Crystal had with the first modern-day western
with this title; 'Forrest Gump', the story of a simpleton starring Tom
Hanks; and 'Speed', about a bus rigged by a psychotic to explode if it slows
below 50mph.
But the season should still belong to 'The Lion King', which industry
observers think could top Dollars 200m in total US box office receipts. With
that and the Saudi rescue under his belt, Mr Eisner might be heard muttering
'Hakuna Matata', the Swahili motto adopted in the film by the would-be lion
king. It means 'no worries'.
