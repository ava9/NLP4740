The thunder of dinosaur feet in Jurassic Park is likely only to be beaten
this weekend by the thunder of movie-goers' feet as they stampede to cinemas
to see Steven Spielberg's latest blockbuster movie, which is previewed in
the UK this evening.
Those who prefer to turn their backs on this somewhat prehistoric method of
getting a seat can use technology to ensure a place at the front of the
queue.
MGM Cinemas is using a fully automatic ticket booking service for customers
in 34 cinemas in the London and Brighton area, including the Trocadero in
London's cinema land in the west end. A telephone call will enable customers
with credit cards to book a seat at their first choice cinema or at a nearby
venue if that is not available.
And, assures Keith Pullinger, assistant to the general manager at MGM, there
will be enough lines to ensure that every caller gets through. 'I defy
anyone to get their phones answered as quickly as we can.'
The numbers to be called will be advertised in the local press - each of the
34 cinemas has been allocated a different number. Callers hear a recorded
announcement asking questions about the film, day and time. By pressing the
number indicated after the time or film the preference is registered. The
most popular film is always listed first, says Pullinger. 'Seventy-five per
cent of bookings now are for Jurassic Park.'
Once the details, including the credit card number, are determined, the main
computer, which is operated by Computicket, sends them to the cinema
requested using the Paknet radio data network. Confirmation is then sent
back to the computer centre and the tickets printed out in the cinema for
collection. If the caller does not have a modern tone telephone, the system
will switch the caller to a human operator.
According to Pullinger the Computicket service is unique in offering both a
manual and automatic booking service.
