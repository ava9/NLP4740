  [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- The broad cooperation of 
the right-wing and center parties, as suggested by the Christian 
Democrats, could lead to "revival of the creatures from Jurassic 
Park" which do not belong to the Slovak politics any more, 
Deputy Chairman of the NDS-NA Anton Hrnko told journalists 
today. The NDS-NA (National Democratic Party-New Alternative), 
led by Ludovit Cernak, splintered from the Slovak National Party 
(SNS) in February. The NDS-NA has 5 deputies in the 150-member 
Slovak Parliament. 
  "I am speaking about people who are not able to put up with 
the current political situation and who still long for the old 
federation (former Czechoslovakia)," Hrnko said. This could 
eventually damage the Slovak right, he added. 
  On Saturday [30 April] the Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH) put in an offer to its potential partners regarding "the 
open list of candidates up from a certain number." In addition 
to the NDS-NA, the offer relates to the Democratic Party and the 
Standing Conference of the Civic Institute. 
  A coalition after the election (scheduled for September 
30-October 1) with the left-leaning parties could be considered 
only "on the principles of national interest," Hrnko said, 
adding that his party was ruling out cooperation with the 
"authoritarian" parties, based on "principle of the personality 
cult," i.e. with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and Jan Slota's SNS.
