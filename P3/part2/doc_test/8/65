FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate backing vital for ENO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, In your management page feature, 'Time to sing a new song' (September
23) on ENO's new team, you say the company 'recognises that it will never
get much out of the corporate entertainment market'. May I elaborate on this
point. Although the Coliseum is not a corporate house in the sense that all
the best seats are monopolised by business people, ENO enjoys the support of
100 companies and trusts which contribute more than Pounds 1m a year to the
company while taking advantage of the theatre's many private entertaining
rooms.
Sponsorship also plays a vital role - more than half of our productions have
been sponsored in 1993-94 so far. Indeed, a recent Arts Council appraisal
says ENO's performance far exceeds the average growth in arts sponsorship
during the past five years.
Lucy Kellaway rightly says that our success in attracting audiences will be
determined by the operas we produce and, citing the critics, questions
whether ENO's new production of La Boheme (sponsored by the IIR Group) can
be the equivalent of a Jurassic Park. The public has answered resoundingly
with attendances averaging more than 90 per cent.
