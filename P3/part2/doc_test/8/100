<F P=106> [Report by Daria Gorodisky: "Fini: Split in North Is </F>
Bossi's Fault"] 
  [Excerpts] Milan -- "If the anti-Occhetto [secretary of the 
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] front is split in the north, 
the fault lies with the lamentable selfishness not of the 
League, but of [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi, who 
refused to accept the AN [National Alliance] in the pole of 
freedoms." Speaking in Milan yesterday, [AN leader] Gianfranco 
Fini did not tire of saying so to the crowd that filled piazza 
del Duomo (almost 20,000 people), and to reporters, both Italian 
and foreign, curious to observe this new Italian Right. 
[passage omitted] 
  Fini is convinced that a large proportion of League voters 
will support the AN this time and that in any case, "since the 
League is a regional phenomenon, it cannot impose conditions." 
  But Fini wanted to discuss other matters. He was keen to 
stress that the national and social Right is ready to govern: 
"This is the only new factor in Italian politics, whereas the 
Left is an exacerbated repetition of what has been done for the 
past 30 years." We must beware, therefore, because "politics has 
been dominated by the Center-Left for the past 30 years. If 
Occhetto wins, we will have a Left-Center coalition government." 
  The danger, Fini said, comes not from the Right, but from 
Occhetto's men (who, in the guise of progressives, in fact 
"favor the major industrial groups to the detriment of small and 
medium enterprises. There can be no economic development under 
the PDS") and "from the specters of [Mino] Martinazzoli's 
[secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] and [Pact for 
Italy leader] Mario Segni's center, who want to help to 
establish a government of left-wing forces." The MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] secretary stressed that this center is 
"ambiguous because it has sought unacceptable allies such as La 
Malfa [Italian Republican Party Secretary]. We thought had 
disappeared without trace, like former Prime Minister Amato, 
champion of antisocial policies, and that Jurassic relic of the 
First Republic that answers to the name of Zanone [Italian 
Liberal Party]. We may yet have to report them to the police 
for attempting to restore the five-party alliance." In the 
evening, however, he added in Genoa that "poor Martinazzoli is 
aware now that he is bound to emerge the loser and, at the same 
time as he rules out an accord with the Right, he shows that he 
has already decided to reach an agreement with the Left." With 
regard to the election results, Fini is sure that the AN "will 
go well beyond 10 percent." And if the pole of freedoms were to 
win, could Bossi-Attila ("who is still shouting about 
corruption, but who has taken bribes, even though he blames it 
on some idiot just passing through") become crucial to the 
formation of a government? "This, on two conditions," Fini 
said: "clarity on the issue of national unity and identity and 
on the duties of a policy of solidarity between north and south 
and between the strong and weak sectors of society." [passage
