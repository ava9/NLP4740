The English stone belt - the seam of limestone that is the source of
England's finest building stone - runs from Dorset on the south coast to
Bath and then up through the middle of England to Lincoln and on to
Humberside. It cuts a green and rural swathe between the brick-built
industrial areas on the coasts. On the downs and wolds of the stone belt you
will find some of England's prettiest villages.
The limestones were laid by sedimentation millions of years ago, by the
rivers of a long-disappeared Jurassic continent. Minerals and tiny crustacea
were compacted into beds of stone, layer upon layer. As England slowly
formed, they were buried and then buckled and crumpled by continental shift,
emerging in places on the surface, ready to be quarried.
'If you really want to get to grips with limestone, James, you'll have to
climb on it', said a friend, kindly offering to help me do so. This is a man
whose idea of fun is technical climbing at 8,000m (26,000ft). I had done
only two days' climbing in my life, so I set off apprehensively.
We headed for the south coast, where the stone belt emerges in cliffs
between Swanage and Portland, in places 150m high. Cormorant, the climbers'
name for the outcrop we climbed, looked like a sheer face of limestone to
me.
It dropped to a graveyard of massive broken slabs, played over by the waves.
We abseiled off - a point of no return, I realised soon enough - and set
about climbing. On the way back up, Cormorant seemed an appropriate name,
even if the birds have been frightened off by men in fluorescent lycra.
In quieter moments, standing on a tiny ledge 100m up, I looked around. The
limestone strata were clearly visible in the cliff-face. There was no
quarrying here, but further down the coast I could see gaps like missing
teeth where the quarrymen had used a natural ledge to tunnel into the cliff.
From there the blocks were loaded straight on to boats for shipment.
Certainly I had an appreciation of limestone by the end of the day. I had
been hugging it, alternately wedged into crevices and clinging,
spreadeagled, on to exposed buttresses, wondering what on earth I was
supposed to do next. There was a certain intimacy in carefully picking tiny
hand-holds out of folds in the rock.
Afterwards, we took time out at the Square and Compass, a garden pub at
Worth Matravers where many a climber has sat with a pint of ale and verbally
picked his way back over the cliff-face. Like so many buildings in the area,
the pub (which takes its name from stone-masons' tools), is built of local
stone.
It was mid-summer, and the sun was gradually sinking, following its longest
path over the downs. Mid-June is a fine time of year and a pub garden a fine
place to witness it. With the first, absurdly green blooms of spring growth
just past, the trees were filling out and the hedgerows beginning to billow.
Purbeck marble is another distinctive stone that originates in this area. It
is a grey stone which overlies the limestone beds in thin seams and is
visible in places, protruding from the cliff-face. Purbeck marble is not a
marble at all, but is so called because it is one of the only British stones
to take a polish.
It was very popular in ecclesiastical buildings in the 13th century, and was
shipped all over the country alongside Portland and Purbeck limestones, to
be used for interior decoration. In Salisbury cathedral you will see slender
columns of Purbeck marble decorating the massive columns of the nave. Tiny
kidney-shaped crustacea - ooliths - are still visible in the stone.
Salisbury Cathedral, which is visible from the downs for miles around, is
built entirely of local Chilmark limestone - not far from the south coast
the stone belt disappears under the chalk downs of Hardy country,
re-emerging in the Vale of Wardour in northern Dorset and southern
Wiltshire.
In the 60 years from 1220, 60,000 tons of stone were carted from quarries 12
miles from Salisbury. Sadly, limestone steadily dissolves in water, and this
has left the cathedral sorely in need of repair, although the spire has been
restored. The Chilmark quarry was reopened to provide exactly the right
stone for the work.
The country around Chilmark and Tisbury, and on down to Sherborne, is
rolling, rounded hills. The villages hide in the small, tree-lined valleys,
and most of the houses are built of local stone from any of the many
quarries in the area. Here the roofs are thatched or laid with slate.
Tisbury has one of the country's largest tithe barns, with an enormous
thatched roof.
In the tiny lanes, the hedgerows were filled with wild roses and
elderflower. I was out walking when I came on some familiar-looking women
chattering and rootling around in the hedgerow. It was my mother and
godmother, gathering the year's crop of elderflower heads. Using elderflower
heads, water, sugar and some citric acid, you end up with a fine, and very
English, summer drink.
Limestone has many colours (resulting from the amount of iron oxide) and the
different quarries are known for their colour. Where Portland stone is very
white, the Cotswold stones are famed for their honey colour. Others have
tinges of ochre and even pink. Chilmark stone is light beige, with some
touches of green, best visible after rain. Add to this the yellow, white and
red lichens and the stone has an amazing variety.
The stone belt disappears below ground soon after Chilmark and appears again
in north Wiltshire, on the slopes of the Avon valley. Here, villages such as
Westwood and Freshford lie in wooded hollows, linked by tiny sunken lanes
where the greenery threatens to bar your way. The stone is light yellow and
golden and the antique, moss-covered roofing slates reappear.
I arrived in the local market town, Bradford-on-Avon, where pretty stone
buildings cluster on the hillsides in lines. Bradford is a friendly town,
its heart still at the medieval bridge, where the medieval stone buildings
of the Shambles, the old market, look on today's trade of bakeries and
bookshops.
Even the factory buildings are made of stone in Bradford. There was a big
trade in wool (sheep have traditionally been farmed in limestone areas) and
the factories stand in the centre of town on the river; the water from the
weirs was used for washing and for felting into cloth.
From Bradford I made my way along the Avon valley to Bath, cycling along the
towpath of the Kennet and Avon canal. Woollen cloth and Bath stone were
shipped along the canal early last century, but nowadays the barges carry
families on summer holidays. In two places the canal is diverted across the
river Avon on stone aqueducts.
Bath is known for its crescents, all built of local stone. Arranged in
uniform lines, they seem grand after the rural abandon of the nearby
villages, but they show off light honey-coloured Bath stone ('so soft and
creamy', according to one mason I met) strikingly when it shines in the
summer sun.
At school I was told that a man's nature is defined by the landscape around
him. I suppose I know a few Scotsmen with the demeanour of granite, but it
would be stretching the point to suggest that the soft contours of the stone
belt - or even the dependability of limestone - have done much to shape
Wiltshire's modern-day inhabitants. Still, travelling along the stone belt
gives you a glimpse of people living a very English existence, rural and
tranquil.
