  [Excerpts] Some 51 Palestinian deportees and former 
fugitives crossed over from Jordan and Egypt yesterday evening. 
The men, many of whom will be in positions of authority under 
Palestinian autonomy, were welcomed by thousands of people. 
About 28 deportees returned via the Allenby Bridge to Jericho, 
and reporter Mark Weiss was there when they arrived: 
  [Begin Weiss recording] It was a long wait in the Jericho 
sun for the relatives and friends who came to greet the 
deportees at the Allenby Bridge crossing. Because of 
registration problems at the border, the bus bringing the 
deportees didn't cross until 8 o'clock in the evening [1700 
GMT]. Army jeeps escorted the bus by a back road to a 
restaurant outside Jericho where the men received a hero's 
welcome. [passage omitted] 
  In contrast to the group of elderly veteran deportees that 
were allowed back last year, this group is mostly made up of 
younger intifadah activists or those deported for student or 
trade union activity. They are expected to take up leadership 
positions throughout the territories, as Fatah and the other 
groups that support the peace process attempt to win over the 
population. They hope that their return is just the beginning. 
[end recording] 
  At the same time, at the border crossing at Rafah in Gaza, 
23 
deportees arrived. Dani Gur-Arye reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Palestinians destined to 
become the new bureaucrats in the Gaza Strip returned home to a 
warm reception. Dozens of friends and relatives greeted the 
returnees at the Rafah terminal, while hundreds of others waited 
outside, chanting and waving the PLO flag. [passage omitted] 
  The returnees, mostly Fatah members, have credentials both 
in 
Gaza and in Tunis. They were all grass roots intifadah 
activists, who were either deported or who fled to Egypt as 
fugitives. In their years abroad, they were incorporated into 
the PLO's leadership in Tunis. Now they are back in the Strip, 
with authority from above and with what the PLO hopes is respect 
from below. 
  The head of Fatah in Gaza, Zakariya al-Agha, describes the 
return as a positive gesture. But, he says, the Palestinians 
are waiting for more serious steps. 
  [Al-Agha] I hope that we will see in the near future the 
complete evacuation of Gaza from the settlements and settlers, 
because this is very important and this will remove a large 
obstacle from the road to attain the full peace we are looking 
for. 
  [Gur-Arye] The returnees are expected to begin working out 
of PLO offices in Gaza in the coming days. Officials in Tunis 
hope their presence will bolster Yasir 'Arafat's position in the 
Gaza Strip. [end recording]
