  [Text] Taba, Egypt, Feb 16 (AFP)--PLO and Israeli 
negotiators worked here Wednesday [16 February] to draw up a 
timetable for the release of Palestinian prisoners after making 
headway on plans for Gaza and Jericho to have their own police 
force. 
  The chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said he was 
optimistic that an overall accord on the implementation of the 
September 13 autonomy accord was within sight. 
  "If the negotiations go on at the same rhythm as the last 
two 
days, we will not take long," he said. 
  On the third day of negotiations in Egypt's Red Sea resort 
of 
Taba, his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq said: "The 
paper on the police is almost completed. There are some things 
that can wait a few more days." 
  Israel and the PLO drafted two documents on Tuesday, one on 
the size and strength of the force and the other on coordination 
with the Israeli army, Sha'th told reporters. 
  However, differences remain over "how large the force should 
be and how many weapons it should have," said Hasan 'Asfur, 
another PLO negotiator. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation wants a force of 9,000 
police for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho, 
while Israel has set a ceiling of 6,000. 
  Israel's Police Minister Moshe Shahal said the Palestinians 
would be allowed to use the same light weapons and armoured cars 
as their Israeli counterparts, but a request for tanks was 
rejected. 
  The PLO also wants speed boats to patrol parts of the 
Mediterranean coast. 
  The negotiators turned Wednesday to the key issue of 
prisoners, with the Palestinians seeking the phased release of 
all 11,000 detainees within four or five months. 
  Colonel David Agmon, an adviser on the intifada to the 
Israeli army command, and Palestinian deportee Muhammad Dahlan 
headed the sub-committee in charge of drawing up a timetable for 
the releases. 
  Israel has said it would not pardon Palestinians who carried 
out attacks since the autonomy accord was signed in Washington. 
  A separate timetable is under discussion for the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, the launch of which is 
already two months behind schedule because of a deadlock on 
security issues. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on 
Peres finally signed a security agreement last week in Cairo. 
Economic talks are to resume next Monday in Paris. A committee 
on the hand-over of civilian powers also met Wednesday to hammer 
out deals on electricity, archaeology and communications, 
including the launch of Palestinian television and radio 
stations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin insists his country 
will 
take as much time as necessary for a detailed, overall agreement 
on autonomy. 
  In Washington, the wider Middle East peace talks resumed on 
Tuesday with the heads of Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian, 
Syrian and Lebanese delegations meeting away from the cameras 
after a two-week break. 
  The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were focused on 
elections in the self-rule areas set for July. 
  US State Department officials said privately that Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher was planning to return to the Middle 
East in late March to try and advance the Israeli-Syrian track 
of the peace process.
