A last-minute row over details of an historic accord to withdraw Israeli
troops from Gaza and Jericho yesterday soured final preparations for today's
scheduled signing of the agreement, locking both sides into a further and
recriminatory round of negotiations.
Israeli officials insisted the signing would go ahead as planned, even if
the outstanding disputes were not settled. 'Time has its limits and tomorrow
at 11 o'clock we shall sign,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister,
said in Cairo.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, were due to meet last night in a final
effort to resolve the differences under the pressure of expectation and
potential embarrassment created by the arrival of 2,500 dignitaries and a
host of foreign ministers to witness today's planned event.
The last-minute disagreement occurred when PLO officials claimed Israel had
'reneged' on more than 20 detailed points of the agreement.
Mr Arafat accused Israel of 'manoeuvres to obstruct the signing', prompting
Israeli officials to blame the disagreements on 'a last attempt' by the PLO
'to get a bit more'.
The points of disagreement included whether the Palestinians could issue
their own postage stamps and have their own phone codes for Gaza and
Jericho, and a dispute over the length of validity of proposed Palestinian
travel documents.
Israel had balked at the inclusion of Mr Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian
leader from Jerusalem, on the proposed list of 25 Palestinians to constitute
the Palestinian authority which will administer limited self-rule until
elections due in October. Israel says no Jerusalem-based Palestinians must
serve on the body.
PLO and Israeli negotiators had left Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to resolve two
final points of disagreement: whether a uniformed Palestinian guard would be
allowed on the Allenby Bridge linking Israel and Jordan, and the delineation
of the area around Jericho to be ceded to Palestinian control. The PLO had
been seeking more than twice the 54 sq km offered by Israel.
Mr Rabin's spokesman, Mr Ben Ari, said it was unclear whether the two
leaders would announce any agreement on this and other outstanding issues
before this morning.
The 200-page document, entitled Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho
Area, would give the Palestinians their first limited degree of political
and economic autonomy since the Israeli state was created in 1948,
committing Israel to withdraw troops from land claimed by the Palestinians
and occupied by Israeli forces during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
The agreement is already 20 weeks behind the schedule under which Israel
should have completed its military withdrawal by April 13.
Once signed, the deal would prompt the immediate conclusion of Israeli
military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Under a draft text, Israel will
complete the withdrawal within three weeks of signing.
