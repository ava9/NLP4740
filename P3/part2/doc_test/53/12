  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 8 (AFP) -- The 
Palestinian police deployment in the Gaza Strip, scheduled to 
start on Sunday [8 May], has been delayed again, Palestinian 
sources said here late Saturday. 
  They said "technical reasons" were to blame for the delay in 
the arrival of hundreds of policemen from the Rafah border 
crossing with Egypt, but declined to elaborate. 
  Some 300 policemen left Cairo for the Rafah crossing earlier 
Saturday, a day after Palestinian general Ziyad al-Atrash 
announced here that the Gaza deployment would start Sunday after 
a delay of several days. 
  But Palestinian officials in Amman, meanwhile, said hundreds 
more policemen were to cross Sunday from Jordan into the West 
Bank for deployment in the other self-rule area, Jericho. 
  However, the Israeli news agency ITIM said no deployment was 
expected in Jericho Sunday as the Palestinians had failed to 
coordinate their arrival with the Israeli army, it said. 
  The police were due to arrive in Gaza, ITIM said, quoting 
military sources. 
  Under the autonomy deal signed Wednesday between the PLO and 
Israel, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are to be deployed in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip to take charge of security as the 
Israeli army pulls out. 
  However General Dany Rothschild, coordinator of Israeli 
activities in the occupied territories, complained Saturday that 
the Palestinians were not ready to take over their new 
responsibilities. 
  "If the transfer of civilian powers in the autonomous zones 
does not take place in an orderly fashion, the situation on the 
ground will deteriorate," he said. "We still don't have anybody 
to hand these powers to." 
  He detected a change in the Palestinian stand. 
  "Up until a few days ago, the word from them was: `Give us 
the keys and leave. We'll sort it out.' Their calls for help 
are now more frequent and they're starting to realize the size 
of the task," said the general. 
  On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is to 
present the self-rule accord he signed last week with PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat for parliament's approval on Wednesday, 
parliamentary sources said.
