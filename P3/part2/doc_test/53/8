  [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--The PLO has rejected an 
Israeli compromise proposal on the scope of Palestinian 
jurisdiction in parts of the occupied territories slated for 
Palestinian self-rule, the chief PLO negotiator said early 
Monday [18 April]. 
  Nabil Sha'th was speaking at the opening session Sunday [as 
received] of the latest round of Israeli-PLO negotiations aimed 
at implementing Palestinian autonomy on the Gaza Strip and in 
the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  He said Israel had proposed that Palestinian jurisdiction 
extend to all foreigners -- non-Israelis and non-Palestinians -- 
in Gaza and Jericho, apart from those who travel there to visit 
Jewish settlements. 
  In another offer, according to Sha'th, Israel suggested that 
a Palestinian charged with a crime against an Israeli be tried 
before a Palestinian court if he is arrested in the autonomous 
areas and before an Israeli court if he escapes and is captured 
in Israel. 
  Israel had initially wanted to maintain jurisdiction over 
all 
foreigners as well as over any Palestinian charged with a crime 
against an Israeli. 
  "They tempered their first proposal, which I have called a 
horror," Sha'th said. "It is now a horror on a minature scale 
but still it is a horror." 
  He charged that Israel's position on jurisdiction was "a 
clear violation of the Declaration of Principles," referring to 
an autonomy agreement signed last September by Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
  "From our point of view, the only (areas) out of our 
jurisdiction are Israelis and settlements." 
  He disclosed that an electronic surveillance system will 
likely be used to resolve the issue of Palestinian movement 
between Gaza and Jericho. 
  The proposed route linking the two sites would extend from 
Eretz, bordering the Gaza Strip, and then pass through Ashqelon 
in southern Israel and Hebron on the West Bank, entering Jericho 
south of Jerusalem. 
  Sha'th also said that Israeli and PLO negotiators had begun 
discussions Sunday on water sharing but declined to release 
details. 
  But he added: "It's not really that much of a problem. It 
can be solved." 
  Sha'th stressed that that PLO was still pressing for a 
general amnesty for all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, 
estimated to number 10,000. 
  Israel announced last Tuesday that it would agree to free 
5,000 prisoners following the approval of a final autonomy 
accord, excluding Islamic militants in the Hamas movement. 
  Hamas has claimed responsibility for two recent bomb blasts 
that killed 12 Israelis. 
  "What we are discussing is a general amnesty," Sha'th said. 
"We cannot accept that Israelis tell us that people who are 
imprisoned because of their resistance in the past to an illegal 
occupation should remain in jail indefinitely, even after an 
agreement is signed."
