  [Text] The Israel Police are completing their preparations 
for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal said today that the Israel Police would evacuate 
their personnel within the very next few weeks, rather than the 
originally planned four months. Our correspondent 'Ofer Vardi 
spoke with the police minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Vardi] Upon the evacuation and the 
redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israel Police's 
Gaza District will be renamed the Shimshon District, Minister 
Moshe Shahal announced today in a meeting with journalists in 
Tel Aviv. Policemen are busy organizing the said withdrawal 
which, according to the police minister, will take effect soon. 
  [Shahal] Israel Police troops will initially evacuate police 
stations and Gaza's central prison, according to the timetable 
stipulated by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. This timetable 
will apparently be shorter than the four months originally 
planned. I believe we are now talking about very few weeks. 
  [Vardi] This fast withdrawal, however, will not change the 
Israel Police's plans to reinforce its troops in the territories. 
  [Shahal] We have started discussing the issue, but the 
debate has not yet been concluded. We are mainly dealing with 
the second phase, the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, which will call for additional troops; we are 
requesting an addition of some 1,400 policemen. Our immediate 
requirements in order to carry out first phase of evacuating the 
police stations in Gaza are: building stations in the Qatif 
Bloc, creating a police district near Gaza, integrating police 
personnel into the border terminals planned by the IDF, and 
reinforcing the border terminals in Rafah and especially at the 
Allenby Bridge especially. [end recording]
