<F P=106> [Discussion between political correspondents Udi Segal, </F>
outside the Prime Minister's Office, and 'Adi Talmor, in the 
studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Segal] A very brief cabinet session, which 
started at 0900, ended a short time ago. This session was 
convened to ratify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the agreement 
was indeed unanimously ratified. The results of the Histadrut 
elections obviously hovered in the air, but political affairs 
were the main issue on the agenda. Minister Yosi Sarid told us 
that even more significant than the ratification of the 
agreement was the determination of a timetable for the transfer 
of powers. The target date is next Wednesday [18 May]; by then 
all the Gaza and Jericho autonomy areas will be transferred to 
Palestinian authority. 
  [Talmor] Am I correct in saying that by that date all the 
Palestinian police forces will have entered the area and the 
Palestinians will be in charge of all the powers and buildings 
in the area? 
  [Segal] More than that. By next Wednesday the PLO will bear 
full responsibility in Gaza and Jericho. This is what Minister 
Yosi Sarid told us several minutes ago: 
  [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet ratified the agreement 
unanimously. We should pay attention, however, to the 
timetable, because now it is very specific: by Friday, two days 
from now, the Palestinians will take over the southern part of 
the Gaza Strip and all of Jericho. By next Wednesday the 
Palestinians will take over the entire Gaza Strip, that is, Gaza 
city itself and the northern part of the Gaza Strip as well. 
This means that by next Wednesday the Palestinians will be in 
charge of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as stipulated by the 
agreement. The actual testing of the agreement will start at 
that time. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 11 May, 
reporting on the cabinet session, adds the following: "Minister 
Shim'on Shetrit said in the session that the agreement signed 
with the PLO deviates from the Declaration of Principles. He 
cited several examples, such as the granting of passports to the 
Palestinians, the ability to legislate basic laws, radio 
frequencies, dialing zones, etc."]
