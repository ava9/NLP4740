Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are to begin talks next
week in Cairo on an accelerated extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho
across the rest of the West Bank.
The agreement announced in Paris yesterday marks a critical step forward in
the peace process and reflects the greater trust and confidence both sides
have in each other following completion of the first phase: the
implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
However, Israel appears to have forced the PLO to accept a two-stage
negotiating process for the West Bank - accelerated talks on the transfer of
power followed by talks on redeployment of Israeli forces - rather than the
single-stage process demanded by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chair-man.
Mr Arafat wants the process speeded up considerably to allow the PLO to take
control of the West Bank well ahead of Palestinian national elections due on
October 15. He appears determined to hold quick polls to confound critics
who say he is undemocratic and afraid of elections which might see opponents
win considerable power.
Israel has cautioned on the need to move slowly.
A joint Israeli-PLO statement said yesterday that the Cairo talks would
break into two working groups. One group would discuss issues outstanding
from the first phase - such as Israel's refusal to release 6,000 Palestinian
prisoners, and arrangements for border crossings and safe corridors between
the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The second group would discuss giving
Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank more control over some aspects of
the local administration, as well as elections and financial matters such as
the transfer of taxes and customs.
Israel agreed in Paris to speed up transfer of power in the West Bank and
expand self-rule beyond the already agreed five areas of health, education,
tourism, direct taxation and social welfare. Only after the conclusion of
these talks would the two sides negotiate an interim accord for the West
Bank including the redeployment of Israeli forces out of Palestinian
population centres, which Israel is pledged to complete by the eve of
elections.
The third issue which is now open for discussion is the right of return of
Palestinians who fled their homes in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
