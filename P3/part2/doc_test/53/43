  [Text] Geneva, Jan 18 (AFP) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will attend a 
roundtable conference on the Middle East late this month, the 
president of the World Economic Forum said Tuesday [18 January]. 
  Klaus Schwab said a direct meeting of the two men at the 
Forum scheduled to open in Davos, Switzerland, on January 27 
could not be ruled out. 
  Israeli-PLO talks on Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho have been deadlocked over the size of the Jericho 
area in the West Bank, security for Israeli settlements in the 
Gaza Strip and control of border crossings between the strip and 
Egypt and Jericho and Jordan.
