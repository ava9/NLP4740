  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, 5 May 
(AFP)--Palestinian officials admitted Thursday [5 May] they were 
having "difficulties" launching self-rule, but fended off 
Israelis accusations off being ill-prepared. 
  PLO spokesman Sufyan Abu-Zayda told AFP there were 
"technical" problems, a day after the signing of an agreement to 
launch autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  "We are not a government, we are an organization with our 
forces spread around the world," he told AFP. 
  "We have to expect that there will be difficulties, serious 
difficulties because this conflict has been going on for so many 
years," said PLO official Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the 
armed group the Black Panthers. 
  West Bank military administration spokeswoman Colonel Elise 
Shazar said the occupiers were "ready to transfer power at any 
time. 
  "But we are waiting for the Palestinians to knock on the 
door 
and present the list of names of the future heads for various 
sectors," she said. 
  "Since the Palestinians have asked for a delay to get 
organized, the administration is waiting and continues, while 
waiting, to be responsible for everything as usual." 
  The military administration would operate until the 
withdrawal was completed. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has already turned on the PLO 
for its apparent lack of readiness in a devastating outburst. 
  "They're not ready to take things over," he said Wednesday 
after PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat at first refused to initial part 
of the autonomy deal, causing chaos at the lavish ceremony. 
  'Arafat finally appended his reservations to the size of the 
Jericho enclave. 
  "We could finish our withdrawal in 10 days, the problem is 
that Yasir 'Arafat has asked for four weeks," Rabin revealed. 
  Palestinian negotiators were "more concerned about symbolic 
issues than purely practical problems". 
  Rabin urged the PLO to focus on the "economic woes" of Gaza. 
With more than half the working population unemployed and with 
little prospect of finding a job in the near future, the size of 
the task cannot be under-estimated. 
  The PLO, whose offices have just one telephone line working 
in Gaza City, had announced that 1,000 policemen would enter 
Gaza on Thursday. 
  But the arrival has now been put back to an imprecise 
"middle 
of next week". 
  From Cairo, PLO security chief Jibril Rajub told Israel 
radio: "There are logistical problems in the deployment of the 
Palestinian police. It will begin in a few days and will no 
doubt extend over a few weeks." 
  "We have to coordinate our efforts with Israel and a liaison 
committee will try to harmonize the deployment and the transfer 
of responsibilities." 
  The liaison committee met on the strip on Thursday with the 
aim of agreeing a timetable for the security transfer. 
  Israel has set a "representation" at the Erez crossing point 
into the strip to assist the new authorities and later to act as 
a contact point, for example if a Palestinian wants hospital 
treatment in Tel Aviv. 
  PLO spokesman Abu-Zayda tried to explain the slow pace. 
  "We don't want the police to come before everything is ready 
for their deployment. We don't want to put them in camps like 
jails," he said. 
  "We need a week to prepare things, to find places for them 
to 
live. The agreement gives us three weeks." 
  However, divisions among the Palestinian ranks cannot have 
helped. 
  No Palestinian figure from the territories attended the 
Cairo 
ceremony. 
  Neither West Bank Fatah chief Faysal al-Husayni, nor ex-PLO 
spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, nor ex-head of the delegation to 
bilateral negotiations Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. 
  "After a 27-year pregnancy, we have given birth to a 
premature son, in weak health and who may not survive," said 
al-Husayni. 
  Such prognostics were not heard publicly on the Gaza Strip 
among those charged with running autonomy. 
  "We are ready to set up the authority in 24 hours," claimed 
Abu-Shibak, who returned to Gaza in early April after escaping 
abroad to avoid arrest in 1990. 
  No one mentioned whether 'Arafat was using time as a weapon 
to try to gain more concessions from Israel over the size of 
Jericho and the release of prisoners, hundreds more of whom were 
expected to be freed Thursday after an initial 250 following the 
signing. 
  Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director of the PLO-appointed 
Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Construction, 
described the problems as "Palestinian insufficiency". 
  "We are not ready to receive authority," he said, pointing 
out that under occupation Palestinians had never had to take 
decisions. 
  "Environment questions, for example, are totally new to us," 
said Abu-Libdah who is also in charge of 36 technical committees 
the Palestinians set up after the Madrid conference launched the 
peace process in October 1991. 
  "What we need is to Palestinize the programmes in every 
sphere. It's not a matter of being a week late, it might take 
three or six months before we are really ready," he said 
  Palestinian sources added: "They are only ready in the field 
of health. 
  "It's the only field we have experience in and have a full 
programme ready. 
  "As for the rest, education, tourism or whatever nothing 
else 
is completed. 
  "For direct taxation nothing has been done. We need three 
months' work with the Israelis on tax matters. 
  "Autonomy grants authority to the Palestinians for indirect 
tax, social welfare, education, health and tourism."
