<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks and 
professor at Bi'r Zayt University, in Jerusalem, by Fayiz 
al-Miliji in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Good morning Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib. 
We welcome you to our talk show. 
  [Al-Khatib] Good morning and thank you. 
  [Al-Miliji] To start with, could you fill us in on the 
reactions to the signing of the agreement on starting to 
implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Khatib] The reaction is the opposite of what was 
expected. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories 
received the signing of this agreement and the celebrations that 
went with it lukewarmly and cautiously, quite opposite to their 
reception of the Oslo agreement and the celebrations following 
its signing in Washington. The reason is that the repeated 
Israeli stalling in implementing the agreements has created 
indifference among the Palestinian people. Because of the 
Israeli stalling the Palestinians have lost faith that such 
agreements will actually be implemented. The Palestinian man in 
the street is saying that he will believe these things only 
after they are implemented, because he has seen many things 
signed and heard about many agreements. None of these ever 
changed the course of his practical life. Therefore, the 
reaction to, or judgement of this agreement by the Palestinians 
here has been put on hold until after the Palestinian people see 
the actual implementation or effects of this agreement on their 
lives. Then, the whole situation will be different. 
  [Al-Miliji] The agreement that was signed the day before 
yesterday still has some pending matters that have not been 
agreed upon. Do you think the Palestinian people are worried 
about these points? 
  [Al-Khatib] Frankly speaking, the Palestinian people are 
worried about a lot of things. First, they are worried because 
there are some matters that have been put off. Our people have 
gone through some difficult times and were promised certain 
changes that never happened. 
  [Al-Miliji] Although you have always shown concern for the 
Palestinian people, do you not see any reasons for optimism now, 
especially since the Palestinian and Israeli sides have adopted 
the slogan "Let there be peace"? 
  [Al-Khatib] Yes. There are certain things that should make 
the Palestinians optimistic. But this optimism is hedged with 
caution and apprehension. For example, the possibility of 
allowing the Palestinian leadership, police, and the army--that 
is the Palestinian Liberation Army--to enter the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho are great sources of hope and optimism for the 
Palestinian masses. In addition, the possibility of releasing 
or the majority of the Palestinian detainees, if not all of 
them, is also a source of hope and optimism for the Palestinian 
people. However, so far the Palestinian people have not seen 
any practical results despite the large number of agreements and 
hopes, so they have mixed feelings of optimism, expectation, and 
anticipation to see what the practical changes will be. After 
that, the government can be established. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, today is the third day 
since the agreement was signed. In other words, the it has not 
been very long. Now, everyone is waiting for the Israeli forces 
to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian police to 
enter. Does this not provide grounds for optimism rather than 
concern and tension? 
  [Al-Khatib] Yes, but you have to remember that there have 
been agreements in the past and Israel stalled on implementing 
them. It also stalled on the negotiations over implementation. 
It created obstacles everywhere, thus hindering the practical 
implementation of these agreements. Various dates were agreed 
upon that were not respected by Israel, who always claimed that 
deadlines were not sacred. Thus, our people are afraid to be 
overly optimistic in order to avoid disappointment like after 
the Madrid conference and the signing of the Oslo agreement, 
etc. However, there is anticipation and hope. After the 
Palestinian leadership and police enter the territory, after 
some changes start taking place, and as soon as the Israeli 
withdrawal starts, I expect the mood of the Palestinian people 
to shift. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. al-Khatib, have the Israeli forces started 
withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Khatib] The Israeli forces have vacated a few locations 
in Gaza City, or the Gaza Strip. This has left a positive 
impression with the Palestinian people. The people understand 
clearly that things take time and that complications may crop 
up. Therefore, they are waiting to see how the agreement will 
be implemented. They will take their stands based to that. 
  [Al-Miliji] In your capacity as a leading figure of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, could you tell us 
when the Palestinian police will enter? 
  [Al-Khatib] A group of 17 high-ranking Palestinian officers 
have already entered the Gaza Strip at Rafah crossing. They 
have begun a series of meetings with ranking Israeli army and 
police officers to put the final touches on the process of 
handing over the buildings and security responsibilities to the 
Palestinian police. After these meetings, this group will submit 
recommendations on the necessary time period for handing over 
responsibilities. Based on their recommendations, the date for 
the Palestinian police's entry will be set. 
  [Al-Miliji] Our last question is: How are the Palestinian 
people preparing themselves to receive Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat when he enters the occupied territories for the 
first time since Palestinian autonomy began? 
  [Al-Khatib] Actually, President 'Arafat is greatly respected 
and supported in the occupied territories. I notice that the 
Palestinian people are anxiously awaiting the return of the 
Palestinian leadership headed by brother Yasir 'Arafat, 
especially since the Palestinian people are expecting his return 
to spread a sense of security and stability after the difficult 
conditions we have gone through. Of course, when brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] returns he will be accompanied by a 
large number of Palestinian people, be they leaders or 
otherwise, who are living abroad. The people here are awaiting 
this very anxiously. 
  Therefore, I believe that the return of the Palestinian 
leadership will soon have a positive effect on the mood of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories. 
  [Al-Miliji] At the end of this dialogue, we thank our guest 
Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the Palestinian delegation to 
the peace talks and professor at Bi'r Zayt University, who spoke 
to us from Jerusalem. Thank you Mr. Ghassan. 
  [Al-Khatib] Thank you.
