<F P=106> ["Text" of letter from PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to Israeli </F>
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "in the wake of the Israeli 
Government's protest against 'Arafat's statements in South 
Africa;" date not given] 
  [Text] Mr. Prime Minister: 
  Greetings. 
  The PLO reiterates the following with regard to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo: 
  1. The PLO pledges that the Palestinian Authority, including 
the police and other departments, will work in accordance with 
this agreement and will effect a mechanism for coordination and 
cooperation in the appropriate time. 
  2. The PLO pledges to cooperate with Israel and to help it 
discover the location of and return the Israeli soldiers who are 
still missing, as well as return the bodies of the dead soldiers 
who have not been restored yet. 
  3. The PLO pledges to ask the Palestine National Council, in 
its next session, to officially approve amendments to the PLO 
National Charter in accordance with the pledge included in the 
message signed by the PLO chairman on 9 September 1993 and 
addressed to Israel's prime minister. 
  4. As I enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho area I will use the 
title of the chairman of the Palestinian Authority or the PLO 
chairman, not the president of the state of Palestine. 
  5. I pledge not to take any measures that would change the 
status of Gaza Strip and Jericho area and to discuss this matter 
during the talks for a permanent solution to the situation. 
  6. We pledge to implement Paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the 
accord, which stipulates that we must inform the Government of 
Israel of the names of the Palestinian Authority members in a 
letter to be presented within a week. The appointment of 
authority members will be effective in accordance with letters 
to be exchanged to this effect between the PLO and the 
Government of Israel. Also, any change in the membership of the 
Palestinian Authority will be effective in accordance with 
letters to be exchanged between the PLO and the Government of 
Israel. 
  7. Following the endorsement of the accord, talks will begin 
immediately to grant the authority the powers to implement 
Article 6 of the Declaration of Principles. Both parties will 
work toward exploring possible ways to expand the sphere of 
talks so as to exceed the five fields. [not further identified] 
  8. Both parties will work toward giving momentum to talks in 
light of temporary arrangements in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles and its objective. 
  9. We are committed to embarking on permanent talks on the 
final status as soon as possible provided that they will not be 
later than the beginning of the third year of the transitional 
period. 
  10. We will decide -- through cooperation with Israel and 
within one month -- on calling the Governments of Jordan and 
Egypt to form a follow-up committee as noted in the Declaration 
of Principles. 
  11. We will assess, together with the Government of Israel, 
all necessary legislation that would help implement the accord. 
  12. We are ready to continue discussion on the following 
issues: 
  A. Jericho area. 
  B. Allowing an official Palestinian presence on bridges. 
  C. Achieving additional measures in the Rafah crossing 
area. 
  D. All suspended issues that are mentioned in the accord. 
  [Signed] Sincerely, Yasir 'Arafat
