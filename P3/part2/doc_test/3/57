FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on tube link to Docklands

AN ALL-PARTY group of MPs voiced its anxiety yesterday that the government
may be close to abandoning the planned extension of the Jubilee underground
rail line to London's Docklands.
Their concern - set out in a Commons early day motion - came as ministers
reacted positively but cautiously to the suggestion that the government
might buy outright one of the buildings at the Canary Wharf development.
The government has told the administrators of Canary Wharf that it is ready
to study a scheme under which it would buy one of office blocks at the
Docklands site.
The money would then be repaid by the administrators to the Treasury as the
private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line extension, which was agreed
before the development's owners - the Canadian company Olympia &amp; York - went
into administration at the end of May.
It is understood that the administrators have told the government that they
would need to raise Pounds 170m from an outright sale - a figure that
equates to the present-day value of the phased Pounds 400m payment promised
by Olympia &amp; York for the rail link.
Such a deal would have a number of attractions, but some ministers believe
that, on a realistic calculation of property values in the area, the
government would have to secure up to 800,000 sq ft of space to justify
paying Pounds 170m.
That represents twice the amount of space the government would need for its
proposed transfer to Docklands of civil servants from the Department of the
Environment and some other Whitehall departments.
The signatories of yesterday's motion, who include Mr Paul Channon, the
former transport secretary, said that the Jubilee Line extension was
'vitally important to the competitiveness of London' and 'critical' to the
success of Docklands.
London's RiverBus, the Thames passenger service recently given a three-month
reprieve from closure, is to make an additional stop at Greenland Pier in
Surrey Docks on weekdays in response to passenger demand.
