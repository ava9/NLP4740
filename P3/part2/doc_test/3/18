FT  17 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf tenants warn Major

PROSPECTIVE tenants of Canary Wharf are warning Mr John Major that unless
the Jubilee underground railway line is extended into east London they will
reconsider their decision to move to Docklands.
In letters to the prime minister, present and prospective tenants of the
east London development, which is in administration under UK insolvency
procedures, urge Mr Major to take action in helping to finance the extension
of the Jubilee line.
The tenants want the government to take advantage of the offer from the
Canary Wharf administrators to finance a private sector contribution for the
line by selling a building to the government.
In the Commons yesterday, Steven Norris, minister for transport in the
capital, said construction could not start until the eventual owners of
Canary Wharf pledged to pay their contribution. 'We see no prospect of
authorising the start of construction unless, and until, that contribution
is assured,' he told MPs.
The tenants, including the US oil company Texaco and investment banks Credit
Suisse First Boston and Bear Stearns, said they opted for Canary Wharf on
the understanding that the government was committed to regenerating London's
Docklands, but now feared the area was trapped in a downward spiral.
Before signing up for Canary Wharf, they had each been shown a letter from
the chief executive of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
official body in charge of redeveloping the area, promising that Docklands
would 'become the most accessible location in the central London area by
1992'.
Docklands is now perceived as completely inaccessible, they said.
Additional pressure to build the Jubilee extension come from a coalition of
Docklands businesses and community representatives who sent Mr Major a
petition backing the line.
On Wednesday, government ministers and advisers - including Mr John Wakeham,
lord privy seal, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury - are
due to meet to evaluate the Canary Wharf offer.
The environment department needs 350,000 sq ft to relocate the bulk of its
civil servants and is considering three Docklands sites, including Canary
Wharf.
The proposal to sell the government a Canary Wharf building has broad
ministerial support, although the Treasury is sceptical. An official there
said the development had to demonstrate that it offered value for money.
The administrators have told the government that if it wants to rent rather
than buy, Canary Wharf could still contribute to the Jubilee line extension
by raising new loan finance on any government-rented building.
The 11 banks which have lent Pounds 576m to finance the development of
Canary Wharf met yesterday to evaluate this rescue strategy.
