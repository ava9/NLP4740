CANARY WHARF has only a month to bring in new investors and to persuade the
government to move civil servants to the office development if it is to
avoid a liquidation which could make it a ghost town.
This was the bleak message yesterday from Mr Michael Dennis, the Olympia &amp;
York director who masterminded Europe's biggest office development, and from
Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the London Dockland Development Corporation.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, also made clear yesterday that the
government planned to tell Canary Wharf's administrators, who took control
of the project on Thursday, that the Pounds 400m contribution agreed by O&amp;Y
towards the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line was
'non-negotiable'.
Meanwhile the administrators, who are three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, have
been deciding which of Canary Wharf's running costs need to be cut
immediately.
There are fears that an early victim will be the Riverbus Partnership, which
provides the only commercial passenger service on the River Thames.
O&amp;Y has only a minority holding in Riverbus, but it has been covering the
losses generated by the service.
Mr Pickard, the main policy maker outside central government for Docklands,
said rapid decisions had to be taken by government and potential investors
in Canary Wharf if it was not to be damaged irreparably.
A number of companies, including American Express and Texaco, are understood
to be reviewing whether they should move to Canary Wharf as they had
planned.
Both Mr Pickard and Mr Dennis said a government commitment to move 2,000
civil servants to Canary Wharf needed to be made quickly, to reassure these
companies and prevent the occupancy rate falling to level where liquidation
would be inevitable.
Mr Pickard pointed out that the Canary Wharf buildings were technologically
more sophisticated than most UK buildings. Unless they were maintained,
which might not take place if the project was liquidated, the buildings
could deteriorate badly.
He said the regeneration of Docklands could be set back by three or four
years if Canary Wharf was not kept as a going concern. He said the costs of
such a delay far outweighed the 'small sums' needed from government and
investors to keep Canary Wharf afloat.
Mr Dennis disclosed that O&amp;Y had drawn up a list of 20 investors with
sufficient resources to rescue Canary Wharf. It began its search for such
investors three months ago, at the suggestion of Citicorp, the US bank with
a substantial exposure to O&amp;Y's worldwide operations.
The potential investors include the investment offices of most of the
oil-rich Gulf states, the Singapore government's investment office and a
handful of international insurance companies. Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong
investor, is also on the list but yesterday that Lord Sterling, chairman of
P&amp;O, may become involved in helping to raise outside finance. P&amp;O has been
closely involved in Canary Wharf's development as owner of Bovis, the
building contractor.
Mr Major yesterday underlined that the government was not prepared to
increase its contribution to the Jubilee project. It had already contributed
well over Pounds 1bn to Docklands. His policy remained that the line would
go ahead only when the owners of Canary Wharf provided the amount agreed.
Mr Dennis pointed out that the contribution which Canary Wharf said it would
make to the Jubilee line was not Pounds 400m in today's money, since the
payments are staggered over 25 years. The value in today's money of the
contribution is between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m.
Senior officials close to the prime minister said any flexibility in the
government's negotiating position would be restricted to the timing of
payments.
