FT  17 OCT 92 / Tories urge Jubilee Line cash pledge

LORD Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords, has urged the chairmen of Lloyds
and Barclays to persuade Canary Wharf's 11 banks to make a no-strings cash
contribution towards the cost of building the Jubilee Line extension on the
Underground.
The request is understood to be an important shift in the government's
intentions towards the extension. Until now, bankers have feared that the
government was happy for them to make an inadequate offer because it
provided the Treasury with an excuse to cancel the project and save public
expenditure.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, and Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds'
chairman, were acting as representatives of Canary Wharf's 11 commercial
banks in a meeting this week with Lord Wakeham, who is chairing a government
committee on London's Docklands.
Lord Wakeham indicated that if the banks made the no-strings offer, the line
would probably be built. A government source said that money had been
allocated for the Jubilee Line, conditional on the banks providing their
share.
The Bank of England is acting as a mediator between the government and the
Canary Wharf banks. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of
England, has warned the government that, having invited the banks to make a
new Jubilee offer, it must not subsequently dismiss any offer in a fashion
which could appear cavalier. The Bank of England is concerned that any such
rejection would damage the government's reputation in financial centres
abroad.
Bankers warned yesterday that the Jubilee extension to London's Docklands
may yet be scrapped, since it will be difficult to persuade all 11 banks,
nine of which are foreign, to make a no-strings offer.
The banks have already offered Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee's Pounds
1.6bn costs. However, the first two pay-ments totalling Pounds 98m are
conditional on the government moving civil servants to Canary Wharf. The
Treasury is adamant that the funds should not be conditional on relocations
or any form of government support.
Canary Wharf's banks, which have lent Pounds 576m to the project, have to
decide in the coming week whether they can make an unconditional offer.
