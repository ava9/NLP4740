to avoid the delays that bedevilled the early years

For the past eight months the automatic, driverless trains of London's
Docklands Light Railway have been shuttling along a new five-mile extension
to the suburb of Beckton. The trains have been operating without passengers
as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested.
Problems in constructing the Beckton extension and installing the systems
have delayed the opening for 18 months.
Mr Malcolm Hutchinson, DLR managing director, is determined to avoid the
breakdowns and delays which followed the opening of the first 7 1/2 miles of
the railway in 1987.
It is important that the DLR gets this launch right. It has never really
recovered from the poor reputation it acquired in its early years. This was
partly because it was designed when Docklands was still planned as an area
of housing and light industry and before the building of Canary Wharf turned
it into a high-rise office centre.
The Beckton extension will bring a large part of east London within easy
reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the
City airport.
In a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled
Docklands development, there will still be no station in the airport
terminal.
The Beckton extension, which starts east from Poplar, is only one of several
developments under way. Mr Hutchinson and his team of managers, recruited in
November 1991 from the procurement department of the Ministry of Defence,
believe they will bring about a rehabilitation of the railway's image and a
period of rapid expansion. The second significant improvement should come in
the summer when painstaking work to modernise signalling will be completed
and the railway will be open in the evenings and at weekends, making it much
more attractive to local workers and accessible for tourists.
Original signalling is being replaced with a system incorporating improved
safety systems and allowing greater flexibility in train timetables.
By the end of this year the DLR expects to choose a private consortium to
carry out a Pounds 100m extension of the railway across the Thames.
This will take it south into Greenwich and Lewisham, more than doubling
potential revenues and traffic volumes. At present the DLR costs Pounds 20m
a year to run but takes only Pounds 4m in ticket revenues.
Once the line is completed, the DLR is expected to lease it from the
consortium for between 15 and 20 years before assuming final ownership.
Original plans were for five new stations south of the river and for the
present Island Gardens terminus on the north bank to be moved underground.
But this would have pushed up costs to nearly Pounds 150m and made the
project uneconomic. So the present plan to resite Island Gardens below
ground will be dropped and proposals to build the Cutty Sark station in
Greenwich town centre will be shelved, although this decision has prompted
criticism that the line would then bypass the most attractive location for
travellers.
Hopes of a sustained recovery of the UK economy and indications that the
Canary Wharf development is starting to attract more tenants make
improvements to the DLR particularly timely.
The Lewisham spur is due to be completed by 1997, the year before the Pounds
1.9bn Jubilee Line extension provides a direct underground link between
Docklands and the West End of London. The Jubilee Line extension will
increase the attractions of Docklands for office developers, but will at the
same time steal many of the DLR's customers who now come out from the City.
An interchange station between the two lines will be built at Canary Wharf.
The Lewisham line, it is hoped, will provide a new source of income and
narrow the gap between operating costs and ticket revenues.
But by the time this happens, the DLR could well be in preparation for
private ownership.
