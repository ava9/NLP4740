THE GOVERNMENT held talks with three developers, including Olympia &amp; York,
on terms for a substantial shift of civil servants to London's Docklands
even before O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf went into administration last week, it
emerged yesterday.
Consideration of moving a large number of civil servants before the collapse
indicates the government's long-standing concern about the loss of momentum
in the development of Docklands.
The relocation of up to 5,000 government workers from several departments
will top the agenda when senior ministers meet in Downing Street today under
the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords.
Officials continue to insist there will be no bail-out of Canary Wharf but
one minister confirmed that the aim was to give a firm vote of confidence in
the area. The government also intends to maximise its leverage in
negotiating preferential rents by offering to take substantial quantities of
space.
Some senior civil servants are even urging the examination of the option of
buying freeholds from distressed Docklands property companies, arguing that
the crisis has produced a 'once-in-50 years' opportunity to buy quality
property at knock-down prices.
Furthermore, reports that the government is taking a tough stance on the
obligation of any private investor to honour O&amp;Y's commitment to put Pounds
400m towards the proposed Jubilee Underground line extension were being
qualified yesterday.
The initial requirement is for Pounds 100m, payable in three tranches over a
number of years, and the rest over the long term using a formula based on
rent income. The Pounds 800m improvement to the Docklands Light Railway, the
east-west road link and the upgrading of the A13 would be more than adequate
for the area in the short to medium term.
Civil servants who could be involved in the move include 2,000 from the
Environment Department, up to 1,000 from Transport, and several hundred from
Trade and Industry, including the Radio Agency. Pressure is also being
exerted on the new Department of National Heritage.
Details of the behind-the-scenes discussions emerged as Hanson, the
acquisitive industrial conglomerate, and P&amp;O, the transport company,
confirmed their interest in the future of the multi-billion pound
development. At the same time, Labour stepped up demands for an emergency
Commons statement on the future of Canary Wharf that went into
administration owing banks Pounds 1.2bn.
Hanson confirmed its interest in buying property on Canary Wharf, although
it was stressed that this was still at an early stage. It remains unclear
how the property would fit into the company's portfolio. Mr Martin Taylor,
Hanson's vice-president, said: 'We think this is an interesting opportunity
and wish to look further.'
Hanson does not have extensive interests in property development but Mr
Taylor said the company did have a significant property portfolio and had
some properties surplus to requirements from previous purchases. He added:
'Most of the things that we've done have been different from what we've done
before.'
P&amp;O was also watching the situation, but seemed unlikely to put money in to
Canary Wharf.
