FT  09 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Rail in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS RECESSION taken the pressure off central London's creaking public
transport system? Try asking commuters on the Central Line, London
Underground's main east-west link across the capital. Even at today's
reduced passenger levels, peak-hour loadings are 45 per cent above the
levels for which the line was designed. Yet the Treasury is now questioning
the need for the planned Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, a new east-west rail
line due to open around the turn of the century.
CrossRail would bring big benefits to central London. By providing a link
between British Rail's Liverpool Street and Paddington stations, it would
enable suburban trains to run straight through central London stopping at
stations in the West End and the City on the way. Many commuters could then
reach their destinations without changing to the Underground, so saving time
and reducing pressure on the Central Line.
Questioning such a project looks perverse at a time when London Underground
is poised to embark on a Pounds 1.8bn extension of the Jubilee Line to the
Docklands development area. Like CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension was
approved before recession set in. At the time, cost/benefit analyses of the
two projects yielded similar results. Since then, the outlook for employment
growth in Docklands (and hence, demand for transport) has deteriorated much
more than it has in central London. Yet it is the financially stronger case
for CrossRail that has now come under Treasury scrutiny.
There is an argument for pressing ahead with the Jubilee Line extension for
the regenerative effect it would have on Docklands, but certainly not if it
is at the expense of providing central London with an acceptable transport
system. While money is being ploughed into transport for Docklands - Pounds
1.8bn for the Jubilee Line, Pounds 1.65bn for roads and Pounds 800m for an
expansion of the Docklands Light Railway - central London has seen the
Pounds 750m-a-year capital spending budget for its transport system cut by a
third, and CrossRail is now the only significant transport project on the
horizon.
Docklands is not the only part of London that needs good transport: central
London needs it, too. If the government cannot see this, it can only be
because it regards one of the capital's withered extremities as more
important than its overall economic health.
