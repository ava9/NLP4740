The water and electricity companies are expected to emerge as prime movers
in the government's drive to involve private finance in public services,
according to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary.
Mr Dorrell told journalists yesterday that the government was trying to
create a business sector which would build road and rail infrastructure on
behalf of the transport department.
Construction companies and the banks normally act as promoters for large
projects such as the Channel tunnel and estuarial crossings.
Mr Dorrell said the benefits of involving the private sector would emerge
only if the design, financing and construction of infrastructure were under
the control of companies with expertise in managing roads and railways.
He said: 'Utility companies recognise this as a business they might move
into. There will also be foreign companies with experience of running toll
roads abroad. Not all the expertise has to be home-grown.'
Mr Dorrell said he would not be keen to see state-owned foreign operators
such as SNCF, the nationalised company which runs the French railways,
entering the market.
The Budget this week included commitments to proceed with three large
public-sector projects using private finance: the modernisation of the west
coast railway line from London to Glasgow, the extension of the Docklands
Light Railway in east London to Lewisham, and the new air traffic control
centre for Scotland.
Mr Dorrell said he expected all three projects to be out to competitive
tender by the next Budget. He acknowledged that there was 'scope for
disappointment' over the pace of progress on the private finance initiative.
