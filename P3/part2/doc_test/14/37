It was a night for pageantry at the Rancho Alamitos High School homecoming game 
Friday, so Vaquero tailback Ulysses Trammell decided to put on a show of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell rushed for 244 yards in 20 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead 
Rancho Alamitos over Kennedy, 34-12, in front of about 1,500 at Bolsa Grande 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Ulysses Trammell saved our bacon," Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
That he did. 
</P>
<P>
The senior scored on a 60-yard run the first time he touched the ball and later 
on runs of 52, one and 24 yards, breaking would-be tacklers numerous times. He 
had 95 yards in six carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rancho Alamitos (5-0 overall, 2-0 in league) could not come up with 
much of an offensive output in the first half and held a 7-6 margin at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros were stunned on Kennedy's first possession of the game when 
quarterback John Guthrie connected with wide receiver Rod Rosales on a 51-yard 
pass play to give the Fighting Irish the early lead with 8 minutes 34 seconds 
left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho didn't help its cause by being penalized for 80 yards in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Trammell took control in the second half to bail out the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
He set up his second touchdown with a 26-yard run midway through the third 
period and then ran the ball four times in a six-play drive a couple of minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (2-3, 0-2) could not capitalize on Rancho's penalties and had to settle 
for only one more touchdown, on a five-yard pass from Guthrie to tailback Vince 
Church with 5:31 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros wrapped up their scoring with a five-yard run by Leon Vickers 
early in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho held Church to 60 yards in 14 carries. Guthrie completed seven of 16 
passes for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The victory almost proved costly for the Vaqueros, however. Senior 
fullback/tackle Vince Otteman suffered what originally was believed to be 
possible torn ligaments in a knee on his first carry of the game, but Vicki 
McAdams, a physician's assistant at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim, said the 
injury was diagnosed as a knee strain.
