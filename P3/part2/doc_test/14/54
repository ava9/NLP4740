Seventeen high school students from the San Fernando, Santa Clarita, Conejo and 
Simi valleys are among 1,800 recipients of National Merit $2,000 Scholarships 
in 1989.

The nonprofit National Merit Scholarship Corp., founded in 1955, honors 
students based on superior academic and extracurricular accomplishments, 
reflecting their potential to flourish in college.

<P>
A national 16-person committee, consisting of college admissions officers and 
secondary school counselors, chooses each state's winners in proportion to the 
size of the state's graduating class.

<P>
Each student receives a single allotment of $2,000.

There are two other categories of National Merit awards: corporate-sponsored 
scholarships, which are offered to students who have qualifications of 
particular interest to a sponsoring corporation, and college-sponsored awards 
that are given to students who will attend colleges and universities that 
finance Merit Scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 Merit Scholarships, totaling about $24 million, are offered 
annually. The program is funded by more than 600 independent-sponsor 
organizations and institutions.
