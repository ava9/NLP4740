Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lost contact with Magellan, the 
sophisticated radar-mapping spacecraft that entered orbit around Venus just 
last Friday, for 14 hours before communications were regained today. 
</P>
<P>
During a routine orientation test Thursday night, the spacecraft turned its 
antennas from Earth and pointed a small on-board telescope at two bright stars 
whose positions provide reference marks for the spacecraft's internal 
gyroscopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get a signal back," JPL spokesman Allen Wood said today. 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the spacecraft may have inadvertently locked on to a 
different, third star, disorienting its internal reference system so that it 
could no longer point its antenna toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the spacecraft is in no immediate danger. "We're pretty 
certain it is not tumbling," Wood said, because Earth-based receivers would 
pick up intermittent radio signals if it were. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of Magellan would have been a shattering blow to NASA, which has already 
been rocked this summer by the grounding of its shuttle fleet because of 
hydrogen leaks and defects in its highly touted Hubble Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Tony Spear was in the midst of a news conference today to 
outline the loss of contact when excited engineers ran in to announce a signal 
had been received from Magellan, the centerpiece of a $551-million mission to 
map the hidden surface of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
"It is Magellan's signal," project engineer Steve Wall said. "It is in lock. It 
has been verified to be Magellan's signal. This is slow telemetry (but) the 
spacecraft looks healthy." 
</P>
<P>
However, both of Magellan's high-data-rate radio transmitters were off, 
indicating that the spacecraft was or had been operating in a computer-induced 
state of hibernation called a "safe mode."
