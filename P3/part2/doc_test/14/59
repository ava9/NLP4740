It has only been six months since Ronald Reagan left office, but already some 
historians are willing to guess how history will compare him to other 
presidents. Most put him somewhere in the middle. Lewis Gould, a University of 
Texas historian, compares Reagan to Calvin Coolidge, explaining: "Coolidge was 
strong for keeping things from being done." Gould thinks Reagan will eventually 
wind up "in the middle or lower-middle ranks." But he did give Reagan credit 
for having "elements of F.D.R. in his ability to communicate." A biographer of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt begs to differ. Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at 
Harvard, said: "If I had to rank him right now, I would rank him as high as 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Both were total charmers. Both clung to the same sort of 
small-town Middle Western verities. Both were men of principle. Both to a 
certain extent were hands-off presidents." Not everyone agrees with Freidel, 
either. An Eisenhower biographer, Fred Greenstein of Princeton, said Eisenhower 
never had an Iran-Contra-type scandal and instead compares Reagan to Ulysses S. 
Grant, a President who, he said, "had substantial public support but left a 
rather messy legacy." Historian Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas also 
called Reagan a hands-off President and said that "he wasn't terrific at it but 
on the other hand he wasn't a failure, either. What shall we say? So-so, 
average, fair."

 -- For the first time in 35 years, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will enter a 
horse in a race in the United States, said track officials at Arlington Park in 
suburban Chicago. The queen's last entrant in the United States was Landau in 
1954. That horse finished last in the Washington International.

 -- The people of Salem, Mass., are a bit confused about two candidates for the 
City Council. One of them is Jean-Guy Martineau, who holds the 5th Ward seat 
and is seeking one of four at-large seats. Another is Jean-Claude Martineau, 
who is running for the 5th Ward seat that Jean-Guy is leaving. Adding to the 
confusion from their similar names is the reason for that likeness: They're 
40-year-old identical twins. Jean-Claude had been living in Florida but decided 
to enter politics upon his return to Salem because constituents kept mistaking 
him for his office-holding brother. "He got all the complaints and I got off 
free half of the time," Jean-Guy said. DAVE JOHNSON
