<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu Dhabi Denies Qaddumi Made </F>
Visit"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi have 
denied that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi paid an 
official visit to Abu Dhabi and held talks with officials there 
on the situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian issue. 
The sources said they had no knowledge of such a visit. 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Qaddumi 
stopped 
over on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning at Dubai international 
airport en route from Cairo to the Far East to visit a number of 
states there. 
  They added that Qaddumi, who stopped over at Dubai airport 
for about an hour, made some telephone calls to some Palestinian 
embassy officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The sources expect 
Qaddumi to stop over at Dubai airport when he returns from east 
Asia. The sources stressed they had no knowledge of the 
possibility of his making an official visit to the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] soon. 
  Qaddumi's stopover at Dubai airport does not carry any 
political indications, as President Yasir 'Arafat too stopped 
over at Abu Dhabi international airport last year while en route 
from Jakarta and Turkey. 
  Observers point out that official contacts between Abu Dhabi 
and the PLO were limited to the contacts with PLO Executive 
Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), who visited it on 
two occasions, the more recent of which was after the signing of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement in Washington on 13 September. 
During this visit he met with senior UAE officials, first and 
foremost Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the head of state.
