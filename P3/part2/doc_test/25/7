The ruler of Dubai, Sheik Rashid ibn Said al Maktum, vice president and Prime 
Minister of the United Arab Emirates, has died, Dubai television said Sunday.

<P>
Rashid, born in 1914, became ruler in 1958 and vice president and prime 
minister of the federation when Dubai merged with the six other members of 
the-then Trucial States to form the United Arab Emirates in 1971.

<P>
His eldest son and heir, Crown Prince Sheik Maktoum ibn Rashid Maktoum, is one 
of the UAE's two deputy prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Dubai is the UAE's second largest oil producer after Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Rashid assumed effective control of Dubai under British rule long before 
his father, Sheik Said al-Maktoum, died in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
He played a key role in establishing the UAE in 1971 but spent the last nine 
years of his life secluded in his palace, incapacitated by a series of strokes. 
Friends said he was still alert and in touch with the affairs of the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sheika Latifa, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, died in 1983.
