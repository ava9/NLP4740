  [Text] Abu Dhabi--Sources in Abu Dhabi yesterday stated 
that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will soon visit the UAE 
[United Arab Emirates] capital on his first official visit since 
August 1990. 
  'Arafat is expected to meet with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, president of the UAE, and a number of senior officials 
to inform them of the new developments on the Middle East peace 
process and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to conclude an 
autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. The sources did not 
mention the date of 'Arafat's arrival in Abu Dhabi, but they 
expect it to be after the end of his talks in Cairo with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  They asserted that a high-level UAE official had informed a 
delegation of the sons of the Palestinian colony in Abu Dhabi 
that the UAE had agreed to 'Arafat's visit. 
  The Palestinian president stopped at Abu Dhabi International 
Airport in October on the way from Indonesia to Turkey. He met 
in the airport with Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan, the 
deputy prime minister, and a number of senior UAE officials. 
  Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin), a member of the PLO executive 
committee, is the highest Palestinian personality who has 
visited the UAE officially since the Gulf war. 
  The sources state that 'Arafat will discuss with Shaykh 
Zayid 
the achievement of Arab interests and the PLO's relations with 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states. It is expected that 
he will discuss the PLO's financial situation and aid from the 
Gulf states for Palestinian autonomy with the UAE officials. 
  Shaykh Zayid has asserted more than once the UAE's 
continuing 
support for the Palestinian people and its intifadah in the 
occupied territories. The UAE has advocated offering financial 
aid of some $50 million within the framework of the aid, which 
will be offered to the autonomous areas in the occupied 
territories. 
  The UAE and the other member states in the GCC have 
supported 
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement that was signed on 13 
September in Washington, considering it a first steop toward the 
return of the Palestinian people's rights and the establishment 
of their independent state.
