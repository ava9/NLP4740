FOREIGN MINISTERS of Gulf Arab states started a second day of talks in Saudi
Arabia yesterday to find ways of countering energy taxes proposed by the US
and Europe, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The two-day meeting in Riyadh is the last in a series of talks by Gulf
Co-operation Council (GCC) states, which control over half the world's
proven oil reserves, to co-ordinate a unified position before talks with the
European Community next month.
Mr Mohammad Sahlawi, spokesman for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, was reported in the Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh as saying that Opec
would continue to try to explain its opposition to the tax.
The foreign ministers were also discussing the stalled Middle East peace
process, the United Arab Emirates' dispute with Iran over three strategic
Gulf islands, and Iraq's compliance with Gulf War-related UN resolutions.
The GCC groups Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)
heavyweights Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar with
small independent producers Oman and Bahrain.
The six states fear the tax would reverse a projected rise in oil demand and
hit earnings. The proposed US tax would levy around Dollars 3.50 on each
barrel of imported oil.
Gulf exporters are worried it will spur the EC to go ahead with plans for a
similar tax, which could add Dollars 10 over 10 years to the cost of a
barrel of imported oil. Gulf oil ministers will take the proposals to a
meeting in Oman in mid-April between Opec and other producers to map out a
strategy to counter the tax.
