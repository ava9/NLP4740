We would remove from the definition of ``freestanding'' the requirement that hospital-based OPOs service a single
transplant center. Section 4009(g) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&hyph;203) required
that OPOs be designated by Medicare to include no more than one OPO per service area. As the certification process limited
only one to an area and some of the OPOs were hospital-based, limiting the OPO's responsibility to a single transplant
center became impractical. An OPO (whether independent or hospital-based) is required to service all transplant
centers in its area. Accordingly, it would be very rare when a hospital-based OPO would service a single transplant
center.

Organ Acquisition Costs

To ensure that there is a more reasonable and accurate determination of the Medicare program's share of heart and lung
acquisition costs, we propose to pay transplant hospitals using the same method that we use to determine Medicare's
share of the cost of acquiring kidneys. As noted earlier, organ acquisition costs are paid to Medicare-certified
transplant centers as cost passthroughs (&sect;412.113(d)). The cost of acquiring kidneys for transplant is determined
by using a formula specified in &sect;413.179. Existing &sect;413.179 (redesignated as &sect;413.202 in this proposed
rule) requires that transplant hospitals compute Medicare kidney acquisition costs based on the ratio of the number
of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable
costs. We propose to expand the applicability of redesignated &sect;413.202 to include hearts and livers by making
it apply to ``organs'' instead of ``kidneys.'' We believe that this revision would result in a more reasonable determination
of Medicare heart and liver acquisition costs because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion
of such costs, including organ wastage. We would cross refer &sect;412.113 to &sect;413.202 to ensure proper cost
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By making this change, we would ensure that acquisition costs of organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients
are excluded from Medicare payment. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requires that the cost of services be borne by
the appropriate payor. Accordingly, the cost associated with organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries must be borne
by the responsible individual or third party payor. The law precludes Medicare from paying any costs associated with
organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries.
