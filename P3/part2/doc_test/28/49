&bull;Conditions that may not co-exist, such as partial/total, unilateral/bilateral, obstructed/unobstructed,

The creation of the CC Exclusions List was a major project involving hundreds of codes. The FY 1988 revisions were intended
to be only a first step toward refinement of the CC list in that the criteria used for eliminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain diagnoses from consideration as CCs were intended to identify only the most obvious diagnoses that should
not be considered complications or comorbidities of another diagnosis. For that reason, and in light of comments
and questions on the CC list, we have continued to review the remaining CCs to identify additional exclusions and to
remove diagnoses from the master list that have been shown not to meet the definition of a CC stated above, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. (See the September 30, 1988 final rule for the revision made for the discharges occurring in FY 1989 (53
FR 38485), the September 1, 1989 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1990 (54 FR 36552),
the September 4, 1990 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1991 (55 FR 36126), the August
30, 1991 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1992 (56 FR 43209), the September 1, 1992 final
rule for the revisions made for discharges occurring in FY 1993 (57 FR 39753), and the September 1, 1993 final rule for
the revisions made for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharges occurring in FY 1994 (58 FR 46278).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing a limited revision of the CC Exclusions List to take into account the changes that will be made in the
ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM diagnosis coding system effective October 1, 1994. (See section II.B.7, below, for a discussion
of these changes.) These proposed changes are being made in accordance with the principles established when we created
the CC Exclusions List in 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, upon review of our current CC Exclusions List, we found that there are some diagnosis codes that do not
exclude themselves as CCs. In the September 1, 1987 final notice, we noted that a very few codes were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from themselves because they may signify the bilateral occurrence of a particular condition (for example,
diagnosis code 730.02 (acute osteomyelitis of upper arm)) (52 FR 33154). However, we found some diagnosis codes that
do not meet this criterion. Therefore, we are proposing to add the following diagnosis codes to the CC Exclusions List
as excluding themselves when they are secondary diagnoses: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
710.0_Systemic lupus erythematous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
710.1_Systemic sclerosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
710.3_Sicca syndrome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
710.4_Dermatomyositis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
710.8_Other specified diffuse diseases of connective tissue 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a comment we received, we are also proposing to exclude diagnosis code 707.1 (Ulcer of lower limb, except decubitus)
as a CC when the principal diagnosis is 440.23 (atherosclerosis of the extremities with ulceration). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter believes that this exclusion is similar to the current exclusion of 785.4 (Gangrene) when the principal
diagnosis is 440.24 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with gangrene), and we agree with the commenter's assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it was brought to our attention by another commenter that when a patient's principal diagnosis is complication
of a transplant condition (diagnosis codes 996.71 and 996.8x), the diagnosis codes used to denote transplant status
(V42.x) should not be considered CCs. Thus, for the following principal diagnoses, we are proposing to delete the
indicated status code: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.71 (Complications due to heart valve prosthesis) delete code V42.2 (Heart valve transplant influencing
health status) as a CC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.80 (Complications of unspecified organ transplant) delete codes V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing
health status), V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health status), V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health
status), V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health status), and V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue transplant
influencing health status) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as CCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.81 (Complications of kidney transplant) delete code V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing health
status) as a CC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.82 (Complications of liver transplant) delete code V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health
status) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.83 (Complications of heart transplant) delete code V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health
status) as a CC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For code 996.84 (Complications of lung transplant) delete code V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health
status) as a CC.
