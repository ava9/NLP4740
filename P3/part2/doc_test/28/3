Doctors suspect Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a heart-liver 
transplant, is rejecting a second transplanted liver she received Feb. 20, a 
family friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Stormie, 12, was scheduled to leave her home near Ft. Worth today for 
Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh after her liver enzyme count shot to 
dangerously high levels. Stormie's condition has been constantly monitored 
since she became the world's first heart-liver transplant patient on Feb. 14, 
1984. The first liver was damaged by a form of hepatitis.
