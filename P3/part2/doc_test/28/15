Hospital Report: Surgeon Thomas Starzl, 64, was expected to be back seeing 
patients this week after undergoing coronary surgery in the Pittsburgh hospital 
he helped make famous for innovative transplants. He was released Tuesday from 
Presbyterian-University Hospital, where doctors removed a blockage from his 
right coronary artery. Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver 
transplant in 1967, was admitted Sunday with chest pains. "He's doing quite 
well," said Starzl's physician, Bruce Wilson. "We expect a speedy recovery."

His Other Kitchen Cabinet: Dwight Eisenhower, the 34th U.S. President, 
apparently had considerable culinary skills, according to Ed and Candace 
Russoli, authors of "Ike the Cook." The book includes 32 recipes and 
photographs of Ike in an apron. Some of his specialties were vegetable soup and 
squirrel stew. The recipes come from Eisenhower's former staff members and from 
Eisenhower's archives.

weekend with James Usry, who faces charges of corruption resulting from his 
tenure as mayor of Atlantic City, N.J. Barry, on trial in connection with drug 
possession and perjury charges, said he was in Atlantic City to relax, and he 
and Usry joined their wives Sunday at church services. Usry is charged with 
accepting a bribe and was defeated in his reelection bid last month.
