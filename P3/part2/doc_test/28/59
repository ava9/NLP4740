Ricky Reed turned 5 on Tuesday. But how many more birthdays he'll live to 
celebrate may depend on whether he can receive a lifesaving bone marrow 
transplant from a brother or sister who is due to be born in five days. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky has suffered from leukemia since he was 22 months old, and his parents, 
with the help of the National Marrow Donor Program, have searched the United 
States and Europe for a donor of bone marrow -- the thick, almost granular 
substance within bone structure that manufactures the blood's red and white 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
In Ricky's case, it's the stuff that could save his life by providing him with 
the raw material necessary to replenish his body with healthy white blood 
cells. But no donors have been found yet who match Ricky's exact blood and 
antigen types. Now his best bet for the future may rest with an unborn sibling 
whose due date is Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While the chances of finding compatible bone marrow donors among unrelated 
people is 1 in 20,000 -- and the reality can be 1 in a million -- the chance of 
a match between siblings is 1 in 4. 
</P>
<P>
But little Ricky isn't watching the odds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more excited about having a baby sister than the fact that the baby may 
save his life," Theresa Reed said Tuesday while her kindergartner son 
celebrated his birthday with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle swords, pajamas and 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Richard -- a Navy hospital corpsman -- live on the 
northern fringe of Camp Pendleton, near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricky's living as normal a life as possible. He doesn't think about it (the 
leukemia) all the time, but he does know that he can die from it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reeds thought they were getting close to finding a compatible donor when 
the national registry found five people in the United States -- and two more in 
Europe -- who showed on the first screening that they might match. But further 
testing eliminated them. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's other child, 2 1/2-year-old Ruben, didn't match, either. 
</P>
<P>
So, for years, Ricky has received a steady regimen of chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment as he roller-coasters between remissions and relapses. Now 
the leukemia has infected his spinal fluid and entered his brain, and the 
youngster undergoes regular spinal taps to relieve the pressure in his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows something's up when the headaches won't go away. He knows he's got 
cancer, but he doesn't understand why, or why him, or the depth of it," his 
mother said. "He's constantly asking questions, and constantly learning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hiding anything from him. It's not fair for a child to go through so 
much pain without knowing what he's got. We don't want him to be scared, but we 
talk to him about what he has, and that it can be fatal, and we talk about God, 
and how we accept the fact that there's nothing we can do but be there for him 
and support him." 
</P>
<P>
But a wellspring of hope erupted nine months ago -- coincidentally, at a low 
point in the family's life, when Ricky was being treated for another infection 
that required he be taken off chemotherapy. With the lapse of that medication, 
his bone marrow cancer flared up, sending the family into depression. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the Reeds learned Theresa was pregnant with her third 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a miracle," she said. "It's the best we can hope for. We know the 
baby may not match Ricky -- we've been let down before -- and we won't let our 
hopes go real high. But still. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The baby will be delivered at the Navy Hospital at Camp Pendleton, and the 
newborn will be typed for its human leukocyte antigens -- the six particular 
components of blood that should match identically with the would-be recipient. 
</P>
<P>
There are 210,000 potential donors registered with the National Marrow Donor 
Program -- a number that virtually doubled in the past six months with 
increased awareness. But the critical antigens are somewhat linked to race and 
ethnicity, and only about 1.5% of the donors are Latino, like Ricky. 
</P>
<P>
That's why all the attention is focused, for now, on the new baby. 
</P>
<P>
If the siblings prove compatible, doctors will wait as long as necessary -- 
weeks, or maybe months-for Ricky's leukemia to again go into remission. Then he 
and his new brother or sister will be flown to Seattle's acclaimed Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the largest bone marrow transplant unit in 
the world, for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
While chemotherapy and radiation remain the primary treatments for leukemia, 
bone marrow transplants have grown in popularity in recent years -- thanks 
largely to the growth of the donor list. 
</P>
<P>
The use of children -- even babies -- as donors is increasing as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The youngest donor I'm aware of was a 6-week-old baby, and the marrow 
transplantation was successful," said Dr. Carl Lenarsky, medical director for 
the transplantation program at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I've done transplantations involving a baby 5 or 6 months old, and 
that was successful, too," he said. "It's technically feasible, and can be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Given the time it will take for Ricky to re-enter remission, and for the 
newborn to be tested, the baby will likely be at least 6 weeks old before the 
transplant is done -- assuming the two children match -- he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Kadota, director of bone marrow transplantations at Children's 
Hospital of San Diego, said doctors prefer to wait until a baby is 6 months 
old, if not a year, before undertaking the procedure. "But you don't always 
have the luxury of waiting that long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In such procedures, the donor is put under a general anesthetic, and a needle 
is inserted into the center of the hip -- the body's largest bone. A tablespoon 
of marrow is withdrawn for every kilogram of the recipient's body weight, then 
introduced into the recipient's body by a catheter that leads directly to the 
heart, where it then is carried to the bones and settles. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest risk to the recipient during the recovery time is infection; for 
the donor, it is the anesthesia itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical ethicists question the use of babies as donors of bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The first issue is, is it right to impose risk on a child in order, solely, to 
benefit another person?" said Art Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical 
Ethics at the University of Minnesota, who specializes in the ethics of 
transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
"The second issue is, who can give consent for the baby, since normally we 
presume parents can, but in these kinds of situations -- donations between 
siblings -- there may be a conflict of interest. Should there be a third party 
-- an ethics committee, a guardian, a court or an advocate for the newborn 
child?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, he said, the parents have to be braced for the possibility 
that the newborn child's bone marrow won't match the older child's -- and 
consider the baby a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"The hidden issue is the strain on the parents who have a child who is dying, 
and are filled with joy because of the birth of a new child. That's an 
incredible burden," Caplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenarsky agreed that ethicists have debated turning to babies as donors of bone 
marrow -- but says he endorses the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance of doing overwhelming good outweighs the very slight risk to the 
baby," he said. "And in situations like this, reasonable people believe a child 
would give his consent, if he could." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Reed, meanwhile, is focusing on other matters. "I got a Ninja Turtle 
poster for my birthday!" he blurted. "And I've got a girlfriend."
