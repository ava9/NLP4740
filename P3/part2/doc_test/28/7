<P>
A girl who received part of her mother's liver in the nation's first such 
living-donor transplant underwent nearly five more hours of surgery today to 
stop internal bleeding, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the bleeding, doctors predicted success for Monday's transplant 
operations on 21-month-old Alyssa Smith and her mother, Teresa. Specialists say 
the procedure could relieve a severe shortage of organs for children, many of 
whom die while awaiting a liver from a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
During the night Alyssa's new liver began to bleed, a complication that occurs 
in about 30% of all liver transplants. The youngster was returned to the 
operating room before dawn.
