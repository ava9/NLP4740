SUCCESSFUL HEART TRANSPLANT ENDS PATIENT'S LONG WAIT

An excruciating wait and more than 50 days on a mechanical life-support system 
ended for a young Costa Mesa man Sunday when doctors replaced his virus-damaged 
heart in a successful transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Smallcomb, 22, was recuperating Monday after surgery in which Sharp 
Memorial Hospital doctors attached a donor heart taken from a Central 
California man in his early 20s, according to Judy Coburn, transplant 
coordinator at Sharp. Smallcomb's liver and kidneys were functioning normally 
with the transplant, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The new heart was in place and working by 3 a.m. Sunday, Coburn said. It had 
earlier been flown to San Diego, packed in a sterile plastic bag and kept at 5 
degrees Celsius in a saline solution in a cooler. It arrived at Lindbergh Field 
just after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A transplant team of doctors, nurses and assistants from Sharp flew to Central 
California Saturday night to retrieve the heart with blood type O, Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Smallcomb was alert Monday after the surgery that ended at 8:30 a.m. Sunday. He 
had been up from his bed twice, said his father, Thomas Smallcomb, adding that 
the transplant "was right, and we knew that it would eventually happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although his son was in some pain from the surgery, "he is doing 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing he did is, we have this little sign language and squeezing 
each other's hand means I love you. He squeezed my hand the hardest . . . he 
has since he's been here." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's surgery marked the painful end of Smallcomb's dependance on an acute 
ventricular assist device that had been pumping oxygen-rich blood in place of 
his heart's left side, which had been devastated by an unknown virus. The same 
virus has claimed the lives of his mother, a sister and seven other blood 
relatives.
