  [Text] After the completion of the Apollo moon 
program at the beginning of the 1970s, the U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department 
of Defense launched the design engineering of the Space Shuttle 
reusable space transport system (MTKS). The decision was made in 
the USSR to create a transport system for analogous purposes in 
order to preserve parity, although the conceptual framework for 
air/space craft had begun to be developed here before the 
Americans--since the beginning of the 1960s. 
<H6>  Space Shuttle </H6>
  Crew. Two astronaut/pilots and up to five flight 
specialists. 
  Composition. The Space Shuttle MTKS has an orbital 
aircraft (OS), an external fuel tank (VTB) and two solid-fuel 
launch boosters (STU), sometimes called the first stage. The 
sole non-reusable element of the system is the VTB. 
  Flight configuration. The three propulsion ZhRDs 
[liquid-fuel rocket engines] of the OS and STU are ignited from 
the moment of launch. The MTKS is launched vertically. The spent 
STUs separate from the VTB and drop into the Atlantic Ocean by 
parachute. The OS continues flight using its own propulsion 
ZhRDs, and after the fuel in the VTB is expended the tank 
separates from the OS and burns up in the atmosphere. The 
aircraft is brought into orbit using the ZhRD of the orbital 
maneuvering system (SOM), which operates using storable 
hypergolic fuel. The MTKS is controlled on the injection section 
by rolling the propulsion ZhRDs in swivel suspensions and 
deflecting the STU nozzles in an elastomeric (flexible) bearing. 
The OS is controlled in orbit by the ZhRDs of the low-thrust 
rocket control system (RSU), which operates, like the SOM 
engines, using storable hypergolic fuel and is installed in the 
nose and in two rear sections. The OS, upon completion of 
orbital operations, is slowed by the SOM engines, enters the 
atmosphere and makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, a glide 
and a horizontal landing with inoperative engines. The RSU are 
used when leaving orbit and flying in the upper layers of the 
atmosphere, and the aerodynamic control surfaces enter into 
operation to the extent of the descent of the OS. The crew 
pilots the OS on the glide and landing legs. 
  Design. The wing is a low-mounted delta wing with 
dual sweep on the leading edge, split ailerons on the trailing 
edge and without any means of mechanization. The fuselage is a 
semimonocoque design with flat sides. It consists of three 
parts--the nose holds a two-level airtight cockpit for the crew 
and a compartment for the electronics gear, the middle has a 
non-airtight cargo bay (OPN), under which runs the central 
torsion box of the wing, and in the rear is the compartment for 
the main engine installation (ODU), the SOM nacelles and the 
swept tail with a split rudder. The lower portion of the rear 
tail section has a balancing flap under the fuselage, which 
plays the role of an air brake along with the rudder during 
landing. The airframe was constructed principally of aluminum 
alloys. The doors of the OPN and the fairing of the SOM nacelles 
are manufactured of graphite-epoxy composite materials (KM); the 
strength elements of the tail fin are made of boron-aluminum KM, 
and the seating frame for the main ZhRDs of boron- epoxy KM; the 
housing of the high-pressure tanks and some of the trunk lines 
are made of Kevlar-epoxy resin type organic fibers. 
  Thermal protection of OS is passive, and covers 
almost the entire surface of the craft. The most heat-stressed 
locations on the OS--the tips of the fuselage and the wing--are 
covered with reinforced carbon-carbon type KM, followed by 
plates of silicon dioxide with a boron-silicate coating with 
heat-resistant additives that are black in color protecting the 
lower surfaces of the fuselage and the wing, as well as its tips 
and trailing edge. White plates of silicon dioxide fibers with a 
boron-silicate coating are installed on the upper surfaces of 
the wing and fuselage, the tail fin and the SOM nacelles. The 
least heat-stressed locations--the OPN doors, upper surface of 
the wing and sides of the fuselage and SOM nacelles--are 
protected with mats of nylon fiber covered with an organic 
silicon resin. 
  Engine installations. The main engine installation 
consists of three SSME oxygen-hydrogen propulsion ZhRDs from the 
firm of Rocketdyne, with a thrust of 170 tones of force each on 
Earth or 213 tons in a vacuum. The engines have a self-contained 
configuration (both components enter the combustion chamber in 
gaseous form), with the reheating of spent turbogas in 
high-pressure combustion chambers, installed on the OS and fed 
from the VTB. The two solid-fuel launch boosters from the firm 
of Morton-Thiokol mounted along the sides of the VTB have a 
thrust of 1,203 tons of force at sea level. 
  The power plant of the OS consists of three batteries of 
hydrogen-oxygen fuel elements and three hydrazine auxiliary 
power plants used to steer the main ZhRDs, as well as to control 
the aerodynamic surfaces and the landing gear. 
  Status. The Space Shuttle MTKS had made 53 flights 
as of January 1993. Six OS were built--the Enterprise (employed 
as an analogue of the OS for horizontal flight testing), the 
Columbia, the Challenger (lost in the catastrophe of January 
1986), the Atlantis, the Discovery and the Endeavour. The system 
continues to be in service. 
  Additional information. The existing configuration 
of the MTKS was chosen in 1974. The flight testing started in 
April of 1981. 
  The MTKS is currently employed for deliveries to space, 
supporting astronauts in orbit and returning especially valuable 
payloads to Earth, but the Department of Defense had decided by 
the end of 1992 to refrain from the use of the MTKS to put 
military payloads into orbit, and to use the non-reusable launch 
vehicles of the Titan family for this purpose. 
<H6>  Energiya/Buran </H6>
  Crew. Two to four cosmonaut/pilots and up to six 
flight specialists. 
  Composition. The Energiya/Buran MTKS includes the 
Energiya launch vehicle (four Zenit-1 launch boosters and a 
central second-stage unit), which is able to put various 
payloads and the Buran orbital vessel (OK) into orbit. The OK 
and the launch boosters are the reusable elements of the system. 
  Flight configuration. At the moment of launch the 
MTKS includes the four RD-0120 oxygen-hydrogen engines of the 
central unit and the four RD-170 oxygen-kerosene engines of the 
boosters. Launch is vertical. The boosters separate from the 
central unit after finishing their operation, make a parachute 
descent in the atmosphere and land. The central unit ceases 
operation before reaching the nominal orbit, separates from the 
OK and is destroyed on entering the dense layers of the 
atmosphere. The OK is brought up to orbit using two 
oxygen-kerosene ZhRDs of the SOM system. The MTKS is controlled 
during this ascent stage by steering the combustion chambers of 
the ZhRDs in the central unit and the boosters on their bearing 
suspensions. Low-thrust oxygen- kerosene ZhRDs mounted in the 
nose and two in the rear RSU units control the OK in orbit. 
After the completion of orbital operations, the SOM engine 
issues a braking impulse, and the OK enters the atmosphere, 
makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, glides and make a 
horizontal landing with non-operating engines. The RSUs are used 
when leaving orbit and in the upper layers of the atmosphere, 
with the aerodynamic control surfaces coming into action to the 
extent of the descent of the OK. The OK can be controlled on the 
glide and landing legs either by the crew or automatically. 
  Design of the OK. The Buran is in principle 
analogous to the OS of the Space Shuttle by and large, but its 
wing is shifted forward somewhat. The tail section of the 
fuselage, aside from the rudder and flap under the fuselage, has 
the SOM engine installation, RSU units and a pod with the 
braking parachute. 
  Thermal protection of the OK is passive and 
plated. The tips of the fuselage and wing are covered with a 
carbon-carbon type reinforced KM, with the less heat-stressed 
places having plates of sintered quartz fiber with a protective 
coating. The thermal protection of the Buran OK, as opposed to 
the American craft, is "all-weather"--it can withstand rain and 
hail. 
  Engine installations. The principal ZhRDs of the 
launch vehicle and the ship are executed in a self-contained 
configuration (hydrogen comes into the combustion chamber in 
gaseous form, and the oxygen in liquid form) with the reheating 
of spent turbogas in the combustion chambers under high 
pressure. The RD-170 engines have a thrust of 740 tonnes of 
force each, the RD-0120s 156 tonnes each (205 in a vacuum) and 
the SOM ZhRDs 8,500 tonnes in a vacuum. 
  The power plant of the Buran OK is analogous to that of the 
Space Shuttle OS. 
  Status. The Energiya launch vehicle has made two 
flights--15 May 1987 with a Skif-DM (Polyus) module as the 
payload, and 15 November 1988 with the Buran OK without 
cosmonauts. The OK No. 1 had been mothballed by the start of 
1993, with the OK No. 2 prepared for orbital flight; the 
manufacture of OK No. 3 has been curtailed. 
  Additional information. The decree on the 
development of the Energiya/Buran MTKS came out in February 1976 
after the cancellation of the N1-L3 program. The manufacture of 
five Buran OKs had been proposed. The MTKS was to meet the 
country's needs for the placement into orbit of medium and heavy 
payloads for civilian and military purposes, with the return of 
some of them to Earth. 
  A special version of the VM-T bomber, which provided for the 
separate transport of the launch vehicle and the OK on an 
external hanger over the aircraft fuselage, was created in order 
to transport the larger elements of the system from the 
manufacturing plant to the engineering positions. The An-225 
Mriya heavy-lift transport aircraft was later created for these 
same purposes. 
  Smaller models of the OK (the BOR-4 and BOR-5) launched 
using 
the Kosmos launch vehicle were used to try out the aerodynamics 
and thermal protection of the craft in the range of high 
hypersonic speeds. 
  Flight testing of the Energiya/Buran has been halted, owing 
to the cutbacks in appropriations and the loss of interest in 
the program on the part of the Ministry of Defense. A 
non-piloted flight of Buran OK No. 2 is being proposed for 1993, 
with the subsequent mothballing of all of the MTKSs until such 
time as spheres for its efficient utilization are found.
