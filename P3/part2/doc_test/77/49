  [Text] Republican economic entities have run into debt 
amounting to millions of soms in customs dues for barter deals 
to the state. Staff at the Kyrgyz Customs Directorate are 
facing now the task of recovering this money from commercial 
structures and enterprises. This has been said by Anatoliy 
Linishenko, head of the Republican Customs Directorate, during a 
briefing at government house. Over the last year 32 million 
soms in customs duty were paid to the state budget, which 
comprises around 20-30 percent of the possible volume of customs 
dues. The reasons for this are inefficiency of the Customs 
Directorate, the open border with Tajikistan, gross violations 
of customs rules by a great number of commercial organizations, 
and other reasons.
