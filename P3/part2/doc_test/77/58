  [Text] Bishkek March 10 TASS -- About a hundred of 
picketers, members of the association of Kyrgyz free farmers and 
agricultural enterpreneurs, met in front of the government 
palace in Bishkek today to demand government support for 
President Akayev's decree on free land transactions. They also 
called for cutting short all intervention hampering reforms in 
agriculture. 
  The picketers, who are participants in the congress of the 
association, which opened in the Kyrgyz capital today, decided 
to make their views known to the government and the public on 
the very first day of the gathering. 
  Their representative Askarbek Bazarkulov said "the 
government 
headed by Apas Jumagulov has not justified our confidence, 
because it is only paying lip service to reforms in agriculture. 
  "We ask only one thing -- that they do not interfere with 
our 
activity and give us loans. The 150 million soms (about 15 
million dollars) allocated to agriculture recently has been 
wasted in supporting unviable collective farms, and only ten 
million soms (about 1 million dollars) of that amount of money 
were given to private farmers. 
  "We, free land owners and farmers, have not received 
anything", said Askarbek Bazarkulov, one of the organizers of 
Kyrgyz peasant movement. 
  The congress is expected to raise a question about the 
resignation of the republic's government.
