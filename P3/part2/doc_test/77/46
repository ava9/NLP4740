<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Theo </F>
Sommer; place and date not given: "Europe Must Not Become a 
Loser"] 
  [Text] [Sommer] Mr. Chancellor, what belongs together is 
gradually coming together in Europe. Are you satisfied with the 
results of Austria's European Union [EU] membership negotiations? 
  [Vranitzky] I am satisfied with the result of the membership 
negotiations. We stood our ground and realized our objectives 
in virtually all the fields of particular importance to us. The 
transit treaty in its present form is actually an improvement of 
the original version. Therefore, one can tell the Tiroleans 
with reason and good conscience that they have won something. 
In addition, the transit treaty provides for the speedy 
alternative of rail transportation, in many places underground, 
including the Brenner Pass tunnel. And our farmers are well 
off. Bavarian Minister President Stoiber visited us recently. 
He said that, after the conclusion of our negotiations, he now 
has to explain to his mountain farmers why Austrian mountain 
farmers are treated better. 
  [Sommer] How friendly are the Austrians toward Europe after 
the conclusion of the negotiations? If the referendum were held 
tomorrow.... 
  [Vranitzky] ...we would have a majority of positive votes. 
  [Sommer] The referendum will be held in June, and the 
parliament will deal with the treaty in May? 
  [Vranitzky] Our treaty has already been submitted to the 
parliament here. However, we have to wait for final adoption 
until the European Parliament has made a decision. Its final 
deadline is 4 May. 
  [Sommer] Since the last elections in three of your provinces 
the question has sometimes been asked whether a radical domestic 
policy change in Austria is imminent that might run counter to 
your willingness to become a member. What importance should be 
attached to the anti-European factor, Haider? 
  [Vranitzky] One has to start with the knowledge that both 
the political prerequisites and the election results in the 
three provinces were quite different. By the way, Haider's 
attitude has resulted in the formation of blocs in the Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe]; many people in the party take an 
absolutely positive view of integration. Provincial 
organizations in individual provinces will dissociate themselves 
from Haider as party chairman; today nobody can tell yet whether 
Haider will decide in favor of or against EU membership in the 
end. 
  [Sommer] Does the question of Austrian neutrality still play 
a role in connection with entry into the EU? 
  [Vranitzky] Insofar as more than 50 percent of our people 
are in favor of maintaining neutrality. 
  [Sommer] Even after the end of the Cold War and the 
confrontation of the blocs in Europe? 
  [Vranitzky] Even after these developments. One must neither 
underestimate nor ignore the emotional value [of neutrality]. 
For a country that was involved in either war or civil war, 
occupied, or otherwise disrupted until about 1955, it has 
primarily to do with the attainment of independence and 
identity. Therefore, I am particularly glad that we have found 
a consensus with the EU members by our clear declaration that we 
also want and are able to participate in the development of a 
European security system on the basis of our neutrality. 
  [Sommer] You will participate in the development of an EU 
security policy identity? 
  [Vranitzky] That's right. Neutrality is not affected by a 
joint security policy. This is also the reason we have not 
abandoned neutrality overnight. As soon as a visible and 
recognizable European security system is developed, it will also 
be possible to discuss neutrality far more calmly in this 
country. 
  [Sommer] Austria is not considering closer involvement with 
NATO or even becoming a NATO member, which is desired by many 
Central European countries? 
  [Vranitzky] We are indeed not discussing NATO membership. 
  [Sommer] But you would not rule out membership in the 
Western European Union, either associate status or as a full 
member? 
  [Vranitzky] I would not rule it out. 
  [Sommer] How will Austria change after entry? What will you 
get? What will be made easier for you? 
  [Vranitzky] I start with the premise that today Austria is 
already one of the most integrated countries in the field of 
economy and commerce. We transact two-thirds of our trade with 
EU countries. This share is far higher than the share of many 
EU members. 
  It is also undeniable that the development of the single 
market will result in disadvantages for those who do not belong 
to it. The longer it takes, the more this disadvantage will 
increase. 
  Moreover, in the so-called European treaties, the EU 
concluded free trade agreements with the Visegrad states that 
are in this way better off than us. These disadvantages cannot 
be eliminated in another way than by our entry. That is to say 
that we will formalize a very intensive relationship and 
eliminate disadvantages from one moment to the other by our 
entry. 
  [Sommer] How must the EU change if the present round of 
enlargement is to be successful and, in addition, one aims at 
further expansion to the east? 
  [Vranitzky] The political voting mechanisms should become 
more conclusive and gain in substance. The EU is now reaching a 
new dimension, the next substantive step. The enforcement of 
certain principles of order is no longer at issue here. Rather, 
it must be important to jointly develop structural measures, 
politically resolve them, and then implement them. 
  [Sommer] Do you also feel that there is a lack of 
democracy in the Community? 
  [Vranitzky] From the point of view of someone who is still 
an outsider, one certainly has to show understanding for the 
fact that countries with functioning parliamentary democracies 
on a national level also do not want to do without a functioning 
parliamentary democracy at the level of integration. 
  [Sommer] Some people have lately voiced the fear that the 
enlargement by Austria and Scandinavia will "Germanize" the old 
Community and an imbalance in favor of the north might replace 
the imbalance in favor of the south, about which many are 
complaining today. The original European Community was a 
Carolingian community. Now a piece is being added to it. 
  [Vranitzky] A combination of Kaiser Wilhelm and Metternich 
or something of that sort. 
  [Sommer] From the point of view of history, one could say 
that a Habsburg element is being added. Romans, Germans, and 
Slavs will be unified in the future Europe. 
  [Vranitzky] If the EU is to truly integrate, it probably has 
to be expected that other elements yet to be historically 
defined will be added. 
  [Sommer] The idea of a EU with 24 or even 30 members does 
not worry you? 
  [Vranitzky] No. Then we will certainly have to basically 
consider the institutions. The statutes of the club will have 
to be different if the number of the club members increases that 
much. I do not assert that everything will be simpler then. 
The challenges will increase. However, if we reduce the idea 
of integration to its original idea, that is, to establish 
security and peace, this objective has already been reached in 
the present circle of members. It has become inconceivable for 
one to aim a gun at the other again. There is no justification 
whatsoever for stopping at borders when this objective is 
pursued. 
  [Sommer] Will the next group enter the EU en bloc like the 
countries of the European Free Trade Association now? Or will 
readiness for entry have to be judged more according to the 
individual capacity of the candidate countries? 
  [Vranitzky] It is not easy to predict. However, there seems 
to be a trend toward individualization. But I believe that we 
will be busy with the expansion to the east in the next decade. 
  [Sommer] What is your concept of the future EU? Will it be 
a confederation? A federal state? Or, as the Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe said, a union of states? 
  [Vranitzky] Provided that this debate is not primarily an 
academic one, I believe that what we call federalism in a 
national state is probably the most obvious model. This would 
also be in line with the subsidiarity principle according to 
Maastricht. 
  [Sommer] Will the EU become a big bloc in addition to the 
two big blocs that are already beginning to appear now, that is, 
the North American and the Asian-Japanese? And do you 
anticipate confrontations or cooperation between these 
structures? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not like to use the word "bloc" because, on 
the one hand, it expresses monopolization and, on the other, it 
might confirm the reproach that Europe is developing into the 
"fortress of Europe." European integration is to create a 
certain framework of order and rules of behavior; it is to 
formulate and implement policies without restricting peoples or 
individuals. The first challenge would be to guarantee these 
areas. 
  The second challenge is to come to an understanding with the 
rest of the world beyond these forms of integration. For 
example, in the economically very successful Asian countries 
there are certain views of social standards, the standard of 
living, individual rights, human rights, and democracy rights 
that do not correspond to ours. The danger that I see is if 
these different views are used to strengthen competitiveness in 
competition with other areas. Thus, if some Asian states say 
coolly and bluntly: "We do not want to achieve a living 
standard such as that of the Europeans because we think that the 
defense of it over decades is too difficult," we are worlds 
apart in this respect. However, we have to take care that, in 
this division of the world, Europe does not permanently lose, 
which is currently beginning to show to a certain extent. 
  [Sommer] Do you think we in Europe again capable of offering 
work to our people without reducing our standard of living, our 
social standard? 
  [Vranitzky] Even though we in Europe currently anticipate 
the first signs of an economic stimulation and are delighted by 
it, one must clearly state: If a basic problem is that the 
strengthening of Europe's competitiveness means almost 
exclusively a reduction of jobs in industry and the industrial 
environment, there are not enough alarm bells ringing in Europe 
because the next aspect of such a development would be a threat, 
a danger to the present standards of our social security. 
Certainly the answer cannot be in the reduction of the European 
income level. 
  [Sommer] We cannot adopt the hourly wages of southern China. 
  [Vranitzky] Precisely. And the answer cannot be the 
reduction of social security either, if only because for 
humanitarian reasons. The answers that one must find and give 
lie in overcoming what I would call the third industrial 
revolution. We have to become the new leader in technology, 
production, finding markets, cooperation, and systems 
engineering through research, development, education, training, 
and the best possible mobilization of human capital. 
  [Sommer] Can the economy achieve that on its own or does it 
need the state's protective or even guiding hand for it? 
  [Vranitzky] This question is essential. I am firmly 
convinced that the economy needs support from the state. The 
very clever question was once asked: How much of the state does 
the market need? Politicians have to define the answer to it 
always anew. Meanwhile, even the most committed market economy 
experts realize that the market or the market economy cannot 
work without a certain guiding network, a network of state 
management and services. 
  [Sommer] What will thousand-year-old Austria bring to 
Europe in the way of historical experience? 
  [Vranitzky] We must ensure that with the process of reform 
and the restoration of democracy that is underway in the former 
communist states, the European West and my country in particular 
do not turn away from the reform states for political reasons or 
isolate those states permanently. 
  What I mean by that is: When, following parliamentary 
elections in those reform countries, a political grouping is 
formed that does not correspond exactly to our Western model, we 
distance ourselves. That should not be the case. I fear that 
the Western democracies will not be able to choose what 
preferences and priorities our brothers and sisters in the east 
develop. 
  Furthermore, now that there is a glimmer of hope that the 
armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be brought to an end, 
one must support efforts that really will seen an end to the 
conflict. However, we already have to start thinking about what 
will happen after the conflict: What would we do to assist in 
the reconstruction of these regions that have been destroyed? 
How will we overcome the isolation of those who are currently 
outcasts? 
  [Sommer] Whom do you mean? The Serbs? 
  [Vranitzky] For example. One must in general give the 
postcommunist countries a chance to develop a new mentality, a 
chance to transform their own systems. There are some who 
believe that free market economy evidently cannot be created in 
Ukraine. That is why there is a distancing from Ukraine. 
However, without a basic readiness on our part for cooperation, 
Ukraine will not be able to develop a free market economy. Also 
those who have a bad record on human rights are kept at arm's 
length. We must win them over to treating human rights in the 
way that we decide within the CSCE [Council for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe] or the European Council. We should not 
always say: "We do not want to have anything at all to do with 
you," but "we would like to have something to do with you, but 
create the appropriate conditions." 
  [Sommer] As Foreign Minister Mock put it, Austria lies on 
the edge of a storm zone. You have mentioned Ukraine. Vienna 
is closer to the Ukrainian border than to the city of Bregenz. 
In the north, you witnessed how Czechoslovakia fell apart after 
75 years. On your southern border, you have witnessed how 
Yugoslavia has fallen apart. 
  [Vranitzky] The statistics of European wars shows clearly 
that most wars arose as a result of threats in southern and East 
Europe. That is why European integration is so important: 
Europe must treat the task of achieving peace in a courageous 
and resolute manner, even if this venture will undoubtedly take 
years and decades and in some respects appears to be impossible 
today. However, utopias were on very many occasions the engine 
of development, not restrictions, limitations. 
  [Sommer] During the EU negotiations in Brussels, cooperation 
between Bonn and Vienna was very good. 
  [Vranitzky] Yes. 
  [Sommer] During our thousand-year-old relationship, we have 
experienced some happy periods and some unhappy ones. What will 
be the hallmarks of this new phase in Austrian-German relations? 
  [Sommer] I believe that the qualitative element in future 
politics will involve introducing historical and cultural 
relations into a common Europe in a way that will always make it 
possible to cultivate and develop other relations. 
  We have an existing historical and cultural relationship 
between Germany and Austria. However, the wisdom and art of 
politics, above all in view of the relationship, must involve 
developing new, promising relations.
