The great Dutch manager Rinus Michels once said that football was war. After
El Salvador and Honduras met in three controversial matches in 1969, the
tanks rolled in. But more often, countries play football as an alternative
to war.
It seems that many people all over the world see life as a permanent battle
for status between 200-odd nations.
But football is by far the most direct way of ranking.
Recently, I spent a year travelling the world to write a book* about
football and politics. In Argentina, I spoke to an army general named
Enciso, who recalled the night that Argentina won the World Cup in 1978:
'All the country was on the streets. Radicals embraced with Peronists,
Catholics with Protestants and with Jews, and all had only one flag: the
flag of Argentina]'
I asked if he could compare this to the Falklands War, when the crowds
filled the streets of Buenos Aires again. 'Exactly]' said Enciso. 'It was
exactly the same]' So much so that the World Cup song, 'Vamos Argentina.
Vamos a Ganar' (Go on Argentina, Go and Win) was cranked out again during
the war. When Maradona's 'hand-of-God' goal put the English out of the 1986
World Cup, most Argentines felt the victory pretty much cancelled out defeat
in war.
Things may change when Croatia first play Yugoslavia, but the biggest grudge
match in Europe remains the Netherlands against Germany. When the Dutch beat
the Germans in Hamburg in 1988, 9m Dutchmen, or 60 per cent of the
population, took to the streets to celebrate. Although it was a Tuesday
night, it was the biggest public gathering since the liberation. A former
resistance fighter went on TV to say: 'It feels as though we've won the war
at last', and the Dutch poet Jules Deelder wrote of Marco van Basten's
winning goal: 'Those who fell rose cheering from their graves.'
On that night the decades seemed to fall away. The Germans still wore eagles
on their chests; the Dutch players were the resistance, and the Germans the
Wehrmacht. These comparisons are absurd, but they occurred to most Dutchmen.
Vrij Nederland, a magazine that began as an underground news-sheet during
the German occupation, interviewed the Dutch full-back Berry van Aerle: 'In
the match against Germany, you pulled the injured Voller's hair.' (The Dutch
have a particular dislike for the German striker Rudi Voller.) 'Did I pull
his hair? I can't remember that. I patted him on the head. I didn't pull his
hair.'
'No?'
'No. I patted him on the head and he got angry. I don't know why either. He
reacted quite strangely; he suddenly jumped up to chase after me, but when
Ronald stopped him he fell again and started rolling about. I thought that
was strange behaviour.'
Both the journalist and Van Aerle knew what really happened, but a
resistance fighter never discusses his heroics. He hints at them, using
irony.
As well as Wehrmacht against resistance, Hamburg was also a reversal of the
invasion: an orange-clad Dutch army numbering tens of thousands drove its
cars into Germany and defeated the inhabitants. (In the era of regular
England-Scotland games, the Scots would conquer London for the day.) People
in the Netherlands sang: 'In 1940 they came. In 1988 we came, Holadiay,
Holadio.'
The Ukrainians remember a similar game during the German occupation. Outside
the Dynamo Stadium in Kiev, there is a statue that depicts four men, all
10ft tall, who stand arm in arm gazing into the distance. They are wearing
shorts so you know that they are a monument to a football match.
The Germans arranged a match against Dynamo Kiev. The spectators were all
German soldiers with machine-guns, and when the Ukrainians took the lead the
soldiers began to fire at their legs.
Though several players went down, Dynamo hung on to win. After the final
whistle the whole team was executed. It was, in short, Escape to Victory
with an unhappy end. A famous Soviet film was made of the match, and the
actor who played the goalkeeper looked so much the part that a club offered
him a contract.
Sadly, the story is a myth concocted after the war by the local Communist
Party. No doubt some kind of game did take place, for one survivor still
lives in Kiev, but sensibly he remains silent.
The Germans really began to get over the war in 1954. That year, West
Germany was re-admitted to the World Cup, and won it. Friederich Christian
Delius, a pastor's son and author of the autobiographical novel, The Sunday
I won the World Cup, says: 'The time of defeat was past; from now on victory
was the aim.'
Many of the players had fought in the war or been taken prisoner. as Delius
writes: 'Never again would a German team be so representative of the
nation.'
As the journalist Brian Glanville has noted, the former England manager
Bobby Robson was obsessed with the world wars. But this did not give him an
overriding desire to beat the Germans (even though England fans like to
sing, 'Two world wars and one world cup, doo-dah, doo-dah]' at German
supporters).
Rather, the first and second world wars shaped the way Robson picked his
players. He told Pete Davies, author of All Played Out, about his captain
Bryan Robson: 'You could put him in any trench and know he'd be the first
over the top . . . he wouldn't think, well, Christ, if I put my head up
there it might get shot off. He'd say: 'C'mon, over the top.'' Robson may
have had in mind the first world war officers who would start a 'push' by
kicking a football out of the trench and chasing after it.
Robson is typical of British managers. People talking about football tend to
draw their metaphors from one of two fields: art or war.
Brazilian football has 'the rhythm of samba', and the British have 'fighting
spirit'. British managers almost always compare football to war, and the
players they favour are like soldiers: fearless, hardworking men who never
question their superiors. As Robson said, when he was reluctant to play the
prodigy Paul Gascoigne: 'You have to be utterly reliable.' Soldiers are
reliable, artists are not.
I realised just how much war can seem like football when I met another, more
senior, Argentine general, whom I shall call Sanchez. We were sitting in the
building of the Supreme Council of the Argentine Armed Forces, the highest
military organ in Argentina, and the setting was comic-book South America.
The building is shrouded by palm trees, guarded by soldiers with
machine-guns and moustaches.
Sanchez is a tall, thin man with a military moustache (no surprises there)
who looks like Enoch Powell. He had primed himself for our meeting: he was
carrying two files, one containing his incidental writings on football, and
the other his book on football tactics. Written in 1951, it had never been
published, and what he had in the file was the original, yellowed, typed
manuscript. He was nervous: he had walked around with his ideas in these
dusty files for 40 years, and here was someone who wanted to know. It was
why he had overcome his instinctive fear of the media to speak to me.
'If my team is concentrated on this small piece of paper,' Sanchez
gesticulated, 'and the opposition is spread out over that big file, then I
will have superior numbers in the crucial areas. You must have a force that
is compact, organised, and moving forward.'
I suggested that his ideas on football rang somewhat military. 'No, it's not
military,' he snapped, before adding: 'The principles of war can be applied
to anything.'
I suspected that he had done things the other way around: that he had
applied his footballing theories to military strategy, rather than vice
versa. It was chilling to listen to: old men all over the world expound
half-baked coaching manual wisdoms, but here was one who might use them on
the battlefield.
Football against the Enemy, by Simon Kuper, Orion, Pounds 9.99, is the 1994
William Hill sports book of the year.
