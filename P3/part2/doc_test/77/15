A REMARKABLE experiment is taking place in Kyrgyzstan, the poorest of the
former Soviet republics. It has introduced a new currency with strong
support from the west. On its success depends the future of the state
itself, the viability of new currencies in the post-Soviet world and the
reputation of the multilateral financial institutions.
Kyrgyzstan is a small, landlocked state on the Chinese border. It has an
ethnically divided population - the Kyrgyz are a bare majority with a 25 per
cent Russian-speaking minority which dominates production and forms the
majority in the capital Bishkek.
The industrial sector of Kyrgyzstan is like that of all ex-Soviet states,
but more so. The Frunze agricultural machinery plant made one type of
machinery for the former Soviet trading bloc which is no longer in demand
and for which it usually cannot get steel anyway. A sugar refinery got its
raw material from Cuba, hauled across central Asia from the Black Sea. Both
have all but stopped production.
This is a grim position in which to find oneself 'independent' - especially
since its years as a Soviet state have left what Kyrgyzstan's foremost
economist, Mr Turar Koichuyev, calls a 'psychology of dependence'.
But in introducing the som ('catfish' in Russian) in place of the rouble, it
blazes a trail for the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States - only one of which, Ukraine, has introduced its own currency, and
that without an accompanying programme approved by the International
Monetary Fund.
The effects of the introduction of the som have so far been both
dramatically good and disturbingly bad. Its first trading session took place
on Monday in the street outside the National Bank, where some Dollars 2m was
exchanged for som issued the week before.
It held its introductory rate of 4 to the dollar, while on the black market
the official rate of Rbs150 to a som doubled to around Rbs300. A government
decree that, after a five-day transition period, the rouble may no longer be
used seems to have been obeyed.
But it has caused an inflamed reaction in neighbouring Uzbekistan. The
border between the two states has been closed, money transfers and trading
of any kind stopped and gas supplies shut off. Uzbek President Islam
Karimov, no friend of the pro-western leaders of Kyrgyzstan, accused the
Kyrgyz of plotting to flood his republic with unwanted roubles. His action
threatens to strain further the bad relations between the Kyrgyz and the
ethnic Uzbeks who live in the border areas of Kyrgyzstan.
The currency's introduction was badly executed and badly advertised; the
result has been that only Rbs7bn to Rbs10bn of the estimated stock of
Rbs30bn in the country were exchanged for som in the five days. Residents of
Bishkek grumble about the bright new currency - accusing the government of
raising prices under its cover, and fearing that the government had given
them an unconvertible currency.
The som is a test case in two ways. First, it poses a colossal challenge to
the leadership of Kyrgyzstan: a leadership which, under the presidency of Mr
Askar Akayev and the premiership of Mr Tursumbek Chyngyshev, attempts to
chart a pro-market course.
Mr Chyngyshev says: 'We believe we had no choice but to introduce the som:
it allows us to escape from the inflation of the rouble and to create our
own economy.'
The chance is there, but the task is difficult.
The second test is of the IMF and, to a lesser extent, the other
multilateral financial agencies. The IMF, some six months ago, switched its
policy advice dramatically: having previously advised the former Soviet
states to stay in the rouble zone, it concluded - after observing the
actions of the central bank of Russia in supporting enterprises with a flood
of credit - that the only way ex-Soviet states could fight inflation was to
control their own currencies.
Says Mr Harry Trines, the resident man from the IMF: 'It became clear that
in the present circumstances no one could reduce inflation while remaining
tied to the rouble. And thus the IMF executive board decided that if the
(ex-Soviet) countries wanted their own programmes with the IMF they must
have their own currency.'
This decision. meant that the IMF, and through it the richer countries of
the world who provide aid to the former Soviet Union, were implicitly
offering to support the new currencies if the state could commit itself to
an IMF programme with its familiar features of monetary stability, budget
stringency and rapid privatisation.
Kyrgyzstan, uniquely - outside the Baltic states which are not part of the
CIS - has done so, earlier this month signing on to a tough programme and
receiving Dollars 23m as a first tranche of an Dollars 85m package of
support. These funds form the reserves with which the National Bank has
supported the currency.
In all, Kyrgyzstan should receive Dollars 400m in loans, including a Rbs75bn
(about Dollars 100m) from Russia which is promised but the delivery of which
must be in some doubt. The World Bank and the Japanese government are to put
in about Dollars 110m in budget support - in the form of goods which will be
sold in Kyrgyzstan.
For the foreign experts now in Bishkek, the future seems clear enough: a
programme (barely begun) which pushes enterprises into the private sector -
though there are signs that the state favours worker-ownership, with which
the Fund would be unhappy. It will also trade on its few assets - wool;
fruit and vegetables; hydro-electric power; natural beauty; minerals
including gold; and a relatively well-educated population.
A final asset is the harsh realism of people and leaders alike. Says Mr
Chyngyshev: 'We have things we can sell, but they are not yet of world
quality. We haven't got the equipment or the experience, and we lack the
money to buy the equipment. It's going to be very hard - it's inevitable.'
