Bill Bryden's latest epic extravaganza, The Big Picnic, concerns a bunch of
Scotsmen fighting in the First World War. It has several visual wow effects,
of which the main one is that the audience moves (part of it is moved on a
vast galley lined with seats) from the 'Glasgow' end of the huge Harland &amp;
Wolff Engine Shed (in Govan, Glasgow), to the 'trench' area in the middle
(real trenches dug amid six or more feet of surrounding earth and mud), and
so into the final waste land of the battlefield itself, pitted and baked.
And it is accompanied by music of several kinds.
There are no great surprises for those of us who have heard even a little
about the Great War. We are taken through the horror of innocent young men
being killed or transformed by warfare; and we see famous events such as
Germans and British exchanging cigarettes and playing football on Christmas
Day, and also the Angel of Mons. Some of these incidents are presented
sharply enough to prompt me and other audience members to laughter or tears.
But elsewhere to yawns. For The Big Picnic keeps us in the Shed for almost
four hours. And it is woefully underscripted. (Bryden himself is author and
director.) It is astounding how often ordinary sentences or phrases are
repeated to no good purpose. 'That was the devil's work,' says Hughie
Frizell ponderously, 'the devil's work, 'cos it was murder, murder.' 'You
always know,' says Norrie Beaton lugubriously, 'you always know.' Pause.
'You always know.' Thin, thin. Thin. Also slow, slow. Slow. And heavily
amplified, so that voices usually emanate from nowhere near the actors and a
heavy echo follows every utterance.
The next problem is John Tams's music. I do not care to hear scenes of death
and battle in the Great War accompanied by sub-Elton John songs, and I think
blasts of electric guitar and drumming are a cheap way to suggest gunfire.
There is some visual excitement in the way this muzak is played, high above
the action, by a group of musicians and singers on a galley which also moves
from end to end of the action. The vocalists sing mainly slow folksy numbers
in folksy style (ie flat), but the worst element is the percussion, which
adds an appalling monotony to everything it joins.
Much better are the songs, dances and music played and performed by the
performers. In general, the performances are fine, and would be much better
if encouraged to move at twice the speed. Jimmy Logan is Colours, who turns
this bunch of volunteers into soldiers; Iain MacColl is the dour Gus Adams,
who becomes the toughest fighter of them all; Stuart Bowman plays the
half-reluctant young warrior Russell Enoch; Derek Riddell is the more
mercurial Norrie Beaton. Morag Hood and Juliet Cadzow lead the female
contingent in a variety of roles.
Oh, yes, the Angel of Mons. After Angels in America I have grown so used to
seeing angels that I feel like Joan of Arc. This one, however, is the worst
to date. With deep red hair, she hangs, usually upside down, from the
musicians' gallery - a cumbersome sensational effect trundled out for the
same symbolic effect time and time again. Her most spectacular effect is to
pick up a corpse and to bear him in her arms, as she hangs in the air, until
she passes out of sight. You just watch and pray she never drops the poor
blighter.
Show me a group of bright young Scotsmen going to their deaths, show me them
sharing cigarettes with the enemy on Christmas Day, and I blink back tears
as fast as the next person. Travel me from the Glasgow Docks to the uneven
terrain of the battlefields and trenches and I too am astounded. (William
Dudley's design is altogether the evening's highlight.) But there is an
awkward mix of sentimentality and sensationalism about all this. We watch
these young Scotsmen face the prospect of their possible deaths - and then,
ghoulishly, we zoom along to see, from ringside seats, whether they indeed
live or die. Meanwhile drums and cymbals thwack out a 4/4 beat in the air
above our heads.
At the Harland &amp; Wolff Engine Shed, Govan, Glasgow, until October 30.
