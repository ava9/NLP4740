THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: SAMPLING WINE PUBS OF STRASBOURG CAN BE AN ENLIGHTENING

STRASBOURG, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd miscalculated how long it would take me to drive from Paris east to 
Strasbourg. 
</P>
<P>
It's only about 300 miles, but on the way I stopped to taste champagne in 
Reims. By the time I reached Strasbourg, negotiated the narrow, one-way streets 
and found my hotel, it was already after 10 p.m. At that hour in most places in 
France, you need good luck to find anything to eat other than a soggy croque 
monsieur. It could have been very grim. 
</P>
<P>
Armed only with the address of a winstub (wine pub) near the cathedral, I 
hurried down empty cobblestone streets flanked with tall, half-timbered houses 
so old that their steep-pitched roofs had leaned into each other through the 
years. A glow of light that glimpsed through checked curtains told me I'd found 
S'Burjersteuewel. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what the sign says, though most everyone calls it Chez Yvonne. 
When I opened the door, voices filtered out from behind a red velvet curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling it aside, we stepped into a brightly lit room filled with what seemed 
like all of Strasbourg -- talking, laughing, eating and drinking. Waiters 
sailed by with platters of sausages and sauerkraut, and filled pitcher after 
pitcher with local white wine. 
</P>
<P>
It was a little startling, like suddenly walking on stage from the darkened 
wings, but YvonneHaller took us firmly in hand and found us a place at one of 
the crowded tables. 
</P>
<P>
We were wedged between an elegant older woman who was lustily digging into a 
pig's knuckle, and a young couple attacking an overflowing plate of choucroute 
garnished with sausages, smoked pork and bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Haller was back soon, surveying her domain through white harlequin 
glasses. She delivered us some Gruyere salad in a mustardy vinaigrette, slabs 
of onion tart, boiled tongue with a puckery sauce and warm potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, she brought a sugar-dusted apple tart, plus a slice of tarte au 
fromage blanc, a subtly sweetened cheesecake with raspberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
For good company and inexpensive, delicious fare, Strasbourg's winstubs can't 
be beat. Clustered in the narrow streets around the gothic sandstone cathedral, 
they date to the last century, when producers from wine villages south of 
Strasbourg opened winstubs as a way to introduce their wines to city folk. 
</P>
<P>
One winstub tradition is the stammtisch, a large table reserved for regulars 
who sit down and eat together every day. If you're only a party of two, they'll 
simply tuck you in with other people at a big table. And it turns out to be 
fun. It's also a great way to decide what to order. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Jenny, who owns the Strasbourg winstub Le Clou, describes the winstub 
as the melting pot of Alsatian life, since workers, businessmen, artists, 
students and society people all gather to mingle and eat. 
</P>
<P>
Le Clou is really the Elaine's of Strasbourg. The kitchen is open until 1 in 
the morning, thus it's a favorite haunt of show business, theater and music 
people who come for the company and the good food. 
</P>
<P>
You can order steak tartare or perfectly grilled lamb chops, but her backenoffe 
-- the slow-simmered stew of veal, pork and beef, with pigs' feet and potatoes 
-- is one of the best in town. Also good bets: the choucroute cooked in 
Riesling and the wine maker's tourte, a savory meat and mushroom pie made at 
harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away at San Sepulchre, the proprietor greets you with a towel slung 
over his shoulder, squeezes you in at a table and then rushes off to the 
kitchen, where his 75-year-old mother mans the stoves. 
</P>
<P>
This cozy, rustic winstub looks as if time stopped when it opened in 1936. And 
the stammtisch, where a dozen old men meet every day before lunch, has been 
going just as long. Representatives from the European Council rub elbows with 
stout matrons and young girls on a shopping spree, and the postman stopping in 
for a nip. 
</P>
<P>
Monsieur Lauch dashes back and forth, joking with customers while he carves a 
ham on the bone -- which is exactly what to order here. Cooked very slowly in 
bread dough, it is pale, moist and delicious, an entirely superlative ham 
served with mustard, cornichons and horseradish. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of Le Pont Couvert, the medieval covered bridge in the section of 
old Strasbourg known as La Petite France, is an informal bierstub (which also 
serves wine) called L'Ami Schutz, where you can feast on traditional Alsatian 
fare while Judy Kael sings Edith Piaf songs. 
</P>
<P>
Specialties include l'esiigbroda, beef marinated and cooked in vinegar and 
served with spatzle noodles; saupfeffer, pork marinated in peppers, and coq au 
Riesling, chicken cooked in Riesling. In the fall there are all sorts of game 
from the Vosges Mountains; the chef's father is a hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Along the wine road that runs from Marlenheim, just a few miles west of 
Strasbourg, between the Vosges and the Ill River south to Thann, there are 
several country-stryle winstubs. 
</P>
<P>
Wistub du Sommelier (wistub is the local spelling of winstub) in Bergheim 
features sophisticated home cooking and a list of wines to rival a two- or 
three-star restaurant. Owner Jean-Marie Stoeckel is a former best sommelier of 
France who offers half a dozen wines by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Get set for foie gras in an old Gewurztraminer, a superlative choucroute garni, 
cinnamon-scented boudin noir with pickled turnips and house-smoked pork. Or an 
autumn salad of bitter greens, apples, mushrooms, duck gizzards and grapes. 
He'll also sell wine from his list to take out for a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Zum Pfifferhuss in nearby Ribeauville is a favorite with local chefs and wine 
makers. It's very informal, usually packed with people, and features dishes 
such as choucroute salad with poultry gizzards, smoked pork filet in a pastry 
crust, and blood sausage with apples. You can also taste a range of eaux de vie 
(brandy) from the master distiller Jean-Paul Mette, whose artisanal distillery 
is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Winstub Arnold in Itterswiller is covered with cascades of red and pink 
geraniums. Tuck in your napkin and dig into slabs of their own goose foie gras 
served with warm toast (pain de mie) in a quilted box; salade Alsacienne 
(grated Gruyere with onion, cervelas sausage and head cheese in a mustardy 
vinaigrette); thick noisettes of venison with wild mushrooms and squiggly 
spaetzle noodles, or wild boar cooked in a blood-thickened red wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Bouquets of wildflowers grace the table. Vino 1756 Veritas is carved on the 
massive beam over the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Life is sweet in Alsace.
