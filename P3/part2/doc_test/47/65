The Soviet Union's three-year-old orbiting space station Mir will be evacuated 
at the end of this month and mothballed, Soviet authorities disclosed Tuesday 
amid indications that the Kremlin is sharply scaling back its ambitious space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Mission control has ordered the three cosmonauts aboard Mir to begin shutting 
down and putting into protective wrappings the station's scientific, flight and 
control systems, according to the official Tass news agency. In addition, the 
scheduled April 19 launch of a three-man replacement crew has been canceled. 
Space officials were saying as recently as a month ago that the mission would 
proceed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"New tasks will be found for the Mir," Radio Moscow said late Tuesday, implying 
in its announcement that the space station will remain unmanned for some time, 
although it was designed and placed in orbit as the centerpiece of the Soviet 
manned space program. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to enlarge Mir with two new modules -- one small factory for growing 
crystals in conditions of zero gravity and the other adding more scientific 
equipment to the space laboratory -- have also been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
These actions, so far not officially explained, may reflect the Kremlin's 
determination to reduce its huge budget deficit, estimated at $160 billion this 
year, as well as a rising popular demand that the space program be cut so that 
more money and resources can be allocated to meeting consumer needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tackling more problems in the Soviet Union, but it is equally true that 
we are not used to counting our expenses," a science commentator in the 
government newspaper Izvestia wrote recently. "There is actually no system yet 
that would enable a quick transfer of space achievements to our economy on a 
commercial basis." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. space experts, the Soviet Union spends more than $30 billion 
a year on its combined military-civilian space program. 
</P>
<P>
During parliamentary elections last month, the once-prestigious Soviet space 
program ranked close to the government's bloated bureaucracy and its massive 
military spending as the most frequent targets for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying we should abandon space research -- just stretch it out," said 
Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist who won 89% of the vote in Moscow for a 
seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies. Explaining what he felt could be 
cut to improve the availability of consumer goods, he added, "Mars, Venus, the 
stars will be there 10 years from (now), just as they are today." 
</P>
<P>
Another critical element, however, may be the failure of two Soviet probes 
launched toward Mars last July with the goal of landing on the Martian moon 
Phobos. The first was lost in October due to a ground controller's error, and 
radio contact was lost with the second in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Those setbacks have brought into the open a serious debate among Soviet 
scientists over the course the space program should take, and the Soviet press 
has suddenly been filled with critiques of the program from half a dozen points 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
"Some time is needed to assess the results of the Mir program, to measure them 
against our goals and decide how to proceed, and we do not need to keep men in 
space for that," one well-informed Soviet official commented. "But there 
already is agreement that we do not need to keep Mir manned all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The manned space program has been strongly criticized within the Soviet Academy 
of Sciences as expensive and less and less useful scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
But manned missions have also had strong supporters, not only in the scientific 
community but also in the Soviet military.
