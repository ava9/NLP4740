The House on Friday passed a $44-billion, three-year spending authorization 
bill for NASA that includes President Bush's proposal to place a settlement on 
the moon and to begin work on a manned expedition to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration bill includes no money for 
the moon and Mars programs in the next fiscal year but would spend $444 million 
on them in fiscal 1992 and $649 million in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The bill won approval on a voice vote after a brief debate. It goes to a 
conference committee to work out differences with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides a three-year spending authorization to enable NASA to make 
longer-range plans, including space shuttle missions, space exploration and 
development of expendable launch vehicles and an experimental high-speed 
aerospace plane. 
</P>
<P>
The House passed a multiyear authorization last year, but the Senate never took 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed last year that NASA establish a permanent settlement on the moon 
and begin a 30-year project to send a manned expedition to Mars by the year 
2019. The bill authorizes the Bush Administration's request for the start of 
the project.
