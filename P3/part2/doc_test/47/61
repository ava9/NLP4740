Regarding "Selling Mars," by Kathryn Phillips (June 25): Louis Friedman's 
response to the argument that the moon, not Mars, should be the next goal of 
our manned space program -- that the moon "bores the public" -- points out the 
inherent risk of his focusing solely on a trip to Mars. What's to keep the same 
public boredom from settling over a Mars mission? Witness the Apollo era: 
Despite the fact that it included some of the most dramatic moments in the 
history of mankind, it faded to an obscure close after the initial goal -- 
traveling to the moon -- had been met and the public's attention moved on to 
other things.

Were it not for the space race, Apollo could have been structured as a series 
of challenges that linked together to form an ongoing plan for the future. Each 
element could have left behind an infrastructure of launch vehicles, orbital 
platforms, industrial facilities and scientific outposts that could remain 
useful and continue to grow once the symbolic "goal" had been met. 
</P>
<P>
We shouldn't repeat the same mistake. Let's go to Mars, but let's make sure we 
leave something behind for when we return.
