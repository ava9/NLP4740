ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodriguez asks us not to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Christopher 
Columbus' great adventure, which he prefers to call "genocide." 
</P>
<P>
Forget for the moment that Spain's attitude towards the indigenous peoples of 
America was no different than it was toward non-Christians at home, and in the 
same year that Columbus sailed into the unknown the Jews were driven out of 
Spain, forced to leave all of their property behind them, and that the horrors 
of the Inquisition were in full control of the lives of the people of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
No, Mr. Rodriguez, we are not going to celebrate genocide, but rather the 
accomplishment of one rather courageous individual, whose adventure still 
stands as the greatest voyage of mankind, including Neil Armstrong's walk on 
the moon. In truth, a parallel would have Armstrong pleading with the President 
-- over a period of eight years -- for use of a castoff spaceship and the 
company of a few criminals and debtors to go with him on a voyage that he would 
plan and carry out alone. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus' serendipity -- a new world instead of China and Japan -- brought 
lesser men after him, and when he punished a few Spanish gentlemen for 
murdering Indians he was himself removed from power and returned to Spain in 
chains.
