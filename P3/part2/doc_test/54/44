Director Steven Spielberg gave him a run for his money, but singer-moon-walker 
Michael Jackson came out on top for the second straight year in Forbes 
magazine's list of the highest-paid entertainers. Jackson's estimated gross 
income for 1989 is $65 million, giving him a two-year total of $125 million. 
Spielberg's 1989 total is expected to be about $64 million, for a 1988-89 total 
of $105 million. The list counts as entertainers a range of personalities that 
includes such fields as sports and cartooning. In third place is comedian Bill 
Cosby with a $95-million total. The rest of the two-year Top 10 are: boxer Mike 
Tyson, with $71 million; "Peanuts" cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, $60 million; 
actor-comedian Eddie Murphy, $57 million; Pink Floyd, $56 million; the Rolling 
Stones, $55 million; talk show host Oprah Winfrey, $55 million, and singer 
George Michael, $47 million. Others on the list, which goes to No. 40, include 
"Garfield" cartoonist Jim Davis, No. 30 at $25 million, and actor Mel Gibson, 
No. 40 at $20 million.

 -- Speaking of moonwalks and money, Soviet Parliament member Boris N. Yeltsin 
said on a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston that the United States or 
the Soviet Union should drop its space program. Yeltsin told center director 
Aaron Cohen that the two countries should join forces to explore the moon and 
Mars. "We're spending more money on space exploration because we are 
competing," Yeltsin said. The maverick Soviet politician has said the Soviets 
should reduce their space spending and spend more on their economy, and he said 
a joint space program would improve superpower relations. "I don't care who 
gets to the moon sooner. Whether it's the Soviet Union or the U.S. doesn't 
matter to me," Yeltsin said. "Sometimes I wish one of you would come over and 
whisper in my ear which of the space programs we could easily get rid of."

 -- Spy novelist John Le Carre is one of the latest beneficiaries of the more 
open policies in the Soviet Union. His latest best-seller, "The Russia House," 
will be published next year in that country, Tass reported. The contract signed 
at the Moscow International Book Fair calls for 100,000 copies to be printed in 
the Russian language.
