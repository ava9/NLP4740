  [Abstract] Until recently, trajectory designs have involved 
a single-stage, one-impulse flight to halo orbit near libration 
points L[.sup]1[/] and L[.sub]2[/] of the Sun-Earth 
system. Launch parameters were chosen so that after boost near 
Earth, the spacecraft would enter a trajectory passing rather 
close to the libration points, with halo orbit C = 0. Farquhar 
has proposed a design that reduces the orbit-size parameters 
("Halo-Orbit and Lunar Swing-by Missions of the 1990's," 41st 
Congress of the IAF, October 1990, Germany) and that recommends 
a rendezvous with the Moon not immediately after launch, but 
after a given number of revolutions in a highly elliptical orbit 
whose perigee is near the Earth and whose apogee distance is 
greater than the radius of the lunar orbit. There is yet to be 
any published data, however, on the possible use of such a 
trajectory to perform the Relict-2 mission in the context of the 
constraints on the control system that is to be used in the 
mission. Analysis shows that a design with two revolutions in 
intermediate orbit is best for trajectories involving a lunar 
swing-by. The researchers here analyze the control 
characteristics for only the segment before lunar rendezvous. 
Their analysis considers launch errors, as well as measurement 
and correction-execution errors. Fuel expenditure at the 
velocity typical for performing control during entry into halo 
orbit is the principal criterion for quality of control. Control 
parameters are calculated for flight trajectories based on 
launches in October and November 1994. Figures 4, references 5:
