We had a leaflet raid in the Palais Garnier on Friday night. From the little
gallery that runs round the inner dome of the ceiling papers fluttered down
just before curtain rise. A protest, of course, and one part of a campaign
by the Opera's unions to protect jobs at a time when Garnier's palace closes
for refurbishment (the ballet goes to the Opera Bastille next season) and a
new administration is foreshadowed.
The rights and wrongs of the matter are not for me to rehearse here, but one
phrase in the leaflet made me feel immediately sympathetic to the cause:
'substantial savings can be made by forward planning on productions, and by
not yielding to so many of the caprices of producers and designers.' These
words, decorated with audience bravos, should be inscribed in every opera
house. Why yet another re-designed and politically galvanised Ring cycle, or
another tarted-up ballet classic, or someone-else having his go at Swan Lake
or Figaro? Opera houses plead poverty and screech for funds. Let them
concentrate their cash on new work, new artists, and spare us the desperate
cosmetic exercises that cloud and minimise the established repertory with
radical decoration and wrong-headed recensions.
The Opera Ballet is ending this season with two triple bills under the title
Twentieth Century Classics. And if for 'classics' you read 'enduring
repertory items', then the title is a good one. What the programmes
demonstrate yet again is the superlative quality of the Opera Ballet as a
performing ensemble, stunningly well-trained, bursting with talent.
The first bill concentrates, not without wit, on the company as an assembly
of virtuosos. Harald Lander's Etudes has been a celebrated show-piece for
dancers since he made it in Copenhagen in 1948. It hymns the disciplines and
rewards of academic training, and with the Opera's dancers it is a thrilling
display of French style in its present and most exultant form. You watch the
girls working at the barre, and notice the clarity and sensitivity of their
feet, the taut outlines of each step. You see the boys beating and turning
with unfailing ease. And, as the heart of the affair, on come Agnes Letestu
and Jose Martinez (both making debuts, though their authority was absolute)
and Nicholas le Riche, tossing off prodigies of movement. They are three
young angels. They look proud, happy, commandingly good. Radiant security in
effects; unforced charm; elegance of means: these qualities mark the work of
the principals and also the dancing of the least member of the cast. And,
because Opera schooling is strong, unified, coherent, the whole affair has
the gloss given by finest craftsmanship. It is exactly this assurance that
Derek Deane, in his recent comments upon failings in dance training here,
wants our dancers to find.
The closing In the middle, somewhat elevated looks like an abrasive response
to Etudes. William Forsythe's choreography is a kick in the slats of
academic dance. The brutish Thom Willems score is matched by ferocious
energy in the choreography, disjointed, deconstructed, disassembled, and
perversely lit so that you think you can see, but actually can't - which is
Forsythe's neatest trick.
On any other company it looks as if the Forsythian bull has done his worst
in the daintiest of balletic china-shops. The Opera cast is so strong, and
so stylish, that the mayhem has an odd fascination: there are the wonderful
Manuel Legris and Lionel Delanoe, Nathalie Rique and Nathalie Aubin,
polishing every jagged shard of movement as if it were of worth. They are
superb. The piece is a con-trick.
Separating these two displays of bravura - Hyperion to a satyr - was Jerome
Robbins' In the Night. Henri Barda playing Chopin nocturnes with grace;
three couples; emotion ranging from serene to stormy; the Opera's stars at
their most effulgent in feeling and technique. And, because it is the
women's ballet, Monique Loudieres, Carole Arbo, Isabelle Guerin floating on
the music, or transfixed by it, with exquisite sensitivity. Kitsch at
moments, but marvellous all the time.
The second programme was rather more solemn in mood. I do not think that
Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas has a chance at the Opera. The location is too vast
for a ballet first given on a stage 18 ft. square; the lighting on Friday,
when I saw the performance, was sepulchral; the garden looked as if the
Douanier Rousseau had a hand in planting it; interpretations had no chance
to show those subtleties - of glance, of under-the-skin tension - which are
the fabric of Tudor's dances. Monique Loudieres and Manuel Legris are ideal
for the roles of Caroline and her lover: their readings were swamped.
About Paul Taylor's Speaking in Tongues which followed, I comment with
reluctance. This study in ecstatic religion in the American Middle-West,
with its fundamentalist hysteria, is the only Taylor work that I do not
enjoy. I find it over-long, inexact. Its Opera performance - led by Kader
Belarbi, as a darkly powerful preacher - was fine. And I still do not
understand it.
In the closing Song of the Earth, the dancers gave performances of beautiful
and proper simplicity. MacMillan's contemplation of death and renewal needs
no applied solemnities, and a strong musical account (the Lamoureux
orchestra with Catherine Keen and Ian Caley, under Jonathan Darlington)
inspired no less uncompromising dancing. In Isabelle Guerin, the role of the
Woman finds a most eloquent interpreter - dignified, selfless. She tells
everything of the woman's grief, her isolation, and she pours out
MacMillan's dances in a grand stream of movement - the sequence of pas de
bourrees at the end of the last song exquisite in shape and feeling. Laurent
Hilaire was the Man, Wilfried Romoli the Messenger: both readings were, like
Guerin's, admirable, truthful.
The Tudor/Taylor/MacMillan triple bill can be see at the Opera Garnier on
June 23, 24, 25, 27, 28.
