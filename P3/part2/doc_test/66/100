Some centenaries work. Lully's tercentenary came in 1987: in Paris the
echoes have not died down but rather increased. From being a respected name
in books and useful provider of warmers-up for song recitals, he is climbing
up the classical charts. At the Champs-Elysees, the beautiful theatre now
one of the city's auxiliary opera houses, a spectacular staging of his
Alceste brilliantly inaugurates a series of annual Lully revivals, backed up
by concert performances of relevant works (Gluck's Alceste included),
lectures, exhibitions, sumptuously illustrated handbooks about 'tragedie
lyrique'. At the Opera-Comique they are reviving the Arts Florissants
production of Atys which won much praise in the tercentenary year.
No half-measures or cheese-paring over Alceste. Producer Jean-Louis
Martinoty has surrounded himself with a team of talents - Hans Schavernoch
(sets), Daniel Ogier (costumes), Jacques Benyeta (lighting). The
choreography, essential feature of an opera written by an expert dancer for
a society mad about dancing, is by Marie-Genevieve Masse and Francois
Raffinot. The Compagnie Barocco provides the dancers. Someone recently
described Lully as 'the Diaghilev of his time, but a Diaghilev who could
compose like Stravinsky and dance like Nijinsky'. That is not all: he
coached, conducted and produced. Only Wagner rivalled him, and he didn't
dance.
Preparations for the first Alceste in 1674 were shared between Versailles
and Paris, the heavy transport expenses for scenery and machines paid by the
passionately interested Louis XIV, who attended rehearsals when he could.
Because of court mourning the premiere took place not at Versailles but in
Paris in the Palais Royal, the public theatre where Lully's operas were
shown sooner or later to enthusiastic audiences ready to go again and again.
Since Lully had a monopoly, there were no alternative choices.
Alceste was the second of the 'tragedies lyriques' Lully wrote with Philippe
Quinault, whose exceptional gifts as a librettist are now recognised again.
There are many differences from the version of the story used by Gluck.
Alceste is betrothed but not yet married to Admete. Alcide (Hercules) plays
an important role: he loves Alceste devotedly. Having retrieved her from the
underworld after she has sacrificed herself to save Admete (wounded in
battle), he nobly gives her up to the man she loves. Lycomede, King of
Skyros, is also in love with her.
Comedy mingles freely with the serious matter. Alcide and Lycomede have
confidants, Lychas and Straton, both in hot pursuit of Alceste's confidante
Cephise, whose view of morality is in complete contrast - she welcomes both
young men and would like more. One famous episode is the rough and ready but
not unfriendly treatment by Caron (Charon) of the dead souls clamouring to
cross the Styx in his bark.
It is the great achievement of this staging that the producer, aided by
Quinault and Lully's dramaturgical and musical skills, has ensured that the
darker moments - Alceste and Admete grieving for his approaching death, the
long scene of public mourning for Alceste, and most of all the sacrifice of
Alcide, stand out strongly from the comedy and the mass of spectacle and
movement. An art-form long regarded as dauntingly old-fashioned and
overcomplicated is now, with each major revival of Lully or Rameau, being
revealed as full of life, relevance, entertainment value and, given the
means, eminently stageworthy.
Schavernoch's designs boldly and imaginatively blend French Baroque with
modern styles. There are machines galore - gods and goddesses descend from
the skies on puffy silver clouds, fat little Cupids fly about, huge blown-up
photographs of formal gardens or seascapes are viewed through tall windows
with giant Venetian blinds with revolving slats polished like mirrors. There
is a stunning effect when they reflect a floor-cloth painted like a baroque
ceiling. Costumes are Baroque theatre traditional, worn in the French way
with pride and unselfconsciousness.
As the heroine, Colette Alliot-Lugaz gives yet another enchanting
performance. She uses more, and more convincing, period gesture than anyone
else. Howard Crook sings Admete with his usual poise. No-one could make the
character seem worth so much sacrifice. Jean-Philippe Lafont asked
indulgence for a bad throat, but his Alcide is a noble, commanding, moving
figure. He is one of the lucky ones who can dominate a stage while keeping
still. Francois Loup mops and mows as the oily Lycomede. The comedy roles
are in the expert hands of Sophie Marin-Degor (Cephise), Gilles Ragon
(Lychas), Jean-Francois Gardeil (Straton), Gregory Reinhart (Caron), Michel
Gens (Pheres). In the big mourning scene the voice of Veronique Gens rings
out finely.
One stumbling block of tragedie lyrique has always appeared to be the
recitative for which Lully studied in detail the declamation of leading
players of spoken theatre. Now we have a generation of singers who can
perform these scenes clearly and naturally. And because so many of
Quinault's lines are simple, direct and even witty, these same recitatives,
weaving in and out of short, expressive 'airs', become a positive pleasure.
Spectacle is indeed an essential part of French serious opera, but the words
remain paramount. In Lully's day the libretto was published in advance,
studied, and taken to the theatre.
The Grande Ecurie et La Chambre du Roy (orchestra, authentic instruments)
and the lively Ensemble Vocal Sagittarius (chorus), were under the direction
of Jean-Claude Malgoire, who firmly outlined the shape and varying moods of
the score even if one missed the greater rhythmic buoyancy and keener
textures of other ensembles of this kind. The opera is given, so far as I
could tell, virtually uncut.
Dresden and Vienna contributed painted cloths, British firms supplied
engineering and lighting technology. The list of technical personnel is as
long as their handling is efficient. Paris programmes are less specific than
ours about financial support. I gather sponsorship came from the Conseil
Superieur du Mecenat Culturel and the Caisse des depots et consignation.
Alceste is a co-production with Montpellier.
