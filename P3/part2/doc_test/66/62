If central casting was asked to rustle up an actor to play the role of a
contemporary architect, no self-respecting movie mogul could complain if the
chosen candidate looked like Jean Nouvel.
Nouvel does, after all, have all the requisite accessories. He is invariably
dressed in black, with close-cropped hair and a nice line in techno-toys,
like the deep sea diver-style watch wrapped around his wrist. At 47, he has
already made his name in architectural circles through his uncompromisingly
modernist designs, such as the Arab cultural centre in Paris, now marked by
an exhibition of his work at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.
But his biggest and, possibly, his best building has yet to come. Early next
year the builders will arrive at a plot of land beside the futuristic Grande
Arche at the La Defense business district in western Paris, to start work on
Nouvel's La Tour Sans Fins, the Tower of Infinity.
This is the building that seems set to propel Jean Nouvel into the tiny band
of contemporary architects, such as Richard Rogers and I M Pei, whose names
are known beyond the cloistered world of architecture. It should also place
him in the forefront of the new wave of modernists redefining architectural
thinking in the 1990s.
La Tour Sans Fins, at 1,400ft (425m), will be the tallest tower in Paris,
easily dwarfing the Eiffel Tower's 984ft. It will be built in glass - black
at the bottom, but gradually becoming paler until it is completely clear at
the top. 'It's one of the projects where I've been given most freedom,' says
Nouvel. 'It's an office block, a serious building, and the design reflects
that, but it's also fun. I want people to enjoy it.'
The sci-fi style and scale of La Tour Sans Fins seem set to cause as much
controversy as other modern Paris monuments, notably the Pompidou arts
centre, the building that brought Rogers into the limelight, and Pei's
glacial glass pyramid in the Louvre museum. Nouvel sees his tower as 'a
metaphysical object' and an exercise in 'urban poetry'. One of the judges of
the architectural competition that chose it was more prosaic. He described
Nouvel's design as 'a pure object of capitalism'.
If Nouvel cares about such quips, he is far too shrewd to show it. La Tour
Sans Fins is typical of his style. It is a witty building, which twists the
traditional tenets of 1920s modernism - the geometric lines and emphasis on
function - into new forms for today. 'I'm a true modernist, a man of my
time,' he says. 'The role of the architect is to reflect the age they live
in.'
Jean Nouvel looks like his buildings, thoroughly modern and larger than
life. He is a big, burly man with a diabolic face, who punctuates his
conversation with rumbustious chuckles. He works from a rambling open-plan
studio in an old warehouse in the dowdy 11th arrondissement of Paris. He
moved there a few years ago when he outgrew his old studio on Rue Beaubourg
opposite the Pompidou centre. The Beaubourg studio is now his home. 'It's
pretty basic,' he says. 'I spend 12 or 14 hours a day designing buildings,
so I don't want to do that in my spare time. Lots of architects dream about
building their own homes. Not me.'
He was born, the son of teachers, at Fumel in the Lot valley in southern
France. He ended his education at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux Arts in
Paris where he began by studying painting, but soon switched to
architecture. 'At the time I didn't have any money, so architecture seemed
like a better bet,' he recalls. 'I always planned to go back to painting but
after two years of architecture I was hooked.'
Nouvel quickly became a notorious figure in French architectural circles,
initially because of the unusual vehemence of his attacks on other people's
work. His vitriolic views, coupled with a penchant for publicity (he
recently featured in a Swiss Air advertising campaign), have saddled him
with a reputation for megalomania.
He was one of the most vociferous opponents of the Forum des Halles
development in Paris during the late 1970s, when the old fruit and vegetable
market was pulled down to make way for a shopping centre - 'the
indescribable architectural catastrophe'. He then emerged as a critic of
post-modernism, the trend for reinterpreting historical images that
dominated in the 1980s, producing buildings such as Robert Venturi's
National Gallery extension in London.
But he has been equally critical of the bastions of early modernism such as
Le Corbusier - 'he was a genius, but he also wrote some really stupid
things' - and of contemporary architects who continue to copy them. 'I don't
want to perpetuate the legacy of the architecture of another age,' he says.
'Just because something was modern 50 years ago doesn't make it modern
today.'
The architects he does admire - Alvar Aalto, the Finnish modernist who
emerged in the 1920s, Tado Ando, the grand old man of contemporary Japanese
architecture, and Richard Rogers - all share his passion for reinterpreting
modernist principles in his own way. 'They all have their own idiosyncratic
styles,' he says. 'A building by Rogers just couldn't have been designed by
anyone else.'
Nouvel made his mark in the 1980s through the grands projets, the
architectural schemes initiated by President Francois Mitterrand to
celebrate the 1989 bicentennial of the French Revolution and to raise
awareness of modern architecture.
The grands projets, such as the Louvre pyramid and the new finance ministry,
were accompanied by a reform of public sector building in France, which
included introducing architectural competitions and encouraging local
authorities to launch their own petits projets. Nouvel was lucky. He came to
maturity as an architect at a time when an unprecedented number of major
buildings were being commissioned in France, and there were relatively few
French architects with enough experience to handle them.
But luck was not enough. The architects for the grands projets were chosen
by international competitions. Being in the right place (and of the right
nationality) at the right time probably helped Nouvel to get on to the
shortlists, but after that he was on his own. He lost the competitions for
the finance ministry and national library, but won the commission for
L'Institut du Monde Arabe, the Arab centre on the banks of the river Seine
in Paris.
The FFr500m (Pounds 61m) Arab centre combines all his favourite themes. It
is a futuristic building made in modern materials, steel and glass. Nouvel
broke it down into sections so that it looks different from each angle. He
also indulged his love of technology in the computerised blinds, designed in
traditional Arab patterns, which regulate the flow of light through the
windows.
The result is a building which is superficially stunning and becomes
increasingly complex the closer you look. 'It's not enough just to make
something that looks amazing, or to show how clever you can be with
technology,' he says. 'The building must work as a whole.'
L'Institut du Monde Arabe established Jean Nouvel in the international arena
and garnered the Grand Prix d'Architecture, France's most prestigious
architectural prize usually given for a lifetime's work. He now faces the
challenge of developing his ideas in his new projects - the Opera house in
Lyons, a factory for Cartier in Switzerland and La Tour Sans Fins.
'It's easy to get complacent and to become mediocre by doing the same thing
again and again,' he says. 'You have to know exactly what you want and how
to get there. But I'm lucky. I'm an optimist. I always look for the positive
side in everything.'
