Dam, an artist in control of his destiny

WHEN THE Salzburg Easter Festival opens tonight, one of the few surviving
links with its past will be Jose van Dam, who sings the title role in Luca
Ronconi's new production of Verdi's Falstaff. For nearly 20 years, van Dam
was the favourite bass-baritone of the festival's founder, Herbert von
Karajan. That did not stop him turning down invitations from Karajan to take
on roles he considered unsuitable. Nor has it prevented van Dam finding
favour with Karajan's successors.
Sir Georg Solti, who conducts Falstaff and has been the Easter Festival's
artistic director since 1990, chose him for last year's recording of Die
Frau ohne Schatten - even though van Dam did not want to sing the role of
Barak in the festival stage production. His Belgian compatriot Gerard
Mortier, the new broom at the Summer Festival, engaged him at the Monnaie in
Brussels throughout the 1980s, and built last year's Salzburg production of
Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise around him.
Now 52, van Dam is at the summit of his career. After more than 30 years in
the profession, his smooth, well-coloured voice is still in perfect
condition. He is equally at ease in the lyric bass roles of Massenet, Gounod
and Verdi, as in heldenbariton parts like the Dutchman and Hans Sachs. He is
a master at marrying text to music so that it makes sense. Despite his
modest physical stature, he is a commanding presence on stage, because of
the conviction he brings to each role. Van Dam is what the French call un
homme de bon sens - he has his feet on the ground in a profession where it
is easy to get carried away.
The clearest evidence of this is the astute control he has exercised over
his vocal development: he has never sung a role which was beyond his means.
He attributes this partly to instinct, partly to the influence of his
teacher, the late Frederic Anspach, and also to his own understanding of
voice and technique. 'A teacher can only give you so much. When you're on
stage, you're alone. You yourself have to know what you can and can't do,
and that means knowing your own voice. Many people will say 'You must sing
this role', but only you can judge if it's possible. You have to have that
confidence and knowledge.'
Van Dam made his professional debut at the Paris Opera aged 20. The next 12
years were spent as an ensemble member in Paris, Geneva and Berlin's
Deutsche Oper. He sang Masetto before moving on to Leporello in Don
Giovanni, tried out Paolo and Fiesco before tackling the title role in Simon
Boccanegra, observed experienced Germans singing Sachs from the vantage
point of Kothner. For his debuts at the Met, La Scala and Covent Garden
(under Solti) in the early 1970s, he sang Escamillo. To other French roles
like Golaud he brings a native speaker's understanding of what he calls
'this typically French line of song'. He has kept clear of 'belting' roles
like Telramund and Luna, and is only now debating whether to sing Wotan. He
is more suited to thoughtful, philosophical parts than buffo - though his
Figaro was always beautifully sung. His next new role is Scarpia, but he
talks of retiring from the stage and devoting himself to recitals and
teaching.
That leaves little hope for British admirers, who will have to be satisfied
with a single Wigmore Hall recital next year. His last appearance at Covent
Garden was in 1986. Why the long absence? Van Dam pins the blame on the
previous Royal Opera management of Sir John Tooley. After two visits as
Escamillo, he was asked back to sing the same role. 'I said if I was offered
another contract alongside Escamillo, I would come. But they didn't offer
anything. It was quite a few years before I was invited back for Wozzeck and
Salome. Now my diary is full till 1996. It's a pity - I always had good
experiences there. The people know how to work, and my wife and I like
London.'
Which makes a stark contrast to the Bastille in Paris, where van Dam says
the acoustic is poor and the atmosphere dreadful. 'It's so badly managed -
they have three or four chiefs running round at the same time, to no
purpose. Chung (the Bastille's young Korean music director) is too
inexperienced to have responsibility for such a huge operation. How can he
know which singers are suitable for each role?
'They've spent all that money on a building which doesn't even resemble a
theatre - it's more like a tube station. The Met in New York may be big, but
at least the acoustic is good. The problem with the Met is that the work is
uninteresting. All through my career I've said that wherever I go there must
be some bait - either artistic or financial. At the Met you have neither.
They're more concerned with show than music. It's the same at the Bastille:
the priority is to fill seats.
'Of course, if I was well paid, I admit I would go for the money. But when
the rewards are so small, the best thing is to stay away.'
Van Dam's professional satisfaction comes increasingly from recording rarely
performed French operas and from song recitals. He learns the text and music
separately - reciting the words like a poem, whistling the vocal line -
before bringing them together. Adjusting to the disciplines and repertoire
of the recital hall has not been easy, 'but you don't make this sort of
career in order to live simply. My belief is that if you're an artist, you
have to deny yourself the easy path. It's part and parcel with being an
artist. If you only take the easy path, you never move forwards, you don't
give art the chance to develop. If there's no struggle, there's little point
doing it.'
