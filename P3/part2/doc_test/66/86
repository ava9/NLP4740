It was Diaghilev who brought Picasso to the ballet stage, as he did so many
more of the best painters of his time. No dance company today can boast such
acumen. Only in France - with the visual wit and adventurousness of Roland
Petit's troupes, and the proud record of Jean-Albert Cartier in finding
artists to decorate works for his companies - has there been a readiness to
let the painter's eye (rather than the designer's) show us something about
ballet. The tried, the true, the predictably winsome and the sullenly
grungey, make our dance-stages a dreary sight.
How good, then, to see such performances as the Paris Opera Ballet's current
Picasso et la danse, in which the eye is ravished, stimulated. Picasso made
three great designs for Diaghilev (Parade, Le Tricorne, Pulcinella), married
one of Diaghilev's dancers, and drew dancers for many years. His later
involvement with ballet amounted to the provision of decorative accessories,
beginning in 1924 with the two racing women who thunder across the painting
La Course, which Diaghilev borrowed as a front-cloth for Le Train bleu, and
including Picasso's suggestion that one of his war-time paintings (Candle
and Mask) would serve well as a front-cloth for Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous
of 1945.
The Opera Ballet's Picasso tribute has been revived after its successful
showing last season. It offers a reconstruction of Le Train bleu, with
Nijinska's dances evoked as much as restored; a very fine staging of Le
Rendezvous; and the sun-lit Andalucia of Tricorne. Le Train bleu, alas,
stopped running years ago, and this capriccio about gaiety on a 1920s plage
(it must be Eden Roc) is vivaciously dull. The central role of Le beau gosse
was, in 1924, a picture of the beauty and physical daring of Anton Dolin.
No-one today can capture the verve Dolin retained in even his late
performances as a dancer. Without such central allure the staging is
dutiful, spectral, unlikely.
Yet Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous, which is quite as much a period-piece with
its war's-end melancholy and existential disillusion, is tremendously alive.
A Young Man finds death in the arms of the Most Beautiful Girl in the World,
guided to her by the terrifying figure of destiny (a macabre top-hatted
being, stupendously taken by Cyril Atanassoff). The setting is Brassai's
photographs of Paris streets. The dance is as theatrically urgent as when we
saw it in 1945, and last week-end's performers (Patrick Dupond as the Young
Man; Marie-Claude Pietragalla as the Girl; Atanassoff as Destiny) were
grandly alert to the choreography's dramatic pulse. It was an ideal revival.
Tricorne is the only Spanish ballet in my experience that is authentically a
ballet and authentically about Spain. It is well done at the Opera, and
rather more alert in manner than last year. The designs and the de Falla
score do a lot of the work nowadays - there is a tendency for companies to
treat the piece as a glorious dress parade to a great score - but in Kader
Belarbi the role of the Miller has a bold interpreter. He has both the youth
and the vivid presence to make every moment count. The programme contains a
photograph taken of the young Massine - he was 24 when he created the part -
which tells everything of the dance's taut outlines. Belarbi, like last
year's dazzling debutant in the role, Jose Martinez, gives it the right edge
of sexual pride and rhythmic clarity.
Throughout this programme the Opera's dancers were on best form. We have in
the Palais Garnier a dance-house for Europe, and in its resident company a
peerless troupe. Visiting the new Richelieu wing of the Grand Louvre - which
is a triumph of design and restoration - the Barnes Collection at the Musee
d'Orsay, and the Opera Bastille, I was struck again by the seriousness and
generosity of France's patronage of the arts, and depressed even more by the
mean-spirited inadequacies of our own national response.
Gremlins in the machinery removed a paragraph from my Nutcracker notice in
Friday's paper of the Perm Ballet's British debut in Northampton at the
Derngate Theatre. With apologies to any puzzled readers, and to the Perm
Ballet, the missing sentences are herewith restored.
'No less than six different stagings of The Nutcracker are threatened this
year: the first outbreak, and I'd venture the most intriguing, is that on
view at Northampton's Derngate Theatre. Derngate, lively in its programming,
had scheduled a production from the Lille-based Ballet du Nord. That fell
through, and with a nice turn of speed, the theatre engaged a Russian
troupe, the Perm Ballet, never seen here before, albeit known and admired
from European tours. Perm was Diaghilev's birthplace. More significantly,
the Kirov Ballet was evacuated there when Leningrad was threatened with
siege in 1941, and the Kirov's influence on the Perm troupe and school was
to be profound and lasting.
This first visit (until December 11 at the Derngate, Northampton) is
welcome, and I hope a prelude to a more extended showing in future. The
troupe - something after the size of Birmingham's Royal Ballet - is well
mannered in technique, with a style that speaks clearly of Kirov example.'
