FT  26 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nasa lost in space
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NASA scientists listening with increasing desperation for radio signals
from their Mars Observer spacecraft realise that much more is at stake than
the Dollars 1bn mission to study the red planet. Failure to make contact
with the silent probe would be a crushing blow to future missions to Mars,
which had been designed to use Observer for communications and/or for
spotting promising places to land on the planet's surface. More generally,
an Observer write-off, following a string of other technical and managerial
disasters, would raise the most fundamental questions about the US space
agency and the management of its Dollars 14bn-a-year budget.
Nasa's morale has never fully recovered from the 1986 Challenger disaster.
The manned shuttle programme is still plagued with technical problems.
Several scientific missions, including the Hubble space telescope, are
performing below par. And poor leadership has left Nasa's plans to build an
orbiting space station in disarray; Congress may yet kill the project.
One part of the agency is still running well, its public relations. But even
a PR machine that makes the most of every opportunity - for example,
trumpeting fuzzy pictures from the space telescope as breakthroughs in our
understanding of the universe - cannot disguise the fact that Nasa needs
radical reform.
The problem is that the gung-ho Nasa of the 1960s, geared up to beat the
Soviets to the moon and then the planets, has grown into an elaborate
bureaucracy. Its senior managers, including several astronauts from the
glory days, tend to be more interested in running multi-billion dollar
mega-projects than cost-effective scientific missions. The emphasis is on
technology rather than science.
Radical solutions
Given the reality of Washington politics, the most radical solutions are not
feasible. It might make sense, for example, to remove the space science
activities, such as observatories and planetary exploration, from Nasa and
fold them into the National Science Foundation. Nasa would then be
responsible for manned activities - the shuttle and science station - and
for promoting space technology. But the agency has too many defenders, in
congress and the aerospace industry, who would fight to prevent anything
that looked like a break-up.
So the overhaul has to take place within Nasa's current boundaries. The
first requirement is to make sure that space exploration is really led by
science rather than the internal agenda of Nasa managers. That means giving
scientists outside the agency, particularly from universities, more say in
its programmes. The practical result is likely to be a larger number of
smaller, more flexible - and more imaginative - missions than Nasa is
planning today.
International plans
Secondly, Nasa must change its mentality more quickly from a national space
agency to a partner in international programmes. Progress is being made.
This summer a three-way collaborative project was announced: a gamma-ray
observatory called Integral that will carry a US instrument on a European
satellite, to be launched by a Russian rocket in 2001. It is the first
mission designed from the start to involve Nasa, western Europe and Russia.
More would be welcome.
The European Space Agency's science programme, known as Horizon 2000, is
indeed looking increasingly attractive to some Americans as a model for
Nasa. Although a dozen European nations are involved, Horizon 2000 is less
bureaucratic than Nasa's big-is-best space science programme, and it is more
open to outside participation. Another great advantage is that Esa projects,
once approved, have far more stability of funding than similar Nasa
missions, which suffer frequently in Washington's annual budget battles.
If Observer remains lost in space, the lesson will not be to give up
missions to Mars but to stop putting Dollars 1bn into a single
interplanetary basket. Indeed the likely scientific dividends would justify
sending an international fleet of spacecraft to observe all the planets in
our solar system. But they need not be grandiose Nasa-style craft.
