JACK SMITH: WHEN BIG-CITY NAMES HIT CLOSE TO HOME

If an alien from Neptune's moon Triton were visiting in New York City, and 
someone happened to ask him "Where are you from?" as someone inevitably would, 
he would probably say he was from Neptune, rather than Triton. 
</P>
<P>
He would assume that everyone had heard of Neptune, whereas Triton might not be 
as well-known, and he would probably have to explain that it was just a little 
moon in orbit around Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
This is a device most of us use when we're traveling, not so much to pretend 
that we are from a place of importance, but to avoid having to explain the 
exact location of our home, in relation to someplace larger. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if you happen to be from Sausalito, and you're talking to a stranger in a 
bar in Paris, there's no use saying you're from Sausalito, and having to 
explain where that is; best just to say you're from San Francisco, to avoid 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
While traveling I have heard many variations on this dodge. Someone will say 
"Where you folks from?" And the person asked will say, "Los Angeles." And the 
stranger will say, "Oh? Where in Los Angeles?" And the visitor is obliged to 
say, "Well, actually, we live in Covina. That's a suburb of Los Angeles." 
Whereupon his interrogator puts him down as an impostor. 
</P>
<P>
How this innocent subterfuge can be carried to ultimately comic and 
embarrassing lengths is shown in a letter from Robert Taylor of Tustin (in the 
Anaheim area). 
</P>
<P>
Taylor recalls that in 1956 he was flying from New York to Los Angeles and he 
asked the man sitting next to him, in the lounge, whether he was going home or 
was traveling on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Home," the man answered, and volunteered that he lived "in the L.A. area." 
</P>
<P>
"So do I," Taylor said. "In San Gabriel. Where do you live?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well," the man said, "I really live in Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor allowed that he was familiar with Bakersfield, having stopped there many 
times on trips to Fresno, Madera, Yosemite or Sequoia National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the man said, he didn't actually live in Bakersfield. "I really stay in 
Buttonwillow, where my son has a place." 
</P>
<P>
Now Buttonwillow, while home to many folks, is not an internationally known 
place name. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor was familiar with it: "A little bitty place out of Bakersfield, 
maybe 20 miles west on the old road to San Luis." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," the man said, "I really work in the oil fields in Weed Patch. 
That's about halfway to Arvin from Highway 99. No one has ever heard of Weed 
Patch so I tell them I'm from the L.A. area." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he was also familiar with Weed Patch. His brother had helped bring 
in the first oil well there. Evidently, his traveling companion had exhausted 
his lines of retreat. He stayed with Weed Patch. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived for some years in Bakersfield, I have always known where Weed 
Patch was, and if I were traveling in London or Cairo or Athens and some 
American told me he was from Weed Patch, I'd say, "Weed Patch, hey -- I know it 
well. Up there just southeast of Bakersfield, isn't it ?" The "up there" would 
refer, of course, to its relationship to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Weed Patch is not the absolutely most rustic name in the Bakersfield 
area. The man could have been from Pumpkin Center. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife and I were first married we lived in Oildale, north of the Kern 
River from Bakersfield. Now Oildale is not a name that is recognized throughout 
the world as a population and cultural center. So when we traveled, which was 
rarely, and never any farther than San Francisco, we always said we were from 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud to say that, out of a sense of modesty or honesty or loyalty to 
Bakersfield, we never said we were from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There is one exception to this harmless attempt to upgrade one's place of 
residence. I have never met anyone from Orange County who pretended to live in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Why should they? Anaheim is so well-known throughout the civilized world as the 
home of Disneyland and the Rams and the Angels, that to say, "I'm from 
Anaheim," is enough to identify one's place of origin, whether one is from 
Tustin, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Yorba Linda or El Toro.
