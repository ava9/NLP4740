Are you more likely to die in an aircraft crash or in a cataclysmic
collision between the earth and an object from space?
Amazingly, the two risks are similar - about 1 in 20,000 for an average
American - according to the latest astronomical calculations.
Although aircraft crashes kill hundreds of people a year and there is no
authenticated record of anyone on earth ever being hit by a heavenly body,
once every million years or so a collision with a comet or asteroid does
enough damage to wipe out a large fraction of the world's population. Over
the long term, therefore, the statistical hazard from cosmic catastrophes is
comparable to that from familiar natural and man-made disasters.
Astronomers expect to view a similar impact in mid-July - from a safe
distance of several hundred million miles - when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hits
the giant planet Jupiter with an explosive force equivalent to millions of
atomic bombs. Unfortunately they will not be able to see the collision
directly from earth because it will be on the far side of the planet, but
flashes will be reflected off Jupiter's moons and disturbances should be
visible in the Jovian atmosphere for weeks.
Scientists believe that similar collisions between the earth and comets or
asteroids - lumps of ice and rock a few kilometres wide - were responsible
for the mass extinctions that punctuate the palaeontological record. The
most celebrated instance killed off the dinosaurs 65m years ago, according
to a theory which is now generally accepted. Ironically, a cosmic collision
on that scale brings global catastrophe by ice rather than by fire. Although
the explosion which occurs on impact devastates thousands of square
kilometres, its secondary effects are more lethal. Billions of tonnes of
dust are thrown into the atmosphere, plunging the whole globe into a sunless
'impact winter' for many months. Few plants and animals escape death by
freezing or starvation.
Earth's fast-changing geology quickly heals scars left by cosmic impacts.
Even so, scientists have identified traces of 140 craters left by giant
meteorites, including the one that sealed the fate of the dinosaurs, which
stretches 180km across Mexico's Yucatan peninsular. Anyone wanting to see
the unhealed face of such bombardment need only look at the moon.
A detailed hazard assessment by two leading American space scientists, Clark
Chapman and David Morrison, published earlier this year in Nature, the
science journal, concluded that an impact with global repercussions is
likely every 100,000 years or so. There is one collision devastating enough
to kill at least a quarter of the human population (1.3bn people) every
500,000 to 1m years - and to wipe almost everyone out every 50m years.
The biggest extraterrestrial object to reach earth this century was an
asteroid, probably about 30 metres wide, which exploded in the air over the
Tunguska River region of Siberia in 1908, flattening hundreds of square
miles of uninhabited forest. Smaller meteorites have damaged buildings and
cars - in 1992, for example, a 12kg rock ruined a Chevrolet in New York
state - but fortunately not people. Others have reportedly come close to
setting off a nuclear alert by misleading American and/or Russian military
commanders into thinking an enemy missile was attacking.
But we may now be living through a relatively quiet period in the cosmic
bombardment of earth. Some astronomers believe large meteorites come in
cycles, rather like the streams of small meteors that cause periodic showers
of shooting stars. According to one theory, earth passes through the debris
of a huge comet every 3,000 years or so, producing more frequent
Tunguska-sized impacts; this would have occurred most recently in the Dark
Ages (about 500 AD).
'There is a lot of information buried in ancient annals about destruction by
fire from the heavens,' says Mark Bailey, an asteroid specialist at
Liverpool John Moores University. 'Until recently, scientists dismissed
these stories as figments of someone's imagination, but perhaps the
historical record is telling us about something that really happened.'
For example, Mr Bailey says, the account by Nenius in his 5th-century
chronicle of St Germanus, in which the fortress of the heathen king Vortigan
was suddenly destroyed by fire from heaven, sounds like a large meteorite.
Over the past decade, as cosmic collisions have moved from science fiction
to respectable research, astronomers have begun to realise that we are not
necessarily powerless to prevent a cataclysm. In principle, 21st-century
space and military technology could be used to detect a threatening asteroid
or comet in time to deflect or destroy it before it hit Earth - just as
Arthur C Clarke described in his recent book, The Hammer of God.
As a first step, scientists working for Nasa, the US space agency, have
proposed a 25-year Spaceguard survey. It would use powerful telescopes to
map all 1,000 or so large 'Earth-crossing' asteroids that could cause a
global catastrophe, at a total cost of just Dollars 300m. It would give a
warning time of several decades before an asteroid collision.
Comets, which have much longer and more elliptical orbits than asteroids,
present more of a problem. Even for the most elusive comet, however,
Spaceguard would give a few months' warning of impending disaster.
Most astronomers support the Spaceguard proposal. More controversial - and
far more expensive - is the idea of setting up a meteorite deflecting system
to keep on stand-by, just in case we find a comet or asteroid heading our
way. Some enthusiastic veterans of former US president Ronald Reagan's Star
Wars programme have taken up the idea as a way of developing nuclear and
laser technologies that can no longer be justified on defence grounds after
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But others, such as Carl Sagan of Cornell University, warn that using
nuclear explosions to deflect cosmic bodies could pose more of a threat than
the asteroids and comets themselves. They say such a system could easily be
misused to deflect a previously harmless asteroid towards earth. As
Professor Sagan puts it: 'There is no other way known in which a few nuclear
weapons could by themselves threaten global civilisation.'
So, for the time being, we must live with the knowledge that we are as
likely to die in a cosmic cataclysm as in an aircraft. For the nervous
flyer, that should be rather a reassuring thought.
