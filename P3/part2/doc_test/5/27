office, Clinton has seemed determined to prove government can make a

The rush to judgment is now a permanent sprint. Bill Clinton's presidency
was pronounced irrevocably dead - and alive - even before he assumed office,
in its first days and round the clock, on the half hour, ever since. This
has been more than usually evident this week, with 86 dead in the ashes of a
religious fanatic's fortress in Texas, a jobs bill killed by 43 obdurate
Republican senators and with a nation now conditioned to demand to know who
was at fault.
But a presidency - as well as the political and national contexts in which
it operates - is a permanent work in progress. Hindsight can always identify
watersheds - Jimmy Carter's 'malaise' speech in the summer of 1979 and
George Bush's approval of the 1990 budget act increasing taxes can now be
said to have definitively marked the beginning of the end of their
presidencies. But Mr Clinton's first 100 days, a mere one-fifteenth of his
first term and one-thirtieth of what he might serve, are only up next week.
Had he promised a rose garden, he would by now only have been able to
deliver a few buds.
But even these demonstrate the enormous gulf between Mr Clinton and his
predecessor, above all domestically. Mr Bush thought everything could be set
to rights by a balanced budget amendment, the line item veto and a
conservative Supreme Court, of which he had only the latter and then not
consistently. It is, on the other hand, hard to imagine a problem, no matter
how small, to which Mr Clinton could not come up with a programmed solution
and even a means, probably a tax, to pay for it. And he will get the chance
substantially to reshape the nation's highest court.
Government, in the Clinton doctrine, can make a difference. It may, as he
frequently says, have to 'get by on less', and its pockets, even in the
great cause of aiding Russian reform, may not be too deep. But this does not
invalidate its mission to lead by example and, where necessary, to
intervene.
Thus, the first 100 days have been phenomenally busy. The single great
achievement has been the passage by Congress of the broad outlines of the
plan to cut the budget deficit substantially over the next five years. The
truly hard parts - enacting specific tax increases and cutting spending
programme by programme - still lie ahead, but the fact remains that for the
first time since 1985 a president has proposed a budget that is not
automatically 'dead on arrival' on the steps of the Capitol. It is even
possible that Congress will improve on it and cut spending even more.
But this has not been all. Also at home, Mr Clinton, under his wife's
direction, has got stuck into the momentous issue of healthcare reform, with
serious proposals due perhaps next month. He struck down Republican
restrictions on abortion and in the labour market, obtained a family leave
bill, committed himself to ending the ban on homosexuals serving in the
military, instituted easier bank lending to small businesses, inserted the
government into technological research and development, set up a civilian
national service corps, mediated in the trees-versus-spotted owls dispute,
promised to sign the international bio-diversity treaty, and more besides.
He has run a thousand hares already and if few are radical in themselves the
collective impression is of a man determined to change the way the country
looks at itself and what it thinks it can do for itself. It is an agenda as
ambitious as the ideological Reagan revolution it is intended to reverse.
All it lacks is the single-minded focus of the first Reagan term, opposition
to which was made in any case almost impolite by the president's own brush
with an assassin's bullet.
There have been setbacks, the most telling of which was this week's defeat
of the jobs bill at the hands of a Congress run by Democrats. This was not
supposed to happen in the first flush of Clinton's presidency and so soon
after the great budget victory. The package may be dismissed as economically
insignificant - at Dollars 16bn it is one-tenth of the size of that just
proposed by Japan - but its demise in its proposed form serves as a potent
reminder to the new president that working on Congress is a full-time
occupation.
Successful presidents instil a mixture of fear and respect into Congress. So
far Mr Clinton has earned respect for his marketing abilities but has not
generated fear. He was unable to scare off the Republican filibuster, itself
a remarkable display of solidarity by a party in search of a role and
nervous of being blamed for yet more gridlock. Somehow the White House has
to learn to overcome its understandable dislike of Republicans such as
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a man with the voice of a dentist's drill and a
personality to match, and come to terms with the crafty minority leader,
Senator Bob Dole, so adept at making trouble if not courted or cowed. As a
very practical politician, Mr Clinton should know about compromise.
Not that the Democrats are necessarily much easier, especially the new,
independent-minded freshman class. Of the barons, Mr Clinton already has his
hands full with the resentful Sam Nunn of Georgia on the gay question. Even
George Mitchell, the faithful majority leader, Pat Moynihan, of the finance
committee, and Dan Rostenkowski, powerful chairman of the House ways and
means committee, have started muttering disapproval about value-added taxes
and investment credits.
Nor has he yet found cruising speed with another important Washington
institution with the power to wound - big media. The fact that he has held
only two formal presidential press conferences so far puzzles many because
Mr Clinton is so articulate when thinking on his feet, so much the
stimulating contrast to the men who went before him. Press relations with
George Stephanopoulos, the smart and influential communications director,
are frequently fractious, while lesser White House lights, schooled by last
year's electronically sophisticated election campaign, point out with scorn
that it is now technologically easier than ever to bypass the Washington
media establishment to get targeted messages across, which is exactly what
Mr Clinton does all the time.
Indeed Mr Clinton is still playing pretty well in the heartland through his
public speeches and other appearances, which repeatedly display his
extraordinary ability to explain the complex in comprehensible and sometimes
moving terms.
He is also making some serious friends at the state and local government
levels, not simply by loosening the federal purse strings but by actively
encouraging the sort of policy innovation that he feels appropriate for all
forms of government. This should be no surprise, given his record in
Arkansas and his recruitment to his cabinet of several members known for
their state, not federal, experience.
But going over the head of Washington, where much policy and even more
comment is minted, is risky, and in the capital his administration has
already been stretched painfully thin. At the last count he had nominated
barely a third of the approximately 3,500 senior political appointments in
his fief and many of these had still not been confirmed in office, a handful
because of the typically mischievous delaying tactics of Senator Jesse
Helms, the conservative curmudgeon.
But the real reason why this administration is barely formed is the
determination of the White House (not the cabinet secretaries themselves) to
follow the president's instructions and form a government that 'looks like
America' in its ethnic, gender and geographic diversity, all minus skeletons
such as illegal nannies in their closets.
The net result has been much resentment, some ridicule and, worse, the
occasional acute embarrassment. Whole departments, most obviously Justice,
have been mostly run by brand new cabinet officers assisted by Republican
hold-overs, unaccountable political advisers and career civil servants
without clout. This week's denouement in Waco found Janet Reno, the
attorney-general fresh out of Miami and in office for barely a month, very
short of institutional help, apart from a beleaguered FBI director assumed
to be on the way out. She was admired for immediately taking full
responsibility, Mr Clinton rather less so for waiting a day to say the buck
stopped on his desk.
From the outset it was clear that Mr Clinton, though comfortable in a
collegial environment, intended to take most of the big decisions himself.
He was involved, endlessly, in the nitty-gritty of the deficit reduction
plan, is becoming more immersed in healthcare and will take nobody's
recommendation on trust for the vacant Supreme Court nomination, especially
after two botched attempts to find an attorney-general. Cynics point out
that the last president to try and do everything himself was Jimmy Carter.
Foreign policy clearly interests Mr Clinton, as it does every president, and
his maiden voyage in it, to Vancouver with Boris Yeltsin, showed him at his
subtle best, artfully disguising that the Russian president was the
supplicant by apologising for submarine collisions and old but extant US
anti-Soviet trade laws. His speech before the summit, explaining why aid to
Russia was in the US vital interest, was among his most thoughtful.
But, mostly, the unwavering Clinton's external message is that US national
security in the post-cold war era must increasingly have a predominant
economic component, and his own involvement appears all the greater when
this element is to the fore - in developing US competitiveness, pursuing
more vigorous market-opening trade policies and assisting Russia. In
contrast to Mr Bush he appears to take no particular comfort in the company
of foreign statesmen, entertaining them either to businesslike lunches or,
in the case of Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, to a very
pointed lecture on the way the world had changed.
With the additional current exception of Bosnia, Mr Clinton has chosen to
leave most of the rest of routine foreign policy to his subordinates, under
Warren Christopher, the very capable secretary of state, while the domestic
agenda is being pursued. This neat division does not always work. The
Vancouver summit and its Tokyo follow-up also preoccupied Lloyd Bentsen, the
Treasury secretary, who knows more about twisting arms in Washington than
anyone. There was no one of equivalent clout left behind to lobby for the
jobs bill.
Mr Clinton seems perfectly comfortable in the presidency, relishing its
challenges, and the nation more accustomed to him in it, even if it still
harbours doubts about his character. The great question is whether this
one-man band (and his formidable wife) can keep it up, especially if the
domestic agenda, such as the budget and healthcare, gets shredded and if
foreign affairs refuse to be neatly compartmentalised offshore. It could all
end in tears, but for the moment, and for the next 100 days, too, there is
going to be more going on, for better and for worse, in America and its
capital than most other places, much of it because of Bill Clinton. That
would not have been predicted under George Bush.
