intelligence capacity 'crippled' in Baghdad strike

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that the weekend US missile strike on
Baghdad was intended as a warning, not only to Iraq but to all governments
which fostered terrorism.
Mr Clinton said he had been advised that Iraqi intelligence capacity in
Baghdad, target of the raid, had been crippled. The US claims that a plan to
assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait in April had been drawn
up in the Iraqi intelligence headquarters.
One side of the main 10-storey block has virtually collapsed and the
adjoining six-storey building had most of its roof blown away. But the
nearby communications tower was unscathed.
Foreign diplomats in Baghdad said yesterday there was deepening despair in
the population, who had hoped that Mr Clinton's arrival in the White House
might bring a change in US attitudes and an easing of sanctions.
They said the missile strike had come as a shock to most Iraqis, though some
retaliation had been expected by the Baghdad regime following allegations of
Iraqi complicity in the plot to kill Mr Bush. US reconnaissance aircraft had
been seen over the capital for the two days preceding the attack.
Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, in a television interview amplifying Mr
Clinton's warning, said any country contemplating a terrorist action against
the US 'now know that if they do that they're going to get a response'.
Apart from Iraq, US concerns are mostly directed at Iran and Sudan. Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, complained on Sunday that too many
US allies are 'doing too much trading' with Iran, thereby assisting the
build-up of its military capability, possibly including nuclear ambitions.
The Sudanese connection has been highlighted by last week's arrest in New
Jersey of an alleged terrorist cell numbering several Sudanese nationals and
linked to the outspoken cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, who arrived in the
US in 1991 from Khartoum.
The New York Times reported yesterday senior administration officials,
including Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, had intervened with the FBI
not to arrest the sheikh, partly on the grounds of questionable evidence
against him and partly because he was felt to be more useful at liberty as a
source of information on Islamic terrorism.
One official was quoted as saying that if it could be proved that Iran
and/or Sudan was behind the New Jersey group then the US response would be
put in the hands of the Pentagon.
Mr Clinton's decision to launch missiles against Iraq has continued to win
general approval, with one instant poll recording support of two-thirds of
the public.
In his brief comments promising that there would be an 'aggressive' response
to terrorism, the president also said he wanted 'to move on to other
matters,' specifically his domestic economic agenda and preparation for next
week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading economic nations.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was forced to defend the
government's support for the attack on Baghdad, insisting that it was a
'justified and proportionate' response. In an emergency statement to the
House of Commons, he came under fire from opposition MPs who declared that
the action should not have had the backing of the UK.
Spokesmen for both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties warned of its
damaging impact on the role of the United Nations.
Other MPs, including some Conservative backbenchers, voiced concern about
the effect of the attack on relations between western powers and the more
moderate Arab regimes.
