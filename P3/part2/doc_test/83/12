The president of Alcorn State University finally got the kind of R.S.V.P. that 
he wanted. Walter Washington has asked every U.S. President since Lyndon B. 
Johnson to speak at commencement at the primarily black college in Mississippi. 
President Bush is the first to accept. He will speak on Saturday. Alcorn State, 
which with 2,757 students is one of the smallest of Mississippi's eight public 
universities, is located in the rural hills of southwestern Mississippi, seven 
miles west of Lorman -- an unincorporated hamlet consisting of a post office, 
two service stations, a general store and a few houses. "Roots" author Alex 
Haley attended Alcorn. Bush also will travel Saturday to Mississippi State 
University in Starkville to give another graduation speech. The predominantly 
white school has about 12,000 students.

 -- One of the reigning stars of rock 'n' roll met with a reigning monarch. 
British singer Sting led a delegation in a session with Spain's King Juan 
Carlos I and Queen Sofia as part of his campaign to create a nature reserve in 
the Amazon River basin. The group, which includes Brazilian Indian chief Raoni 
and Sioux tribal leader Red Crow, is midway through a 14-nation tour. Sting 
told a Spanish television network that a nature reserve would be a first step 
to curb the destruction of the rain forest.

 -- Clara Hale, an 84-year-old New York City woman who cares for children born 
to drug addicts and AIDS patients, traveled halfway across the country to 
receive the 16th annual Truman Award for Public Service, named for former 
President Harry S. Truman. Independence, Mo., Mayor Barbara Potts, who 
presented the award on the steps of the Truman Library, noted that Hale "did 
not wait for a government program" to give babies a second chance. "God put us 
here with brains to think and do, and we're here to help one another," Hale 
said. Hale House was born in 1969 when Hale discovered a child in the arms of 
an addict on a New York street corner. Since then, she and her daughter, 
Lorraine E. Hale, have helped raise more than 600 infants in the nonprofit 
residential program, operating in a Harlem brownstone. Hale's efforts became 
widely known after then-President Ronald Reagan praised her as an example of 
volunteerism. SHIRLEY MARLOW
