  [Text] "A la guerre comme a la guerre," (in war as in war) 
Prime Minister Berov said one year ago, and until today he 
remains loyal to his slogan. 
  God and history could testify that the Professor was not the 
one who started the war. Unlike his predecessor, Lyuben Berov 
was also the target of the other institutions. However, a real 
war has been conducted in the last week only on one front -- the 
presidential front. 
  Bulgarian, and probably many non-Bulgarian, factors claim a 
part in the big game. 
  The reconnaissance view of the battlefield produces the 
following picture: On one side there is the cabinet, which 
relies on insecure and even conditional parliamentary support. 
On the other there is the figure of the supreme commander in 
chief -- a rather lonely figure, unless one also notes his 
advisers and controversial military office. Only conventional 
means are used -- the one gives interviews, the other responds 
through statements. Behind-the- scenes maneuvers are not 
revealed to the public at large. 
  The presidential salvo began with the conclusion that 
Berov's 
cabinet must go because it threatens civic peace. Despite his 
four by-passes the prime minister countered in a direct manner 
-- he accused Dr. Zhelev of violating his constitutional 
prerogatives and interfering in places he has no business. The 
Presidency did not react to this blow. It lowered its profile 
and apparently awaits support from outside. 
  The outcome of the games that are taking place, is 
unpredictable, especially when one realizes that one side is 
motivated by interest, the other -- by honor.
