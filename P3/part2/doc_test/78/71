<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev </F>
in Sofia on 20 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots: During the last few days a farce 
has developed in Bulgaria that poses a threat to the foundations 
of parliamentarianism. Guided by personal and party interests, 
many deputies have involved themselves in lobbying machinations 
and bargaining that are well on the way to finally destroying 
the people's trust in the institutions of state. I do not have 
the right to judge anyone, but I am convinced that democracy, 
apart from merely being a form of procedure, also means a sense 
of responsibility, which some people have forgotten. The 
deepening political crisis has led to a complete paralysis of 
state life. In my view, we can extract ourselves from this 
situation only with the determination of all the responsible 
political forces in the country. 
  This conviction led me to invite the chairmen of the 
parliamentary groups to a meeting. Yesterday and today I held 
talks with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov; with 
Stefan Savov, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Union 
of Democratic Forces [SDS]; with representatives of the NSD [New 
Alliance for Democracy] and the Independence parliamentary 
group, Georgi Kostov, Nikolay Vasilev, and Ivan Pushkarov; and 
with Aleksandur Tomov, chairman of the GOR [Civic Alliance for 
the Republic]. For reasons outside my control, no meetings took 
place with Nora Ananieva, parliamentary group leader for the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition, or with Ahmed 
Dogan, leader of the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] 
parliamentary group. 
  I will now propose to the nation what I proposed to the 
politicians: the reaching of an agreement between the 
parliamentary forces on early elections. The agreement should 
define the following: 
  First, the exact date of the elections. 
  Second, it should guarantee the passing of laws that will 
ensure the conclusion of the agreement on our foreign debt and 
create conditions for carrying through real reforms. 
  Third, the agreement should lead to the formation of a 
government that will enjoy the confidence of all the 
parliamentary forces, guarantee responsible government in the 
pre-election period, guarantee the fairness of the elections, 
and continue the reforms that have begun. 
  If such an agreement is concluded and such a government 
elected, I shall assume the obligation to entrust this 
government with the additional task of carrying out the 
functions of a caretaker government during the final two months 
preceding the elections. I hope that this will put an end to 
the dirty speculations concerning the role of a future caretaker 
cabinet and will enable us to emerge from the crisis, because 
what we are now putting at risk is not merely the instability of 
one government or another, of some parliament or other, but 
faith in parliamentarianism and democracy. 
  Dear compatriots, I want to believe that the parliamentary 
forces will find the courage, responsibility, and goodwill to 
conclude such an agreement on early elections, an agreement for 
preserving democracy and parliamentarianism. However, at the 
ballot box the decision lies with you.
