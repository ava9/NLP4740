  [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- Today parliament elected 
Kiril Tsochev deputy prime minister and minister of trade, by 
117 to 6 out of the 123 MP's in the 240-seat parliament present, 
accepting Valentin Karabashev's resignation submitted on April 
28. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) did not 
take part in the vote. According to the parliamentary rules of 
procedure, the proposed cabinet changes are considered accepted 
by a simple majority of 50 percent plus one of the voting MP's. 
"I will protect Bulgaria's interests," was the only thing Mr. 
Tsochev when he was sworn in. Mr. Tsochev, former chief 
executive of Electroimpex and president of the Bulgarian Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, now is the manager of a private 
consultancy firm. Interviewed by a private radio station a 
month ago, Mr. Tsochev said that though his business was good, 
he was ready to work in the executive branch. Kiril Tsochev's 
candidature was supported by the formerly Communist Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP). 
  "The cabinet's term in office is limited, its life is only 
two or three months, that is why I'm making just the minimum 
necessary changes," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said, presenting 
Mr. Tsochev's candidature. 
  Kiril Tsochev, a diplomaed engineer who later took a 
postgraduate course in foreign trade, was born in 1947. He 
speaks English and Russian. He worked as an electrical 
engineer, then as director of Energoproekt and Electroimpex, and 
as a commercial representative in Tokyo. Since April 1992 he is 
president of the Mikra private firm. He chairs the 
Bulgarian-Japanese Economic Committee. He is married and has 
two children. 
  The parliamentary group of the SDS, which has been 
boycotting 
the parliamentary sittings for some time now, today appeared in 
the plenary room to take part in the debate and the vote on the 
cabinet changes. Its floor leader Stefan Savov's motion for an 
open vote was defeated by the Socialist MP's and the MP's of the 
ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS). The 
incumbent cabinet was formed on the DPS mandate. Although they 
had the right to discuss the changes and ask the candidate 
questions, the MP's directly proceeded with the ballot. 
  "Mr. Tsochev will not be able to do anything in two or three 
months' time," ex-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade 
Valentin Karabashev said in the lobbies of parliament. He 
resigned because of the differences he had with Prime Minister 
Berov on the mass privatization policy. 
  The Socialists, who asked the prime minister for structural 
and personnel cabinet changes in order to give him their 
support, now appeared to believe that this sole change was 
enough. "Any changes are pointless, given that there will 
probably be early elections in autumn," BSP leader Zhan Videnov 
told a news briefing yesterday.
