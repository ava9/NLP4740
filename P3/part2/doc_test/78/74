<F P=106> [Commentary by Evgeni Gavrilov: "Cabinet Sets New Record in </F>
Governing"] 
  [Text] On 30 December Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and his 
ministers festively marked the first anniversary of their tenure 
at the head of the executive. This is noteworthy because no 
other government since 10 November 1989 could match this 
achievement. 
  Foe a whole year the government based itself on a "dynamic 
parliamentary majority." Indeed, this was the government's 
foundation. In the final analysis the cabinet's longevity was a 
result of Lyuben Berov's ability to balance interests, which at 
first glance seem to be contradictory. This is because the 
interests of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the Movement 
for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS] are rather different. This resulted in certain 
incomplete decisions that disturbed rather than furthered reform. 
  The cabinet, which survived four no-confidence votes, had 
succeeded in strengthening its positions only by the end of the 
year. It was then that its two major successes came -- the deal 
with the bank-creditors on remitting 50 percent of Bulgaria's 
foreign debt, and signing a provisional trade agreement with the 
European Union. Other governments also contributed to those 
successes, but it was Berov's government that reaped the rewards. 
  However, the successes were preceded by the three great 
failures of Berov's team -- privatization, land reform, and the 
budget. In his program speech, precisely one year ago, the 
prime minister announced that his team would be the government 
of privatization. The lack of privatization deals was replaced 
by actions that in the past belonged to the category of 
organized enterprises. In January the government adopted a 
decision to prepare a long-range privatization program by the 
end of May. The program has still not been carried out. In 
February a group of experts led by Emil Khursev, deputy chairman 
of the Bulgarian National Bank, submitted a proposal to the 
Council of Ministers on the participation of the banks in 
privatization. At a special meeting in March the government 
adopted a number of decisions related to accelerating 
privatization, but they remained only on paper. In May there was 
an inadequately considered proposal by Berov on accelerating 
mass privatization through promissory notes. Deputy Prime 
Minister Valentin Karabashev did not like the proposal. Two 
months later he proposed a draft mass privatization program 
through investment funds. This time Berov disagreed with the 
proposal. Finally, in August the Berov-Karabashev hybrid 
proposal was accepted. Prior to this it had been rejected by 
everyone, but, nevertheless, it was adopted without any debate 
at a government meeting. 
  In November the professor told REUTER that he was 
contemplating the establishment of a ministry of privatization. 
In December the government admitted that the greatest 
privatization deal -- the one with the "Balkan" Air Company -- 
had fallen through. Throughout this entire period the 
government four times dismissed the members of the Privatization 
Agency Supervisory Board, appointed on a quota of the government 
basis, but the Supreme Court restored their membership. 
  The words of the minister of agriculture that in 1993 land 
will be returned to its owners still hang in the air.
