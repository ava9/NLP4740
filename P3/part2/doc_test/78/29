  [Text] Sofia, May 10 (BTA) -- The main parliamentary 
forces today met to decide their positions on the planned 
cabinet changes. Government spokesman Raycho Raykov does not 
believe that the changes will be discussed this week. The prime 
minister has yet to confer with the main parliamentary forces 
supporting his government. There will be no drastic changes in 
the cabinet's policy, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev, speaking at a 
working lunch today with the ambassadors of the 12 European 
Union [EU] member countries and the three applicants for EU 
membership: Austria, Finland and Sweden. 
  The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) reiterated 
the stance on the government it took in early April. "The BSP 
wants, as much as possible, to see the creation of conditions 
for the country's stabilization, for overcoming the unfavourable 
tendencies in the economy, the social sphere and international 
monetary and financial relations," BSP deputy floor leader 
Krasimir Premyanov told a news conference. "There are still no 
reasons to revise our policy line," said Vladimir Topencharov, 
member of the party leadership. 
  According to Mr. Premyanov, the BSP has not yet received 
adequate guarantees that keeping Valentin Aleksandrov as 
minister of defence in the cabinet would ease tensions in the 
Bulgarian Army. Speaking to reporters today, Mr. Osman Oktay MP 
of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) 
described as a "satisfactory option" the prime minister's 
supervisory function with respect to the "power" ministries. In 
a telephone interview on Bulgarian national radio on Sunday [8 
May], Prime Minister Berov indicated that there will be no 
changes in the Ministry of Defence. 
  According to officially unconfirmed reports, incumbent 
Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov may be nominated for a 
deputy prime ministership. There are plans for three deputy 
prime ministers. One will be in charge of the financial and 
economic team of the government and of foreign debt matters, 
another deputy prime minister without portfolio will oversee the 
reform processes and especially the progress of land reform 
(Prime Minister Berov already nominated Associated Professor 
Rumen Gechev for this job), and a third one will deal with the 
social sector and no changes are expected on this count, 
government spokesman Raycho Raykov told reporters today, 
obviously referring to incumbent Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev. 
  The government may well resign en bloc if parliament does 
not 
pass the moved amendments to the Privatization Act and a 
Bankruptcy Act, Mr. Matinchev told foreign diplomats today, 
according to the government spokesman. This is not a 
government's whim or wish to dictate terms but conditions set by 
the international financial institutions, Mr. Raykov emphasized. 
  Approval of the cabinet changes will require an affirmative 
vote of more than half of the MP's present and voting. 
Interviewed on national radio this morning, the leader of the 
Alternative Social Liberal Party (affiliated to the New Union 
for Democracy, a parliamentary faction formed by expellees and 
defectors of the Union of Democratic Forces -- SDS) Nikolay 
Vasilev said that the union will not take part in the vote on 
the cabinet changes. The Rally for Democracy (another faction 
of SDS expellees and defectors) will most probably refuse to 
support the structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed by 
Prof. Berov, according to Rally deputy leader Ruslan Semerdzhiev. 
  DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said yesterday and today that 
when 
the changes are put to the vote, the government will get less 
support than in previous such votes. Personally, he believes 
that the government deserves one more chance. The DPS top 
leadership held a meeting today. Mr. Oktay told reporters that 
according to information which the movement has, the Chairman of 
the Committee of Tourism Prof. Emil Lozanov already has 
resigned. He also said that according to the DPS there are 
unclear questions concerning the future structure of the 
Committees of Tourism and Forestry. The government spokesman 
said that the stand on the Tourism and Forestry Committees has 
yet to be finalized. The structural changes matter more than 
the personnel ones, as far as the DPS is concerned, Mr. Oktay 
emphasized. 
  "The situation surrounding the government is getting more 
disturbing by the day," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov after a 
meeting of the Union's top leadership. In his words, there is 
already public awareness that the government is unfit to perform 
its functions and bear responsibility. "The obvious 
impossibility to achieve understanding on the cabinet changes, 
which delays their introduction before parliament, makes the 
picture in the country only gloomier," Mr. Dimitrov went on to 
say. He did not specify the actions which the Union is planning 
to take in the coming days when Prime Minister Berov is expected 
to table the cabinet changes. According to Mr. Dimitrov, on 
Wednesday [11 May] the majority will be forced to have a say on 
the union's draft resolution to censure the Government's 
economic and financial policy. The SDS will hold a national 
conference on Saturday and Sunday [14-15 May]. At it, the union 
may decide to boycott parliament.
