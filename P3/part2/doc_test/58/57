<F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov and Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin Will Be Doing His Job in Spain, Not Visiting the Doctor"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Russian president's first official 
visit to Spain will be brief, businesslike, and with a 
relatively small delegation -- the foreign minister and the 
minister of foreign economic relations. 
  Yeltsin's main tasks are to reinforce the political mutual 
understanding between our countries and to get economic 
cooperation moving. He will meet with King Juan Carlos and 
Premier Felipe Gonzalez and will sign the Treaty of Friendship 
and Cooperation that was initialed in Moscow back in April 1992. 
  But this relates to the political side of the visit; as for 
economic relations, these will boil down to the expression of 
good intentions. According to every indicator, the level of 
mutual trade -- which was not distinguished by any great 
achievements in any case -- simply collapsed last year. Russian 
exports were almost entirely made up of raw materials, and sales 
of machinery and equipment fell. At the same time, Russian 
imports from Spain -- with foodstuffs predominant -- almost 
doubled. Over the past year trade turnover between our 
countries has fallen 46 percent. 
  According to the Russian delegation members, Boris Yeltsin 
will not be raising the question of "unfreezing" the unused part 
of the $1.5-billion Spanish loan granted to the USSR in 1990. 
By early 1993 Moscow had not repaid its debt on the half of 
this sum that has already been "consumed." Moreover, the 
Spanish Government has no spare cash. So in practice Oleg 
Davydov, minister of foreign economic relations, has very little 
room for maneuver on achieving a breakthrough in the development 
of trade relations with Spain. 
  On other point: The Russian president, contrary to the 
considerable speculation about his health, will not be 
undergoing medical treatment at the Barcelona hospital where he 
underwent an operation in 1990. He will not even be visiting 
it. But Yeltsin will meet at his residence with the doctors who 
treated him.
