Britain and Spain will come under intense pressure from their European
partners to settle the EU power-sharing dispute which threatens to prevent
four new members - Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway - entering the Union.
Britain in particular, has been identified as the villain in sabotaging
prospects for the wider Europe it says it wants.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, mainly blamed the UK when the
enlargement negotiations broke up in rancour late Tuesday night, to resume
in Brussels next Tuesday.
London and Madrid, with lukewarm support from the Italians, insist on
keeping the weighted voting rules of the 12 - where two large and one small
countries combining 23 out of 76 votes can block measures - for a Union of
16. Their nine partners want to move the threshold to 27 out of 90 votes,
keeping the same, roughly 30 per cent proportion for the 'blocking
minority', after the four newcomers arrive.
'The Nine won't blink on the 27 votes,' Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister
for Europe warned early yesterday.
British officials maintain that only the Benelux countries and possibly
France firmly oppose the UK and Spain, with a large pool in between for both
sides to fish in before next Tuesday. The known evidence from what has
nevertheless been a row behind closed doors suggests they are wrong.
First, the power-sharing issue goes to the heart of the divisions in the
Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between North and South,
between big and small member states, between the sovereignty-conscious who
prefer inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists who want to tighten
European integration and make decisions at EU level easier.
But more immediately, countries like Germany and Holland - both with greater
right to complain about under-representation in the Council than the UK or
Spain - feel certain that the European Parliament will not ratify the
accession treaty if EU law-making is made more difficult by a shrinking
minority.
Parliament formally has to decide whether to go ahead today. This might be
stretched to next week. Much beyond that, however, and the January 1995
enlargement target could be lost, along with momentum in the applicant
countries which still have to convince their voters to endorse entry.
Although nobody disputes that the UK and Spain can block the decision, there
is a growing feeling in Brussels that Britain has misread the situation -
unless it is putting down markers now for the 1996 constitutional review to
which the 12 heads of government (including Mr Major and Mr Felipe Gonzalez)
in June 1992 remitted the votes issue.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has suggested moving to 27 votes
for the moment, and for the 12 leaders to set up a committee to study vote
distribution ahead of 1996, specifically taking into account British,
Spanish, Italian, and also German concerns.
This looks like the only sort of framework which can resolve the dispute and
deliver a Europe of 16 next year - and the British and Spanish governments
can expect to be told so in no uncertain terms in the few days left.
