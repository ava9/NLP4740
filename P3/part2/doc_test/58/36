  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro met with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
here today at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The Cuban 
president arrived for the meeting at 0700 dressed in civilian 
clothes. He wore a white long-sleeved guayabera shirt, which is 
Cuba's typical dress. 
  The revolutionary leader's appearance in public without his 
classic olive drab uniform, which he has worn since the struggle 
in the Sierra Maestra mountains, caused a veritable commotion 
among the virtually 1,000 reporters covering the conference. It 
was undoubtedly one of the most important news stories of the 
summit's opening day. 
  After meeting with Felipe Gonzalez, the Cuban president left 
for the summit, which was to begin with the participation of 22 
heads of state and government of Latin America, Spain, and 
Portugal, in addition to the vice president of the Dominican 
Republic. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned during a conversation today with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina that President Fidel Castro 
will participate in the entire program of the summit and will 
also hold bilateral talks with other presidents and 
personalities. 
  This confirmed that Castro will meet with Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei on 16 June and that Castro is arranging meetings 
with five other chiefs of state. There is also a possibility 
that he will meet with businessmen, congressmen, and 
representatives of organizations that have expressed solidarity 
with Cuba.
