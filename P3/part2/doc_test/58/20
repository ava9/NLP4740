  [Text] Madrid February 10 TASS -- The first day of my visit 
to Spain was very strenuous and effective, Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, now on an official visit here, told 
ITAR-TASS. He said his conversation with head of the Spanish 
Government Felipe Gonzalez was interesting and substantial. 
They discussed a number of international problems, as well as 
prospects of the development of Spanish-Ukrainian relations. 
  On the same day, Zlenko continued, he had talks with his 
Spanish counterpart Javier Solana. The two sides initialled the 
Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Ukraine and Spain, 
signed a document on the freedom of movement of their citizens 
on each other's territory and discussed a number of agreements 
due to be signed soon. Aside from it, during the talks some 
matters were settled, which are connected with the preparation 
of an official visit of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to 
Spain, which is planned to take place in the first half of the 
current year. 
  According to Zlenko, a lively interest of Spanish business 
people in developing cooperation with Ukraine came as a surprise 
to him. He discussed the development of economic relations with 
Minister of Trade and Tourism Javier Gomez Navarro and at a 
meeting with representatives of the Spanish business and 
financial circles. 
  During the talks with Defence Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
the sides devoted much attention to the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where both Spanish and Ukrainian soldiers 
are serving as part of the U.N. peace-keeping contingent. They 
exchanged views concerning the propopsals on the settlement of 
the Balkan conflict, which are being discussed at the NATO 
headquarters. The stands of Ukraine and Spain on those 
proposals are almost identical. Both sides believe it is 
necessary to further look for political ways of settling the 
conflict. Maximum effort should be exerted for attaining a 
peaceful settlement without permitting the militarisation of 
that region. Otherwise U.N. troops made up of soldiers from 
Spain, Ukraine, Russia and other countries may become hostages 
of the ill-considered decisions taken by politicians or 
diplomats, Zlenko said.
