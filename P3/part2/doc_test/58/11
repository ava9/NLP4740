Integration"] 
  [Text] Schwerin, 7 Jun -- Germany, France, and Spain are 
seeking to achieve "the highest possible degree of agreement" 
regarding European policy and leadership in the European 
Council. Beginning on 1 July, the three countries will each 
have the presidency of the council for six months in succession. 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez said at the end of the German-Spanish talks in 
Schwerin on 7 June that in view of the "specially friendly 
relations between the three countries," there was a "great 
chance for the three to start work jointly." Kohl briefed the 
Spanish prime minister on the talks he held with French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand last 
week. The chancellor said he had "personally the impression" 
that he had also reached a "very high degree" of agreement with 
Felipe Gonzalez on problems related to the "building of Europe." 
  Kohl said that prior to the meeting of EU chiefs of 
government on the Greek island of Korfu on 24 June, there would 
be "intensive" talks with the governments of the partner states 
in the European Union [EU], not least to achieve agreement on 
the succession of outgoing EU Commission President Jacques 
Delors. Kohl said he had also discussed this topic with 
Gonzalez. He added that bringing about such a coordinated 
approach prior to the Korfu meeting also referred to the white 
paper submitted by Jacques Delors, which contains, among other 
things, proposals on employment, economic recovery, and the 
improvement of the infrastructure within the EU. 
  At the Schwerin meeting, differences of opinion between 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and the Spanish economics 
minister came to light on whether the EU Commission should in 
the future have the right to raise loans on the capital market. 
Reportedly, the option sought by both sides was not to give the 
relevant permission generally, but at best only on a 
case-by-case basis. 
  Kohl said he agreed with Gonzalez that a "consistent 
continuation of the policy of European integration" was "of 
importance for the whole continent." He had discussed with 
Gonzalez the problem of bringing the Central and East European 
states closer to the EU. It was "an essential goal" of both 
politicians to further deepen relations with the EU neighbors; 
this held also true for the Mediterranean countries, which are 
of particular interest to Spain. 
  Germany, France, and Spain also intended to cooperate in 
preparing the EU conference in 1996, which would examine the 
question of whether the conditions for further steps on the road 
to monetary and economic union were met. Kohl said it was a 
"good coincidence" for the three countries to hold the EU 
presidency in succession; this should, however, not be 
misunderstood as "hegemony of the three." 
  The chancellor stressed that monetary union, which is 
envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, is linked to stability 
criteria. He said these criteria were more important for the 
implementation of monetary union than the "time schedule." Kohl 
said he was "absolutely satisfied for people to say that we are 
working for it as fast as possible." Gonzalez added that for 
the Spanish Government, too, stability was the most important 
thing. He said there was "a certain strictness" regarding the 
convergency criteria, and "a certain flexibility" regarding the 
timeframe agreed upon. 
  Kohl also said that the Federal Republic had reached the 
limits of its possibilities regarding financial aid for the 
Central and East European states. The Federal Government 
believed that new funds for EU programs or projects should be 
paid by member states on a new basis of assessment. He said in 
this context that it was advisable to make the per capita income 
in member states the basis of assessment. Commenting on 
economic difficulties of the Spanish Volkswagen subsidiary, 
Seat, Gonzalez said the Spanish Government would hold talks with 
the Volkswagen management. The Spanish Government was willing 
"to a certain extent" to do something to preserve the jobs; 
however, only such aid could be granted as was in line with EU 
directives.
