SKEELS UNABLE TO MASK DESIRE FOR A TRADE

<P>
A prosperous situation for the San Diego Padres has placed Andy Skeels in a 
most uncomfortable position. And it has nothing to do with the fact that he is 
asked to squat behind the plate nearly every night. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are blessed with a full rack of talented catchers. At the top, of 
course, is National League All-Star Benito Santiago. Not far behind, at 
triple-A Las Vegas, is Sandy Alomar Jr., one of the hottest prospects in 
baseball. Further down the line, at Class-A Riverside, is Skeels, a Thousand 
Oaks High graduate who was drafted in 1987 after setting the single-season home 
run record (18) at the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing his prospects of moving up in the Padre organization as dim, Skeels 
hopes that some smart shopper lifts him off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely begging for a trade," he said. "If I weren't in this 
organization, I'd be in triple-A, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, Skeels has batted better than .300 for the past two months 
to improve his average to .261. He also has 14 doubles, four triples, one home 
run and 36 runs batted in. This is his second season at Riverside after playing 
his first professional season at Spokane, Wash., in the rookie Northwest 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Heightening his frustration is a feeling that the Padres are reluctant to trade 
any of their catchers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like a kid with lots of toys. The minute someone else wants to play 
with one, they say, 'No, no, you can't have that one,' even though they haven't 
given it any attention in a month," Skeels said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Romenesko, the Padres' minor-league director, talks like a kid with a chest 
full of toys. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fortunate to have two high-profile catchers, and we have several more 
interesting catchers at the minor-league level," Romenesko said. "Catching is 
one of the most difficult positions in the industry, and you can never have 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
The backlog of backstops has piqued the interest of other teams, however. And 
there is interest in Skeels. "Andy's been heavily scouted," Romenesko said. 
</P>
<P>
But until -- or if -- a move is made, there is nothing Skeels can do but strap 
on the mask and present to the world a broad smile and a hard swing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to find out if I can play or not," he said. "In our organization, I'm 
nobody. Their business is to play who they think is best. I'm a grown man, I 
can handle that. I'll be at the park tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Buying time: After mostly watching from the bench as Arizona won the Division I 
national championship in 1986, Pat Waid of Camarillo probably figured the clock 
was running out on his baseball career. He was a backup outfielder again in 
1987, his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
But perseverance has paid off for Waid. He called around to independent 
minor-league teams and landed a tryout last year with the Salt Lake City 
Trappers of the Class-A Pioneer League. Not only did he make the team, he 
batted leadoff, played center field and was among the league leaders in stolen 
bases, with 15 in a 70-game season. 
</P>
<P>
Waid, who played for two years at Oxnard College before transferring to 
Arizona, has improved his batting average from .280 last season to .326 and he 
has five home runs, 24 RBIs and seven stolen bases. Now, time is on his side. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat has a real good chance of being picked up by a major league organization 
at the end of this year," said Holly Andretta, the Trappers' assistant general 
manager. "He was nearly signed by the Reds after last season and he has got a 
lot stronger since then." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking ground: Gino Tagliaferri's first professional hit was not a booming 
home run of the type that were his signature at Kennedy High the past three 
years. But because it was his first hit, his single up the middle Tuesday might 
be more memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, the City Section single-season home run champion, has made several 
adjustments since reporting last week to Niagara Falls, N.Y., of the Class-A 
New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
"He says the pitchers really throw gas," said Gene Tagliaferri, Gino's father. 
"He's adjusting to the wood bat and he's adjusting to the weather. It's always 
cloudy and humid." 
</P>
<P>
Another change for Tagliaferri is his position -- third base after a high 
school career at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
But the most change Tagliaferri will see is due Jan. 15, which happens to be 
his 19th birthday. That's the day he receives the second half of his signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Another hunch, by George: Longtime San Francisco Giants scout George Genovese 
of North Hollywood has signed several longshots who have enjoyed long careers 
in the major leagues. In addition to sure things like Bobby Bonds, Chili Davis 
and Jack Clark, Genovese has taken chances on players like Gary Mathews and 
Eric King, players no other scout would touch. 
</P>
<P>
John Chiaramonte of Westlake High and Moorpark College is Genovese's latest 
gamble. After signing in June, Chiaramonte was assigned to Pocatello, Ida., of 
the Class-A Pioneer League. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily a knuckleball pitcher in high school, Chiaramonte has gotten 
progressively stronger and has developed an impressive array of pitches. The 
right-hander was 7-1 at Moorpark last season and was named the team's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's averaging a strikeout an inning," Genovese said. "He kind of reminds me 
of (Dan) Quisenberry, who wasn't overpowering when he signed. John brings the 
ball from all over but he can be rough with his sidearm delivery. When he drops 
down, his ball really sinks." 
</P>
<P>
Genovese is impressed by Chiaramonte's head as much as his arm. "I love his 
general makeup, he seems to be a competitor," Genovese said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Pocatello: The last Valley-area player signed by Genovese prior to 
Chiaramonte was Joey Speakes of Poly High. Speakes is also at Pocatello, where 
he starts in the outfield. A single performance in the 1987 City Section 
playoffs told Genovese volumes about Speakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Poly knocked Chatsworth from the playoffs and Joey really performed in the 
clutch at bat and in the outfield," Genovese said. "That one game told me that 
he was professional material. I decided that day to draft him."
