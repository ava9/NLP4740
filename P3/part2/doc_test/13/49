<P>
It was just a dinky hit, but for Jim Vatcher, Friday's single took on enormous 
proportions because it was his first hit in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher, a 5-foot-9 Philadelphia Phillie outfielder from Cal State Northridge, 
faced Dean Wilkins of the Chicago Cubs with two out in the eighth inning. 
Vatcher topped a forkball and the ball trickled down the third-base line as 
Vatcher dashed to first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget running down the line at Wrigley Field in the sun," Vatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped and Vatcher was given the baseball. Philadelphia trailed, 
15-1, at the time, which muted the celebration. But Vatcher is savoring every 
major league moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm holding on day to day," said Vatcher, who also delivered a pinch-hit 
single Saturday. "I'm incredibly fortunate to be here this early in the season. 
I'm pumped." 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, Vatcher was playing left field and batting a ho-hum .260 for the 
Phillies' triple-A team in Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa. Manager Bill Terlecky 
told Vatcher that he wouldn't be in the lineup that night and to meet him in 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to expect," Vatcher recalled. "He said, 'You're going to 
the Phillies tomorrow.' I was like, 'Wow.' I was speechless." 
</P>
<P>
Since being called up, he had been hitless until Friday. All six of his 
appearances have been as a pinch-hitter, although twice he has remained in the 
game as an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
He vividly recalls every detail of the first four at-bats, the way a pilot 
remembers his first flight. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 1: Vatcher leads off the fifth against San Diego Padre right-hander 
Andy Benes. "Not much of a pressure situation except for being my first 
big-league at-bat," Vatcher said. "I thought I'd be a lot more nervous. You get 
kind of locked in with the pitcher and don't really realize where you're at." 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher redirects a 2-2 pitch to right field. For Vatcher, it's that 
unforgettable first major league at-bat. But for right fielder Tony Gwynn, it's 
just another easy fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 2: With Darren Daulton on first and none out in the eighth, Vatcher 
bats against New York Met left-hander Frank Viola. "Daulton walked on all 
fastballs and I was stupid to think he'd throw fastballs to me," Vatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Viola throws a first-pitch changeup, Vatcher lunges and bounces into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 3: St. Louis Cardinal left-hander John Tudor has made a career of 
getting hitters to swing at pitches low and away. Vatcher lays off 'em and 
draws a walk. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 4: With runners on first and second and Cardinal left-hander Ken 
Dayley on the mound, Vatcher watches a fastball right down the middle for 
strike one. "I figured, 'Well, I'm gonna look at one.' It was the best pitch 
I've seen yet," Vatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
He also looks at strike two and strikes out swinging at a high curve. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I've got a pretty good eye and I wait for my pitch," he said. "But 
when I'm pinch-hitting, if I get a fastball anywhere near, I'm hacking." 
</P>
<P>
There is no time to waste. Phillie outfielder Carmelo Martinez is scheduled to 
come off the disabled list Wednesday, which could signal a return to the minors 
for Vatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking about when I'm going back," he said. "The big leagues are 
unbelievable. They take care of you so well. You get spoiled in a hurry, I'll 
tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to take: Steve Dailey knows what it's like to come up short, and it has 
nothing to do with his stature. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, Oklahoma State's left fielder and a former two-sport standout at 
Ventura High, took a called third strike Saturday to end the College World 
Series. Georgia defeated the Cowboys, 2-1, for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
But if history is true to form, Dailey, a sophomore, will get a chance at 
redemption. Oklahoma State has qualified for the series eight times in the past 
11 years but has yet to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Add CWS: Cal State Fullerton, which made a quick exit from the series, had 
three area players -- Steve Sisco, Kevin Farlow and Frank Charles -- in its 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco, a sophomore infielder from Thousand Oaks High, was Fullerton's regular 
first baseman despite standing only 5-9. Sisco, however, holds a winning hand 
in low ball. "In our key regional win against Texas, he picked three throws in 
the dirt," Coach Larry Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco, who batted .294 with 32 runs batted in this season, has broken a mold 
before. As a senior shortstop at Thousand Oaks, he batted leadoff and set a 
school record with nine home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Across the infield from Sisco, at shortstop, was Farlow, a former All-City 
Section player at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, a 6-4 senior, transferred from USC last summer and solidified the Titan 
defense. He also batted .284 with 32 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked out great for us," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, a transfer from Pepperdine who played at Montclair Prep, is a catcher 
and designated-hitter who batted .330 with 43 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of those guys are the type I want on my club," Cochell said. "After 
coaching 24 years, I am interested in being around good citizens. Kevin, Steve 
and Frank fit the mold exactly."
