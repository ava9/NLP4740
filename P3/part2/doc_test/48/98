FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Steel side lifts Adam &amp; Harvey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adam &amp; Harvey, the international distribution and steel stockholding group,
lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 2.82m in
the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 23.8m. Earnings per share improved
from 34.5p to 39.6p.
Mr Gerald Stuart-Lee, chairman, said the profit increase resulted from a
strong performance in steel stockholding. 'As a whole the group continues to
trade profitably.' The group had benefited from moves towards free market
economies in Africa, he added.
The interim distribution, which will be paid as a foreign income dividend,
is up from 6p to 8.5p.
