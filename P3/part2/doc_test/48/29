FT  14 MAY 92 / Brazil plans radical tax devolution to states and cities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government will outline radical proposals this week to halve
the number of federal taxes and shift responsibilities for many public
services from the federal government towards states and municipalities,
report Stephen Fidler and Christina Lamb in Braslia.
The reforms, aimed to enable the government to balance its books
consistently, are seen as crucial for the success of Brazil's economic
stabilisation programme.
Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, co-ordinator of the Fiscal Reform Commission,
said in an interview that the proposals will be presented across the country
to mass public meetings throughout next month.
The final version will go to Congress only after municipal elections in
October. This means the government will have to continue to rely on tight
monetary policy as its main weapon against inflation for at least the next
six months.
According to Mr Oswaldo, the main thrust of the reform will be to devolve
greater responsibilities to the states and municipalities, transferring
services such as health and education from the federal government. It would
reduce the number of major taxes to eight from 15.
Under the proposals, the federal government would raise taxes in two ways -
via excise duties on items such as fuel, cars, tobacco, drink, electricity
and telephones; and through income tax.
It would also broaden the base and lower the rates of the current income
tax, reducing heavy payroll taxes on companies, a focus of legal
controversy.
For the states, the main source of revenue would be value-added tax and, for
municipalities, a property tax applied to rural and urban areas.
Under the 1988 Constitution, about half of tax revenues is transferred to
the states and muncipalities, but without clear definition of their
responsibilities. 'We cannot reduce the transfer of funds but we can pass to
them the jobs they could perform better', said Mr Oswaldo. 'At present, one
cruzeiro leaving Braslia for schoolbooks has to go through so much
bureaucracy that it is worth only a few cents by the time it reaches its
destination.'
He stressed that the planned decentralisation would 'improve efficiency and
bring the citizen closer to the provider of services'. He believed it would
be politically popular because mayors and governors could win electoral
support for building and running good schools and hospitals.
