I DO NOT adhere to any religion. I agree with Arthur Koestler, who said that
the continuous disasters in man's history are 'mainly due to his excessive
capacity and urge to become identified with a tribe, nation, church or
cause, and to espouse its credo uncritically and enthusiastically, even if
its tenets are contrary to reason . . . wars are not fought for personal
gain, but out of loyalty to king, country or cause'.
If I lean in any direction, it is towards paganism. One of my favourite
places is Delphi. Another is Olympia. I believe I came from star-matter, and
to star-matter will return. If you ask me, paganism could be very big news
again by - strictly a guesstimate - 2100.
None of which means that I don't enjoy Christmas. I enjoy it enormously.
Especially this Christmas, which promises to be minimalist and beautifully
well-organised. Also economical. Thrifty. Cautious. This is all part of my
Lamont strike, my refusal to countenance any form of spending other than
what is strictly necessary so long as Norman Lamont remains chancellor of
the exchequer.
(Do not be fooled by those trendy political columnists who now maintain that
Major and Lamont have somehow escaped the grisly reckoning that awaits them;
they haven't; they are doomed; I can see it in their stars.)
My economical Christmas started well last Sunday when I and Miss Lee, my
executive assistant, visited, in the Rover, one of London's most exclusive
garden nurseries, not a million miles from Maida Vale, in search of a
Christmas tree. This nursery is so expensive it charges Pounds 100 for
weeds. At once, Miss Lee made a beeline for the 10-footers: strapping
Christmas trees royal in lineage, sap and price.
Fortunately, twirling in desperation, I noticed a dwarf affair propped by
the gate, inelegantly put together, bottom-heavy, a spindly, droopy top - a
bargain for just a fiver.
Summoning immense reservoirs of persuasion, I charmed Miss Lee into
believing that unless we purchased the dwarf it would be cast into the
canal, or burned. So home it rode with us, propped in the Rover, and a fine
sight it makes, its spindly, droopy top, now glittering and lighted, poking
above the sill of our sitting room window like a pinprick of civilisation in
a distant, dangerous galaxy.
Flushed with my success in extracting a Pounds 5 Christmas tree from a
nursery that charges Pounds 100 for weeds, I went for broke on Tuesday. I
took the bus to Knightsbridge, to see whether Harrods or the dreaded Harvey
Nicks were offering any bargains. Don't make me laugh. I hate those stores,
wish they could be vaporised, mainly because they consume, via Miss Lee's
credit cards and charge accounts, a measurable fraction of my income.
Harvey Nicks was quiet. No scenes of outrageousness. Nor, come to think of
it, any sign of the advent of John Major's classless society. In the
fragrance department, an Amazon in ghoulish make-up sprayed some concoction
on my wrist and asked if I liked it. I grimaced and gurgled, and ran for the
escalator.
In sweaters, a maiden (or youth) with Botticelli hair, Botticelli eyes and
Botticelli lips asked if I needed help. 'Only,' I replied, 'if you have
anything for less than Pounds 1,500.' The maiden (or youth) smiled anciently
and enigmatically, and returned to buffing her (or his) nails. I thought I
would have a coffee, but everyone in the coffee shop seemed to recognise me.
They all waved and shouted. So embarrassing.
Harrods was noisier: lots of common folk, foreigners in the main, Brazilian
cement kings and Australian princesses hocking the sheep farm. There was
also a group of choirboys, sweet-voiced and bored. I made for the pet
department. There were two parrots for sale, one at Pounds 750, the other
Pounds 700. There were some canaries and budgerigars, and some bizarre furry
articles.
Also tanks and tanks of fish, including glowlights at Pounds 2 each, zebra
angels, Pounds 10 each, marbled angels, Pounds 6.50 each, thick-lipped
gouramis, Pounds 6 a pair, and red cap orandas, Pounds 6 each.
It is a theory of mine that fish make an ideal Christmas present. They are
minimalist, and economical. If they prove not to be popular the recipients
can always eat them, breaded, I suppose, with a bottle from Sainsbury,
something Hungarian, possibly rather curranty.
I bought five red cap orandas and 10 glowlights. Happy Christmas.
