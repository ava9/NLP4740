  [Excerpt] The number of persons captured by the National 
Police in connection with "Operation Nortenito" has risen to 10. 
This operation made it possible to discover half a ton of 
cocaine ready for shipment to the United States. 
  The last three to be arrested are Hugo Segura Hurtado and 
Oswaldo William Rivera Cabezas, both corporals in the Customs 
Military Police [PMA] on active duty, and the civilian, Jaime 
Oswaldo Suarez Valencia. 
<H5>  They Were Evading Immigration Inspection </H5>
  The Interpol chief in Guayas, Lieutenant Colonel Abraham 
Correa, claimed that both Segura Hurtado and Rivera Cabezas were 
working at the Guayaquil airport, and had connections with the 
drug trafficking ring. They were linked, in particular, with 
Kleber Delgado Delgado (also in custody), who was responsible 
for delivering the drugs to them, concealed in various export 
items. 
  According to the investigations, both members of the Customs 
Military Police were assigned to prevent drug shipments from 
getting through the immigration screening process. However, they 
had managed to put shipments aboard airplanes bound for the 
United States. 
  Interpol agents, who were pursuing the drug traffickers, 
discovered Delgado delivering several packages to the corporals. 
Consequently, Interpol coordinated its action with the 
headquarters of the Customs Military Police, an agency that 
arrested Segura and Hurtado. Both were turned over to the 
National Police last Wednesday morning. 
  The two subjects in custody were moved to the Second Guayas 
Command, where they are being held along with the Colombians, 
Alfredo Arturo Benavidez Coral, Juan Carlos Gamba Garcia, and 
Mario Fernando Jurado Portilla, as well as the Ecuadorians, 
Kleber Eudoro Delgado Delgado, Ivan Gerardo Pineda Flores, Luis 
Fernando Mejia Tarupi, and Nelson Orlando Benavidez Medina. 
<H5>  Another Arrest </H5>
  Finally, last Thursday morning, the Interpol agents captured 
Jaime Oswaldo Suarez Valencia at the Guayaquil airport. In the 
statements made by several of those implicated who were 
captured, it was claimed that Suarez played a part in the drug 
trafficking crime under investigation. 
  It was also learned that the counternarcotics agents are 
tracking at least six more persons said to be seriously 
implicated in the drug traffic. 
<H5>  Confiscated Assets Shown </H5>
  Yesterday morning, the National Police organized a tour of 
the properties confiscated from the drug traffickers captured in 
"Operation Nortenito." 
  These assets include a residence in the Los Albatros housing 
complex owned by Kleber Delgado Delgado; a warehouse located at 
Km 4 of Juan Tanca Marengo Avenue, where the drug dealers had 
been storing and packing the drugs brought from Colombia; and an 
office located on the second floor of the building at 418 
Chimborazo and Clemente Ballen Streets, where the Intersis 
office, owned by Delgado, is operated. [passage omitted]
