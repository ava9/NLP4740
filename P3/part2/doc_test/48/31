<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich by Yuliy Semenov of Ostankino Television, Lyudmila 
Telen of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and journalist Igor Rudometov; 
Shushkevich and Rudometov speak from a Minsk studio, Semenov and 
Telen are in the Moscow studio; from the "Live Dialogue" 
program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Semenov] You know, journalists always look for 
something extraordinary to start a conversation, and I also 
propose to start our conversation with a scandal, although not 
with a scandal between you and me, of course -- I hope that 
everything will be fine between us on the air -- but with the 
political scandal which has stirred the Belarus Supreme Soviet 
over the last few days. [passage omitted] So Stanislav 
Stanislavovich, perhaps it is not a very pleasant topic for 
conversation, but today I think it is unavoidable. What is your 
attitude toward this situation? 
  [Shushkevich] Good afternoon, esteemed viewers. Esteemed 
Yuliy Aleksandrovich, of course this topic is not the best way 
to start a conversation, but we should be ready to consider any 
question. I have probably spent the last three days thinking 
about this question above all others. I would like to separate 
it from the essence of the accusations and so on and so forth, 
because they are different issues. 
  Here we have a very clear example of our inability to work 
in 
the new conditions, that is, when we become a truly legal state. 
We are seeing that law by telephone continues to operate in 
Belarus. That is, a sanction is issued over the telephone by 
the procurator general, and it seems to represent an 
authorization to act completely freely from then on. The 
parliament has been analyzing this situation for a long time, 
and I can say that yes, unfortunately written laws are being 
violated in the upper echelons of authority, the upper echelons 
of our law-enforcing bodies. 
  We sometimes ask why this or that law is not working, or why 
something is not happening; after all, the laws are written. 
There are structures that must make them known and structures 
that must study them and implement them religiously. And we are 
seeing the violation of those laws. That is unfortunately a 
fact, a sad fact, and it will serve as a bitter lesson for the 
whole Supreme Council, for the republic's law-enforcing 
structures, and probably for a wider group of people as well. 
  [Semenov] Do you see any legal problem here for the CIS as a 
whole? For instance, some states have agreements between 
themselves on legal assistance, others do not. You see, there 
have been cases when representatives of certain Central Asian 
countries have caught members of their own oppositions here in 
Moscow. Is there a possibility that tomorrow Azerbaijan will 
demand the extradition of Mutalibov and Vezirov in connection 
with the accusations that are being directed toward them? Is 
there a legal mechanism for such cases? Should not the special 
services of some countries work on the territory of other 
countries, all the more so if it is openly and legally? What do 
you think? 
  [Shushkevich] You are absolutely right. These are ordinary 
things that one can well understand. I would point out that 
Russia is probably the most careful implementer of such an 
approach, and so I do not understand your concern, especially 
your strange examples. I did indeed touch on similar issues both 
with the Russian procurator general and even with the president 
-- I hope he will forgive me for taking the liberty of 
mentioning it. But I perceived an entirely correct and cool 
approach here: everything must be carried out according to the 
letter of the law. 
  Such a legal accord does not exist between many states of 
the 
USSR [as heard], but we do have such an agreement with 
Lithuania, and it is all the more regrettable that our services 
are not mature enough to implement this agreement. Because the 
procuracy, which worked for a week on this question with 
representatives of the Lithuanian procuracy, suddenly came forth 
with a verbal instruction. This of course is entirely irregular. 
And, therefore, the concern in the Supreme Council was natural. 
I hope that coolness will prevail and strict juridical rules 
will operate and this case will receive a proper assessment. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, you said that this case will 
receive 
a proper assessment, but nevertheless the situation is still 
quite acute today. Clearly you and the Supreme Council will 
have to take some kind of action to settle the situation. How 
do you see the situation developing, and what do you intend to 
do in order to ease it? 
  [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, you know the situation in 
Belarus quite well. I follow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI and your 
writings closely. It is very difficult to forecast how the 
situation will develop. The thing is that we lack the 
analytical disposition and the coolness that a parliament should 
have. The parliament should not sink to score-settling, 
forgetting about its main business. 
  What do we have now? Those laws that would allow us to 
rectify the economic situation, as well as those corrections to 
the constitution -- or rather the solution of questions 
concerning the adoption of the new constitution -- are being 
held up by political score-settling. It is not always Supreme 
Council business; the cases when it is the business of the 
council are exceptional. Because whatever happens, the work of 
the council is paralyzed. 
  And you know, there are serious events ahead of us. There 
are very serious treaties ahead of us, of a kind not previously 
seen in practice between CIS states, and indeed it is difficult 
to find similar approaches anywhere else in the world. We have 
to work on this and work seriously. But a week has passed and 
we have made very little progress in the work of our session. 
So I repeat once again: Professionals, legal experts, and 
parliamentary commissions should work on issues, submit 
proposals, and not make decisions or turn the council into a 
commission of enquiry. That will be fruitless, because emotion 
will prevail over reason and the juridically correct approach. 
That must be avoided. 
  [Semenov] Before handing the floor to our Minsk colleague 
Igor Rudometov, I have a question here. Viewer Kuznetsov from 
the Moscow area has evidently been attentively following what 
has been happening in your country. He is interested in this. 
Some kinds of troop contingents have twice appeared in Minsk 
outside the Supreme Council. Is this so? And what was it 
connected with? 
  [Shushkevich] You know it seems to me that if the Moscow 
area 
has already been informed of this, our affairs are in quite a 
bad way. Unfortunately, one has here again a case of law by 
telephone -- or, you know, not even law, but an anonymous 
telephone call. According to the report I received from the 
commander of our interior troops, an anonymous telephone call 
led to the fact that, contrary to existing regulations under 
which contingents of interior troops cannot be moved from the 
locations where they are stationed without the sanction of the 
head of government and without the sanction of the interior 
minister, troops in our country were moved some 150-200 meters 
from the Supreme Council. 
  I asked why this occurred and I demanded a written 
explanation. The explanation was very simple. It said: I 
received a telephone call, and I was afraid that the deputies 
would not be treated with due respect when they emerged from the 
Supreme Council. But what I do not understand is that they do 
not come out of the council at that spot. These games take on 
an unpleasant character, and there have been some examples of 
this in neighboring countries. I think in general that the 
grave and tragic character of these events has not got through 
to the understanding of some of our leaders. 
  Within their understanding they almost want to play a little 
game with the troops. These games are very dangerous and are 
very dangerous for Belarus. I think that we must be very 
emphatic in this regard. 
  As far as I am concerned, I think that one such occasion was 
discussed at the security council during its preparation, and 
there were no grounds for bringing the troops out. All the 
subsequent events showed that there was no reason, that is to 
say, there was no attempt to destabilize the situation. Now we 
have run into it again and there was not even a hint of such an 
attempt, and again the troops were brought out. I consider it 
my duty in the most resolute way to address this issue tomorrow 
on the basis of the documents in my possession. It is essential 
in general to build a law-governed state and not a state where 
there can be methods of intimidation. I hope that Belarus will 
not be an example of such a state and that the Supreme Soviet 
and the government will do everything possible to see that no 
further such games take place on the territory of the Republic 
of Belarus and that such things do not occur. [passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] Before we turn to purely economic questions, 
such 
as the single ruble zone, I'd like to read the following 
question. It's from Russia, from someone who describes himself 
as: Golubovich, a Belarusian living in Russia. Here goes: What 
were Shushkevich, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin guided by when in 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha, contrary to the will of the people -- 
that's the way the question is worded -- they were wrecking the 
Soviet Union? I won't make any comments on the question, I'm 
just passing on to you. 
  [Shushkevich] I have already spoken about it a thousand 
times. 
  If today I had to do everything all over again, I would not 
have been able to find a better way to ensure that we build 
legal relations between us in a civilized manner. I would have 
taken the same road. I believe that there are many negative 
phenomena both in the CIS and, on the whole, in individual 
countries; but the fact that this step was taken has averted 
much more evil events. I am proud of this step. 
  [Rudometov] Which leads us to the many questions we have 
about the single ruble zone. 
  [Semenov] We too have many such questions. Well, go ahead. 
  [Rudometov] OK, question number one: What is it? Why are 
there so many advocates and opponents on either side? One would 
naturally prefer to be rich and healthy rather than sick and 
poor, but what should we do now? 
  [Shushkevich, laughs] You know, the funny thing is that I 
cannot give a precise, comprehensive, and meaningful answer to 
the question of what it is. And neither can anybody else, I 
believe. What I can say is what aim it pursues, what I'd like it 
to be. It would be very good if we could have a single means of 
payment; it would be very good if we could pursue an agreed 
monetary policy; and it would be very good if we could make the 
settlement process less complicated. 
  And I'd like to say that Russia is in no way threatened by a 
unification with our financial system, even on those terms that 
have been formulated and have been denounced in Russia. Because 
in general, if, as it were, our Belarusian rubles turn into 
Russian ones, there will be no inflationary processes -- because 
we have so few that it poses no threat. 
  In fact, our enterprises are generally penniless. The 
absence of the financial means that we so often talk about is 
what we inherited from socialism. This is why I believe that it 
is a positive move, which should help us to stabilize the 
economy. 
  [Rudometov] But there is an opinion that in this case we are 
going to Russia as poor relations. 
  [Shushkevich] That will depend on what specific agreements 
we sign. I think that in the communique signed by Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I, not a single line suggests that we 
are going to Russia as poor relations. In fact, we believe that 
we are uniting, that we are unifying the financial systems in 
order to enable both Russia and Belarus to gain profit because 
we will simplify a whole range of relations. 
  But I can tell you what is my main priority. For me the most 
important point is this: The economy of Belarus can be knocked 
out, it has in fact been knocked out; that is to say, it is in a 
sorry state. I will give you an example. In Russia prices went 
up eightfold last year, while here prices went up 28 times! In 
Russia, the dollar rate has increased threefold... By the way, 
I was asked about it during a TV program and I checked later and 
this is in fact true. Well, in Russia the dollar went up 
threefold, while here the increase was 16.5 times. This means 
that we are bad managers. Why? Here is the main problem: Our 
main market is Russia. This is a fact. And our exports there 
are of quite good quality. But if we include in the price of 
these goods the price of the Russian oil -- and it is a lot more 
expensive here than in Russia -- we end up with astronomical 
customs duties! Last year we had to pay $28 for one tonne of 
oil. If this oil is included in the price of our goods -- and 
our energy consumption is high -- our goods will end up being 
very expensive in Russia. Russia will not buy them. And the 
primary reason is the price of oil. If Russia does not buy 
goods, our industries will perish. We have no one else to sell 
the goods to, because oil is expensive and we will not be able 
to sell our goods anywhere else. 
  But look how this backfires on Russia. Enterprises producing 
these goods use spare parts made in Russia. There are so many 
of them -- and we are not talking about raw materials, but about 
engines, electronics, and the like. These Russian industries 
will in turn collapse because they will not have a market 
either. We are destroying a huge mechanical engineering 
industry, radio electronics, motor industry, tractor industry. 
We are ready to kill them through an unreasonable pricing 
policy. We have to stop this. And for me the solution is in 
unified prices for energy carriers. This is not a sacrifice for 
Russia. This is something that Russia must do. 
  I'd like to make one other remark in this connection. Please 
understand that Russia is a legal successor to the former Soviet 
Union on most points. It was not us who generated Chernobyl, it 
was not us, bear this in mind. But every product we sell there 
has a 5.2 percent Chernobyl tax, because otherwise we cannot 
bring these people out of their most difficult plight and 
resettle them somewhere they can live, and help them settle -- 
because there is no way they can stay where they are. 
  It was not us who led to a situation in which 15 percent of 
our budget -- mind you, 15 percent, which is more than what is 
spent on defense, on education, on culture, and many more things 
taken together -- 15 percent is spent on the Chernobyl tax. 
And, therefore, we cannot invest in industry even though it is 
now necessary that the state should support many positions in 
industry through planning. But we are deprived of this 
opportunity. Therefore, I believe that one has to move in the 
framework of a sensible treaty, understanding that there are no 
reasons, no grounds for the so-called Russian-speaking 
population who form a majority in Belarus -- there aren't that 
many Belarusian speakers -- there are no reasons for them to 
complain to Russia about some kind of policy against them -- it 
is not like in other countries. 
  [Semenov] You know, unfortunately not all your fellow 
countrymen share your view. The publication of a notorious 
article by Zenon Paznyak has created a stir in Moscow. Here I 
have Russian TV viewers' reaction to it. For my part I can only 
say -- I understand that we are probably placing you in an 
awkward position by mentioning this -- but this article has been 
noticed in Moscow, and it is understandably causing irritation 
among Russian readers. One cannot speak of the Russian people 
the way Zenon Paznyak does. And even though he is trying to 
frighten Belarusians with Zhirinovskiy, he comes very close to 
him in some respects, particularly in his use of language and 
the nature of arguments. 
  But let us now return to the subject of our discussion. You 
know, we understand your pain, your concern, particularly 
regarding Chernobyl. And TV viewers really welcome the fact 
that Russia and Belarus are coming closer together. [passage 
omitted] But there are also doubts on this point, connected 
with fears of some damage for Russia, particularly financial 
damage if funny money is exchanged one for one. Someone here 
tried to calculate Russia's financial loss. It can be as high 
as 1.6 quadrillion rubles. By the way, this figure is 
marginally higher than the annual budget of Ostankino. These 
are the estimated losses this exchange can bring the Russians 
due to inflation. Another problem is that there would be a 
second center for the emission of rubles. 
  [Shushkevich] Yulian Aleksandrovich, first of all I cannot 
leave unnoticed your remark concerning Zenon Paznyak's article. 
First of all I'd like to say that I categorically dissociate 
myself from such an approach. But I'd like to explain just one 
thing. You know what the trouble is? We can, all of us, 
Russia, Belarus, and many other countries, find in our previous 
history a whole range of incidents that can lead to a strained 
and apprehensive attitude to each other. But, you see, one 
cannot be partial in treating historical facts. I just don't 
know, with all those things about Malyuta Skuratov and 
oprichnina [Skuratov was Ivan the Terrible's henchman most 
associated with the 1565-72 practice of mass repressions, 
executions, and confiscation of land on suspicion of treason, 
known as oprichnina]. 
  Was not the oprichnina really calamitous for those who are 
now Belarusian-speaking, for those who live in these regions. 
And was it not calamitous for Russian citizens? I could go 
through history, and sometimes, you understand, the genocide 
carried out by the Russian authorities against the Russian 
people was so harsh and so tough that it was simply terrible. 
And now we are singling out one factor; that, for example, 
those same authorities that carried out genocide against the 
Russians more than any others also carried out genocide against 
the Belarusian people and that's what we'll build a policy upon! 
This is just juggling facts. I oppose this, and I want to say 
this: In our history there are many remarkable examples. We can 
always build and are continuing to build good relations. And 
the main criterion, the main approach, is the people: No article 
of any sort, including articles about the inhumanity of Russian 
Federation imperialism, will nurture anti-Russian Federation 
attitudes in our republic! As for unification, this is a 
difficult issue, I repeat. If we manage to resolve the main 
question, if Russia resolves the main question on pricing 
policy, then I assess it is a worthy solution. 
  And now as for the losses: I mentioned the figure of about 
15 
percent of our budget. This is a higher figure than the one you 
mentioned, and we are shelling out on Chernobyl expenditure -- 
although I repeat, we have never had, and do not now have, a 
single nuclear power engineering installation -- but why should 
we remain in isolation? According to contemporary calculations, 
we are indeed receiving assistance from the Russian Federation, 
but if you will excuse me saying so, in comparison with the sum 
you mentioned, this assistance is positively paltry, just 
peanuts. And so realistically speaking, given our previous 
history and given whose legal successors we are, we really do 
have a worthy package of agreements and they must be sacredly 
observed. And there is sufficiently good motivation and grounds 
for drawing these up. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, if I may I should like to continue 
on this topic. The communique that you and the Russian 
president signed make considerably more difficult both your and 
his positions within your states. [passage omitted] Can you 
say, please, will you, as chairman of the Belarus Supreme 
Soviet, and President Yeltsin, as head of the Russian state, 
manage to convince your opponents and convince the people that 
this decision is for the well-being of both states? [passage 
omitted] What happens when Russian citizens are told today: 
unification with the Belarus monetary system means an extra 10 
percent inflation a month? Does it not seem to you that this 
could make relations between peoples more difficult rather than 
easier? 
  [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, first of all I don't want 
to 
give an opinion on who has been saying what and how about 
joining or not joining the Russian Government. But I ought to 
say that it is difficult to find a politician in Russia for whom 
I have more respect than Yegor Gaydar or Boris Fedorov, and I 
could name many others who have and haven't joined the Russian 
Government. 
  The matter is this: Either the Russian reforms, the monetary 
approach, were excessively intensive and corrections are now 
needed, that is, they went slightly in the wrong direction, or 
they were largely correct. There are official declarations 
everywhere that the reforms are continuing and that the brake 
won't be applied to them. But on the other hand, given the 
lineup that we see, they'll have a little less monetarism and a 
little more state planning. That's how I understand the issue. 
  I don't think that Belarus can add 10 percent to the 
inflation rate. We've made some very serious miscalculations, 
or rather calculations, and that kind of inflation... [pauses] 
It's quite another matter that everyone who can will claim that 
such inflation has come about due to unification. So the 
agreements have to be carefully drawn up, and the reason for 
that explained. 
  As far as political unification is concerned, then excuse 
me. 
I'll say once again that I'm proud that Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, the president of Russia...[pauses] It wasn't even me 
that asked him or pushed him about this. You see, it turned out 
during talks that we both came up with the same proposal. We 
should have made it clear that this is two states reaching 
agreement here, two countries. That we are preparing a 
full-scale and far-reaching treaty on relations between our 
states. But taking into account the realities and the great 
extent to which we are interwoven, this probably won't be the 
kind of agreement that is reached between other states. That 
is, it will be a closer relationship anticipating the kind of 
links, perhaps, of which some countries in Europe dream. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] The question of dual citizenship arises. How is 
it being resolved in Belarus, and in this connection there is a 
question from our next group of listeners. 
  [Shushkevich] I can answer that one straight away. 
  [Rudometov] Go ahead, please. 
  [Shushkevich] This question has not been resolved in our 
legislation. It can be decided in two ways: One way is by being 
drawn up by our commission on nationalities, because we have to 
find a way. There is a certain category of people affected, and 
we've understood that this issue has to be resolved. The other 
way might be set out in this treaty. It could be drawn up 
applying international law. Instructions have been issued. 
  [Rudometov] [passage omitted] What measures are being taken 
by the Belarus Government to uphold ensure rights in Belarus 
that are being encroached upon in other ex-USSR republics? This 
question comes from a lady in Riga who didn't give her name. 
  [Shushkevich] Yes, this kind of question could well be 
asked in Riga, because there's a problem there. There's a group 
of servicemen's families who, in our opinion, do not largely 
enjoy all the rights enjoyed by citizens of Latvia. This is a 
delicate issue. Our Supreme Soviet commission is aware of it 
and a whole range of specific approaches to it have been 
examined. It might possibly be resolved with international 
involvement. We have told the Latvians about this and also 
other states who are trying to help Latvia sort this issue out. 
There are families of former servicemen of Belarusian origin in 
Latvia who, our commission on inter-ethnic relations is 
convinced -- I stress is convinced -- do not have the status 
that free citizens of a free country should have. This, 
unfortunately, is a fact. [passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] Will the promise about early elections to the 
Supreme Soviet be honored, and why is there no law on recalling 
deputies? A lot of people are concerned about this. 
  [Shushkevich] Once again, I repeat that unfortunately the 
Supreme Soviet is so distracted from its proper work by 
secondary issues and investigations it shouldn't be involved in 
that I think we can only meet the announced deadline by 
mobilizing all forces within it. Because the process is clearly 
being drawn out, there's no secret about that. I'm beginning to 
think certain groups of deputies are even doing this 
deliberately. [passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Viktor Viktorovich Poteskiy from Nizhniy Tagil is 
interested in your attitude toward your Polish minority. 
  [Shushkevich] I don't think that we have a problem with the 
Polish national minority. In particular this is linked to the 
Catholic faith...[pauses] Our legislation and the realities are 
such that Poles have a proper status in Belarus. 
  [Semenov] Regarding your new position on nuclear disarmament 
by Belarus: You're known to have set a good example for 
everyone in this respect, but some nuances have appeared. 
  [Shushkevich] Our position is in no way new. It's as it was, 
as was announced on literally the first day of the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet when I was elected chairman. We are for 
withdrawal. We signed all the documents and we are withdrawing 
them. 
  As far as a share of the value of the materials obtained 
from 
the nuclear warheads in our country is concerned, we have an old 
and long-standing agreement with Russia and the United States 
with all our fellow CIS members. 
  [Semenov] Here is a curious question. It is known that 
President Boris Yeltsin, in his meeting with Bill Clinton, gave 
him certain official documents on the Lee Harvey Oswald case, 
who as you know was officially recognized as the man who killed 
President Kennedy. Meanwhile, there was a report that the 
volumes on this case were sent to Minsk, where Oswald once lived 
and was even married. Did you give anything to President 
Clinton, and do you know anything about this dossier? 
  [Shushkevich] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, everything that could be 
done in accordance with our legislation was done previously. We 
are punctual here in our observance of the law. But I, like all 
my colleagues in Minsk, have already said everything I can about 
this, right up to the fact that I personally taught him Russian, 
the man who is believed to be Kennedy's killer. All the 
documents that could be handed over according to the law were 
handed over a long time ago. 
  [Telen] Stanislav Stanislavovich, your position in the 
Supreme Soviet is, unfortunately, somewhat complex. Up to now, 
you've always managed to find some kind of balance and 
equilibrium to work constructively with the Supreme Soviet. On 
what political forces are you now ready to rely within the 
Supreme Soviet, and with whom is it easier for you to find a 
common language? 
  [Shushkevich] You know, I've now become a centrist, 
initially 
spontaneously but now by conviction. This is a lengthy answer 
to your question, because I can say that I can rely on the 
communists as well, because Marx was the greatest free-marketeer 
of them all. I can demonstrate what's primary and what's 
secondary, beginning with Engels's speech at Karl Marx's grave. 
  I'm obliged to rely on the majority who support the 
government, because they're also all claiming to be 
free-marketeers. Therefore, I'm seeking a platform for 
compromise from the standpoint of rational organization of the 
economy, and such a platform can be found. 
  That's why I'm not a member of any political party and do 
not 
intend in the near future to create one. 
  [Telen] One more question. Economic reform is known to be 
proceeding in a less intensive way than many people and 
economists in Belarus would like. Are there any differences in 
this respect between yourself and Prime Minister Kebich? 
  [Shushkevich] You mentioned differences. I want reforms to 
move faster than the prime minister can realistically achieve. 
You see, I want this to happen. We're creating laws on the 
basis of which they can move faster, but it's the prime minister 
who has to do it. And this is where the complications arise. 
It's a lot harder for him -- I understand that -- but I do 
think that in the actual present conditions we can head toward a 
free market faster. [passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Did you get a saxophone concert during your 
meeting 
with President Clinton? 
  [Shushkevich] No, we didn't get a saxophone concert because 
we didn't have enough time and had to tend to business. We 
didn't have any breaks for a personal chat except in the car. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Stanislav Stanislavovich, we have a little time 
left. Perhaps you'd like to speak on something the questions 
didn't touch upon? Go ahead if you wish. 
  [Shushkevich] Esteemed colleagues, I'd like to say one 
thing. 
It's very difficult to reform a simple structure, and very 
difficult to reform the economy of a large state. Naturally, 
difficulties are encountered in the course of such reform. The 
whole trouble is that without completing one phase or one task, 
we start making such a noise about these difficulties and 
cursing the reformers that we sometimes lose sight of the goal. 
  I appeal for calm and persistence, because once you choose 
the type of treatment it's impossible to hand the patient over 
to someone else. That would only kill the patient. You should 
either believe the doctor or not believe him. In our country, 
we have every reason to believe in our Supreme Soviet. But in 
the past week it's badly undermined these reasons because we've 
started occupying ourselves with secondary tasks. 
  I'd say this: We shouldn't be diverted from our planned 
market-economy policy, a policy for a social market economy. I 
stress the social, so that pensioners, veterans, and Chernobyl 
victims understand that we should do everything to look after 
them. But we mustn't be deflected from our course. And the 
Russian prime minister... [pauses] We can see that things have 
got better in Russia because Russia has moved more determinedly 
toward the free market. [passage omitted]
