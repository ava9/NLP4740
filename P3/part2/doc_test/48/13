THE MAMBO KINGS (15) MGMs West End
MEDICINE MAN (PG) Odeon West End
THE ADJUSTER (18) Metro RUBY (15) Odeon West End
The Mambo dance craze swept the West in the early 1950s. Aged about three at
the time, I was able to resist its infectious Latin American rhythms. Not so
many others, including my nanny. She would steal my rattle and use it as a
castanet, ruthlessly performing numbers like 'Guantanamera' and 'Mambo
Caliente' over my defenceless pram.
Scarred by this experience, I expected to dislike The Mambo Kings, directed
by Arne Glincher from a screenplay by Cynthia Cidre based on Oscar
Hijuelos's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Instead the movie proves
appallingly enjoyable. Everything is as overheated as in a Mambo song.
Armand Assante as Cesar, a snake in human clothing, and Antonio Banderas as
his younger brother Nestor, an innocent plucked from happy love in Havana,
are the singing Cuban brothers who try to make it big in crime-ridden 1950s
New York.
Assante manages to make it big almost everywhere, especially in bed. Here he
enjoys the lovely, capacious body of nightclub cigarette seller Cathy
Moriarty, a sort of human stretch-limousine.
Banderas falls for pretty Maruschka Detmers. And these four hurl themselves
at a plot full of dance, song, jealousy, sex, murder and all the other
things we might normally complain we get enough of at home.
The pace is so bright and pushy that it cannot be resisted. The villains
snarl on cue - chiefly Roscoe Lee Browne as a black mobster trying to mop up
the 'Mambo Kings' for his own nightclub empire - and the dialogue is out of
Raymond Chandler by Mae West. 'He thinks he's the last Coca-Cola in the
desert,' cracks a girl in the dance-club crowd as she watches the delirious
Assante dance with Miss Detmers. 'He is, honey,' drily retorts Miss
Moriarty.
Then there is Desi Arnaz Jr as Desi Arnaz Sr, signing our heroes for an I
Love Lucy show on TV. (Assante and Banderas are cleverly cut into
black-and-white dialogue scenes featuring the late Miss Ball). There are
fancy opticals from director Glincher, as the recurring image of a couple
dancing across the screen 'wipes' old scenes and paints in new ones. And of
course there is the music: Tito Puente, Duke Ellington, Beny More - my nanny
would be in heaven.
* * * In Medicine Man Sean Connery is a scientist working in the Amazon.
Though described by his new workmate Lorraine Bracco as 'Dr Mengele with a
pony tail', he is more like Tarzan with a test tube. He swings between
100-foot trees while collecting rare bromeliads which he has successfully
used on the local Indians as, yes, a cure for cancer.
Unfortunately he has now forgotten the formula. When young Miss Bracco
arrives loud and yacky and businesslike ('I'm surprised they sent a woman,'
says someone, unschooled in the ways of Hollywood), he plays Bogart to her
Hepburn.
Shambling about his hangar-size shack, he raves in dishevelled fashion
against women, civilisation and bureaucracy. He can afford to. He lives in
Paradise, photographed by Donald McAlpine as if he and his camera crew had
been force-fed with Rousseau paintings.
He is surrounded by naked tribeswomen, ogled by director John McTiernan (The
Hunt For Red October). And he practises golf swings in a jungle clearing.
This is burying oneself in the wild for the benefit of humanity?
Tom Dead Poets Society Schulman took a cool Dollars 1m for his original
screenplay, which on reaching screen seems one of the silliest in memory.
When not trying to put the eek back into ecology - snakes in the rafters,
heroines dangling over 300-foot chasms - the film attempts to be a screwball
romance between an ageing Superdoc and a young tomboy.
But you cannot create comedy or sexual chemistry in a vacuum. This jungle is
nowhere, this plot is a non-starter; and the only time I inwardly cheered
was when Miss Bracco, tasting a rare jungle bean, declared that it would
'knock Maxwell House right off the shelf.' Could this be the first example
of product displacement in the cinema?
* * * The Adjuster is one of those films in which the quality of strain has
no mercy. Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan is fascinated by the
depersonalising drift of the modern world.
We know that already from his earlier, better films: from the family torn
apart by couch-potato callousness in Family Viewing or from the ugly mergers
of big business and private porn in Speaking Parts.
His new film repeats the old themes in a plot so poorly glued together you
want to hand it back for re-assembly. Insurance claims 'adjuster' Elias
Koteas preys upon females who have lost their homes in fires, seducing them
at the Mishap Motel where his company puts them up.
Meanwhile, the new house he himself has bought in an otherwise uninhabited
new estate is about to be invaded by a porno-minded film-maker who likes its
privacy.
Oh and Mr Koteas, an amateur archer, sometimes shoots arrows at developers'
signs. Toxophily, as Theodore Roosevelt almost once said, and carry a big
stick. Egoyan's big stick is aimed at the evil ways in which primal emotions
and Platonic ideals in today's world have become shadows of shadows: love
turning to sex, care to welfare, order to bureaucracy.
Fine themes but fatuous treatment. Egoyan has succumbed to the reductive
evils he aspires to expose. He prefers the flashy well-labelled image - the
arrows of righteousness, the opening scene of a sick old tramp rescued from
subway death by a rich lady - to any exploration of who these people are and
what, apart from the film-maker's clockwork symbolism, makes them tick.
* * * 'I dunnit so one day everything's gonna have to be brung out in the
open,' says Danny Aiello in Ruby. Little could the real Jack Ruby have
known, when he shot Lee Harvey Oswald in a Dallas police station in 1963
with the world's watching TV cameras still in shock after JFK's death, that
30 years on, every imaginable who-did-what scenario would have been 'brung
out' by the movies.
Ruby is to JFK what an elephant with a twisted ankle is to a gazelle on
steroids. Scripted by Stephen Davis from his stage play Love Field, the film
plods from one shoestring set to the next - Ruby's sleazy Dallas nightclub,
a 'luxury' Las Vegas hotel that looks like a down-market Days Inn - as
Aiello's too too stolid Ruby sorts through, or is sorted through by, the
usual shopping basket of conspiracy candidates: Mafia, FBI, CIA, CBI, BFI,
YMCA. . .
The tedium is briefly relieved by the headline scenes: the tingle of history
has not left Dealey Plaza or that Dallas police basement. But nothing
redeems a film which tries to gain a box-office fillip by such putrid
gimmicks as inventing a Monroe-like heroine - Sherilyn Fenn as a stripper
made privy to State secrets. John Mackenzie of The Long Good Friday directs.
Finally, two neglected Maurices. My reviews of Maurice Pialat's Van Gogh
(12, Lumiere) and Maurizio Nichetti's Volere, Volare (15, Metro) fell off
the bottom of my column recently, due to the space demands of Miss
Dietrich's death. Both films are still playing and one is worth seeing.
Nichetti's comedy about a cartoon film sound-dubber, taken over by the
creatures whose moos and honks he imitates, has enough ingenuity to make up
for a wandering plotline. Like Who framed Roger Rabbit, it deftly mixes
animation with live action.
Little animation, alas, in Pialat's account of Vincent VG (Jacques Dutronc)
as a low-energy epateur of the bourgeoisie living in picture-pretty
Provence. Bring back Kirk Douglas in Lust For Life.
