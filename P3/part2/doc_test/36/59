FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hollywood stars in race for
small-screen exposure - Plans by Paramount and Warner Brothers to establish
television networks

Two of Hollywood's largest film studios - Paramount Pictures and Warner
Brothers - are racing to establish new US television broadcasting networks.
And about the only thing they agree on is that there is only room for one of
them to succeed.
Both companies have recently announced plans to launch a fifth broadcasting
network. It would compete against the three long-established networks - CBS,
NBC, and ABC - and the upstart Fox Broadcasting, launched in 1986 by Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Paramount, which is in a joint venture with Chris-Craft industries, owner of
six independent television stations, intends to launch its service in
January 1995. Warner, which has teamed up with Tribune Broadcasting, owner
of seven stations, aims to have its service running by next autumn.
While details of the Paramount and Warner plans differ considerably, both
are essentially trying to emulate Fox.
Fox has built up its network by winning over local independent broadcasting
stations around the country, and by gradually increasing the amount of
original programmes it broadcasts.
Its original output still falls well short of the Big Three, and is
concentrated substantially in the 8pm-10pm prime time slot and in children's
programming. However, its 140 affiliated stations reach around 95 per cent
of American television households.
To attract the national advertising necessary to make a new network
financially viable, Paramount and Warner have to sign up affiliates who can
put their programmes into at least 80 per cent of homes.
Both companies agree the 280 broadcast stations which remain independent -
and which they are targeting - are sufficient only for one more network, and
even that will require some cable partners, or tie-ups with affiliates of
existing networks.
'There's no room for two more networks,' says Mr Robert Daly, chairman of
Warner Brothers. He has appointed Mr Jamie Kellner, who played a key role in
the birth of the Fox network, to do the same for his company.
'The battle will be won or lost in terms of who signs the bulk of the
non-affiliated independents, and that's where all the arm-twisting, and
salesmanship and persuasion is going on,' says Mr Kerry McCluggage, chairman
of Paramount's television group.
But is there even room for a fifth network? After all, the Big Three, which
used to account for over 90 per cent of US television viewing, have seen
their share drop to around 60 per cent with the expansion of cable
television.
Do viewers want yet more general broadcasting, rather than the
narrowly-focused programmes offered by cable? Paramount and Warner Brothers
note that the networks actually gained viewers at the expense of cable this
autumn for the first time in years, suggesting that market share may be
stabilising.
They also point out that some 40 per cent of US population is not wired for
cable, nor likely to be in the near future; and that part of the Big Three's
loss of market share has been to Fox and other independent broadcasting
stations as they improved the quality of their programmes.
The independents have been bolstering their traditional fare of local
sports, news and old movies with so-called first-run syndication shows -
series produced by Hollywood specially for this market.
The trend was pioneered by Paramount, which launched an offshoot of its
long-running, but still extremely popular, Star Trek science fiction series
into first-run syndication in the late 1980s. The move to a fifth network is
logical progression from first-run syndication, but it has also been spurred
by a big change in the structure of the television production industry.
For the past two decades, anti-trust regulations have restricted the Big
Three networks' ability to own and produce the prime-time entertainment they
broadcast, and to benefit from later syndication of these shows, most of
which are are made by Hollywood.
However, a court ruling this month sounded the death knell for this
restriction, and the Big Three are preparing to increase their output of
shows, forcing Hollywood to look for additional outlets.
Paramount and Warner plan to start their networks with just two hours of
original programming two nights a week. Paramount will feature a new Star
Trek series.
Warner has not given any programme details, but strengths include its
expertise in children's cartoons and the talents of producers like Steven
Spielberg.
Although Warner initially announced plans for a much fuller, faster roll-out
of its network than Paramount, it has had to slow down. Potential affiliates
baulked at having to share advertising revenues from the lucrative 5pm-6pm
and noon-2pm time periods with the national network.
Warner has also faced resistance over the financing of its network. The
company, which owns no broadcasting stations, has had to reduce the size of
the up-front 'guarantee' it wants affiliates to pay it to help fund the
roll-out. It also wants a share of any increase in affiliates' profits.
Paramount, which owns four independent stations, is not asking affiliates
for cash, and maintains it can make its network viable with money from
national advertising and from its local stations, whose value should be
increased by network affiliation.
Warner initially planned to establish quickly a related cable television
network to carry its channel into so-called 'white areas' of the nation,
where there is no unaffiliated independent station.
However because of the reduction in its up-front payments and its more
modest programming goals, it has deferred that plan. Instead, it aims to
reach these areas initially through ad hoc syndication deals with affiliates
of the four existing broadcast networks - roughly the same approach being
pursued by Paramount.
Warner claims to have signed up affiliates representing some 42 per cent of
US households, while Paramount is on 33 per cent.
The battle has a long way to go, and could be complicated by the outcome of
the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for the Paramount studio's parent,
Paramount Communications, whose new owners might have different priorities.
