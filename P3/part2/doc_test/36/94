The week's glossiest offering is the live-action/animation movie The
Pagemaster. Macaulay 'Home Alone' Culkin is a boy caught up in a magical
world while wandering a library. A hint of sorcery; a whiff of dragons; and
our hero is hurled into the twilight zone between reality and fantasy.
Most of us feel we are already there by this time of year. Buffeted by
conflicting bids for our Yuletide attention, we scarcely know which is the
way to cosy naturalism and which to state-of-the-art make-believe.
The Pagemaster, promising on paper but flimsy on film, prompts another
question. Why is Britain getting all the feebler seasonal fare from
Hollywood, while the good films - writing from Tinseltown, I can identify
them as I speak - stay in the States keeping our ex-colony happy? The smash
hits here at present are Disney's cheerful Father-Christmas-is-amongst-us
whimsy The Santa Clause, everything that Miracle On 34th Street isn't; the
bright, if mildly barmy, sci-fi romp Stargate; and Star Trek Generations,
which may be old hat but at least wears its headgear with a flourish.
Britain has Junior, fast slipping down the world charts; it has Lord
Attenborough in whiskers (in Miracle on 34th Street), prompting the thought
that we get enough of that at home; and it has the glorious but one-year-old
The Nightmare Before Christmas. The week's new UK openings add to
Scrooge-like feelings. They include the grimly self-explanatory Never Ending
Story III and the wholly dispensable Dennis Hopper film Chasers.
With the video year entering bleak midwinter, where to turn for comfort?
Those seeking the perfect cassette present - and having command of unlimited
funds - could shun the choice of re-issued movies and go for something
completely different. Why not buy the entire set of Monty Python TV shows,
repackaged this year for the team's 28th anniversary? Re-viewing highlights
recently, I found myself still dissolving into helplessness at dead parrots,
AC/DC lumberjacks, ill-equipped cheese shops and all those other things that
make life with Python - and should make Christmas with Python - worthwhile.
