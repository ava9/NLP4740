</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Witness a transformation: A witty boy growing up in an idyllic New York town in 
the 1930s becomes the master of macabre in television's Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
He delivers packages for his father's butcher shop, captains the debating team, 
stars in plays, writes patriotic newspaper editorials. 
</P>
<P>
Graduation, 1942. He joins the paratroopers, is wounded in the Philippines. 
After college, he trades in his smile for a tight-lipped, somber look and 
becomes the spokesman for a bizarre dimension beyond imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Young Roddy Serling is about to become the creator of "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tales of Hysteria 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him growing up in Binghamton, 60 miles south of Syracuse, say 
that their Rod Serling was not the sinister narrator who introduced such tales 
of hysteria as "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" or "Will the Real Martian 
Please Stand Up?" 
</P>
<P>
"He was always gregarious and wasn't a bit Edgar Allan Poe-ish," said Helen 
Foley, Serling's junior high drama teacher. "He was very funny and witty and 
charming." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years after Serling died following heart surgery in Rochester, a group 
of friends has formed the Rod Serling Foundation in Binghamton to keep his 
memory alive. 
</P>
<P>
Serling was born on Dec. 25, 1924, to Samuel and Esther Serling. The family 
later moved to Binghamton, the city Serling disguised in "The Twilight Zone" as 
the perfect towns of Homewood and Willoughby. 
</P>
<P>
His friends in Binghamton remember Serling not as a star but as the grinning 
boy who always showed up at the center of every group picture. 
</P>
<P>
Former Binghamton High School classmate Jim Haley recalls how Serling would 
come to his house on his green bike to visit Haley's sister, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd always let me ride it to get me out of the way," Haley recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has about 150 members nationwide, but it's not a fan club, 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be called fans," said Foley, who attended the ceremonies last 
October when Serling was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "Fans 
sounds as though we're a bunch of clucks like those 'Star Trek' people." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was seven years older than Rod, Serling's brother, Robert, 
remembers staging plays with the future TV whiz-kid in their back yard. They 
later collaborated on an early version of the script for Robert Serling's 
novel, "The President's Plane Is Missing." 
</P>
<P>
Other anthology shows in television's infancy are long forgotten, but mention 
"The Twilight Zone" and everyone will rattle off a favorite episode, Robert 
Serling said in a telephone interview from his home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring out why the show captivated viewers "would be like describing the 
color red," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it was Rod's voice and appearance, the way he set the mood," his 
brother said. "Part of it was the O. Henry aspect, the unexpected twist, the 
surprise ending. And part of it was that Rod masqueraded a sermon in his 
scripts. He sent messages to people without them realizing they were being 
preached to." 
</P>
<P>
That was part of Serling's appeal in television's early years, when good 
writing with a point behind it was rare. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great observer of humanity," classmate Bill Behan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We often wonder what he'd be writing today," said another classmate, Robert 
Keller. "If he were alive, I'm sure he'd have something in the running for the 
Oscars." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief stint as a radio copywriter, Serling began writing TV scripts in 
1951. He sold more than 70 scripts before his drama "Patterns" was aired in 
1955, winning him the first of six Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
For the next four years, Serling could pick and choose what shows to write for. 
He did many scripts for "Playhouse 90," which aired Serling's second Emmy 
winner, "Requiem for a Heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1959, he surprised the industry with plans for a science-fiction 
anthology series. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod always tried to do more than entertain," his wife, Carolyn Serling, said 
in a telephone interview from her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. "He was a 
humanitarian and critic, and he found outer space and fantasy a good vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Serling wrote 92 of the 156 "Twilight Zone" episodes and became its host after 
the producers' first choice, Orson Welles, proved too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
That brooding host was not the Rod Serling that classmate Sybil Goldenburg 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
"He enjoyed the pretense of that persona, but it wasn't him," she said. "If his 
talent overtook his behavior, it was an affectation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voice Attributed to Nerves 
</P>
<P>
Nerves caused Serling's hushed tones at first, his wife said. As he grew more 
comfortable before the cameras, he stuck with the menacing voice because it fit 
the show, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Serling's Binghamton friends lament that his other writing accomplishments are 
largely forgotten: a 1960s Western series starring Lloyd Bridges, an early 
draft of the script for "Planet of the Apes," the 1970s series "Night Gallery." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot for "Night Gallery" gave Steven Spielberg his first directing job in 
1969 in a vignette starring Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when Spielberg and company premiered "Twilight Zone -- The Movie" in 
Binghamton, Serling's old friends formed the foundation to honor the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides sponsoring annual Serling film festivals, the foundation last Christmas 
laid a bronze plaque in a bandstand in a Binghamton park where Serling set the 
"Twilight Zone" episode "Walking Distance." That episode starred Gig Young as a 
man transported back to his childhood in the idyllic town of Homewood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serling Stamp Urged 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has a Serling exhibit in a local theater, sells Serling buttons 
and postcards and is lobbying the U.S. Postal Service to issue a Serling stamp. 
</P>
<P>
Serling's ties with his hometown included featuring Binghamton High School 
graduate Richard Deacon in "Twilight Zone" episodes. Deacon was best known as 
bald Mel Cooley on "The Dick Van Dyke Show." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Serling became disenchanted as producers altered his "Night 
Gallery" scripts. After the show was canceled, he spent his last years teaching 
at Ithaca College, 30 miles northwest of Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
He often returned to his hometown to talk to students. When Serling spoke at 
Binghamton High School once, "a kid told him, 'You must have awful nightmares. 
You've got an awfully creepy mind,' " Foley said. "But he didn't."
