The bloom isn't entirely off the (Pete) Rose. All the attention surrounding his 
suspension from baseball for gambling, his conviction and five-month jail 
sentence for tax evasion hasn't hurt the popularity of his video, dubiously 
titled "Baseball the Pete Rose Way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the week after Rose's sentencing, the video was checked out from the 
Thousand Oaks Library. And librarian Mike Gilman said it has been rented 
consistently over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's an instructional tape and has nothing to do with his personal 
activities," he said.

Jeepers Creepers . . . Here's one for all the science-fiction fans out there . 
. . way out there. Tickets have gone on sale for the Ojai Film Society's Aug. 
26 showing of the 1957 movie "The Incredible Shrinking Man." Following the film 
will be a discussion on science-fiction movies past and present. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of science-fiction experts will analyze the film and compare it to last 
year's Disney film "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." Among the speakers will be 
Richard Matheson, who wrote the original "Shrinking Man" story and screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Film Society founders Sally and Mike Janover have arranged for special effects 
expert Tom Smith to discuss his craft. He has worked on "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids," as well as on two films in each of the "Star Wars," "Star Trek" and 
"Indiana Jones" series. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Tony and Nancy Lawrence, writers and producers of some "Twilight 
Zone" and "Outer Limits" episodes, will also attend. This science-fiction fest 
will be held at Ojai's Thacher School beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10 in 
advance, $15 at the door. Call 646-8946.

You may have noticed that unlike last summer the Ojai Film Society hasn't been 
showing any movies the last couple of months. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"No one comes," said Mike Janover. "We found that there was too much 
competition with the summer blockbusters. We tend to lose money anyway, but we 
really lose money when no one comes." 
</P>
<P>
A big problem, Janover said, is that he can only show his films at the Ojai 
Playhouse on Sunday afternoons. "In summer the days are longer. The idea of 
going to a movie at 4:30 in the afternoon when they could be playing golf . . . 
they don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
But beginning Sept. 16, with "Cinema Paradiso," the films will be playing once 
again. On the schedule are "Time of the Gypsies," "Sweetie," "Women on the 
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Drugstore Cowboy," "The Man With Two Brains," 
"Raging Bull," "Longtime Companion," "Aguirre, Wrath of God," "Tom Jones" and 
"The Adventures of Milo and Otis." LEO SMITH
