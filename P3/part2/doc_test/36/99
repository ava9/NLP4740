Chris Gardner was one of the many media photographers in the nation to capture 
on film the six days of the Santa Barbara fire last June. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was a tragedy to so many and obviously I wish it never occurred," 
Gardner said. "Yet it was very surreal, and terribly exciting, and it was 
beautiful in a way." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, who lives in Santa Barbara and works for the Independent, a weekly 
newspaper, said he wanted to put all the images of the fire in one room. So he 
selected 40 photos from magazines and newspapers that show the tragedy, the 
excitement and the beauty of the fire. The prints, from photographers with the 
city's local newspapers and the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily News, 
Newsweek magazine, Time magazine and National Geographic will be on display at 
the Contemporary Art Forum now through Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gardner's favorite photos include a man running down his driveway just 
as flames are about to engulf his house, and a couple embracing amid the rubble 
that was once their home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a war scene without the bodies," Gardner said. "I will never forget it. 
I feel honored to have been there. And at the same time I feel ashamed because 
I sort of enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is free. The gallery in the Paseo Nuevo shopping center is open 
Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. A reception for "Fire on Film" 
is scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday. Call 966-5373.

The fiery and soulful yet sweet sounds of the Mighty Diamonds will come to the 
Graduate nightclub in Isla Vista Saturday at 8 p.m.

The reggae trio is known as much for gentle harmonies as the ability to bring 
an audience to its feet and into dance. 
</P>
<P>
The group formed in 1969 and has just released its 24th album, "Go Seek Your 
Rights." Past albums include "Ice On Fire" and "Changes," which featured the 
1982 hit "Pass the Kutchie." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $15, available at the Graduate, 685-3112, or charge by phone,

The rise of the Black Panthers, the free-speech movement and the anti-war 
demonstrations of the late '60s and early '70s are some of the events that 
changed the course of American social and political life. 
</P>
<P>
Six years in the making, the documentary "Berkeley in the '60s" was completed 
this year. The production is an archival assemblage of raw footage from the 
mass marches, demonstrations and confrontations of the 1960s. Interspersed are 
recent interviews with 16 activists from that decade, including Black Panther 
co-founder Bobby Seale and free-speech movement leader Jackie Goldberg, now 
president of the Los Angeles Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The film will be shown at the University of California's Campbell Hall at 8 
p.m. Sunday. Admission is $6. Director/producer Mark Kitchell will discuss the 
film after the screening. Call 893-3535.

<P>
Voznesensky, 57, is considered one of Russia's leading poets and many of his 
books have been published internationally. Among the titles published in the 
United States are "Nostalgia for the Present" (1979) and "An Arrow in the Wall" 
(1989). Voznesensky is also co-author of the rock opera "Yunon and Avos," which 
was a hit in Paris.
