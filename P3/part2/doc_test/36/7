It was business as usual inside the Star Trek attraction at Universal Studios. 
Volunteers from the audience had taken the stage dressed as Starship Enterprise 
crew members, Klingons and other aliens. The Enterprise was about to be 
attacked, as it is four to six times every Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Admiral, estoy detectando una nave Klingones (Captain, I am detecting a 
Klingon spaceship)," a crew member said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-speaking director kept up a rapid-fire stream of instructions to 
actors and jokes to the audience. In the dressing room backstage, 
Spanish-speaking Universal staff members looked after costume and wardrobe 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
When the show was over -- "Hasta la vista, Kirk," said the Klingon commander -- 
the actors gathered at the stage apron. Clearly, they felt a post-performance 
exhilaration. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that program many times at home and it was a lot of fun to be in it," 
Claudia Reyes of Los Mochis, Mexico, said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language Star Trek adventure is part of a growing campaign by 
Universal Studios Hollywood to attract Latino customers. Each weekend for the 
past three years, several of Universal's tram tours have been conducted in 
Spanish. The amusement park in Universal City drew large crowds with an 
international mariachi festival in August and an appearance in March by stars 
of telenovelas, or the Latino soap operas that appear on Spanish-language 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Universal also built a theater for production of the television show "Hablamos 
de Cine" ("Let's Talk About Cinema"), a program of movie reviews broadcast on 
KMEX -- Channel 34. Park visitors can watch as the show is taped. 
</P>
<P>
David Weitzner, worldwide head of marketing for Universal Studios Hollywood, 
said the special attractions are working. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Latino attendance so far this year is up 67% from the total for all of 
1988, and we only expect that to increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for growth appears to be enormous. Last year, 65,000 of the 
park's 4.2 million visitors were Latino, Weitzner said, a scant 1 1/2%. 
Meanwhile, Latinos make up an estimated 2.6 million, or 30%, of Los Angeles 
County's 8.5 million population. Weitzner expects the park to draw 5 million 
visitors this year, with Latinos numbering 100,000, or 2% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
With such a large market to tap, other amusement parks and attractions are 
tailoring events and marketing to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Joffrey Ballet, with help from the service organization Plaza de 
la Raza, sent representatives to a meeting of a Latino business association to 
promote its "Billy the Kid" program and distribute half-price ticket coupons. 
The Joffrey held a cocktail reception at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 
those who attended the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Four hundred people came," said Nancy Neal Davis, the Joffrey's West Coast 
general manager. "That's how you build a following. They had a great time, and 
they'll tell others." 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey also invited Latino schoolchildren to rehearsals, where principal 
dancer Beatriz Rodriguez spoke in Spanish about the various jobs available in 
ballet and theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art offers tours in 
</P>
<P>
Spanish by appointment and, as part of its "Sundays in the Museum" program, 
buses in families from community centers in Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Some attractions have not done extensive tailoring of programs to bring in 
Spanish-speaking patrons. Magic Mountain in Valencia has only a Father's Day 
promotion featuring Latino bands and disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic philosophy is we market the park to the Southern California 
community and a lot of that community is Spanish-speaking," said Courtney 
Simmons, the park's public relations manager. "We advertise in their newspapers 
and on TV and radio." 
</P>
<P>
The leader in the effort clearly is Universal, where admission is $21 for 
adults and $15.50 for children 3 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios Hollywood, said the campaign began 
because Latino visitors asked to take the tour in Spanish. Universal has 
expanded its foreign-language program to include, by appointment, tours in 
German, French, Japanese, Hebrew and American Sign Language. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the park hired Valdes Zacky Associates, a Century City advertising 
and public relations firm, to improve its Latino attractions and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish language like any language has a unique culture and a unique 
sensitivity, and you have to take that into account," said Dolores Valdes 
Zacky, the firm's co-owner. "For the international mariachi festival, we did a 
talent search for la nueva voz ranchera (the new ranchera voice). There are 
many ranchera singers and their dream is to be accompanied by mariachis of top 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
Amateur singers performed with Mariachi Vargas from Mexico City, Los Camperos 
from Los Angeles and other well-known groups. The mariachi festival's five 
concerts drew 6,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Valdes Zacky said Latinos can be a boon to a theme park not only because of 
their numbers, but also because of their life style. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanics spend more money in general than the mainstream," she said. 
"They want to have a good time now with their families. If you go to their 
songs, they talk about today. They don't care so much about tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
As with the mariachi shows, the park used audience participation to draw 
customers to its Novela (short for telenovela) festival. Patrons acted in 
scenes with six soap opera stars. 
</P>
<P>
The novelas are immensely popular. On a recent Spanish-language tour of the 
park, a boy was chosen from the audience to play the part of Elliot in a 
re-enactment of a scene from the movie "E. T." Asked by the emcee to name his 
favorite screen character, the boy did not mention Elliot, E. T., Luke 
Skywalker or the like. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa Salvaje," he said, naming a novela star. 
</P>
<P>
Tour guide Patricio Flores said Spanish-speaking visitors ask the same 
questions as 
</P>
<P>
heir English-speaking counterparts -- "How are special-effects produced," "What 
are stars like in person?" Some, however, react differently to the park's 
earthquake attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen people crying," he said. "You have people from El Salvador, from 
Nicaragua, where there were bad earthquakes. But I think it helps by teaching 
them to be calm. After they leave, they aren't so scared of earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Medina, head of the Spanish-language tour program, said the guides he 
hires must be bilingual because English-speaking visitors often stop them to 
ask questions. Medina, who started as a guide three years ago, said the strong 
family orientation of Latinos is another reason the park is seeking them as 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different type of group," he said. "Normally an English tour is two 
people, four people. These people, they come with everybody. There's 
grandmother and uncle, sometimes 20 people."
