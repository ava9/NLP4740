With the help of noted science fiction writers and the creator of "Star Trek," 
a cable television company hopes to boldly go where no channel has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
From pre-Sputnik space alien thrillers to advanced digital animation to reruns 
of "My Favorite Martian," it's all going to be beamed down by the Science 
Fiction Channel Inc., says its president and chief promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the 24-hour channel to debut Dec. 31, said Mitchell Rubenstein, 
who organized investors last year and recruited a board of advisers that 
includes author Isaac Asimov and "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein said programming deals have been made with several small cable 
operators representing about 500,000 subscribers in Colorado, California and 
Florida. Material distributed by the company predicts at least 5 million 
subscribers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein said many new shows are planned, including a robot detective series 
created by Asimov, author of more than 400 books and articles and an early 
proponent of robotics.
