What appeared to the a booming business last fall -- putting local ads on 
videotapes of hit movies -- apparently has gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
Two companies, Video Broadcasting Systems of Wichita, Kan., and Video Air Time, 
of Midland, Tex., were at the forefront of this local-ad movement. Both, 
though, are virtually out of business. 
</P>
<P>
What these video-ad sales firms did was make deals with video store owners to 
put commercials for local businesses on the blank tape at the beginning of 
rental movies. Since video companies like Paramount sell rental copies to video 
retailers, in theory the retailers are free to do what they want with the tapes 
-- including selling commercial space on them. Video retailers and the video-ad 
sales firms split the money paid by advertisers, while companies like Paramount 
and CBS-Fox got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Paramount filed a suit in a Kansas federal court against Video 
Broadcasting, mainly charging trademark infringement and the false creation of 
the image that Paramount approved these ads. Paramount wanted a ban on the 
local ads but the judge denied it. That should have meant clear sailing for 
companies like Video Broadcasting and Video Air Time to sell their local ads. 
</P>
<P>
But, Allen Frasier of Video Air Time explained, Paramount's intimidation 
tactics frightened away both advertisers and video retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Without any advertisers, said William Fry, attorney for VBS and also a former 
co-owner, VBS is just "limping along." Last week VBS filed a countersuit 
against Paramount, charging violation of antitrust laws and malicious 
interference with the company's contracts with advertisers, seeking $105 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's responded to all this with a prepared statement made through a 
spokesperson: "Except for VBS, the other original defendants have agreed to 
stop these practices. As we said all along, we choose what is placed on 
videocassettes very carefully. We brought this action originally to protect the 
quality and integrity of our product as it is sold or rented to consumers. We 
don't want them confused. We believe the court will dismiss VBS' frivolous 
claim." 
</P>
<P>
Putting ads on cassettes released by other companies is now almost impossible 
too, Fry said. These other companies have used tactics like cutting down on the 
amount of blank tape space at the beginning of movies and imprinting the 
company logo on all the tape preceding a movie -- so that adding a commercial 
would constitute trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount particularly objected to the tone and inferior quality of the ads and 
the fact that commercials were inappropriately matched to its movies, like a 
bar ad preceding the teen movie, "Pretty in Pink." Ads have been placed on 
Paramount videos such as "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Flashdance," 
"Crocodile Dundee II" and "Star Trek IV." 
</P>
<P>
All video manufacturers deplore the local video-ad business but only Paramount 
took legal action. Video companies weren't that concerned about lost revenues 
from local advertising but they feared renters might think they approved such 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
Also, these local ads conflict with the national ads that video manufacturers 
have already added to certain titles. But video companies, afraid of alienating 
renters, have put very few ads on movies. Paramount, for instance, has only put 
ads on six of its titles. The companies were afraid that rampant local 
commercials would ultimately turn off renters and damage the whole rental 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas has been the battleground for the video-ad conflict. But Texas' Video 
Air Time has indirectly suffered too. Video Air Time's president Allen Frasier, 
who said he once considered merging with Video Broadcasting, admitted that his 
company is largely out of the video-ad business. Though he blamed Paramount for 
Video Broadcasting's decline, Frasier said Paramount didn't do as much damage 
to his business as the depressed Texas economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertisers don't have much money in this part of the country," Frasier 
said. "We had to compete with cheap radio ads and cheap TV spots. Even if we 
could put all the local ads on videotapes we wanted to, we wouldn't have much 
business."
