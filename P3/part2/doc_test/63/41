IT IS still only the Washington parlour game of the month and it is still
played more with amused detachment than with real intent. But, since life
and art are now patently indivisible, as Vice-President Dan Quayle was
merely the last to demonstrate last week, the current fascination with what
might happen if no-one wins an outright victory in the presidential election
in November might just return to haunt the country.
The starting point is the constitutional technicality that the presidency is
won not by popular assent but through an overall majority of the 538 members
of an electoral college. This is an anonymous group, chosen according to
state size, whose only task has been to ratify, in December, the election of
the previous month.
All but Maine and Nebraska instruct their electors to award all the state's
college votes to whichever candidate has carried the state, irrespective of
by what margin.
If no candidate gets the minimum 270 college votes needed for outright
victory, the 12th amendment to the constitution applies. Under that, the
House of Representatives elected in the November is to convene in January to
choose the next president from among the top three finishers in the
electoral college; this last happened in 1824. The new Senate meets
simultaneously to choose the next vice-president from the top two
running-mates.
The catch is that, although the 100 senators (two from each state) cast
individual votes, the House must decide on the basis of one vote for each
state delegation in its ranks. This puts Vermont, which has but one
congressman (and a socialist to boot), on a par with California, which has
52 members.
According to one lovely calculation by Mr Lloyd Cutler, lawyer
extraordinaire and White House counsel to President Carter, this could mean
that the 26 least populous states, with only 16 per cent of the national
population, could decide who will be president.
This system would appear at present to favour the Democrats, who have a
majority in 31 of the House delegations, compared to only 10 for the
Republicans, with the rest evenly divided and Mr Bernie Sanders representing
Vermont, assuming his re-election. But there could be a big shake-up in
November, even though the disappearance of the Democratic majority in either
chamber of Congress may be unlikely.
However, nobody knows under what rules House state caucuses would determine
who gets the single vote (simple majority? absolute majority? plurality?) or
whether indeed common rules would apply to all the states. Even if they did,
that might not help a state such as Maine, which now has one Democratic
congressman and one Republican, neither of whom might want to give way.
Mr Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, has pointed up the
extreme difficulty that individual Congress members could face. 'What if,'
he wrote in The New York Times, 'your district went for Perot, your state
went for Bush, and you are a Democrat?' The prospect of many state impasses
clearly exists.
In any event, somebody has to be sworn in as president, acting or permanent,
on Inauguration Day, January 20. If this were not to happen, then the
Senate's choice as vice-president 'shall act as president' until the House
has made up its mind. If both chambers are deadlocked, then the Speaker of
the House, by law, takes over in the interim, unless he has declined, in
which case the Secretary of State, if there is one, steps in.
These are the rules of the game, more or less. How it would play depends on
imponderables. Much would rest on the order in which the three candidates
had finished, by which time the third-placed running-mate would be out of
contention in any case. For sure, if Mr Clinton had finished a poor third,
it would be hard for a Democratic House to vote him in. But it might prefer
to hand the presidency to the independent Mr Ross Perot than to the
Republican Mr George Bush, regardless of who held the lead.
One of Mr Ornstein's scenarios posits a House deadlock, has Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey as Mr Clinton's running-mate, and assumes Mr Clinton
finishes second, not far behind Mr Bush. He cannot imagine the Senate, still
in Democratic hands and with public opinion behind it, ever preferring
Vice-President Quayle to the admirable Mr Bradley, who gets sworn in as
president pro tem - and then, when the House gives up the ghost, gets the
job.
Then again, under the divide-and-rule principle, the House might then elect
Mr Bush, producing the remarkable pairing of a Republican president and a
Democratic vice-president.
A variation in the USA Today newspaper has Mr Clinton ahead in the electoral
college and Mr Perot a poor third. The latter then endorses Mr Bush, but not
Mr Quayle, inducing the House to vote in Mr Bush and the Senate to go with
Mr Clinton's running-mate - or, if Mr Clinton finishes third and his
running-mate is thus out of it, the Senate, still baulking at Mr Quayle,
would choose Mr Perot's partner.
In all these variations, the fact that Mr Perot lacks a mainstream party
does not help, though it is increasing his appeal at present with the public
at large.
Underlying the whole game is the knowledge that nobody knows now who is
going to win in November and whether that victory will be enough. Such are
the delights of a three-horse race.
