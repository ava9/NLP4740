FT  18 AUG 92 / Presidential hopefuls take long view on prospects: The
Republican party's convention is a proving ground for those with ambitions
for 1996

WHATEVER happens in November, George Bush will not be the Republican party's
presidential nominee in 1996. This makes the Houston convention something of
a proving ground for those who have eyes on the prize four years from now,
writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Houston.
The list is long - very long for a party not known for great diversity of
opinion. But it can be divided conveniently into two: those not in Houston
or, if so, not much in evidence; and those jockeying for public exposure.
In the first category, naturally, are Mr James Baker, still secretary of
state until Sunday, and Mr Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence. Reflecting
the pressure of other business, with Iraq, and the tradition that these two
cabinet positions should be reasonably above partisan politics, neither will
address the convention, although Mrs Lynn Cheney will do so in her capacity
as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Also absent is Governor Pete Wilson of California, attending to his state's
budgetary crisis. He might, in any case, have found Houston uncomfortable,
given that he supports freedom of reproductive choice and that the party
platform is calling for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
The stakes are probably highest for those who have been given prominent
speaking roles. Chief among them are Vice-President Dan Quayle, Mr Jack
Kemp, the housing secretary, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, and Mr Pat
Buchanan, Mr Bush's erstwhile primary challenger.
Also very much in the frame and on the podium are Mr William Bennett, the
former education secretary, Mr Lamar Alexander, who now holds the job, and
at least four governors - Mr William Weld of Massachusetts, Mr Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina, Mr Pete du Pont of Delaware and Mr Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin.
And the last may not have been heard from the Rev Pat Robertson, the
television evangelist who made a run four year ago.
Some are obviously long shots for 1996. If Mr Quayle is defeated with Mr
Bush in November he will not be a contender. Even if he wins he can expect
to be challenged, if for no other reason than he stands in the way of Mr
Baker's presumed ambitions, not to mention some others on the right.
Nevertheless, Mr Quayle will be extremely visible this week, with a dozen
public appearances and his own acceptance speech on Thursday night. He knows
he is being compared unfavourably with Senator Al Gore, Mr Bill Clinton's
running mate, but he remains popular with conservatives.
It is on the right where the battle for succession is the hottest.
Mr Buchanan, an early convention speaker last night, has expressed an
interest in 1996 but recently underwent heart surgery and has, in any case,
probably been overtaken in the outsider conservative sweepstakes by the
likes of Mr Kemp.
The housing secretary - a conservative renegade within, and frequently
semi-detached from, the Bush cabinet - had to lobby even to be given a
speaking slot at the convention.
Having won his point by threatening to stay away, he is among the most
visible in Houston, pushing the cause of a more radical tax-cutting agenda
in a second Bush term.
Mr Bennett, among the most articulate conservative critics of the president,
is putting Mr Quayle's name in nomination tomorrow night, but, in the
opinion of those who know him, will use this speech as his own springboard.
Conservatives are also becoming increasingly attracted to Mr Weld of
Massachusetts. He fails two litmus tests - he supports both abortion and gay
rights - but his uncompromising fights with his state's Democratic
legislature over taxation go down well with the right.
The 'moderate' with most to gain and lose this week is Senator Gramm, whose
keynote address tonight will probably be the most important speech he gives.
First elected to Congress as a Democrat, he was co-author of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget act of 1986 which sought, and failed, to
control government spending.
Mr Gramm has an owlish demeanour, but, with a sharp tongue, is a formidable
debater; he has this week already criticised Mr Kemp for trying to force the
president's hand on economic policy. Although he is up for re-election in
1996, Texas law allows him to contest national and state elections
simultaneously and he has a Dollars 5m-plus (Pounds 2.6m) war chest left
over from his last campaign.
Except Messrs Quayle, Baker and Cheney, and possibly Mr Buchanan, none of
the above has enjoyed great national exposure. Even Mr Kemp, visible this
year in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, is a closed book to seven out of
10 Americans, according to a recent New York Times poll.
The convention offers all a chance to make a mark, and to be better known
among the faithful at the innumerable parties that sometimes seem to be the
real business of the week.
