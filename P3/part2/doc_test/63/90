  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today announced his plan to name three U.S. officials to 
be members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
  The nominees are John Shattuck, assistant secretary of 
defense for democracy, human rights and labor; Ashton Carter, 
assistant secretary of state for nuclear security and 
counter-proliferation and a former vice president of Harvard 
University; and Charles Meissner, assistant secretary of 
commerce for international economic policy, White House sources 
said. 
  Clinton also announced his plan to nominate Robert Pastor, a 
Latin American specialist at the Carter Center in Atlanta, to be 
U.S. ambassador to Panama. 
  Pastor, 47 and a university professor of political science, 
has been director of the center's Latin American and Caribbean 
program since 1986. 
  He has also served as executive secretary of the Council of 
Freely Elected Heads of Government, a group of 23 leaders in the 
Western Hemisphere, which has monitored elections in eight Latin 
American nations. 
  Pastor was director of Latin American and Caribbean affairs 
for the National Security Council during President Jimmy 
Carter's administration.
