flowing - Foreign stockbrokers and banks

WHILE most Japanese financial institutions are struggling to break even,
foreign banks and securities companies in Tokyo claim to be making a healthy
profit.
In some areas foreign institutions have benefited from the weakness of
domestic players. For example, foreign banks were able to increase lending
to blue-chip Japanese corporations as the domestic banks cut back on asset
growth. However, unlike their Japanese rivals, foreign banks and securities
firms have not pursued market share as a strategic objective. Many are now
reaping the benefits of strategies which emphasised high margins in favour
of high volume.
For example, foreign banks have never taken more than 3 per cent of the
corporate loans market in Japan. By the end of last year market share was
probably close to this historic high, but is now declining as foreign
bankers become more cautious about credit risk.
Bankers reject the suggestion that there is any problem gaining access to
the corporate loans market. 'There is business out there for any bank which
wants to lend,' commented Mr Gerard Jeannin, head of Tokyo operations for
Banque Indosuez, which has a corporate loans book of around Y250bn.
But foreign bankers agree that there is little money to be made directly
from lending to Japanese companies. Loans are made only where the borrower
is likely to buy other banking services: foreign exchange, treasury hedging
products and structured finance.
There is no syndicated loans market in Japan. The exact terms of loans
depend on the relationship between borrower and lender. However, bankers
said that good quality Japanese corporations were now paying 70-80 basis
points over interbank rates for medium-term loans - at least double the
levels of the late 1980s.
However, there are no commitment fees standard in the US and European
syndicated loans market. Return on capital remains relatively low.
Moreover, bankers said that lending margins had already peaked and were now
tightening slightly. As in the UK and US, demand for loan finance is subdued
as companies cut investment plans and liquidate financial assets.
In the securities markets, foreign firms have also avoided head-on
competition for high-volume business. Instead they have emphasised product
diversification, which in most cases is shorthand for building expertise in
futures, options and other derivative financial products. Over the past year
the strategy has been successful, particularly for firms which have made
aggressive use of their own balance sheets for index arbitrage.
In the six months to the end of September, the most profitable foreign
securities operations in Tokyo were Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Both firms are active users of the futures market for index arbitrage
trading.
Their results were only bettered by Nomura and Daiwa, the two giants of the
Japanese securities industry. For the full year the contrast in fortunes
will probably be even greater. All the big Japanese securities firms except
Nomura have forecast a deficit.
However, the contrast of styles and trading strategies has created
conflicting interests which threaten to sour relations as the Japanese
authorities cast around for ways to stimulate the financial markets.
Daily trading volume on the Tokyo stock exchange averaged fewer than 200m
shares in February. At the peak of the bull market in June 1988 trading
volume reached 1,770m shares a day.
Combined with lower commission charges, the total commission income of
brokers in Japanese equities may only be 20 per cent of the level of 1989.
Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director of Nomura, estimated cash
trading volume of 500m-700m shares a day is required for domestic market
participants to break even.
Recent moves to stimulate cash trading volume are likely to squeeze the
profitability of many foreign securities firms. In March, the authorities
increased futures commission charges on the Osaka securities exchange, where
the Nikkei 225 stock index future trades.
Mr Hideaki Yamashita, director of international affairs at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said futures commissions had been raised to iron out volatility in
the cash market caused by futures-related trading.
Up to 15 per cent of cash market transactions are now related to index
futures trading, which is concentrated in the Nikkei 225 contract. Cash
stocks are bought to hedge short positions taken through index futures,
holdings which are unwound as the futures contract expires. Cash volume on
the last day of the futures contract is often double the average. In a thin
market, these block trades can cause wide movements in the cash index.
The authorities hope that a reduction index futures trading will reduce
volatility and help to attract small investors back into the equity market.
This is seen as essential by domestic securities firms for trading volume to
be restored.
However, foreign firms argue that low trading volume and volatility are
factors of influences other than index arbitrage trading.
'The loss of political credibility and the possibility of panic selling are
the root causes of low trading volume,' commented Mr Bill Thompson, chairman
of Salomon Brothers Asia.
Foreign analysts readily admit the differential between cash and futures
market commissions is too wide. However, they argue cash commissions should
be liberalised to stimulate trading volume.
But there is little prospect of a further reduction or deregulation of cash
commissions while the domestic securities firms are facing a severe squeeze
on operating income.
In the absence of price competition on commissions, foreign securities firms
are trying to maintain profitability by other means. Active use of the
derivatives markets is one aspect of this.
Most foreign firms operating in Tokyo also cite the quality and objectivity
of their research as an important competitive advantage.
A recent poll of Japanese institutional investors by Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
the financial newspaper, ranked Mr Peter Tasker of Kleinwort Benson the top
equity market strategist.
