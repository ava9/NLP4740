FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally as pound strengthens

IMPRESSIVE performances from most of the world's bigger stock markets plus a
strong showing by sterling and and an improving outlook for international
interest rates brought a halt to six consecutive downside trading sessions
on London's equity market. Vague suggestions that a predator could be
constructing a sizeable takeover bid helped sentiment in some of the
so-called bid targets.
Adding to a generally optimistic mood in London was an exceptionally strong
performance by companies heavily involved in Hong Kong after it was
announced that the UK and Chinese governments are to resume talks on April
12 about the colony's elections scheduled for 1994/5.
The only disappointing aspect of an otherwise positive day on the London
market was the low level of actual business transacted as the market moved
back into action after the long Easter holiday break.
The FT-SE 100 index closed the session at 2,846.8, clawing back 25 points of
the 56.6 it had fallen over the previous six trading days. Another highlight
of the session was the outperformance by the 100-share index of the FT-SE
Mid 250 index which closed only 17 points up at 3,101.3.
The performances by the Wall Street and Tokyo markets during London's
closure over the holiday period ensured that London would open on a positive
note. Wall Street's 31-point rise on Monday and a much needed rally in the
US bond market after better than expected inflation news at the end of last
week, were viewed by London dealers as real boosters to market confidence.
So,too, was the Pounds 79bn package unveiled by the Japanese government
designed to kick-start the Japanese economy.
The Footsie 100 index opened more than two points higher and progressed
smoothly to reach the day's high, up 26.2 at 2,848.0, ahead of the opening
of Wall Street. Sterling's latest rise plus a reduction in one of the French
interest rate instruments prompted renewed talk that a cut in German
interest rates, and possibly another reduction in UK rates, may not be too
far away.
The latest UK economic data - producer price figures for March - announced
in mid-morning was much in line with estimates and had little impact on the
market. This morning will see the official figures on industrial output for
February while inflation figures for March are scheduled for Friday. A near
20-point jump on Wall Street shortly after the opening failed to produce
fireworks in London and the Footsie 100 index, after reaching the day's
high, moved narrowly for the rest of the session.
There were, however, a number of poor performing areas of the market with
the recently bruised and battered drug sector worst hit. A bearish report on
Glaxo in one of the leading US newspapers saw the shares retreat further
with matters hardly helped by news that US investors have been continuing to
lighten their holdings.
Water stocks, among the market's best performers over the past year, were
upset by press comment.
Dealers were relieved at the extent of the market's rally yesterday, but
pointed out that the Footsie was due for a substantial rise against a
backdrop of very positive news.
Turnover, always expected to be low, was 419.5m shares. The value of
customer business on Thursday was Pounds 1.06bn.
