EUROPEAN bond prices were volatile yesterday, as some markets came under
selling pressure from profit-takers, while others proved susceptible to
movements in the foreign exchange market.
Dealers said most markets had been ready for a correction after advancing
strongly recently. According to Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at SG Warburg,
10-year bond yields have fallen 40 basis points in Germany, 47 in France, 56
in the UK, and 136 in Italy since the beginning of July.
GILTS proved particularly turbulent as sterling came under pressure
following the release of a disappointing batch of economic data which showed
that manufacturing output fell 2.1 per cent in June and unemployment rose
for the first time since January.
The gilt future on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange (Liffe) opened half a point higher and rose to 113 1/2 before
declining rapidly. However, after hitting a low of 11 25/32 , it recovered
to end at 112 3/8 , more than a point down on the opening. Dealers said
there was technical support for the future at this level.
They said the declines were partly due to heavy profit-taking by domestic
institutions. The market has rallied strongly recently, advancing from 108
1/2 two weeks ago and 110 5/8 a week ago.
'The main risk to the gilts market is that overseas demand will dry up,'
said Mr Jonathon Davies, an analyst at UBS. Consequently, the weakness of
sterling is of concern, as foreign investors tend to buy gilts when they are
bullish on the currency as well as the bond market.
However, the Bank of England sold its latest gilt taps without apparent
difficulty.
FRENCH bond prices ended up about  1/4 point, while the French notional bond
future on the Matif in Paris closed at 122.82, up 0.18 point.
The market had reached a high of 122.88, close to its psychological target
of 123.00. However, once the future breaks through that level, it could lose
some of its impetus, analysts said.
It was announced that France's July provisional consumer price index rose a
seasonally-adjusted 0.1 per cent, to 0.2 per cent on the month. This was a
benign number for the market as tax changes had made little impact.
However, inflation is not the current worry for the French market: of more
concern was the pressure on the franc, and fears the government might see
any currency weakness as a reason to delay rate cuts.
The market was hoping for little fresh encouragement from an address by
prime minister Edouard Balladur on French television last night.
'The general stance seems to be to talk tough and ease rates quietly,' one
analyst said.
AFTER rallying strongly in the morning on surprisingly good inflation
figures, US bond prices dropped into negative territory later in the day
following a disappointing auction of 30-year bonds.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 109
(a swing of almost  3/4 of a point from the morning's high), yielding 6.438
per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 11/32 , to
yield 4.049 per cent.
Longer-dated prices surged after the commerce department announced its index
of producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in July. Analysts had been expecting a
modest increase in the PPI. The 'core' measure of inflation, which excludes
the volatile food and energy components, was also unexpectedly weak,
registering only a 0.1 per cent increase last month.
Even the most bullish of inflation forecasters were surprised by the data,
and there was heavy buying of bonds.
All of the early gains, however, were wiped out when dealers marked down
prices in an attempt to clear their books of the new supply of bonds bought
in the 30-year auction. Demand for the Dollars 11bn in new bonds was
unexpectedly weak, and the issue was sold at an average yield of 6.33 per
cent.
GERMAN bond prices ended virtually unchanged after an unusually volatile
session, when the trading range widened to 40 basis points.
The bund future closed at 97.42, having reached a high of 97.63. However,
the future is now heading into new territory, and it there may be some
resistance to the market breaking through to new highs, without some sign of
action to ease rates.
IN Japan, the yen reached new highs, fuelling speculation that an interest
rate cut was on the way, as the Bank of Japan eased conditions in the money
market.
Bond prices rallied more than half a point, and the benchmark No 145
government bond yield breached the psychological 4 per cent barrier to end
at 3.97 per cent.
ITALIAN bonds again out-performed other markets, as dealers continued to
reassess their views on the market, now widely viewed as having been heavily
oversold.
Dealers said the currency was holding up reasonably well, and more positive
sentiment on the inflation outlook is fuelling foreign interest in the
market. Ten-year Italian bond prices rose a further 3/4 point, but yields
are approaching the 10 per cent level, which could provide resistance.
However, Italy and Spain are now the only mainstream European markets
offering 10-year yields above 8 per cent.
