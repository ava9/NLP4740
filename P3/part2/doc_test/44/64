FT  11 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Amway sparks interest in global Japanese
issues - International offerings

Last month's global offering by Amway Japan, the Japanese arm of the US home
care products group, attracted a wide range of international buyers. As the
first international offering by a Japanese company for more than two years,
the deal has sparked interest in global issues among other Japanese
companies.
A well-known name, a stable profits record and extensive presentations to
investors have been attributed as the ingredients for the deal's success.
But securities houses point out there has recently been clear interest in
Japanese issues among international investors in the UK, Europe and Hong
Kong.
Many Japanese companies have now begun to look to overseas equity markets
for funds. According to the ministry of finance, net purchases of Japanese
stocks by overseas investors totalled a record Dollars 46.7bn during the
year ended March, an eight-fold rise over the previous year.
'We know of several Japanese companies currently looking at global deals as
a means of fundraising,' said an official at Morgan Stanley Japan.
With domestic institutions increasingly restrained in their investment risks
following sharp falls in unrealised investment profits, international
investors are likely to be wooed all the harder by leading Japanese
companies.
Earlier this month Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the country's partially
privatised telecommunications operator, announced it was applying to list on
the London and New York stock exchanges to enhance its profile among the
global financial community.
Although the listings themselves are not directly linked to a
capital-raising programme, it has given the ministry of finance, which still
owns two-thirds of NTT, the option to offer its holdings on the two markets.
Smaller Japanese companies are also trying to increase their appeal to
international investors. Overseas investors bought a net Dollars 4.17bn in
over-the-counter stocks last year, 3.6 times that of the previous year. Many
investors have picked up Japanese OTC shares with strong growth potential as
a part of their emerging market portfolios.
The increase in initial public offerings following the ministry of finance's
lifting of restrictions earlier this year, has also helped boost investments
in OTC companies.
Thomas Norton Associates, a US investment researching company specialising
in Japanese OTC stocks, which is organising a seminar introducing the
founders and presidents of Japanese over-the-counter companies to US fund
managers, said interest from both companies and investors has been high.
At the same time, analysts point out that some of the Japanese OTC companies
are looking to list on the US Nasdaq exchange to widen their capital-raising
abilities.
But in Japan, the domestic public offerings market remains tightly regulated
by the ministry of finance. The concept of pre-announcements or roadshows
does not exist, and investors looking for information are largely hedged in
bureaucracy.
Foreign investment houses point out the difficulty in selling shares in bulk
due to restrictions which limit the number an investor can acquire in a
public offering. Such regulations increase the risk for underwriters.
The restrictions, say foreign investment banks, pose a threat to Tokyo's
status as a leading financial centre.
Japanese companies have long raised capital on overseas bond markets as a
result of the tightly regulated domestic market. It may not be long before a
similar trend develops within global equity markets.
