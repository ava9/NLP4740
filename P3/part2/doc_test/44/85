It is unfortunate that in the rush to offer economic advice to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, so little is heard from Japan. After
all, Japan's post-Second World War economic performance puts most
industrialised nations to shame.
With its industry destroyed and cities ravaged, Japan was in 1945 in a worse
economic condition than the ex-communist states are today. Some European and
US experts judged recovery would take generations. Yet by the 1964 Tokyo
Olympics, Japan was already on the way to becoming an economic superpower.
Moreover, Japan employed economic policies which differed significantly from
those of Europe and North America. Japan put less faith than the west in
market forces and more trust in government intervention. Russians and east
Europeans are in danger of ignoring this experience. So is the International
Monetary Fund, which is co-ordinating western economic aid for the
ex-communist states.
Russians and eastern Europeans naturally find it easier to consult Americans
and western Europeans than Asians. Westerners are closer, geographically and
culturally. Many Japanese find Russia and eastern Europe remote and their
complex political heritage difficult to understand. Also, the territorial
dispute between Japan and Russia casts a shadow over any dialogue between
Tokyo and Moscow.
Japanese officials have in the past been diffident about offering economic
advice to other countries. Partly, this reflects a lack of intellectual
self-confidence vis-a-vis westerners. Partly, officials have been reluctant
to emphasise the unique points of Japanese economic development, especially
government intervention. They have usually preferred to discuss the role of
free markets and other similarities between Japan and the west.
However, the Japanese economic establishment is coming out of its shell. As
Japan's overseas aid has grown, so has officials' willingness to direct the
way the money is spent. Over the past year, Japanese officials have been
involved in increasingly frank exchanges with the IMF and the World Bank.
Japanese officials have questioned the US-influenced institutions' espousal
of free markets as an economic panacea and suggested a more interventionist
approach. In response, the World Bank has launched studies of Japanese
development.
But nothing Japanese officials have done so far has been as timely as the
two reports its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
presented this year to the Russian authorities. The first describes Miti's
approach to economic development and the specific policies Japan followed
from 1945 to the mid-1960s. The second analyses Russia's economic
predicament and prescribes a policy.
Miti's researchers see as a good starting point the advice offered by the
IMF which Russia has accepted as a condition of receiving the Dollars 24bn
(Pounds 12.5bn) aid promised by the Group of Seven industrialised countries.
The programme commits Moscow to cutting government subsidies, reducing money
supply growth, and introducing a freely-convertible currency. Miti's
researchers also support the IMF's views on the need for large-scale
deregulation and privatisation.
But Miti's researchers believe this does not go far enough. They would like
the plan supplemented with a Japanese-style 'priority industry' policy. Just
as the Japanese government favoured the coal and steel industries in the
late 1940s with special credits and other measures, so Russia should pick a
priority industry.
Miti researchers say the favoured industry should be oil, because the
industry can quickly become internationally competitive and earn foreign
exchange; investment would lead to the import of high-quality technology;
and it would benefit other domestic industries such as steelmaking.
The reports recommend government support for oil production, including
government-financed loans. But they warn the industry must not be allowed to
export its output in an untrammelled way - for fear of starving domestic
consumers of oil and prompting inflation. The papers advise Moscow to impose
export quotas and/or tax oil exports and use the proceeds to subsidise
domestic consumption.
The reports say introducing price liberalisation and competition is of
utmost importance, So is encouraging entrepreneurship. But in Russia price
mechanisms barely function; and capitalist culture has been suppressed
during 70 years of communism. So, some market-oriented government
intervention could help. It may be particularly necessary to avoid a sudden
collapse in output which might bring rapid abolition of government
subsidies.
Mr Hiroya Tanigawa, one of the reports' authors, says: 'In our view it's
difficult for developing countries' industries to follow market signals only
. . . The example of many Asian countries shows government intervention can
be successful in economic development.'
Mr Tanigawa and his colleagues admit there are huge differences between
Japan and Russia, not least the fact that the Japanese trust their
bureaucrats and Russians do not. But they believe the Russians may have no
choice. 'Our basic stance is in stark contrast with the IMF Memorandum
(reform plan), which thinks that macroeconomic stability will be brought
about before long. We believe that the macroeconomic stabilisation will take
rather a long time (about five years) and that some strategic industrial
policies need to be taken in this transitional period.'
Mr Tanigawa says he and his colleagues had a sympathetic hearing in Moscow
even though the eventual plan adopted owed little to their advice. Miti's
ideas also went largely unheard in eastern Europe.
However, in east Asia it is a different matter. South Korea has in the last
30 years copied many features of economic development from Japan. So has
Taiwan. Today, it is China's turn. Mr Tanigawa, who recently gave a lecture
at Beijing University, says: 'China is modelling itself on Japan very
eagerly.'
The Chinese language has been chosen for the first foreign translation of a
17-volume history of Miti and Japan's post-war development. Just a
one-volume summary will be published in English and nothing at all in
Russian.
