Four questions hang over the developed world's investment outlook for 1994.
What will happen to US interest rates? Is Germany really on its way out of
recession? Will Japan's deflation take the economy into a black hole? And
what does the future hold for China?
Answering these questions is easy. The tricky thing is estimating when the
answers take effect.
Thus, I can say with complete confidence that US interest rates have seen
their lows, and will move higher. Germany will recover from recession, and
when it does, its economy will look much healthier than now seems possible.
Japan's deflation will end short of a melt-down of the financial system, and
will give way to a period of sustained growth, thanks to wide-ranging
economic and social restructuring. And China will become the world's
industrial powerhouse.
But when?
America first
The US story illustrates how hard it is to spot the end of a trend.
Long-term US interest rates peaked at roughly 8 1/2 per cent in 1990, and
fell steadily till they brushed the 6 per cent level last autumn. Since then
they have risen slightly. Short-term rates, also down to historically low
levels, have not yet shown any signs of moving upwards.
At some point, the interest rate cycle will turn. European analysts
generally think that, for long-term US rates, the turning point was last
autumn. US analysts tend to think that the small run-up in yields since the
autumn is a false signal, soon to be reversed.
This phase of the interest rate cycle still has a good few quarters to run,
they say.
The pessimistic view would have you out of the US treasury market now,
looking for bonds with a better chance of capital appreciation, such as
Europe's high-yielders. The optimistic view would keep you in treasuries to
profit from the reversal of the autumn's run-up in rates.
The outlook for short rates is subject to equally conflicting views. The
fourth quarter seems to have been a period of strong economic growth, though
we will have to wait till Friday's payroll and unemployment numbers to be
sure. Inflation is still quiescent, though, and Thursday's money supply data
are unlikely to pose any immediate threat.
Still, the Federal Reserve will probably start easing short-term rates
higher by spring. By how much?
If the Fed plans a speedy return to traditional real interest rates, US
short-term money could soon be anything up to 2 1/2 percentage points
dearer, with much of the rise occurring this year. That would trigger a
wholesale rush by individual investors back into savings instruments,
leaving this year's favourites, bond and equity funds, looking badly mauled.
If rise in rates is largely symbolic, to show the Fed's determination to
keep inflation down, short-term rates are likely to be no more than half a
point higher by year-end. Individual investors will still find almost
anywhere a better home for their savings than banks and money funds. And any
fresh bond rally would be helped by the realisation that the Fed is keeping
a watchful eye on inflation.
The balance of probabilities suggests that long-term rates have seen their
lows for the cycle, but that the rise in short-term rates will be slower
than the pessimists fear. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, is a master of
gradualism. US rates, at both ends of the yield curve, are likely to be
higher in December than they are now - but only a little higher.
Germany's challenge
Just before Christmas, Germany's economy presented a similar clash of views.
The optimists - mostly inside Germany - argued that the recession was, in
statistical terms, already over. Growth, still faltering, would resume
solidly from the middle of the year. The pessimists saw a further
contraction in the first part of 1994, with little sign of recovery before
year-end.
Since then, a fierce confidence offensive by the optimists - especially by
Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister - has swayed opinion their way.
From the point of view of Germany's equity market, this debate is all rather
academic. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, predicted a strong
rally among German blue chips in 1993, on the back of lower interest rates
expectations, high liquidity, completion of the Gatt talks and so on. He got
it, in spades. The 47 per cent rise in the Dax index in 1993 understates the
performance of some of the biggest companies: Mannesmann rose 86 per cent,
Deutsche Babcock rose 83 per cent, Volkswagen, despite its legal wrangle
with Opel, rose 82 per cent.
Mr Frahm is still positive about 1994, but the challenge for Germany -
political worries apart - is to manage the shift from a liquidity-driven
market to an earnings-driven one. He thinks this shift will start in the
autumn, round about the time he expects the economy to pick up. He does not
necessarily expect the market to make the transition smoothly, predicting a
hiccup for share prices before investors focus on the much happier profit
outlook for 1995.
That view, and the Dax's performance in recent months, both assume that the
German economy is heading, sometime this year, into a normal cyclical
recovery. If, instead, 1994 is as unhappy a year for the average citizen as
1993, then the voters will have every opportunity to show their distress:
there are 20 national, European and regional elections this year. The timing
of Germany's recovery is perhaps more critical than the stock market's
insouciance suggests.
Japan's new consensus
Calling the bottom in the Japanese economic cycle is just as hard. Quite
apart from the still-not-properly digested effects of the 1980s bubble,
Japan faces a structural issue. If German output is threatened by the
millions of eastern European workers starting to be unleashed on the market
system, Japan's is threatened by the growth of south-east Asia as the
workshop of the world. Like Germany, Japan has been over-reliant on
manufacturing.
Change is coming in both countries. Germany's private sector is responding
faster than the public sector; in Japan, the reverse may be true. Large
Japanese companies seem frozen by the crisis, unable to believe that
manufacturing excellence alone is not enough.
The new Japanese government, despite its inherent weakness, is making a
bolder stab at facing up to the new realities. The governmental paralysis in
Tokyo - a prime cause of the stock market's dreadful performance in late
1993 - may in fact be preparing the way for the emergence of a new
political/bureaucratic consensus. That is only part of the precondition for
another stock market boom; some sign that corporate Japan is also embracing
a new era is also required. Optimists will be watching for the first
indications of both in 1994; either would be better news than the market was
able to count on in 1993.
China's myths
US investors were buying foreign equities at the rate of Dollars 2bn a week
in the third quarter of last year, according to figures released yesterday
by the Securities Industry Association. That's the equivalent, during the
quarter, of all the shares available for purchase by foreigners in the
Barings indices for Chile, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Much of the money went into Asia's soaring equities, analysed in more detail
by Alexander Nicoll later in this section. But investors are attracted to
the region not just because of the rapid growth of the south-east Asian
tigers. Arguably a more powerful attraction, not for the first time this
century, is the lure of China.
Its vast population enables anyone with a calculator that will handle
billions to create fantasies of infinite growth. As the Lancashire textile
barons said during their slump at the turn of the century: if every Chinaman
added a foot to his shirt-length, there would be enough work to keep the
mills of Oldham humming forever. (That, of course, was before the mills of
Oldham were replaced by the mills of Guangdong.)
Up till now, western investors have had to buy into this proposition by
proxy. But the most significant development of the turn of the year was the
announcement of China's new unified exchange rate for the yuan, an important
step on the road towards conventional portfolio investment in China.
As it gradually becomes possible to invest there directly, instead of
through proxies, China will move out of the realms of myth and become a
straightforward investment proposition. That will help it to become, as it
surely will, the main force for economic growth sometime in the 21st
century.
Getting there won't be easy, however: there is every sign, for example, that
the current growth rate will provoke another overheating crisis sometime in
the next 18 months. Opening up China to real investment will expose
investors directly to the risks, as well as the rewards, of a giant economy
growing at breakneck speed. It will make investing in the rest of the
Pacific Rim a bit more exciting, too.
Shiny new ritual
The City's army of monetary economists have always lacked the sense of
occasion created by the regular meetings of the Fed's Open Market Committee
and the Bundesbank Council. Until now. The new sort-of-semi-independent
status of Bank of England means that, in theory, monetary policy will be
settled at the monthly meetings of the governor and the chancellor of the
exchequer. The Bank will then be free to implement any changes at a time of
its choosing, but before the next meeting.
The two next meet on January 12. Expect a flurry of excitement before each
meeting, and an orgy of anticipation afterwards as the markets wait to see
what, if anything, was decided.
But what's to stop the chancellor picking up the telephone any day he
chooses?
