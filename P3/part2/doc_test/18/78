<P>
As the standoff in the Middle East reaches a tense new high point, 
Administration officials and intelligence analysts are focusing their thoughts 
and resources on one urgent question: What will Saddam Hussein do next? 
</P>
<P>
As it struggles for answers, the Bush Administration is relying heavily on U.S. 
spy satellites and a fleet of reconnaissance planes to peer into Iraq on 
top-secret missions, snapping photographs and scanning electronic transmissions 
for sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence experts warn, however, that a vital complement -- spies on the 
ground to relay close-up observations -- remains missing from American 
capacities, leaving the United States with a potentially dangerous blind spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to rely on technology and gadgetry," said Ray S. Cline, a former 
deputy CIA director. "The real problem is looking into the hearts and minds of 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
In crises like the current one, he added, "We always start too late." 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence gap is a hangover from an overnight shift in focus for the 
United States, away from traditional Communist adversaries and toward one it 
previously had found little need to penetrate. It is also a product of Iraq's 
closed society and intense secrecy, which allow little room for what one 
official called "paleface spies" to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Hamstrung, U.S. policy-makers and Pentagon planners are hoping that hints of 
Hussein's intentions will be telegraphed in movements they can hear or see from 
afar -- the movements of tanks, the angle of missiles, the burst of sensitive 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
In comments this week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, expressed confidence that U.S. intelligence would be "adequate." He 
said the United States had "an extremely good picture of what the situation 
looks like on the ground north of the Kuwaiti-Saudi border." 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, a high-ranking military source disclosed that intelligence 
reports had allowed Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central 
Command, to warn the Joint Chiefs of the impending Iraqi invasion about six 
days before it occurred. Schwarzkopf was able to accurately predict both the 
timing and magnitude of the assault, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Other military experts agreed that satellites and spy planes would probably 
give ample warning of a conventional Iraqi military attack, even if 
surface-to-surface Scud missiles were the weapon chosen. About 12 to 24 hours' 
warning of a military action could be expected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But they expressed concern that the lack of on-the-ground insight leaves the 
United States vulnerable to less visible developments, including planning for 
possible terrorist attacks. Even more pressing, warned John Pike, an expert on 
high-tech espionage: "All that hardware in space is not going to do much good 
in keeping track of American hostages." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials refused to provide details about the "sources and 
methods" used by the the United States in the current crisis. "If there's ever 
a time when you need to hold it under wraps, it's now," warned Lt. Gen. William 
C. Odom, a former director of the National Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable experts outside government said, however, that the array of 
hardware now devoted to the Middle East crisis includes advanced satellites and 
planes capable of tracking virtually any movement or broadcast in Iraq and 
occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Magnum satellite, which intercepts electronic signals from its 
fixed position 22,000 miles over the Mideast, apparently is doing nothing but 
monitoring Iraqi developments 24 hours a day, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, at least four Keyhole photo reconnaissance satellites were 
understood to be making frequent passes over the region to survey the landscape 
with cameras capable of reading a license plate from an altitude of 200 to 500 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to land, sophisticated eavesdropping aircraft known as RC-135 Rivet 
Joints are making frequent forays along the Kuwaiti border, experts said, while 
high-flying TR-1s and more conventional F-4s peer hundreds of miles into Iraq 
from Saudi airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Although cloud cover in much of the world can thwart such monitoring, the 
experts said the constant desert sunshine is an intelligence planner's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about the Middle East is that you don't have to worry about 
clouds," said Michael Dunn, a private consultant who runs International 
Estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Images gathered by the planes and satellites are almost instantaneously relayed 
to the National Photographic Interpretation Center in Washington, where they 
are examined by Navy analysts armed with a "watch list" of sites at which small 
variations could mean big things. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most closely evaluated indicators of possible Iraqi intentions, the 
experts said, are Scud missile batteries, where a change in the angle of a 
missile could betray preparations for launch, and the deployment of forces 
along national frontiers, who might move from entrenched positions to more 
mobile ones. 
</P>
<P>
If one of the indicators, updated every few hours by a new satellite flyover, 
sets off analysts' alarms, "a copy could be on the President's desk within an 
hour after the picture was taken," said Pike, head of policy for the 
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic signals, gathered by Magnum and Vortex satellites from radio 
broadcasts, radar operations and walkie-talkie transmissions, are similarly 
relayed to Washington for analysis. With computers at the National Security 
Agency in Ft. Meade, Md., homing in on key frequencies, the intercepts can 
provide clues about the locations of Hussein and his key deputies, the experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts wearing headphones in the roving RC-135s, flying 
along the Kuwaiti border, are believed to have developed in the last two weeks 
what one source called an "electronic order of battle" by mapping and 
intercepting most Iraqi military communications. 
</P>
<P>
As tensions mount, the effort has enabled the airborne analysts to monitor 
crucial command facilities to detect any increase in military activities. In 
the event of war, it could guide an electronic jamming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the experts warned that the U.S. interception capability in Iraq is 
probably limited to communications that are broadcast in the atmosphere. 
Without help on the ground, telephone conversations and private discussions 
within a single room remain out of reach of American analysts. 
</P>
<P>
And without confirmation from human sources -- which intelligence analysts have 
always regarded as the most accurate -- even the powerful "eyes in the sky" 
sometimes leave analysts wondering. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said the United States was left frustrated earlier last 
week, as Iraqi forces withdrew from the Iranian border, by its inability to 
discover what had happened to a particular elite unit. "We lost them for a few 
days," the source acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to compensate for its deficiencies in Iraq, the United States is 
believed to be relying largely on friendly intelligence agencies, particularly 
the Israeli Mossad, which is reported to have had considerable success in 
penetrating the country. 
</P>
<P>
While better than nothing, such dependence is regarded by analysts as 
dangerous, in part because of the potential for political bias or manipulation.
