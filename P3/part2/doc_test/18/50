FT  25 MAY 93 / S Korean military chief sacked

SOUTH Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday sacked the chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff in a continuing purge of the military under the new
civilian government.
In his first three months in office, Mr Kim has replaced many senior
commanders in an attempt to impose firm civilian control over the military,
which ruled the country for the past 32 years.
Most of those dismissed have been army officers who are members of the
Hanahoe (One Mind) society, which plotted the last coup in 1979 and includes
the two previous presidents, Mr Chun Doo-hwan and Mr Roh Tae-woo. Hanahoe
consists of the graduates from the Korean military academy in the 1950s.
In what is regarded as a move to reduce the influence of the army, the
biggest and most powerful service, Mr Kim appointed the air force chief, Gen
Lee Yang-ho, as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to replace Gen
Lee Pil-sup of the army. The position has previously been held only by army
generals.
The appointment of the air force chief may also be an attempt by Mr Kim to
make amends to the junior services after the recent arrest of a dozen air
force and navy officers on corruption charges including bribery to obtain
senior commands.
The air force and navy complained they were being unfairly punished, since
Mr Kim was ignoring suspected cases of corruption in the army.
The corruption charges have threatened to damage severely relations between
Mr Kim and the military when tensions are growing with North Korea over its
suspected nuclear weapons programme.
Mr Kim then tried to improve ties with the military by cancelling plans to
prosecute the officers for corruption, although they were dismissed from the
service.
The current purge, however, has support within the military, particularly
among younger officers who have seen their chances for promotion blocked by
the older generation affiliated with the former military dictatorship.
