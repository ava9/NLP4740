Former US president Jimmy Carter yesterday entered a fourth session of talks
with Haiti's military rulers, as senior US government officials in
Washington insisted that his mission was authorised only to agree the
departure of the ruling three-man junta.
There were persistent reports from the Haitian side that Lt Gen Raoul
Cedras, the army chief, was demanding that Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
Haitian president ousted in the 1991 coup, agree to step down as a condition
for the junta's capitulation.
Other reports said that General Philippe Niamby, the army chief of staff,
was holding out against leaving, but that Lt Cedras and Lt Col Michel
Francois, the police chief, were resigned to exile. President Carlos Menem
of Argentina yesterday said he was prepared to offer asylum if the junta
left before any invasion.
As the US delegation, which also includes Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and
retired General Colin Powell, former head of the joint chiefs of staff, was
in talks at the Haitian military's headquarters in Port-au-Prince, a US
presidential jet stood ready to whisk them back to Washington.
Mr Carter briefed President Bill Clinton by telephone on Saturday night, as
did Gen Powell early yesterday. This encouraged the White House to say the
discussions were 'serious and constructive', with officials emphasising that
there was no US desire to humiliate the junta beyond their forced departure.
But Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, and Mr William Perry, defence secretary, all said in
television interviews that the junta must go. 'There is no practical way
they can stay after they step down,' Mr Perry said.
Officials stressed that the return of Mr Aristide was non-negotiable,
especially after his agreement last week not to contest presidential
elections scheduled for December 1995.
Asked if merely moving across the border to the Dominican Republic was an
option, Mr Perry replied: 'We have not yet specified which country they
could go to - but that might be under discussion right now' in
Port-au-Prince.
It emerged at the weekend that Mr Clinton decided to send the Carter mission
only after Thursday night's televised address in which he had demanded that
the junta leave.
Mr Panetta said the final decision was taken jointly by Mr Clinton and Mr
Carter but he denied that 'this last-minute effort for peace' had been
opposed by some administration members. However, the decision was
interpreted in Washington as further evidence that Mr Clinton is still
deeply ambivalent about ordering an invasion.
