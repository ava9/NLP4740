on opposition to cuts in Reserves

WHEN Mr Richard Cheney, the US secretary of defence, announced detailed
plans to cut 234,000 troops from the Reserves and National Guard over the
next five years, he stepped into a congressional hornets' nest.
Mr Cheney has been trying for three years, with severely limited success, to
persuade Congress that it must allow him to cut reserve troop strengths in
line with the 25 per cent reduction in overall force structure that he is
trying to carry out.
But the reservists bring formidable firepower to bear: their National Guard
component is organised state by state and falls under the authority of the
state governors unless it is activated by the US president.
Led by Congressman Sonny Montgomery, a retired major general in the
Mississippi National Guard, Congress has resisted making the cuts sought by
the Defence Department and reduced spending in other areas of defence.
'In 1989 when we asked, they said no. In 1990 when we asked, they said no.
In 1991 when we asked, they said okay, you can have half of what you asked
for. Just because Congress says no doesn't mean it's a bad idea,' Mr Cheney
said, arguing that the cuts he proposes would save Dollars 20bn (Pounds
11.5bn) over the next five years.
US military strategy for the past 20 years closely integrated the reserves
into a Total Force designed to head off a Warsaw Pact attack in central
Europe, but the collapse of the Soviet Union has changed both the size and
the type of military forces needed. General Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, argues that he must be allowed to reduce the reserves
along with the rest of the forces.
The proposed cuts would affect 830 Reserve and National Guard units, and no
state would emerge unscathed. Army units would bear the brunt of the cuts,
with much smaller cuts in naval and air force reserves. "I'd like to keep
every single one of them,' Gen Powell said, 'but I can't make that case. The
geostrategic situation has changed in the world, and the fiscal situation
has changed in the world.'
The core of congressional hostility to the proposals is the financial and
social importance of National Guard armories to local economies. "A local
armory of 150 persons has a payroll of about Dollars 2m a year,' Mr
Montgomery says. "By closing over 800 armories around the country you are
certainly not helping us get out of the recession. These armories are the
community centre, and these armories are really the best support that the
active forces have.'
But as Congress continues to demand a bigger 'peace dividend', the Reserves
may also have to suffer. "The Congress cannot have it both ways,' Mr Cheney
says. 'They cannot tell us we have to cut the defence budget, and then
object every time we move to cut the defence budget.'
The Reserves have a chequered history. US presidents have often been
reluctant to call them up, and when they have, the Reserves have often been
reluctant to respond, according to a study of the Army Guard and Reserve by
Mr Martin Binkin and Mr William Kaufmann of the Brookings Institution.
Their mobilisation before the US entered World War Two and during the Korean
War provoked grumbling in the ranks and rancour in Congress. Partly as a
consequence, when the US began to build up its involvement in Vietnam,
President Lyndon Johnson decided not to call up the reserves and to rely on
conscription. The National Guard became a paradoxical haven for those who
wanted to avoid the war - such as Vice President Dan Quayle.
After the Vietnam War, the function, equipment and training of the Reserves
were substantially upgraded as they were integrated into the new Total Force
strategy. Reserve and National Guard units became increasingly
indispensable, with the Reserves providing most of the armed forces'
capability in fields such as transport, supply and medical services. Some
functions, like water purification, are entirely carried out by reserve
units.
New legislation gave the president the power to call up reserve units for up
to 180 days without congressional authorisation, although this power was not
used before the 1990 Gulf mobilisation. In 1987, for example, six naval
reserve minesweepers were deployed to the Gulf; most of their reserve crew
members were left behind.
However, if the Gulf war provided the first sustained test for the Reserves,
the lessons are mixed. Mr Cheney feels obliged to say that the 231,000
reservists called up 'once again proved that they are an absolutely
indispensable part of America's military force.' Certainly, the perception
that the Pentagon is brutally laying off the heroes of Desert Storm has made
the issue of reserve cuts even more sensitive.
Logistical units, as well as two field artillery brigades, were deployed in
Saudi Arabia, but the army found that infantry and armoured reserve units
were far from combat-ready. General Gordon Sullivan, the army chief of
staff, now estimates that he needs as much as a year to get a reserve
division up to full combat readiness, much longer than had been postulated
under Total Force thinking.
It is argued that this kind of delay might be enough to face a resurgent
threat from a power such as Russia, but it is inadequate to meet a sudden
crisis, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
In the meantime, Mr Cheney faces a hard struggle to overcome congressional
opposition to these cuts. The recognition is spreading, however, that it is
hard to cut the defence budget much further without also cutting reserve
strengths, and this may be the year that his argument will prevail.
