U.S. TENTATIVELY PLANS BOOST IN PANAMA FORCES

<P>
President Bush, responding to a rash of political violence in Panama and 
harassment of U.S. servicemen there, has tentatively decided to boost the U.S. 
military presence by sending as many as 3,000 additional troops to the troubled 
nation, Administration officials said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed that no final 
decisions had been made and that the President will review the deployment, as 
well as other options, with congressional leaders who have been summoned to 
meet with him at the White House this morning. The sources commented before 
Panamanian government officials announced late Wednesday that the results of 
Sunday's election would be nullified because of fraud by the opposition and 
U.S. interference. The White House had no immediate statement on the Panamanian 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, President Bush's decision was based on half a dozen 
incidents involving U.S. service personnel and was intended to insure the 
protection of U.S. citizens in Panama. Among the incidents were the arrests of 
two U.S. defense attaches -- later released -- and three reservists on 
Wednesday and, a night earlier, the beating of a Navy enlisted man by suspected 
pro-Noriega forces. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in Washington was made at the end of a day that saw the unrest in 
Panama escalating in the wake of what has been almost universally condemned as 
a fraudulent election and the refusal of the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega 
to recognize the victory of opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Servicemen Harassed 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the Pentagon ordered all U.S. military personnel in Panama 
to remain on base or in their homes because of growing violence in the streets 
of Panama City and harassment of U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Acting within minutes after Panamanian paramilitary forces physically attacked 
Endara during an anti-government demonstration, the Pentagon increased its 
alert status for the 10,000 U.S. troops plus an equal number of dependents in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Endara during the afternoon in Panama City also led to a late 
afternoon meeting between Bush and his national security adviser, Brent 
Scowcroft, and a telephone conversation between Bush and U.S. Ambassador Arthur 
Davis in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House meeting, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, reportedly argued strongly that in the absence of further 
provocations of U.S. military personnel or their dependents, there should be no 
increase in the size of the U.S. force in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Uncalled For, Unneeded' 
</P>
<P>
"It's uncalled for, unneeded at this point, just additional ammunition for 
Noriega to use to his advantage," said a senior military official. The official 
added that the 10,000 "very capable" U.S. troops already in Panama are 
sufficient to cope with the current threat to them. 
</P>
<P>
But Crowe, expressing the opinions of the nation's senior military officers, 
appeared to back a response, in which an escalation in harassment of U.S. 
forces or their dependents could result in the introduction of additional 
security troops. 
</P>
<P>
But on the basis of Davis' report, Administration officials said, the President 
decided tentatively to take the steps that could lead to the deployment of a 
brigade of 2,000 to 3,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Should the troops be called up, they would be culled from a number of 
divisions, government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard, however, stressed Wednesday night that no U.S. 
troops outside Panama had been called up or put on alert. In March and April, 
1988, responding to what it called "the potential for increased threats to U.S. 
citizens and interests in Panama," the Reagan Administration dispatched about 
1,800 fresh troops to Panama. The troops consisted mostly of police forces and 
a helicopter task force that could move U.S. troops quickly in case of an 
attack on the Panama Canal or on U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the force was a 300-man rifle company from Ft. Ord, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Before reaching his tentative decision to boost the U.S. military presence in 
Panama, Bush called the attack on Endara one of a series of "blatant attempts 
at intimidation" by the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
Bush tried to reach Endara by telephone late Wednesday afternoon but could not 
get through, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. Bush asked 
Ambassador Davis to contact Endara "to commend him for his strength in standing 
up to the Noriega forces." 
</P>
<P>
Bush once again accused Noriega of conducting a "fraudulent election" that 
seems designed to deny democratically won power to the general's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"He has now escalated this to include violence against opposition leaders 
including Mr. Endara," Bush said. "This action underscores that Gen. Noriega 
does not have the interests of the Panamanian people at heart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Options Considered 
</P>
<P>
The attack increased the urgency with which U.S. senior policy-makers were 
weighing steps to react to Sunday's election in Panama. Officials have said 
that the Administration was considering a number of actions, from economic 
sanctions to military force, to back up demands that Noriega step down. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has contacted several Latin American leaders seeking their support for 
sanctions against Noriega, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher kept up the Administration's public 
criticism of the Panamanian regime: "Having failed to rig the election in 
advance, Noriega is now doing everything he can to steal it after the fact 
despite the clear message from the people of Panama." But Boucher refused to 
discuss action that the United States might take. 
</P>
<P>
American military personnel in Panama were advised Wednesday afternoon to stay 
out of all public areas except for essential business and to remain on U.S. 
military facilities until further notice. The warning -- code-named "Personnel 
Movement Limitation Charlie" -- is the second-highest alert status for U.S. 
military personnel overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said that U.S. troops and civilian Defense Department 
employees in Panama were "sticking pretty close to home," especially after 
learning that Panamanian riot forces were using acid in water cannons trained 
on demonstrators.
