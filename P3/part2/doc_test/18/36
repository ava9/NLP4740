About once every 40 years, the U.S. public is titillated by the spectacle of a 
military chief being fired by his civilian superiors. The last time was part of 
the "Fancy Dan" period of the Revolt of the Admirals and a final limit to Gen. 
Omar Bradley's tolerance -- when Adm. Louis E. Denfeld was fired in 1949. And 
now it has happened again. Poor Michael J. Dugan left his post as Air Force 
chief of staff before he had time to move into quarters. When he was dismissed 
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday for displaying poor judgment, Dugan 
had been on the job fewer than three months. 
</P>
<P>
Some say: "What he said about launching a massive air strike against Saddam 
Hussein made sense, and the general scheme was not denied" -- and that may be 
true. But privates can say things generals cannot. And generals in the field 
may -- with a little more professional hazard -- say things that chiefs of 
staff cannot. It is also true that Dugan had been exhorting his troops to be 
more open with the press, and that philosophy may have contributed to his 
outspoken talk -- so outspoken, according to one account, that the interviewer 
asked him whether he really should be saying those things. 
</P>
<P>
One is reminded of the famous document in the aftermath of World War II that 
purported to be an interview with the famous ace, Lt. Roger Rudder. The three 
persons involved in this fictitious paper are the interviewer, Rudder and the 
poor public information officer. He desperately tried to salvage the interview, 
beginning each comment with "What the lieutenant really meant to say was . . ." 
(SAMPLE: "Lieutenant, what do you think of your equipment?" "If I ever catch 
the SOB who welded his lunch bucket onto my tail section, I am going to break 
his butt!" "What the lieutenant meant to say was that he is filled with 
admiration for the superb workmanship of our dedicated work force.") 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to this affair than the natural enthusiasm of a new leader. 
First there is the real problem of continuing to have Arab forces arrayed on 
the U.N. side against the forces of Saddam Hussein. Any split in the Moslem 
world is delicate and needs to be nurtured. And Arabs are not Jeffersonian 
Democrats who speak another language; they spring from a wholly different 
culture. Thus the last thing needed in this build-up stage is some direct 
reminder that the United States also has ties to Israel. Just as U.S. strategy 
against Iraq needs to be coordinated at the highest level, so do any gratuitous 
comments about a role for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The second factor has to do with targeting the person and family of Hussein -- 
including his mistress. Washington may well wish him gone from this earth, and 
that departure might be a blessing. But there is an executive order on that 
subject, prohibiting the slaying of a head of state. That also presents certain 
anomalies for the soldier on the ground. ("Son, I want you to go into that 
building and capture that Saddam feller. I know there is shooting going on, but 
for God's sake do not kill him. If you do, I have to send you to the slammer 
for 40 years.") 
</P>
<P>
A third factor lies in the role of a chief of service. In the simpler days of 
World War II, the law specified certain duties for the chief of service. In the 
aftermath of the creation of the Defense Department, Title 10 of the U.S. Code 
was changed in the late 1950s. From that point on, the law can be summarized as 
saying that the secretary of a service does what the secretary of defense tells 
him to and a uniformed chief of that service does what his secretary tells him 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
However, part of the person of a chief of service is a piece of that corporate 
entity, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I was once privileged to hear that saintly 
man, Gen. Harold K. Johnson, inform a civilian official of exactly that fact. 
He said the secretary (in this case Army) had no authority to direct what he, 
as a piece of the JCS, would say in that body. Now the law has been tightened 
again, to provide further authority for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff to speak for that body. There is little evidence that Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, head of the joint chiefs, knew of or approved Dugan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
As a fourth point, with the changes in the law, general strategy is the 
province of the joint chiefs -- and the service chiefs defer to their chairman 
for public expressions of such strategy. Detailed strategy and operational 
matters are the province of the commanders appointed by the authorities -- not 
the service chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
So one must be very careful in a time of dwindling budgets not to accept the 
protestations of those folk, usually retired, who claim that one service can do 
everything. For some time it has been national policy that combat forces be put 
together out of building blocks provided by those services whose forces and 
equipment are best able to play that role. While there must be some redundancy 
in war, there are very practical limits to such redundancy. 
</P>
<P>
The Army is the most keenly aware of that fact -- for it must rely on others to 
get it there, by sea or air. Yet the mundane logistics tasks are often given a 
secondary role to play when competing for scarce resources against the 
glamorous facets of war -- fighting. For some time we have been putting 
together forces for particular missions. Army helicopters have been flying in 
the Navy Task Forces in the gulf; they are trained and equipped to do what Navy 
or Marine helicopters cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Spare Army tanks are stocked in unit sets in Germany to make it easy for the 
air transport of troops to use them on the central front of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. While that front is changing, some of those tanks may 
become more generally available later -- Marine tanks floating near Diego 
Garcia could be called for early arrival in Saudi Arabia together with troopers 
from the 82nd Airborne Division. This is the way the system works: Task forces 
are put together from those pieces best suited to the mission and best 
available in distance. 
</P>
<P>
While this has been true for some time, the press makes it difficult when it 
reports such operations as evidence that everyone is being given a piece of the 
action because of service rivalry. It is the way things are organized now. 
</P>
<P>
There was an element in Dugan's reported comments that indicated the Air Force 
can do it all by itself. The Air Force may well play a primary role if it comes 
to combat in these circumstances -- but no one service will do it all. That is 
not the way the cookie crumbles in today's world. We need to remember this 
every time some retired Marine general says the Marines can do it all by 
themselves. Or some retired admiral says only the Navy is needed. Or some 
active-duty general says only the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
There is one final facet of this problem that engenders sympathy for Dugan. Any 
military leader must be a cheerleader. He has to express unlimited confidence 
that his team will win, and he has to express this where his troops will see or 
hear it. It is difficult for a naturally enthusiastic individual to keep in 
mind that the cheerleader side must be modified by the realities of other parts 
of his job. 
</P>
<P>
For some years now there has been a course at the National Defense University 
to train new generals and admirals in the basics of joint and allied operations 
-- a course in "jointness." As a result of congressional interest, almost all 
new flag officers go through this course. It is held four times a year. As 
these officers work their way up the chain, we can expect to see fewer public 
protestations that any one service can do everything itself -- and fewer 
mishaps of this sort.
