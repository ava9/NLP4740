FT  14 JAN 92 / US battle of the peace dividend: Politicians set their
sights on defence cuts

THE defence budget has always been the biggest piggy bank in town for US
politicians in search of funding for favourite projects.
The collapse of the Soviet threat has removed the Pentagon's strongest
protection just when politicians are hungrier than ever for money to pump
into the recession-weakened economy.
In less than a month President George Bush will announce his budget proposal
for 1993, which is expected to include cuts of up to Dollars 50bn over the
next five years.
From Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts on the left to
Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas on the right, congressmen of every
political hue have announced their own suggestions for defence cuts.
Far-reaching shifts in the US military posture have often been impelled by
late-night wranglings over the annual defence authorisation bill, and key
weapons systems have lived or died by the clout of the senators in whose
home states they are manufactured.
This time, budget negotiations will be an even more crucial force, at a time
when US defence policy is undergoing its most profound revision since the
end of the Second World War.
Since the Berlin Wall fell, President Bush has already announced one plan to
restructure US military forces - on the very day, August 2 1990, that Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
The policy he and Defence Secretary Richard Cheney laid out then and in a
subsequent five-year plan entailed cutting the US force structure by 25 per
cent over five years to a minimum level dubbed Base Force: 12 active army
divisions in 1995, 50 per cent less than in 1990; 15 active air force
tactical fighter wings, instead of 24; and 12 navy carrier battle groups,
instead of 14.
The Gulf crisis tempered some of the enthusiasm for defence cuts, but it
also strengthened those who believed that the collapsing Warsaw Pact threat
meant the US should rethink defence policy more radically, to face
emergencies that were more likely to come from another Saddam Hussein than
from the Soviet Union.
General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says that the
Base Force already represented just such a rethink.
'For the first time in my memory in the Pentagon we haven't just said:
Here's our wish list. We know we can't afford it. You all up there in
political land, figure it out for us. We have taken a hard look at our
worldwide requirements, the new geopolitical situation; we've designed a
force that we think is responsive to that,' he told Congress in September.
But Congressman Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed
Services Committee, calls the Base Force 'essentially less of the same, that
is a downsized force largely shaped by Cold War priorities'.
'The new American force must be created from the bottom up, not just by
subtracting 25 or 30 or 50 per cent from the Cold War structure,' he argued
in a paper on national security policy delivered last week to the Atlantic
Council.
Mr Aspin also takes issue with Gen Powell's contention that the Base Force
is an irreducibleminimum, and some defence analysts have proposed a much
slimmer force structure.
Professor William Kaufmann and Mr John Steinbruner of Washington's Brookings
Institution suggest that a force with only seven active army divisions and
six carrier battle groups could meet the test of another Desert Storm,
although it would hedge much less than the Base Force against other
simultaneous contingencies.
But the debate over future threats rages mainly in academic circles; the
force driving US defence planners is the need to slice still more money from
the 1993 defence budget, which was already intended to drop by 4 per cent in
real terms.
The lower troop levels already proposed by Mr Cheney will yield substantial
savings - personnel costs made up over half the 1992 defence budget of
Dollars 291bn - but only slowly.
Accelerating these cuts would entail politically unpalatable layoffs for
many of the heroes of Desert Storm.
Mr Bush has already announced cuts in the country's nuclear arsenal, and
much deeper cuts are expected as a result of the break-up of the Soviet
Union. Immediate savings, however, are likely to be small, because of the
cost of disabling warheads.
Budget cutters are more likely to set their sights on some of the costly
weapons systems.
Some may be killed outright, such as the B-2 stealth bomber and Seawolf
submarine programmes. The Pentagon is reported to be planning severe cuts in
both, but is unlikely to go nearly far enough to meet Congress's appetite
for killing these two systems, viewed by critics as classic Cold War
weapons.
Other programmes may be delayed, spread out or reduced, although this can
entail higher unit costs. In 1991, when the Pentagon ordered 108 F-16s, they
cost Dollars 19m apiece; in 1992, when it will get 48, they cost Dollars 24m
each; in 1993 it wanted 24 at Dollars 34m each.
In the end, the thirst for money to fund an economic growth package is so
great that the need for an immediate peace dividend seems likely to win out
over Mr Aspin's call for a more considered revision of the threats the US is
likely to face in the future, and the military options it wants at its
disposal to face them.
