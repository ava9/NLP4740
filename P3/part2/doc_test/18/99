Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday that he may send as many as 100,000 
more troops to join the 210,000 American personnel already deployed in Saudi 
Arabia to counter an expanded and increasingly fortified Iraqi force. 
</P>
<P>
A major element of the buildup is expected to be heavy armor units, many of 
them likely to be rotated from Europe, to match up against a huge force of 
Iraqi tanks now in defensive positions in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not at the point yet where we want to stop adding forces," Cheney said 
in a series of interviews on the four television networks. He linked the 
expected American buildup to the growth of Iraq's force in and near Kuwait, now 
numbering more than 430,000. "We've never set an upper limit" on the U.S. 
contingent, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and military analysts have said that the troops already in place are 
adequate to defend Saudi Arabia, but the defense secretary avoided linking the 
buildup to any U.S. plans for offensive action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is today . . . to deter further aggression, to defend Saudi Arabia 
and enforce the sanctions," Cheney said. "We also have the capability, 
obviously, to give the President a range of other options should another option 
be necessary. And we haven't ruled out other options." 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the increasing pinch of economic sanctions may prompt Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to lash out militarily at Saudi Arabia or at Israel 
before shortages of tires, spare parts and fuel sap his forces. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to continued "aggression" against Kuwait, such actions would 
constitute provocations that would leave the United States and its allies "no 
choice but to respond," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
He also addressed, for the first time publicly, the issue of potential 
casualties, which has become a sensitive factor in the Bush Administration's 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should underestimate the cost of conflict," Cheney warned. "No one 
should assume that such a conflict would be cheap or easy." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comments appear to reflect a growing consensus within the Bush 
Administration that nothing short of a military offensive will budge Iraqi 
troops from their trenches. Echoing an assessment Thursday by CIA Director 
William H. Webster, Cheney said that Saddam Hussein "gives no indication 
whatsoever, in spite of the public talk . . . that he has any indication of 
withdrawing from Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was considering a trip to 
Saudi Arabia, other Persian Gulf states and Europe, perhaps as early as next 
week, to shore up the multinational alliance against Iraq, a senior State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
United Press International reported that Baker's purpose would be to seek Saudi 
approval for offensive military action if the trade embargo does not force Iraq 
to pull out of Kuwait. However, the State Department official said he was 
unaware of such a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Saudi government's official public position is to oppose the use 
of its territory for offensive military action, Saudi officials are known to 
have told Baker and other American officials in private that they would support 
the use of force if sanctions fail to work. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is spending a long weekend at his ranch in Wyoming. Cheney plans to join 
him there, ostensibly to go fishing. The senior State Department official said 
that Baker is not expected to make a final decision to travel to the gulf until 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The possible deployment of more troops probably would occur simultaneously with 
a plan to replace some American personnel already in Saudi Arabia with fresh 
troops from the United States and Europe. The rotation and expansion would take 
months to complete, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, the elite 82nd Airborne Division may be withdrawn from Saudi 
Arabia, Cheney said. The lightly armed division of paratroopers was the first 
ground unit to arrive in Saudi Arabia, and Cheney said that it could be 
replaced with a more heavily armed tank or infantry division. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions on which new units to send to Saudi Arabia and how to enlarge the 
force are expected to come early next week after meetings in Saudi Arabia this 
week between Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and 
Lt. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of Operation Desert Shield 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion of substantial U.S. Army forces from Western Europe to Saudi 
Arabia would remain a politically sensitive move even though East-West tensions 
in Europe have eased and calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the 
continent have increased. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a little more than 200,000 troops based in Germany. 
Cheney said armored and infantry divisions -- the kinds now based in Germany -- 
"are the most useful forces" to face a heavily armed tank force of the type 
that Iraq has fielded in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kinds of forces we like to have in the area and we may well send 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to budget pressures and political changes in Europe, Congress has 
directed the Pentagon to withdraw 50,000 U.S. troops from Western Europe this 
year. Cheney said that "we might simply transfer some of those to Saudi 
Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon analysts said that option would be cheaper and faster than dispatching 
such forces from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pentagon sources cautioned that it could take months before the new 
ground troops could be in place with their equipment, even if they came from 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that in drafting their rotation plans, the military 
services have ruled out the use of combat forces from the National Guard and 
Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Without congressional authorization extending the length of time that the 
President can call reserve troops, Cheney does not want to use the 10 National 
Guard Army divisions based in the United States.
