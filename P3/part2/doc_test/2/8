An eighth suspect in the reportedly sacrificial slayings of a Kirtland, Ohio, 
family of five turned herself in, but the self-styled prophet who led the 
religious sect involved in the crime remained at large.

Sharon Bluntschley, 31, formerly of Kirtland, turned herself in to police at 
Bay City, Mich., officials said. In addition to the cult leader, Jeffrey 
Lundgren, authorities were seeking his wife, their 19-year-old son and two of 
his followers. The remains of the slain family, including three daughters, were 
found last week buried in a barn on the northeast Ohio farm where Lundgren and 
the religious commune lived until last April.
