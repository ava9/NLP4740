The Ohio Supreme Court, acting on a suit filed by several news media outlets, 
late Friday lifted a series of orders issued by the judge in the case of the 
alleged cult slayings of five members of a family. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to imposing a gag order on defense lawyers and prosecutors, Lake 
County Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks ordered local television stations to 
save all videotapes of their coverage of the slayings and prohibited them from 
filming one of the defendants, Ronald Luff of Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC and its Cleveland subsidiary, WKYC-TV, filed a challenge Friday with 
the state Supreme Court. Joining WKYC were WJW, the local CBS affiliate, WEWS, 
the ABC affiliate, independent WUAB and the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental question is whether a trial judge may arbitrarily restrain 
(the media's) rights to gather and disseminate news through the issuance of 
orders against them without notice or opportunity to be heard," the station's 
motion said. "The U.S. and Ohio constitutions declare that such orders are void 
and unenforceable." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3-4, the bodies of Dennis Avery, 49, his wife Cheryl, 42, and their 
three children, Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 6, were found buried in a 
common grave in a barn in Kirtland, Ohio, where a religious cult had stayed for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
They were shot in April, allegedly at the orders of cult leader Jeffrey 
Lundgren. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, the leader of the group which had broken away from the Reorganized 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and 12 other defendants have been 
indicted on various charges, with Lundgren, his son, Damon, and three others 
facing capital murder charges.
