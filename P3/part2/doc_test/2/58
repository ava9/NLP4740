<P>
Pet store employees identified former Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes as the man 
who stole a $17.25 bag of dog food in June, a detective testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, now a municipal judge in Cleveland and possible candidate for mayor 
this fall, has claimed he became involved in a dispute with a cashier and 
returned later to pay for the dog food. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes in January admitted taking a $2.39 screwdriver from a Bedford store and 
paid $50 restitution in exchange for a promise not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker Heights police detective Gerald Jankowski testified today in municipal 
court that Stokes' picture was included in a photography spread after store 
employees gave him their description of the suspect. The employees then picked 
Stokes' picture and he was charged with shoplifting.
