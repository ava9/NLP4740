Sauntering out of the Ohio Bell Telephone Co. headquarters at lunchtime, a 
middle-aged man was greeted the other day by a familiar sight: 25 or so 
chanting demonstrators marching in a circle in front of the building. "This is 
becoming a Friday ritual," he said, stopping for a while to watch with a friend 
before moving on. 
</P>
<P>
The well-behaved demonstrators, who also have regularly targeted other downtown 
sites since their protest began June 29, are mostly Cleveland State University 
students. In what some are calling one of the longest campus protests since the 
1960s, black students at the university are campaigning for the reinstatement 
of a black university vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The firing of Raymond A. Winbush last June, 10 months after he started his job, 
has galvanized the black community in Cleveland as have few other controversies 
in recent years, in part because Winbush was hired in direct response to 
charges of racism at the state-supported university. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president for minority affairs and human relations, he was supposed to 
help resolve racial tension. Now his firing has sparked an even louder uproar 
that echoes growing racial tensions on college campuses across the country. It 
also has generated a communitywide debate over what the role of the 25-year-old 
"urban" university should be. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, some say, was Winbush's aggressive and sometimes confrontational 
style in dealing with racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He was brought here to do his job and he did an excellent job, but they didn't 
like the way he did it," said Gloria Rice, the mother of one of the student 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that University President John A. Flower did not want to seriously 
address racial concerns, student protest leader Dante Merriweather said: "He 
wanted a Tom in the job. He thought he bought one." 
</P>
<P>
Merriweather, backed by area ministers and political leaders and a growing 
number of national civil rights figures, vowed that the demonstrations would 
continue until Winbush is reinstated. Martin Luther King III, son of the slain 
civil rights leader, recently came to campus to lend moral support to the 
students. He was preceded the previous week by Joseph Lowery, head of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Protesters said they expect other 
national civil rights leaders to lend their support in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Flower, in the face of this mounting pressure, vows that Winbush will never 
be rehired. Flower has rebuffed efforts by outside parties, including the U.S. 
Justice Department and the mayor's office, to mediate the issue. Differing 
styles, he said, is not the issue -- "the issue is performance." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush's position was created three years ago after then-City Council 
President George Forbes charged the university with racism, and a U.S. Labor 
Department investigation had found that some black employees at the university 
were victims of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush was hired away from Vanderbilt University, where he was director of the 
black cultural center. His problems began almost immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush said he should have known there would be problems when Flower wrote him 
a letter before he began his Cleveland job that said in part: "We must be 
careful not to let the misperception emerge that you are the black community's 
instrument to get a bigger piece of CSU." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush and his supporters contend that, since blacks and Latinos are 
inequitably represented in the student body and work force at the university, a 
"bigger piece of CSU" is exactly what they need. 
</P>
<P>
"That statement alone has outraged the black community," Winbush said. "It sent 
a shock wave through me when I read it . . . . We could triple, in fact we 
could quadruple, the rate of black graduates and still be just at the national 
average." 
</P>
<P>
Winbush was asked by trustees to prepare a report on minority student retention 
rates and goals. When it was completed in November, Flower criticized it as 
inadequate, inaccurate and polemical, and he extensively edited it before 
turning it over to the board of trustees. Winbush and his supporters contend 
that Flower wanted to water it down. 
</P>
<P>
According to the university, 16.1% of the 18,535 students are members of 
minority groups and 11.6% of that number are black, making Cleveland State 
second in Ohio only to a traditionally black school in minority enrollment 
among public universities. Flower said minority enrollment increased 5.9% from 
the 1986-87 school year to September, 1989. In addition, the university says 
minorities are 16.3% of the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush and his supporters contend, however, that the university's figures are 
inflated. He also said the retention rate for black students is low, arguing 
that, although blacks were 10.7% of the 1986 enrollment, they were only 6.3% of 
the graduating class. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the university's figures are accurate, Winbush and his supporters 
argue that Cleveland State, as an urban university with open enrollment 
policies, should strive to more closely approximate the population of the city. 
Cleveland's population is 52% black and the county is about 30% black. 
</P>
<P>
Flower contends that "no one has tried harder than I have to work with the 
various minority communities here in Cleveland to help improve their 
participation here at CSU. We want blacks to have more opportunity at CSU." 
</P>
<P>
Flower stresses, though, that when he refers to minorities he means Cleveland's 
large Eastern European community as well as blacks, Latinos, women and the 
handicapped. And, although the university is "part and parcel of Cleveland and 
the Greater Cleveland area, at the same time we have to strive to maintain . . 
. the integrity of what the university is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That means, in essence, that the university has to protect itself in some 
measure from the pressures exerted upon it by minority groups, the Legislature, 
the business community and others "who justifiably perceive themselves as 
having a vested interest in the university," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winbush's main problem, Flower said, was that he was "not functioning within 
the ground rules" so necessary to running a large organization. 
</P>
<P>
Students continue to hold protest marches at businesses owned by members of the 
university board of trustees. And a 24-hour sit-in has continued since June 
29th. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven protesters were arrested for entering Tower City Center, the 
city's new showcase retail development downtown that is managed by a company 
headed by a Cleveland State trustee. 
</P>
<P>
But as campus protests go, this one is particularly well-behaved. The 30 to 50 
students staging a sit-in at the administration building -- now in its sixth 
week -- are attended by a contingent of lawyers and an auxiliary group headed 
by parents, who bring meals and issue press releases. A schedule of events is 
distributed to the media weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The times, as somebody once said, are a'changing. But then, King's son, on his 
visit to campus last week, had a rejoinder: "History has a way of repeating 
itself . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with problems here," he told black students, "that we thought 
we had dealt with in the '60s."
