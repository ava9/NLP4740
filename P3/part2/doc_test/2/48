What's the betting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will appoint a
woman to replace its outgoing chairman, Gerald Corrigan, who departs in
August?
In normal times, the front-runners would all be men, people like William
McDonough, Corrigan's number two, David Mullins, the respected vice-chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC, or regional Fed presidents
like Richard Syron of Boston and Gary Stern of Minneapolis.
These are not normal times, however, and the rumour mill suggests that the
New York Fed may choose to shake things up a bit by picking Karen Horn, 49,
the former president of the Cleveland Fed and current chairman of Bank One
in Cleveland. Horn, who sits on the boards of BP, Eli Lilly and TRW, has
experience of both public and commercial banking. She also won plaudits for
resolving the Ohio savings and loan crisis when at the Cleveland Fed.
She faces tough competition in McDonough and Mullins. The former was once
vice-chairman of First Chicago, has advised the World Bank, and in his
present position is responsible for the Fed's activities in the bond market
and its implementation of monetary policy. As for Mullins, he is believed to
be closest to Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, which should
count for something. He is also a native of Arkansas, President Clinton's
home state - which may, or may not, help.
However, Horn has a couple of things going for her. Consuela Washington's
failure to get the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission
means that the Clinton administration is under even greater pressure to give
a top job in the financial sector to a woman. It's also worth noting that
the New York Fed's search committee is, for the first time, headed by a
woman - Barnard College president Ellen Futter.
