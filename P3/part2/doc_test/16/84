<TEXT>
<P>
Decked out in a lace slip and little else, Kathleen Turner's beckoning form 
looms over the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on West 49th Street, easily seducing 
passers-by from the two other marquees in view. 
</P>
<P>
Without a glance at the title -- "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," that drama club 
perennial -- you might think Turner's competition was "Lovers in Heat" at the 
World Porn Spectacular down the block, not Somerset Maugham's "The Circle," 
another Broadway revival playing under demure signage across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Turner makes no apologies for stalking audiences with such impudence; this is 
her first sashay onto Broadway in more than a decade, and, with her role as 
Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams' fervid melodrama, the actress shrugs, "I 
couldn't imagine just creeping in unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Turner caused Boston Globe critic Kevin Kelly to loose an alliterative stream 
that would shame the most ardent publicist: she was "steamy, sultry, sexy, 
socko, sinuous, syncopated, scintillating," his review stammered, before 
closing with a veiled hope: "serenade-able . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Even the New York Times' Frank Rich, said Turner was "mesmerizing to watch," 
observing that "to see this actress put on her nylons, a ritual of exquisitely 
prolonged complexity, is a textbook lesson in what makes a star." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Turner hopes to show more than an ability to unroll her stockings. At 
age 35, she senses a crucial point in her career; seductress roles will grow 
scarcer as she ages, Turner notes, so the screen siren who made a name playing 
sexy, dangerous women wants to prove she can act as well. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Maggie, which Turner calls "kind of a Hamlet for women," met her 
objectives. She instigated the current production, which is directed by Howard 
Davies and features Charles Durning as Big Daddy, Polly Holliday as Big Mama 
and Daniel Hugh Kelly as their favorite son, Brick. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a good play, not just some vanity role that would get me on stage in 
the flesh, " she said. Not that the flesh part bothered her: "When I get 
older," she says, "there'll be plenty of time to do Lady Macbeth and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, of course, isn't the only Hollywood figure who feels a need to prove 
something on a New York stage. This season, she joins actors ranging from 
Dustin Hoffman ("Merchant of Venice") to Justine Bateman ("Crucible"), who have 
found Cliff Notes-certified classics the perfect vehicle for their talents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't suppose there's any film or TV actress who isn't sometimes made to 
feel her medium is second-rate," Turner said. "This play can only enhance my 
reputation. It's got a cachet, it gives me what they call 'legit' acting 
credentials." 
</P>
<P>
The play, which Williams himself called "the American 'Lear,' " depicts the 
dying hours of a Mississippi patriarch, Big Daddy Pollitt, and the duplicitous 
maneuverings of his eager heirs. Act I is essentially a monologue by the 
frustrated, clawing Maggie, who seeks to excite her taciturn husband, Brick. 
She yearns for a child to consummate her membership in the Pollitt clan, but 
the drunken Brick spurns her affection, unable to shake the memory of his 
friend Skipper, a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences of the 1958 film version might have wondered why Brick, played by 
Paul Newman, scorned the ardors of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie. The present 
revival returns to Williams' original text, which confronts the homosexual 
nature of Brick and Skipper's friendship less obliquely. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly for Turner's purposes, it also shifts attention from Big Daddy 
to Maggie; unlike "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's" two other Broadway productions -- 
the 1955 premiere and a 1974 revival -- where Big Daddy thundered his way 
through the third and final act, the original text calls for that potentially 
distracting character to be out of Turner's way by the end of Act II. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted to be a supporting actress," she explains. "I'm damn good on 
stage and I want to show it." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean she's unfazed by criticism, however. To Rich's complaint that 
"she lacks the vulnerability of a woman 'eaten up with longing' for the man who 
shuns her bed," Turner responds, "Vulnerable? I thought I was doing it. I mean, 
I get gulps from the audience." 
</P>
<P>
This vulnerability issue touches a nerve with Turner. "All my life I've been 
hearing that I'm not vulnerable enough. I don't know what the hell they mean," 
she said. "Does 'vulnerable' mean some essential inability to function? I 
guess, then, I've got a problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
Since her first screen role as "Body Heat's" murderess 10 years ago, the 
Missouri-born Turner has artfully constructed her persona as a femme fatale. 
Roles in such movies as "Prizzi's Honor," "Crimes of Passion" and even as the 
voice of voluptuous Jessica in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" created the image; an 
off-screen acerbity and impatience with the celebrity press added to it. In 
interviews, she's known to assume Spanish and British accents, drop into 
character unexpectedly, and dismiss the talents of the '40s icon she's often 
compared to, Lauren Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an expert at presenting Kathleen Turner, capital K, capital T, whether 
it's finding the right sentence to say, or the right way to say it. I have a 
kind of carriage that projects the beautiful, powerful presence of a woman," 
she said. "That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Turner was quick to tell an interviewer that she had forgotten when the 
Academy Awards ceremony was scheduled this month. Not recognized for her role 
in "War of the Roses," not asked to present an award to anyone else, the 
once-nominated Turner (for "Peggy Sue Got Married") proclaimed: "Am I going to 
watch the Oscars? Hell no! They didn't remember me, so I can't be expected to 
remember them." 
</P>
<P>
When not engaged in the sultry affectations she sees as her job, however, 
Turner offered views on the state of theater, and the play she put together and 
previewed in Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburg and Wilmington, Del., before 
opening on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
She admires Williams' involved speeches, which "start off intensely 
naturalistic, but then switch to such tremendous poetry. It's amazing how he 
does it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner concedes, though, that the play's topical themes haven't held up as well 
as Williams' poetry: Homosexuality, infidelity and cancer are no longer taboo 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shock value any more in having a woman come on stage and take off 
her dress," Turner said. "But I think that change in attitude removes a 
distraction, it makes the play's real content much stronger. The real issues 
are about honesty, not homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
More recent works didn't have the same appeal. 
</P>
<P>
She admires David Mamet, but "would never in a million years do what Madonna 
did in 'Speed the Plow.' I didn't like 'Burn This.' 'The Heidi Chronicles?' How 
could I do it? I'm not New York-bred, and I'm not Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Turner, who lives in Greenwich Village with her husband, real 
estate developer Jay Weiss and her 2-year-old daughter, Rachel Ann, aims to 
appear in at least one play and one film each year. In the fall, she plans to 
begin shooting a detective movie, "Hard Boiled." After that -- and after a 
hoped for second child -- Turner said she'd like to perform in more vintage 
works, perhaps a Noel Coward play, or, coincidentally, to once again return a 
play made into an Elizabeth Taylor movie to the stage: Shakespeare's "The 
Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
"I was having this fight with (actor) Ron Silver, and I thought, 'You know, we 
could really knock each other out on stage as Katherine and Petrucchio," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the credibility that major stage roles add to her movie career, 
Turner asserted an almost evangelical belief in theater's value to society. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this idea that outside church, theater is one of the few places you can 
be close to somebody and be part of a group experience at the same time. It's 
amazing the trust that occurs, just from being so physically close to so many 
other people. It's a way of lifting the isolation that people feel so much 
today. 
</P>
<P>
That feeling of trust has its limits, though, even for a star as assured as 
Turner. Pointing to a box overhanging the Eugene O'Neill's intimate stage, she 
recalled an audience member who seemed all too close. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the bed kicking up my legs, putting on my stockings, and I look up, and 
the guy sitting in the box is staring at me through binoculars. Even for me, 
that's a little too much."
