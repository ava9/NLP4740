Actress Marion Davies, mistress of William Randolph Hearst, has been dead for 
almost 30 years, but someone remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in Hollywood Memorial 
Park. "Dear Marion, you are still loved and missed," read the accompanying 
note. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically all of Hollywood's history can be revisited here," said Frank 
Cooper during a preview of the upcoming Halloween tour of the cemetery 
sponsored by the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles. This year Cooper, who began 
the tours five years ago, and his colleagues will take groups through the 
cemetery on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper walked the 57-acre grounds, he pointed out the graves of Hollywood 
founder Harvey Wilcox and other city fathers and of dozens of celebrities, from 
swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks Sr. to director John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, whose day job is with a firm that mails press releases, is master of 
the odd Hollywood cemetery fact. 
</P>
<P>
He explains, for instance, that Davies' handsome white mausoleum, with its 
stone cherubs, was not a macabre gift from Hearst to his pretty protegee. 
Davies had the tomb, which has room for 12, built for her family. 
</P>
<P>
As an anthropology student at USC, Cooper wrote a thesis on death and culture 
that took him to most of the area's memorial parks. The Hollywood cemetery, an 
eclectic jumble of 73,000 graves, crypts, mausoleums and cenotaphs, is his 
all-time favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Forest Lawn," he opined, "looks like a golf course. It has no character." But 
Hollywood Memorial Park, with its miniature Egyptian temples, stained-glass 
windows and tombstones shaped like rocket ships, is fraught with character, he 
said. Like the streets of Hollywood, the cemetery tolerates dozens of different 
styles. "There's room for personalization," the cemetery aficionado said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper insists there is nothing strange about liking cemeteries. "We're not 
concerned with what's beneath the ground. We're concerned with lawn level and 
above. It's not morbid. It's quite beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a cheap date, noted Cooper, who sometimes visits the cemetery with 
girlfriend Suzanne Tarbell. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1899, the cemetery is best known for its film-industry burials. 
Producer-director Cecil B. De Mille is lavishly entombed, purportedly with his 
feet pointing toward Paramount. Rudolph Valentino's marker in the Hollywood 
Cathedral Mausoleum almost always bears the lipstick imprint of a kiss. Jayne 
Mansfield, who was decapitated in a car accident in 1967, is buried in 
Pennsylvania, but her bereaved fan club bought her a memorial plaque in 
Hollywood cemetery. On it is a publicity shot of the blonde star and the 
inscription: "We live to love you more each day." 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper pointed out, dead moguls and stars are the cemetery's major draw, but 
many of the most interesting graves have nothing to do with the famous. 
</P>
<P>
In several Armenian areas of the cemetery, graves are marked with headstones 
decorated with photo-like portraits of the dead sandblasted on polished 
granite. One of the deceased is shown as a young man, wearing a rakishly angled 
hat. Little gardens, planted with mint and other herbs as well as flowers, 
flourish on some plots, many of which are edged with brick borders. The grave 
of a beloved toddler is decorated with his toy cars and other playthings. Some 
graves are topped with Eastern Rite crosses fashioned out of plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Art Deco Society tours, which cost $5, will begin at 9:30 a.m. 
Saturday at the cemetery entrance at 6000 Santa Monica Blvd.
