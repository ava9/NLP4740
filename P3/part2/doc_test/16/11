Silent screen heroine Madge Bellamy, who had lead roles in the 1920s epics 
"Lorna Doone" and "The Iron Horse," died Wednesday at San Antonio Community 
Hospital in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bellamy, 89, had been hospitalized since Jan. 10 for chronic cardiac 
problems. One of the last remaining stars of the silent era, she had lived 
quietly in Riverside and San Bernardino counties for several decades after her 
film career took a plunge with the advent of the talkies in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Born Margaret Philpott on June 30, 1900, in Hillsboro, Tex., Miss Bellamy made 
her stage debut at age 5 and began studying serious acting a decade later, 
appearing in several New York theatrical productions as well as the road show 
of "Pollyanna." 
</P>
<P>
The brown-eyed actress made her film debut in 1920 in the screen adaptation of 
the play, "The Riddle Woman," and had featured roles in 40 silent films. 
</P>
<P>
In the John Ford classic, "The Iron Horse," Miss Bellamy portrayed the daughter 
of the first transcontinental railroad's chief contractor. She fell in love 
with the film's male lead, George O'Brien, as the eastbound and westbound 
sections of the track were being joined. As "Lorna Doone," Miss Bellamy 
projected a sweet innocence as the aristocratic girl captured and raised by 
bandits before being swept away by the dashing hero, played by John Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bellamy was named "American Beauty" by the Hollywood Assn. of Foreign 
Correspondents in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
She went on to have roles in 10 talking pictures, including "White Zombie," a 
seminal 1932 horror film in which she starred opposite Bela Lugosi, fresh from 
his success in "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
After her early Hollywood successes, however, Miss Bellamy attracted far more 
attention for her tempestuous love life than for her oft-praised acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
Her love affairs first drew headlines in 1928, when she and Los Angeles bond 
broker Logan Metcalf slipped away to Tijuana to be wed. Within four days, they 
had separated and Metcalf filed for a divorce. "She was the sweetest thing in 
the world while I was courting her," Metcalf told a judge. ". . . (But) at our 
first meal after the wedding she started being temperamental." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, she was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after firing three 
shots at a boyfriend who jilted her for a model. In testimony, Miss Bellamy 
claimed that the wealthy lumber company executive had called her his "little 
Easter egg" and promised to marry her. The actress, who added that she was only 
"trying to scare the gizzard out of him," received a six-month suspended 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Settling in Ontario in her later years, the feisty actress remained a witty 
conversationalist but in a somewhat solitary life style, acquaintances said. 
She left no known survivors.
