THE PLAYBOYS (12) Odeon Haymarket
THE LAWNMOWER MAN (15) Odeon Leicester Sq
RUSH (18) Empire
THE FIVE HEARTBEATS (15) Prince Charles
The Playboys resembles one of those pocket games where you steer a small
silver ball, or several, into the heart of a maze. The silver balls here are
stars Albert Finney, Aidan Quinn and Robin Wright, playing a pretty, unwed
mother and her two suitors in 1950s rural Ireland, and the maze is the
film's plot.
Co-written by Kerry Crabbe and Shane (My Left Foot) Connaughton, this
contains enough blind alleys and colourful digressions to render the unwary
intruder stark staring mad. It would also seem to require a director with
more sense of direction than Gillies Mackinnon. The Scottish-born film
school graduate is known for works like Conquest of the South Pole and
Needle where narrative cogency is a willing casualty of stylistic or
structural experiment.
Here we have a story. And the story includes unmarried motherhood,
haymaking, suicide by shotgun (Adrian Dunbar as an early adorer of Miss
Wright), a band of strolling players (the eponymous Playboys led by Milo
O'Shea), a policeman gnawed by amorous jealousy (Mr Finney), a lovable
troubadour (Mr Quinn, attached to the said Playboys), smugglers, the IRA,
the arrival of television, and Gone With The Wind showing at the local
cinema. How do you steer your silver balls into that labyrinth?
In the event, the film proves perversely enjoyable: being lost in a maze
often is. The happiest conceit was to use the theatre troupe's quick-change
repertory of plays - Othello one night, something occult the next, Gone With
The Wind with songs a third - as a comical distorting mirror to the village
intrigues. Finney's police sergeant, part volcano, part buffoon, is Othello
with a side order of Les Dawson; while Quinn's roguish charm becomes Rhett
Butler with a County Cavan accent.
The longer the film lasts, the more accustomed we become to its
multi-diversionary style. And the more we sense a harmony in the motifs,
which all hint at an old world changing to a new: from the birth of
television to the sexual politics of single motherhood. Most unifying force
of all is Miss Wright as the swept-several-ways heroine. International
pre-sales probably demanded that an American actress play an Irish heroine.
But this actress (late of The Princess Bride and State Of Grace) does so
with flawless accent and also suggests Hardyesque depths and strengths to a
girl lost in a maelstrom of love, not to mention a maze of a movie.
The Lawnmower Man has been hailed as the first Virtual Reality film. VR is
the state-of-art system whereby, donning a computerised helmet and glove and
sitting in a movement-simulator seat, we can see, hear and even feel
imaginary worlds.
Why, given this Promethean gadgetry, we should want to see, hear or feel any
of the things featured in this sci-fi thriller directed by Brett Leonard is
another matter. The film is not 'in' Virtual Reality of course - can you
imagine an Odeon Leicester Square full of helmets, gloves and twitching
seats? - but about it. Dr Pierce Brosnan, a scientist at Cybertech, performs
VR experiments on a retarded gardener (Jeff Fahey) which go horribly wrong.
Though transformed from simpleton to superman in about two weeks, Mr Fahey
is soon 'mowing' people's brains with his telekinetic powers. And when he
makes electronic love to a girl via Virtual Reality, the results are
disastrous.
Using computer images about as inspired as Disney's ten-year-old Tron, the
film is an essay in Virtual Fatuity sometimes raised to Achieved Banality.
The 'real' characters are even less lifelike than their electronic
projections. And the progressively inchoate script, based on a Stephen King
story crossed with a project of the director's own called CyberGod, was
probably written in a screenwriting-simulation seat. In this the writer is
swayed about by a whole lot of seeming inspirations only to discover on
waking that all that remains in his head is colourful gibberish.
Rush is one of those Hollywood thrillers whose plot the critic can intuit in
advance by scanning the list of minor characters in his cast list: 'Yellow
Rose Waitress', 'Wino', 'Scooter Trash', 'Man In Hearse', 'Medical
Examiner.' Ah: must be about petty violence and alcoholic abuse in Texas
escalating into death or murder.
Amazing, Holmes. Yes, Watson, but years of schooling in the Virtual Insanity
that is cinema teach one, first, that Hollywood does everything by numbers
and, secondly, that it cannot add up. So this tale of two narcotics
policepersons (Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh) who risk addiction by
using drugs themselves - to impress the dealers they wish to entrap - moves
powerfully through early and middle scenes only to collapse near the end.
The climax has our hero and heroine 'hiding' from the villains, after
blowing the whistle on them, by spending the night in a lonely, exposed
caravan park about a mile from the nearest telephone. Dear me. Are you
surprised when Miss Leigh wakes up to find the Chief Baddie's shotgun in her
mouth?
Cue screams, blood pellets and homilies over the receding stretcher. Before
this, erstwhile producer Lili Fini Zanuck (Driving Miss Daisy) makes a fair
fist of her directing debut. She pummels tension into some over-wordy scenes
 -screenplay by Pete Dexter from the bestselling book by narcotics cop and
ex-addict Kim Wozencraft - and she coaxes a beautiful performance from Miss
Leigh.
This pudgy-pretty actress, recently memorable as the live-in lover of a
psychopath (Miami Vice), deftly suggests the quiet birthpangs of panic.
Watch her face in one scene as masquerade changes to reality and she watches
her partner forced to inject real heroin.
Robert Townsend's The Five Heartbeats is an early harbinger of the summer
silly season. Subject: the rise and disintegration of a black rock group.
Time: 1960s. Intellectual level: the same as that of last week's The Mambo
Kings.
But where that had style and Armand Assante, this has schmaltz and five
black actors going OTT. The perky wit that marked Townsend's first feature
Hollywood Shuffle is replaced by a game of Guess The Next Cliche.
Will it be the lead vocalist who falls horribly apart on drugs? Or the nice
manager who is knifed in the back by the nasty one? Or the final reunion in
which the band forgets its differences and sings its heart out, oblivious to
the scuffle in the cinema auditorium as spectators compete to be first
through the exit door.
