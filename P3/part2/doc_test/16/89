Joel McCrea, a real-life cowboy who became one of the best of Hollywood's 
make-believe saddle heroes, died Saturday at the Motion Picture and Television 
Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Singer Brown, hospital supervisor, said McCrea died at 4:50 a.m. of 
pulmonary complications. She said he had been a patient a short time, and that 
his wife of 57 years, actress Frances Dee, had been constantly at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea's last public appearance was Oct. 1 when he attended a Beverly Hills 
fund-raising dinner for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is campaigning for 
governor. Paramount Pictures executive producer A.C. Lyles, a friend of 
McCrea's for many years, said First Lady Barbara Bush went over to McCrea after 
her speech, put her hand in his hand, and said, "My hero." 
</P>
<P>
"He lit up," Lyles said. "That summed up everybody's feeling about Joel." 
</P>
<P>
Tall and taciturn, good-looking and good-humored, McCrea may have ranked just 
behind John Wayne as the most believable of Western heroes. During a career 
that spanned three decades, he made 86 motion pictures, starring in many of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although best remembered for his cowboy roles, he was a versatile actor who 
handled frivolous light comedy and adventurous melodrama with the same skill he 
brought to Westerns. Some of his best-known films were Westerns such as "The 
Virginian," "Union Pacific" and "Wells Fargo," thrillers such as Alfred 
Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent," and comedies such as Preston Sturges' 
"Sullivan's Travels." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea worked in at least three pictures with his wife, one of the most sought 
after leading ladies of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Gossip columnists often referred to their union as "an ideal Hollywood 
marriage," and it was one of the few that proved to be just that. They were 
married in 1933, and were together until his death. 
</P>
<P>
One of their three sons, Joel Dee, who is known as Jody, played the deputy in 
McCrea's 1959-60 television series "Wichita Town." 
</P>
<P>
Off screen, McCrea was as low key and down to earth as he appeared before the 
cameras -- a working rancher, a shrewd businessman and a public-spirited 
citizen active as a school board trustee in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea was born Nov. 5, 1905, in South Pasadena, the son of a successful 
executive. His Western heritage was strong: His maternal grandfather, Major 
Albert Whipple, came to California during the Gold Rush in a covered wagon, and 
his paternal grandfather, Major John McCrea, was an Indian fighter and 
stagecoach driver. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, McCrea's future wife was born only five blocks away from his South 
Pasadena home, but moved to Chicago at a very early age. They did not meet 
until both were starting their movie careers. 
</P>
<P>
The McCrea family moved to Hollywood when Joel was 8 or 9 and he then came into 
contact with film figures -- he delivered the Los Angeles Times to such moguls 
as Sam Goldwyn and Jesse Lasky, and stars such as William S. Hart and Wallace 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a good deal about life -- and Hollywood -- back then," McCrea 
reminisced many years later. "There were certain stars, supposed to be worth 
millions, who couldn't dig up the 60 cents, which The Times cost then, at the 
end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly because of such experiences, the lanky, adventurous youngster was less 
star-struck than horse-struck. He loved and understood horses -- and started 
hanging around the back lots of Hollywood, volunteering as a "horse-holder" for 
cowboy star Tom Mix and one of his newspaper customers, Hart. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea first went before the cameras at age 12. Ruth Roland, a star of silent 
serials, was making a shoot-'em-up in the hills above Sunset Boulevard, and 
young Joel was again a horse-holder. A New York stage actor had been brought 
out to co-star with Roland. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy could act all over the place," McCrea recalled in an interview many 
years later. "But when they brought out the horses he was scared stiff. That's 
how I got to ride his horse in a couple of shots. They dressed me up in 
buckskins and for two days' work I was paid $5. Boy, that appealed to my Scotch 
blood. I forgot about wanting to be a cowboy and decided to be an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, he started working summers as a cowboy on the King Cattle 
Co. ranch in the Tehachapi Mountains. He loved to tell stories about the cowboy 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"In rainy weather, I was sent to hoist mothering (pregnant) cows out of low 
places," he remembered. "It rained like sixty. I found a cow that was bogged, 
and I roped her and pulled." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause to let his drawl catch up with his anecdote, he went on: "The 
cayuse I rode wasn't too well broken -- he decided to turn around, fast, four 
times. One end of the rope was wound around the cow's horns, the other tied to 
my saddle-horn. I was in the middle. After almost being cut in two, I freed 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, he said, that he came up with a practical solution. "A horse, I 
figured, gets up by raising his front legs first. A cow the opposite. Knee-deep 
in mud, I got down behind the cow. I bent over, put the cow's tail around my 
neck, gripped it with both hands and raised up with all the strength I could 
manage. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
No one but a real cowboy could tell such a story. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Hollywood High School and enrolled at Pomona College. It was 
there that he began acting in amateur roles. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea decided that he liked the acting life and after college graduation in 
1928 began haunting the studios and picking up occasional work as an extra. 
</P>
<P>
His first feature role came in 1929 in "The Jazz Age," and in the same year he 
played in "So This Is College," "Dynamite," and "The Silver Horde." He began 
winning star roles the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, considering his authentic cowboy background and rugged physique, 
many of his early roles were as the effete, snooty rich kid. 
</P>
<P>
Critics consider that his career peaked in the 1940s with "Foreign 
Correspondent," "Sullivan's Travels," and "Palm Springs Story." 
</P>
<P>
The general public undoubtedly remembers him best in big-budget Western epics 
because his open, honest face, easy-going manner and relaxed seat on a horse 
combined to make him more at home on the range than almost any other actor. 
</P>
<P>
As producer Harry Sherman once put it: "Joel is the greatest natural Western 
star since the old days of Tom Mix and William S. Hart. He has an authentic 
background, and he is one of the finest natural horsemen I've ever seen. . . . 
Just a guy who knows how to sit on a horse with grace and authority." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as an admiring columnist expressed it: "A horse to him was like a sonnet to 
Keats." 
</P>
<P>
Real cowboys verified the judgment of these Hollywood types by electing McCrea 
to the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea's poetic way with a horse and gritty Western look were perhaps most 
evident in Sam Peckinpah's 1962 film "Ride the High Country," in which he and 
Randolph Scott co-starred as a pair of over-the-hill lawmen transporting gold 
to a bank. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea was reputed to be one of the wisest investors and wealthiest actors of 
his era, although he sometimes joked about his business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
"My first business deal was with my mother," he once recounted. "I invested in 
chickens. I sold the eggs to my mother. Then (after she had cooked them) I ate 
the eggs. That's an ideal bargain." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea attributed his financial success largely to the late Times columnist 
Harry Carr and the late actor-humorist Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, when McCrea had a reputation as something of a playboy, 
Carr wrote privately to the star: "Don't let yourself slip into a state of mind 
where you believe that these little screen games of pretend are life. . . . 
Take all the easy money and save it. Accept what you find in Hollywood that is 
good and valuable and turn your back on the rest." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea said that he always tried to act on Carr's advice. On the advice of 
Rogers, McCrea invested his Hollywood earnings in a 1,000-acre working cattle 
ranch near Camarillo in Ventura County. He added to it over the years until he 
owned 3,000 acres of prime ranchland, which later became prime residential 
land. At one time, his ranch was producing 200,000 pounds of beef annually. 
McCrea was active in its management and in riding, roping and branding. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, according to news reports, he sold 540 acres for $1.2 million, and 
four years later sold another 1,000 acres for $3 million. He lived on part of 
his original spread near Camarillo, and had another large ranch near Palos 
Verdes and two more in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea served as president of the local school board, chaired the fund-raising 
committee for the Camarillo Boys Club and donated $35,000 toward a new 
clubhouse. He also made substantial gifts to local colleges and the Tri-Valley 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife and son Jody, now a rancher in New Mexico, he is 
survived by two other sons, David, also a rancher in New Mexico, and Peter, a 
real estate developer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services in Westlake will be private. The family has asked that any 
memorial contributions be made to the Conejo Valley YMCA, Camarillo Boys and 
Girls Club, or Motion Picture and Television Fund.
