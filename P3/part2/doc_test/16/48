An unabashed admirer of Robert Frank, Jack Kerouac once told the great Swiss 
photographer, "You got eyes." 
</P>
<P>
This new batch of film books show off the Hollywood photographers' eye. Largely 
photo essays, they are celebrity chronicles, told through the camera. While 
none have the remarkable intimacy of "Jean Howard's Hollywood," they do offer 
absorbing images of artists, actors and craftsmen -- at work and at play. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best collection is Hollywood At Home: A Family Album 1950-1965 
(Crown Publishers: $30; 144 pp.). Before the arrival of People magazine, which 
snuck us into celebrities' homes (the kitchen and the bathtub being particular 
areas of interest), there was Sid Avery, an award-winning photographer whose 
work appeared in such family magazines as the Saturday Evening Post, Look and 
Colliers. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando with his bongos. Audrey Hepburn astride her bike, cycling on the 
Paramount lot. Kirk Douglas with his kids, all wearing fake mustaches. These 
are playful, authorized portraits from an age when the protective studio 
machinery was still in high gear. As Richard Schickel's elegant introductory 
essay acknowledges, there's nothing especially garish or probing about these 
shots. Yet the passage of time gives the pictures more than just a nostalgic 
tug. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Avery's watchful eye and good humor, they often have a giddily campy 
appeal, whether it's a photo of Ernest Borgnine reading the comics with his 
kids, or Lawrence Welk posing with his band, showing off a fleet of new 
Chryslers donated by his TV sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Who's that chewing the fat over their Beverly Hills back fence? Why, it's 
friendly neighbors Rossano Brazzi and Jimmy Durante! Who's sunning herself on 
the set of "Giant"? Why, it's Elizabeth Taylor, looking impossibly young and 
erotic. 
</P>
<P>
This is a Hollywood book, so the pose is the thing, especially when you see 
Rock Hudson barbecuing in his back yard wearing a "Wolf in Chef's Clothing" 
apron. But sometimes the pose has an odd poignancy. To see a frail Humphrey 
Bogart reading to his child under Lauren Bacall's watchful eye, while a trio of 
massive boxers doze nearby, is to see an image of Hollywood at the end of an 
era. 
</P>
<P>
It seems appropriate that Avery later became a successful TV commercial 
director. His images are fresh and candid, without ever casting a harsh glare. 
It's sometimes hard to tell, however, whether Avery has captured an intimate 
moment -- or simply a moment of studied informality. 
</P>
<P>
The images are far less striking in a pair of new James Dean collections, James 
Dean: Behind the Scene by Leith Adams and Keith Burns (Birch Lane Press: 
$29.95; 223 pp.) and James Dean: Shooting Star by Barney Hoskyns (Doubleday: 
$40; 191 pp.). The former is an awe-struck compilation of still photos, 
letters, studio memos -- even cast and crew lists, complete with vintage 
addresses and phone numbers. (Fanatics take note: When Dean made "Rebel Without 
a Cause," he lived at 1541 Sunset Plaza Drive.) 
</P>
<P>
Neither book has much new to say. Buttressed with a rambling introduction by 
Dennis Hopper (who did "Giant" with Dean), "Behind the Scene" is largely 
devoted to shots of Dean on the set of his three Hollywood films. The memos 
offer the tastiest tidbits. One highlight is a letter to Jack Warner from Hays 
Office czar Joseph Breen, ordering trims in the "Giant" script, including three 
"damns," one "Good Lord" and an offending "Madre de Dios." 
</P>
<P>
Both books view Dean as an icon of devotion. "Shooting Star" offers photos as 
Dean as a toddler, as a high-school basketball star and as Malcolm in a 1951 
UCLA production of "Macbeth." (We also see him clowning around with Milton 
Berle -- Dean armed with a cigarette, Uncle Miltie with his cigar.) 
</P>
<P>
The segment of the book which surely will attract the most notice is its 
account of Dean's brief live-in relationship with a homosexual TV director, who 
took him to gay bars and helped get him bit parts. 
</P>
<P>
Dean got even more career assistance from the press. Author Hoskyns mentions 
Dean's shrewd media courtship only in passing, but it's an apt footnote to his 
emergence as a mythic youth-culture idol. According to Hoskyns, "Giant" 
director George Stevens put it this way: "Dean was the only person he knew who 
could walk into a crowded room and instinctively pick out the four journalists 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
At 81, Katharine Hepburn can ignore the media -- and everyone else. At the 
beginning of John Bryson's The Private World of Katharine Hepburn (Little, 
Brown: $39.95; 175 pp.), the feisty actress is pictured at her front gate, 
which has a sign reading: "Please Go Away." An old friend, Bryson somehow 
passed muster and has photographed Hepburn for more than 15 years. 
Unfortunately, it's the least interesting 15 years of her life -- and it shows 
in this forgettable photo book, which is crammed with the kind of fluffy 
snapshots that should've remained buried in Bryson's closet. 
</P>
<P>
We see Kate's shoe collection, her old golf clubs and, of course, a photo of 
her Oscar statuettes (which is pompously captioned: "The first photograph of 
the four Hepburn Oscars together"). Even the insider shots, of Hepburn at work 
with George Cukor, Henry Fonda and John Wayne, are mostly forgettable 
movie-location fare. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn's assessment of Wayne has all the sass and poetry that these photos 
lack. "He had tiny Irish feet," she says. "Enormous man. Tiny feet. Big hands. 
You leaned against him and it was exactly like leaning against an oak tree." 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn is only pictured once in Fashion in Film (Prestel/te Neues Publishing: 
$49.95; 244 pp.). But this history of Hollywood costume design, edited by 
Regine and Peter W. Engelmeier, is a luscious treat. Even if you couldn't give 
a hoot about Christian Dior (who did Marlene Dietrich's sleek outfits in 
Hitchcock's "Stage Fright") or Hubert de Givenchy (who provided Audrey Hepburn 
with a series of stunning outfits), you can't help but be enchanted by this 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Full of alluring photos of Hollywood's most glamorous women (and debonair 
gents), it offers an absorbing portrait of shifting fashion trends, from Pola 
Negri's Caligari cloaks with batwing sleeves to Madonna's Hell's Angels leather 
and lace bustiers. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the fashions look so chic today, especially the pop-art outfits of the 
late '60's. Don't miss Britt Ekland (from "The Bobo") who looks as though she's 
wearing a shrimper's net, or Raquel Welch, who displays a hairdo in 
"Roustabout" that appears to have been a prototype design for a new football 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Hedy Lamarr once said she felt naked without something on her head. But 
Hollywood's hat fashions have usually been more ridiculous than sublime. In 
"The Merry Widow," Mae Murray has a headdress with more feathers than anything 
Sitting Bull ever owned, while Mitzi Gaynor gamely wears a hat in "Anything 
Goes" that appears to have been patterned after a Tiny Naylor's drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
"Fashion in Film" pictures John Wayne in a natty sports jacket, but let's face 
it -- the Duke looked more at home in dusty cavalry britches and a battered 
cowboy hat. That's the way we see him throughout Ted Sennett's Great Hollywood 
Westerns (Abrams: $49.50: 272 pp.), a massive volume which chronicles seven 
decades of our most fabled film genre. 
</P>
<P>
The great Western directors, from John Ford to Budd Boetticher and Sam 
Peckinpah, were just as taken by the vast landscape as by its swaggering 
heroes. And the epic sweep of the West is pictured here in all its majesty, 
from the forbidding buttes of Monument Valley to the flat prairie, its arid 
stretches dotted with ragged lines of covered wagons. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne is the genre's most affecting hero whether he's on horseback with Henry 
Fonda, in a rare color still from "Fort Apache," or slouched wearily against a 
huge rock during his painful quest in "The Searchers." Despite his dry prose, 
Sennett is a thoughtful writer, especially when critiquing the Western's shoddy 
treatment of the Indians (who couldn't even play themselves, as noted in a 
photo spread picturing Victor Mature, Robert Taylor and Charleton Heston as 
fierce Indian braves). 
</P>
<P>
Unless you count the brat-pack cowpokes of "Young Guns II," the Western is 
largely dead and buried today. But Sennett's book does an admirable job of 
illustrating its gospel of rugged individualism. As Paul Newman says in "Hud": 
"If you don't look out for yourself, the only hand you'll ever get is when they 
lower the box."
