Actress MERYL STREEP, a native of New Jersey who has been outspoken about 
liking to live on the East Coast, and her husband, sculptor DONALD GUMMER, have 
bought a house in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought here because I got a job here. I never made a movie in Hollywood 
before," she said in a telephone interview from the Burbank set of "Defending 
Your Life," a romantic comedy co-starring Albert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Streep, who won Academy Awards in 1982 as best actress in "Sophie's Choice" and 
in 1979 as best supporting actress in "Kramer vs. Kramer," most recently 
co-starred with Roseanne Barr in "She-Devil." 
</P>
<P>
"We were renting (in Santa Monica) and found it hard to live among other 
people's things, so we decided to get a place of our own," she explained. The 
couple have three children. 
</P>
<P>
The Gummers bought a two-story, Spanish-style house on the Westside for 
slightly more than $3 million, real estate sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1972, the 6,469-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths, a 
dramatic spiral staircase and electric gates leading into a garden and circular 
driveway. The home also has mountain and canyon views. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning to go home (to Connecticut)," she said, "but we found this 
(house) as a place where we can stay whenever we come out and I work here 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"We really like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
GRETA GARBO'S "West Coast residence," where the actress, who died April 15, 
spent her winters for 25 years, is on the market at $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo owned considerable real estate at one time in the Beverly Hills area but 
sold it all, including four commercial buildings on Rodeo Drive, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The French Regency-style house, on 3 acres in the Beverly Hills Post Office 
Area, is owned by Anthony Palermo, Garbo's business manager and confidant for 
the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"But for all intents and purposes, it was her house," he said. "She gardened 
and had her roses there." 
</P>
<P>
Palermo bought the home for her to use, he said, after nutritionist Gayelord 
Hauser, Garbo's longtime friend, died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"When he passed away, the property was in the name of the Gayelord Hauser 
trust," Palermo recalled. "Miss Garbo said to me, 'Gosh, what am I going to do? 
I'm too old to own another house, to have it in my name.' And I said, 'Don't 
worry.' I bought it from the trust so she could come there and be undisturbed." 
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot home, built in the '30s, has a guest house 
and a swimming pool. It has been rented, for short periods, by actor Dudley 
Moore and film exec David Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
Palermo put the property on the market for a short time last year when Garbo 
was ill. "But now . . . I'm intent on selling it," he said. It's listed with 
Joe Coons at Rodeo/Prudential Realty.

CURTIS HENDRIX, the New York entrepreneur who last year relocated to Los 
Angeles and bought the former Sanwa Bank Building -- a 13-story office tower on 
South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles -- for $135 million, just 
purchased, with a partner, 410 acres in Malibu and an 1,849-acre ranch in San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix didn't say how much they paid for the properties but indicated that he 
and his partner will develop them each at a cost in the $50-million range. 
Hendrix's partner is John Paul Jones Dejoria, founder and owner of Paul 
Mitchell Hair Products. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on something for Malibu that will be helpful in solving some of 
the environmental problems and not create traffic," Hendrix said, adding that 
he should have more details in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 feet of the Malibu property fronts on Pacific Coast Highway, and 
the rest is in Tuna Canyon, less than 2 miles north of Sunset Boulevard. It had 
been owned for 20 years by a doctor and other investors and is divided into 14 
estate sites. 
</P>
<P>
The San Luis Obispo property, known as the Eagle's Nest Ranch, came with zoning 
approvals for an 18-hole golf course and 225-room lodge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also going to create 16 50- to 100-acre ranchettes with rights to use 
the hotel and golf course," Hendrix said. "We're in the process of submitting 
drawings (to the city)." 
</P>
<P>
While also forming development options for their Malibu property, Dejoria has 
begun construction in Malibu on a 15,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style 
mansion for himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's fast-food founder RAY KROC'S former 204-acre Santa Ynez Valley ranch 
will be open to the public and prospective buyers for the first time Saturday 
and next Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Now owned by the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, the ranch was developed 
and used by Kroc, who died in 1984, as a country retreat for his family and 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
It's on the market through Coldwell Banker's Montecito and Santa Barbara 
offices at $11.5 million, reduced from its $14-million asking price when first 
listed last August. 
</P>
<P>
The property includes a 4,700-square-foot owner's residence on a 20-acre 
hilltop; a 15-bedroom guest house; theater, conference/library building, two 
helicopter pads, twin tennis courts, a volleyball court, stables and two 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch can be reached from the Armour Ranch Road exit of Highway 154 in the 
Santa Ynez Valley, after a 22-mile drive over the San Marcos Pass from Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger first baseman EDDIE MURRAY has purchased a new Normandy-style, 
10,000-square-foot house with a private lake and free-standing, 
4,000-square-foot chauffeur's quarters in Sand Canyon at $3.4 million, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Sand Canyon is the wealthy residential area of Canyon Country, southwest of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's purchase is believed to be one of the highest sales in the area.
