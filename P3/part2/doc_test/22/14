FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keep a sharp eye on Spanish property
contract, not the Sangria
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr IAN S BLACKSHAW

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest Gerald Cadogan's article on Spanish property
(Mediterranean Property, August 13/14) and, in particular, his warning
against the vendor including a clause in the contract of sale, under which
the purchaser becomes responsible for all the debts and taxes of the
property. Such a clause can, contrary to what the General Spanish Law
otherwise provides, add quite substantially to the price.
This underlines the need not only for professional legal advice to be taken
at an early stage in any Spanish property purchase, but also the need to
follow the common sense precept that one should not sign anything,
especially in Spanish, which one has not read or understood, particularly
after a jug or two of Sangria]
