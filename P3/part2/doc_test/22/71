THE LABOUR Party has urged the government to protect customers from the
activities of Club Riviera, a timeshare company that had its credit licences
revoked by the Office of Fair Trading last July.
In an early day motion Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs
spokesman, and Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, allege that - like Land Travel,
the coach company which collapsed last July - Club Riviera has failed to
file accounts within the legal timescale.
The motion adds that Club Riviera's records at Companies House 'do not
reveal the principals' of its various companies. They include Club Tenerife,
Canary Islands Holiday Club, Regency Palms, Marbella Beach Club, Vacation
Management Services, Olympus Resources and Mackintosh Associates.
The motion says that in spite the OFT's revocation of Club Riviera's credit
licences for seriously misleading and deceptive conduct, 'the Department of
Trade and Industry has permitted those responsible for such conduct,
Laurence Werner, Simon Clarke and others, to continue to run the company'.
It adds that Club Riviera and its associated companies 'intimidate consumers
they have cheated, repossess thousands of properties resulting from high
maintenance charge disputes (and) tricked consumers by offering a buy-back
guarantee which was not honoured'.
The motion says the company is being investigated 'by the Fraud Office' and
calls on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to investigate
those who control the companies. It also calls on Mr Heseltine 'to protect
existing customers and the public from malpractices'.
Club Riviera declined to comment on the motion.
