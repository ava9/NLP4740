IN FOUL WEATHER think of Dorset, that contented, homely county where only
spring and summer seem to reign. If you look for a house there now, the
winter gales sweeping in from the Channel promise a few thousand pounds more
off already competitive prices.
A drive of two to three hours from London by the A303 (worth the trouble for
the sudden magic of coming on Stonehenge shortly after Amesbury) or the M3,
Dorset is a different, self-sufficient world of rolling hills and wonderful
walks, villages nestled in tree-packed hidden valleys, and old market towns
of great charm, and good shopping, such as Sherborne, Blandford, Wareham,
Shaftesbury, Bridport and the county town, Dorchester. The Blackmore Vale,
known for its hunt, runs through the middle of the county.
The coast is superb for swimming and sailing, offering a choice between
lonely beaches or developments, especially around Poole harbour, that are
the nearest England comes to a riviera. The Weymouth ferry is an escape
route to France but Dorset itself has any number of places for expeditions,
from the Swannery at Abbotsbury or Thomas Hardy's study in the delightful
Dorchester museum, to Maiden Castle, a whale of a prehistoric hill fort just
outside Dorchester.
Houses on the market are of unusual interest for the slack season. Top
billing goes to Thornhill Park, a splendid Palladian house near Sherborne
which belongs to John Rew, co-editor of the Lloyd's Chatset reports, and his
wife.
Sir James Thornhill, responsible for the dome of St Paul's and the Painted
Hall at Greenwich, rebuilt the house in the 1720s and that is, on the whole,
how it remains today, restored lovingly by the Rews.
With its own obelisk, fabulous views over Blackmore Vale, 185 acres, a dower
house and a lodge, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171), Michael de Pelet in
Sherborne (0935-812-236) and Symonds &amp; Sampson in Dorchester (0305-264-172)
offers this Grade II* house at around Pounds 1m.
Huish Manor, near Blandford, is a late Georgian house from the 1790s,
offered at around Pounds 875,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury
(0722-328-741). The gardens are so fine that only devotees should think of
this property, although the heated indoor swimming pool sounds perfect for
winter.
Still more horticultural commitment is needed from those considering Clapton
Court on the Somerset-Dorset border, offered by Lane Fox (071-499-4785) at
around Pounds 1.2m, including cottages. These could be sold separately but
probably are essential for housing plantsmen to look after the superb
gardens, which are open most of the year and known to all serious gardeners.
Those considering the part-Tudor, part-Victorian Compton House near
Sherborne need not be committed to butterflies and silk worms. It is at
present home base for Worldwide Butterflies and the Lullingstone silk farm -
renowned for making the silk for the Queen's coronation dress - which are
not part of the sale. But, with 50 rooms, it might be wise to think of a
business use for the house, on sale from Savills in Wimborne (0202-887-331)
at Pounds 1m.
In nearby Nether Compton, Savills (acting with Humberts in Sherborne:
0935-816-909) has the mellow Old Rectory, complete with the vicar's billiard
room and orangery, at around Pounds 525,000. Maiden Newton House, offered by
Symonds &amp; Sampson at around Pounds 550,000, is another 19th century rectory,
this one with fishing on the Frome which flows through the grounds.
Weston House, perched on a clifftop at West Lulworth and built by Edwin
Lutyens for George V's surgeon, Sir Alfred Fripp, is also with Savills. The
guide price of Pounds 375,000 is attractive for what stands out at once as
Lutyens' work: a brick manor with projecting eaves and prominently leaded
windows.
Another impressive property by a well known architect - this time the
Victorian, GE Street - is Kingston House, originally a rectory, in the
middle of the Isle of Purbeck and two miles from Corfe Castle. Jackson-Stops
in Yeovil (0935-74066) offers it at around Pounds 675,000. The firm has
another old rectory at Frome Vauchurch, in the Frome valley, for about
Pounds 485,000.
Between Street and Lutyens in date are two Tudoresque houses. One is the
half-timbered Chaffcombe House just across the county boundary near Chard in
Somerset, offered by Michael de Pelet and Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley at around
Pounds 425,000. The other is the stone Dower House at Parnham (John
Makepeace's furniture studio is in the big house), with Savills at around
Pounds 385,000.
The pick of the village houses is the grand Dawnay House in Puddletown
outside Dorchester, a listed Grade II* Queen Anne-Georgian building with
original oak staircase. Savills is offering it at over Pounds 200,000.
The attractive Old Manor Farmhouse at Marnhull, Dorset's largest village
which prospered on the wool trade, dates even earlier to the time of Charles
I and is offered at around Pounds 235,000 by Jackson-Stops.
Thornton Cottage at Moorside, near Shaftesbury, is offered at Pounds 190,000
by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Michael de Pelet. Ware Farmhouse near Lyme
Regis, with spectacular views of the Dorset coast, is with Jackson-Stops at
around Pounds 350,000 while an inland farmhouse, Benville House near
Dorchester - which has a paddock available for anyone who fancies hunting
with the Cattistock - is offered at over Pounds 250,000 by Symonds &amp;
Sampson. The Old Forge in the lovely village of Milton Abbas is also on
offer from Savills at around Pounds 170,000.
Sailors will think hard about Moriconium Quay at Poole harbour. It is a new
'Mediterranean-style' development of apartments and houses on 125-year
leases, each of which has a 43ft berth for a boat right on the doorstep.
Prices at the Quay - Moriconium is the Roman name for Poole - start at
Pounds 285,000 from Savills.
