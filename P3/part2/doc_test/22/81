Variety and convenience make Hampshire popular. It is a large county with
masses to offer. Gardening thrives. So do fishing on the rivers Test and
Itchen and riding in the New Forest.
For sailors, there is Cowes Week. Winchester, the county town, is packed
with history, archaeology and education. And Jane Austen lived in Chawton,
near Alton.
Transport links are excellent. It is an easy journey to London by train or
on the M3 motorway. And cross-Channel ferry services mean that a short break
in France can happen any weekend, finances permitting.
Hampshire homes, when priced sensibly, are selling fast in 1994. Philip
Gossage, of John D. Wood's Lymington office, described it as a 'hardening'
market, with many more deals than last year.
Many sales are on the invisible market, when an agent dangles a likely buyer
before an owner who has often thought of selling - and might have asked
agents what the house should fetch - but has never quite steeled himself to
proceed.
Now, he is faced by a buyer with cash who wants an answer. Philip Blanchard,
of John D. Wood in Winchester, agreed three such under-the-counter sales in
a day recently, all in the Pounds 350,000 range.
At the top end of the market, Blanchard stresses how much it helps for the
vendor to prepare the paperwork (deeds, searches, etc) before marketing
begins. Then, a price can be agreed on a Thursday and contracts exchanged
the following Monday, as happened with Upton Manor near Andover (guide price
Pounds 1.5m).
For Lady Soames's Castle Mill House at North Warnborough (offers over Pounds
800,000), with fishing on the river Whitewater, Lane Fox had more than 40
viewers and several offers in the 3 1/2 weeks it was on the market. In the
medium-price range, Hamptons reports that offers can appear in the first
24-48 hours of marketing.
The north-eastern part of Hampshire is particularly accessible, which makes
Forge Cottage in Odiham enticing at Pounds 120,000 on a 1,000-year lease
that began in 1863, or Holly Tree Cottage in South Warnborough at Pounds
129,000. The agent for both is Hill &amp; Morrison, which also is selling flats
in the handsome Georgian Kingston House in Odiham High Street (now being
restored) at Pounds 195,000 and Pounds 220,000.
Runtens Farm at Rotherwick, near Basingstoke, is half-timbered and has a
barn and a paddock (Pounds 425,000 from Lane Fox in Basingstoke). Near
Alton, Farringdon House is a substantial turn-of-the- century brick building
in four acres (from Hamptons in Alton, Pounds 325,000).
Hill Top, at Powntley Copse (Hill &amp; Morrison, Pounds 250,000), is a little
gem of the 1930s in white-painted brick. The copse was a development of 26
gentlemen's cottages/weekend retreats in 32 acres of wood; Hill Top has 2.6
of them and is the last house in the wood. It makes an intriguing change
from the Tudor half-timbering and Georgian red brick so frequent in
Hampshire.
If your retreat must be in timber and thatch, Ivy Cottage in Wherwell, a
village on the Test near Stockbridge, could be ideal (Pounds 140,000 from
John D. Wood in Winchester). But if you want age, Goleigh Manor at East
Tisted, near Alton, dates back to medieval times. Built of timber, brick and
stone, it is named after the de Golley family (which is known from 1200),
and Winchester College owned it from 1469 to 1965. Price: Pounds 750,000
from Savills.
Lane Fox's London office offers Lyss Place, with 217 acres near Petersfield,
for Pounds 1.5m. It has good Georgian rooms but needs some work. Nearby
Stodham Park is an immaculately restored Regency house, rich in bedrooms and
with an indoor swimming pool. It is set in 23 acres, which include a stretch
of trout fishing on both banks of the river Rother. Price: Pounds 1.95m from
Savills.
The red brick Rookery Farm at Kingsley, near Alton, is cheaper at Pounds
395,000 (from Hill &amp; Morrison). A neighbouring wood belonging to the
Woodland Trust (and listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest) helps
privacy.
Fishermen and bird-watchers will opt for the Lower Itchen Fishery, three
miles of trout fishing on the river Itchen just one mile from Eastleigh
airport, near Southampton. The bailiff has noted more than 150 types of
bird. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is asking around Pounds 1.05m for four lots as a
whole, including a mill and mill pond.
For sailors, Sally Point is a modern house at Hamble with its own mooring
and splendid views over the river Hamble ( Pounds 385,000 from Hamble Estate
Agency or John D. Wood). They are also joint agents for Bailey Cottage -
originally a barge-master's house - at nearby Old Bursledon (Pounds
185,000).
Another property offered by John D. Wood (with Penyards) at Old Bursledon is
8 Greyladyes, the centre part of an 1800 manor house (price: Pounds
225,000). Inland at Wickham, overlooking the village square, the same agents
have Havelock House, an unusually smart 18th century red and blue brick
property listed grade II* (Pounds 300,000).
New on the market at Beaulieu is Blackbridge House, 1930s' Tudoresque with
views down to the Beaulieu river (from John D. Wood in Lymington for Pounds
450,000). On the east edge of the New Forest, Oakapple Cottage at Bartley,
near the end of the M27 motorway, is a four-bedroom thatched house (from
Woolley &amp; Wallis: Pounds 525,000).
In Winchester itself, Westbrook House is a 15th-16th century timber-framed
building in Chesil Street (from the Winchester offices of Hamptons or John
D. Wood for Pounds 153,000).
