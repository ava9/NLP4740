Almost apart from the rest of the country the much-visited Algarve has a
life of its own, writes Audrey Powell. Today's 'real' Algarve is the golf
course development. A figure swinging a golf club must now typify the
province in the way that a pavement orange seller may have done in another
era.
Further expansion of most of the main projects has been mothballed until the
leisure market revives, but construction continues on the Alto Golf and Alto
Club development, near Portimao in western Algarve, financed and managed by
the British construction company Mowlem.
This two-part development, an hour's drive from Faro airport, has an 18-hole
golf course designed by golfer Henry Cotton, who lived in the province for
25 years. On one hole, the 660-yard 16th, if you make a birdie, you get a
certificate and have your name engraved on a roll of honour in the
clubhouse.
Alto Club, about a mile from Alto Golf, is set in gardens on the site of an
old farm. The farmhouse has been restored, with its well and ancient wheel.
This resort has views over the fishing village of Alvor and the bay of
Lagos. It has swimming pools, a floodlit tennis court and a restaurant. A
short walk takes you down to one of the Algarve's vast beaches.
Both Altos offer quite spacious villas and flats with a high ratio of
bathrooms to bedrooms, and many broad terraces. The villas are of varied
design, with two to four bedrooms; they cost from Pounds 175,000 to more
than Pounds 300,000, depending on type and plot size.
Flats cost Pounds 115,000 in Alto Golf and Pounds 107,000 to Pounds 110,000
in Alto Club. There is also an arrangement by which four people can buy
together, each owning a share in a freehold flat. This costs from Pounds
26,000.
A word of warning. One of the attractions of the Algarve is that you can
play golf throughout the year, with warm, sunny days even during the winter.
What you are less likely to be told is that the Algarve also has some
extremely cold days, which can be chillier than the UK at the same time of
year.
If you plan to spend a lot of off-season time there, make sure you have an
adequate central heating system in your property.
Three Alto resorts are planned. The third, Alto Beach, has yet to be built,
and remains an 18-acre clifftop site, close to the existing Altos.
Eventually, Alto Beach will have 70 apartments, a restaurant, tennis court,
swimming pool and a mini-golf course.
If residents of the three Altos want a change of scene, they can drive to
the Algarve's westernmost point, Cape St Vincent, a wilder version of
England's Land's End, and watch the Atlantic swirling below the cliffs. They
may soon feel inclined to return to the more tranquil challenge of the 16th
hole.
