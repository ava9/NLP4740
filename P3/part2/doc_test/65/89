FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Decision to reduce export credit insurance premium
praised

Sir, The British Exporters Association welcomes the Trade Minister's
decision to reduce export credit insurance premiums for medium- and
long-term business under the Portfolio Management System to a more realistic
level ('Export insurance premiums cut by up to 50 per cent', March 10).
When the Portfolio Management System was introduced in early 1991, the
government hoped that other countries would raise their export credit agency
premiums to UK levels. That has not happened.
David Dodwell's article 'Putting risk reality back into export cover' (World
Trade News, February 4) makes the point that Italy is saying 'no' to the
Portfolio Management System unless the rest of the world follows.
As a result, while the Portfolio Management System relates risk to premium,
its uncompetitively high rates have adversely affected our ability to export
capital goods.
Other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries
appear to be winning contracts (and employment opportunities) in the UK's
traditional Third World markets.
The British Exporters Association hopes that the government's decision
heralds an ongoing review process which will cover not only premium rates
but also Portfolio Management System market capacity - that is, the amount
of cover available for individual countries.
Although some markets are highly price sensitive, the Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD) must be aware that others appear to be cover
sensitive.
A degree of flexibility by ECGD to relate its policy to market needs would
be welcomed by industry. The government's decision on premium rates is a
first step in the right direction.
