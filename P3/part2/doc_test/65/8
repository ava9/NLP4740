Blair Thomas scored on a 38-yard run and No. 23 Penn State kept its record 
perfect in games in which Thomas has rushed for more than 100 yards with a 
34-12 victory over Syracuse Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore O.J. McDuffie ran back a punt 84 yards for a touchdown as the Nittany 
Lions broke open a close game at Syracuse, N.Y., with 17 third-quarter points 
and ended a two-game losing streak to the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished with 115 yards in 17 carries, but he carried only once in the 
second half as the Nittany Lions won for the fifth consecutive time after a 
season-opening loss to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse lost its third in a row, able to score only two field goals against 
the nation's second-ranked scoring defense. Penn State entered the game 
allowing less than a touchdown per game. 
</P>
<P>
After a 10-6 halftime lead, Penn State's Mark D'Onofrio intercepted a Syracuse 
pass to set up Ray Tarasi's 20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
After regaining possession on a punt, Penn State drove 65 yards to score on 
Tony Sacca's seven-yard pass to tight end Dave Jakob. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, the Nittany Lions got the ball back again on a punt. 
McDuffie used a spin move to break one tackle and then dodged kicker Ken 
Hawkins to score on the fifth longest punt return in Penn State history. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 31, Navy 14 -- Adam Walker ran for 105 yards and scored two 
touchdowns at Pittsburgh, assuring the Panthers an unbeaten record going into 
their Oct. 28 showdown at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a senior, started at tailback only because Curvin Richards was held out 
of the first half by Coach Mike Gottfried after missing a team meeting. 
Richards, who has also been bothered by a pulled groin, scored on a 52-yard run 
on his first carry in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Alex Van Pelt completed 13 of 26 passes for 204 yards, giving 
him 1,414 yards for the season, and threw two touchdown passes as Pitt overcame 
a 7-0 deficit by scoring 24 consecutive points. Pitt, idle next Saturday, is 
5-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Army 45, Holy Cross 9 -- Mike Mayweather ran for 171 yards and three 
touchdowns, snapping the Crusaders' 13-game winning streak and moving into 
fourth place on the Cadets' all-time rushing list at West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Army (3-2) ran for 493 yards against the Crusaders (5-1). Mayweather, who moved 
past Tory Crawford and Charlie Jarvis, has 2,426 career yards and needs just 
532 to surpass Glenn Davis' record of 2,957. 
</P>
<P>
Yale 24, Dartmouth 19 -- Tailback Kevin Callahan scored three touchdowns and 
quarterback Darin Kehler rushed for 114 yards to carry the Bulldogs to an Ivy

Yale improved to 4-1 and 2-0 in the league; Dartmouth dropped to 1-4 and 0-2.

Cornell 28, Harvard 0 -- John McNiff rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns 
and Frank Monago caught two scoring passes to lead the Big Red to victory at 
Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell, 3-1 overall and 1-0 in the Ivy League, won its second consecutive game 
and Harvard (1-4, 1-1) lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
McNiff scored on a draw play from 42 yards out 3:54 into the game. Then, with 
three minutes left in the first quarter, he went over the left side from 10 
yards out to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton 24, Columbia 8 -- Judd Garrett rushed for 163 yards, scored three 
touchdowns and became the Tigers' all-time leader in rushing, scoring and 
touchdowns at Princeton, N.J.

3-1-1 overall and 3-0 in the Ivy League. Columbia fell to 0-5 and 0-3.

Penn 32, Brown 30 -- Bryan Keys rushed for a school record 249 yards in 37 
carries and scored four touchdowns to lead the Quakers to the Ivy League win at 
Philadelphia. Keys broke the one-game mark of 214 yards set by Francis Bagnell 
in 1950 and Adolph Bellizeare in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 35, Temple 14 -- Tim Frager ran for two touchdowns and kicker 
Brian Lowe became BC's career scoring leader as the Eagles (1-4) beat the Owls 
(0-7) at Newton, Mass. Lowe kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 42 yards and two 
conversions for a career total of 223 points, breaking the BC record of 216 set 
by running back Troy Stradford from 1982-86.
