I have been cooking professionally for the past 44 years. Changes in my way
of cooking may therefore be less dramatic than in that of younger chefs. But
such is the nature of this profession that beneficial influences can come
from the most unlikely source.
We have vastly improved our method of cleaning scallops as a result of
watching the local fish shops' treatment of queen scallops. Our former
method was slow and messy. Now we remove the top shell then, using a knife
or spoon with a sharpened edge, cut behind the muscle and roe to separate it
from the stomach, frill and debris and lift out the scallop and roe. Then
the scallop only needs minimal treatment to remove the hard gristle on the
side.
Around this time of the year we also order seeds from the new catalogues.
Thanks to another chef I can heartily recommend Greek Cross (from Suffolk
Herbs). It is a tangy mustard-like plant that grows easily (and incidentally
runs to seed just as easily) but is delicious in salads.
More by accident we also discovered a red cabbage, red onion and beetroot
combination that is excellent with game, pork and ham. Add half the volume
of coarsely- grated beetroot and sweated red onion to the red cabbage
braised in the normal manner. Mix in, adjust the seasoning and reheat to
serve.
Finally, we make over 1,000 Christmas puddings each year. Our streamlined
production may help others. We put in a blender: eggs, apple, crystallised
ginger, lemon and orange juice, brandy and lemon and orange peel removed
with a potato peeler. Blend well, then put into a bowl with all the dry
ingredients. I have not tried it but I think the base mix in the blender
would make a nice baked pudding on its own.
