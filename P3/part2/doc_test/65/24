Don't look for Virginia Coach Terry Holland to get too excited about the 
Cavaliers' 81-79 Atlantic Coast Conference victory over No. 11 Georgia Tech in 
overtime Sunday at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to be winless in the league, but we can only enjoy this for about 30 
minutes before we have to get ready for Virginia Tech and a four-game road 
trip," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's Kenny Turner, who had not scored since the first half, made a 
10-foot jump shot with six seconds left for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Bryant Stith had a career-high 30 points for the Cavaliers, 
who recorded their first ACC win after four losses. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, which led by as many as 13 points in the first half, found itself 
down, 66-65, with Georgia Tech's Karl Brown at the free-throw line for a 
one-and-one with 14 seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made the first foul shot to make it 67-65, but missed his second shot. 
Brian Oliver made a 16-foot shot for Virginia with one second left to send the 
game into overtime. It was Oliver's only basket of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
A four-point play by John Crotty, who was fouled by Brown as he made a 
three-point basket, and a pair of free throws by Stith put Virginia ahead, 
75-71, with 2:35 left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott made two three-point shots in the last 1:01, the 
second with 29 seconds remaining, to make the score 79-79 before Turner made 
the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman point guard Kenny Anderson of the Yellow Jackets missed a 20-footer 
just before the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Alabama 70, No. 13 LSU 55 -- James Sanders scored 21 points and helped 
hold Chris Jackson, the Southeastern Conference's leading scorer, far below his 
average as the Crimson Tide upset the Tigers at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders and Keith Askins combined to hold Jackson, who was averaging 28.3 
points, to only 11 before he fouled out with just over a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory left Alabama, LSU and Tennessee in a three-way tie for the SEC lead 
with 4-2 records. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (11-3) closed to four points early in the second half. Then, with Alabama 
(13-4) leading, 44-39, Sanders made two baskets, one a three-point shot, David 
Benoit added a basket and Alabama was led, 51-41, with 11:20 left. The Tigers 
trailed, 59-51, with five minutes left after two baskets by Shaquille O'Neal, 
but Sanders and Melvin Cheatum scored to extend the lead for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont 64, Dartmouth 55 -- Matt Johnson and Rahim Huland El each made four 
free throws in the final minute to clinch the win at Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Roberson recorded an unusual triple-double for the Catamounts (7-8). He 
scored 20 points, had 17 rebounds and blocked 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
James Blackwell led Dartmouth (8-6) with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii 74, New Mexico 71 -- Chris Gaines scored 24 points, including nine in 
the final 10 minutes, as the Rainbows beat the Lobos in a Western Athletic 
Conference game Saturday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (15-4, 4-2 in the WAC) took its first lead of the game at 59-57 when 
Gaines made an 18-foot jump shot with 9:46 left. The Rainbows never trailed the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Longley scored 26 points for New Mexico (9-9, 1-5).
