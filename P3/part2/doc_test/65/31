After going on NCAA probation, North Carolina State couldn't get going. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Talford and Alvin West scored 18 points each and sparked an early 11-0 
run as East Tennessee State upset 15th-ranked N.C. State, 92-82, at Raleigh, 
N.C. It was the Wolfpack's first game since being put on probation last week 
for violations within the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our team that East Tennessee State is not the kind of team to get 
behind," Wolfpack Coach Jim Valvano said. "If they get ahead, they do run their 
motion offense. When you're playing them with the lead, you can force them to 
do something else. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot the ball exceptionally well. They out-quicked us and they outplayed 
us." 
</P>
<P>
East Tennessee State Coach Les Robinson agreed that his team's quick start was 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out of the gate extremely fast tonight and N.C. State didn't," he 
said. "That helped us tremendously with the confidence factor." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack (6-2), coming off an extended layoff for exams, committed 14 
turnovers and shot only 35.7% from the field in the first half as East 
Tennessee State (6-1) took a 17-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Talford had five points and West four, including a layup that capped the spurt 
and gave the Buccaneers a 20-6 lead with 13:38 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
East Tennessee State increased the lead to 46-21 on two free throws by Jerry 
Pelphrey, then the Wolfpack scored 10 consecutive points. Bryant Feggins had a 
three-point play and a follow shot and Mickey Hinnant scored on a three-point 
basket and a dunk as the Wolfpack cut the lead to 46-31 with one minute left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Syracuse 129, C.W. Post 72 -- Stephen Thompson scored 20 points and Billy 
Owens 18 as the Orangemen tied a Carrier Dome record with a 70-point first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Michael Edwards added all 13 of his points in the opening half, 
when the Orangemen (8-0) matched the 70-point first half they had last season 
against U.S. International. The 129 points were the third most in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen made 63 percent of their field-goal attempts, including six of 10 
from three-point range. Willard Mack scored 20 points to lead Division II C.W. 
Post (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Georgia Tech 109, Coastal Carolina 82 -- Dennis Scott scored 33 points 
and Brian Oliver added 27 as the Yellowjackets built a 29-point halftime lead 
and coasted to victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (6-0) are off to their best start since 1977-78, when they 
also won their first six. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Oklahoma State 79, Texas Southern 77 -- Corey Williams made both ends of 
a one-and-one with six seconds left to give the Cowboys (5-2) the victory at 
Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Price, who scored a career-high 34 points, including 15 from 
three-point range, missed a long jump shot on Texas Southern's final chance, 
and a tip-in try also missed at the buzzer. The Tigers fell to 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Arizona 83, Miami, Fla. 53 -- Wayne Womack scored 20 points and had 12 
rebounds as the Wildcats used their inside strength to win at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (3-2) dominated from the start in handing the Hurricanes (3-2) their 
second consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 66, Dartmouth 55 -- Isaac Austin scored 24 points and Mark Becker 
had five of his 13 during a 13-2 second-half run as the Sun Devils won at 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in a row for the Sun Devils (4-3). Dartmouth (3-2) 
had its three-game winning streak stopped. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 70, Oregon 54 -- Carrick DeHart scored 22 points and Eric 
McArthur ignited a second-half rally as the Gauchos (5-2) beat the Ducks (5-3) 
at Goleta, Calif.
