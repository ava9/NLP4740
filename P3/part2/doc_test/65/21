SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has authorized the Town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, to temporarily deviate for ninety (90) days
from the operating regulations governing the Padanaram Bridge mile 1.0 over the Apponagansett River in Dartmouth,
Massachusetts. This deviation limits the number of openings during peak traffic periods of the day. This deviation
will permit evaluation of the regulated opening schedule on both marine and vehicular traffic in conjunction with
the operation of new automatic, in lieu of manual, traffic gates.

The Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River between Dartmouth and South Dartmouth has a vertical clearance
of 9
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; above mean high water (MHW) and 12
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; above mean low water (MLW). The current operating regulations (33 CFR 117.587) provide that from 1 May to 31
October from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, the bridge need open on signal only on the hour and half hour. At all other times at
least six hours advance notice must be given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This deviation permits the bridge to open twice an hour, on the hour and half hour, from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 8 p.m.
to 9 p.m. and once an hour on the hour from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the spring of 1993, the Town of Dartmouth requested a change from the operating regulations to permit opening once
an hour rather than twice an hour. The town selectmen felt that the traffic congestion during peak summer months was
a result of the bridge opening every 30 minutes and was causing village commerce to suffer. The selectmen also considered
the 30 minute opening schedule a serious risk to public safety because emergency vehicles could not travel to and from
South Dartmouth during the traffic delays caused by the bridge opening every half hour. The Town of Dartmouth requested
that the bridge be required to open only once an hour for a test period of 60 days to evaluate the effects on vehicular
and marine traffic. This request was approved and the first deviation from the permanent regulations was effective
from July 1, 1993, through August 29, 1993. See (58 FR 38056; July 15, 1993). It provided an opportunity to evaluate
the effects of the deviation on marine and vehicular traffic. The Coast Guard implemented a second deviation for thirty-two
days (32) to the regulations to evaluate alternative opening time periods for the Padanaram Bridge. See (58 FR 47067;
Sep. 7, 1993). There were 29 comment letters received for these deviation periods. Twenty were in favor of the hourly
openings and nine were opposed to the change. Most of the letters in opposition indicated that the lack of facilities
to tie up vessels while waiting for openings was the main concern. The Town of Dartmouth has installed traffic signals,
automatic traffic gates, navigational lights, clearance gauges and regulation signs since the last deviation period
of 32 days was implemented.
