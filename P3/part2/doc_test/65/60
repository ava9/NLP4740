BRASH T. J. RODGERS TAKES ON THE CONSORTIUM CLUB;

U.S. MEMORIES, ONCE AGAIN DEFYING INDUSTRY GIANTS.

The sign behind T. J. Rodgers' desk reads simply: "Be reasonable, demand the 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But what happens when the best known of Silicon Valley's new generation of 
computer chip makers doesn't get what he wants? "Gee, I don't know," reflects 
his assistant. "It's never happened." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen in 1983 when Rodgers, then age 35 and with one semiconductor 
failure already under his belt, persuaded Silicon Valley's top venture 
capitalists to put up $7.5 million to back Cypress Semiconductor, another of 
his schemes to make high-performance computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen when Rodgers persuaded an unwilling partner to join Cypress, 
first peppering him with repeated calls, and then, when that didn't work, 
pleading with the reluctant man's wife. 
</P>
<P>
And it didn't happen when, after Rodgers finally pulled the San Jose-based 
chip-making company together in 1984, it managed to release its first batch of 
products in a near record eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Now the brash and irrepressible Rodgers, who at a boyish 41 still packs the 
precision-tuned presence of the ROTC cadet he was in college during the late 
1960s, is at it again. This time his goal is the undoing of U.S. Memories, the 
proposed chip-making cooperative organized by members of the top-tier of the 
nation's semiconductor industry to fend off Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dumb plan," says Rodgers, a gap-toothed avid jogger who is president 
and chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor. "Have you ever heard of an 
American consortium that helped us? If so, I'll take 50 Amtraks." 
</P>
<P>
And it would seem that despite initial odds very much stacked against him, 
Thurman John Rodgers has a fair chance of succeeding at his latest crusade. 
Thanks in part to Rodgers' loud criticisms, U.S. Memories has failed to raise 
sufficient funds and garner new supporters, and many industry experts say it 
could die before ever getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing he doesn't think he can accomplish if he puts all his talents 
behind it," says Kathleen Wright, Rodgers' ex-wife and a public health 
professor at a university in St. Louis. "He makes things happen, and he really 
believes he knows the right way and that what he does will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Although those traits have served him well in building an aggressive, 
fast-growing and profitable company that will generate sales of more than $200 
million this year, they have also earned Rodgers the enmity of many of the 
leaders of the semiconductor industry, particularly on his home turf in the 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"T. J. is about as welcome in a gathering of semiconductor makers as the 
presidents of (Japanese competitors) Fujitsu or NEC," says Richard Shaffer, 
publisher of a high-technology newsletter in New York. "He has made enemies of 
his competitors. But so what? The people who don't like him are from the 
companies he is beating." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Sanford Kane, president of U.S. Memories and the man who has taken the 
full brunt of Rodgers' blows recently, has few good words for his outspoken 
opponent. "He's just a pain in the ass," Kane says. "He's a bright fellow, all 
right, but his ego is bigger than his brain." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers delights in such comments because they tell him that he's having an 
effect and that his message that big business/government industrial ventures 
aren't the right response to Japanese competition is proving nettlesome to the 
industry's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers also is not without enlightened self-interest in this matter. He is 
clearly worried that a successful U.S. Memories could end up moving into his 
markets and become a chief rival. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers in fact is seeking a license to use the same technology to produce 
4-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips that International Business 
Machines licensed last week to U.S. Memories. He met with IBM officials in 
early November and is developing a formal proposal outlining his suggestions 
for terms and conditions of a licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Rodgers' critics doubt whether he has the financing or capacity to produce 
this advanced chip and note that his entrance into that business would deviate 
from his strategy of avoiding direct competition with Japanese giants in chip 
markets that require high-volume production. 
</P>
<P>
But what Rodgers wants, Rodgers usually gets, say his supporters and friends, 
including ex-wife Wright, who has known him since they were high school 
sweethearts in Oshkosh, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
He was the nose guard on the football team that went to the state championships 
and he later entered Dartmouth College in part because of his on-field 
abilities. When he graduated in 1970, Rodgers was No. 2 in his class with a 
double major in physics and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers earned master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at Stanford 
University where he studied under the late William Shockley, inventor of the 
transistor and founder of the electronics company that spawned virtually all 
the semiconductor firms that today reside in the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he left Stanford, Rodgers had invented a patented process for 
making computer memory chips. He took his patent to a small company in San Jose 
and tried to create a business manufacturing the chips. The venture failed 
after a few years, not because the technology didn't work, but because the 
chips weren't competitive with other products then on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Although he wanted to start over with his own business at this point, Rodgers 
was told by venture capitalists to get additional seasoning. He landed at 
Advanced Micro Devices, then a fast-growing, hard-charging operation led by 
Jerry Sanders, a flamboyant entrepreneur who many believe is Rodgers' role 
model for brash, outrageous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers left Advanced Micro Devices to organize Cypress in 1982 after being 
called by a venture capitalist doing a background check on another applicant. 
Rodgers recalls that when he was asked about the other fellow, he told the 
financier that he was the better bet. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' initial business plan for Cypress, which is still followed to the 
letter, calls for the company to pursue a variety of specialty markets for 
semiconductors. The goal is for no single chip to account for a large 
percentage of the company's business and for Cypress to pursue only those 
markets where there is little or no direct competition from the Japanese or 
large U.S. semiconductor makers. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, and perhaps most important, Cypress makes high-performance chips 
that require less power to operate and therefore run cooler in the electronic 
devices. The technology, called CMOS for complimentary metal oxide silicon, 
allows computer manufacturers to pack more chips into a smaller space, thereby 
creating smaller, yet more powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also been successful on the bottom line, becoming profitable 
within three years of formation and remaining so -- a remarkable achievement 
considering that the firm was formed at a time the chip industry was in a deep 
slump. For the first nine months of 1989, Cypress earned $22.6 million on 
revenues of $148.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Every semiconductor company should be run like his, bar none," says Sanford 
Robertson, president of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage 
that advises Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers clearly relishes the role he has carved out for himself as a 
hard-charging, no-nonsense outsider who can succeed without special treatment 
from the government or even the support of leaders from within his own 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated invitations, Cypress has yet to join the Semiconductor 
Industry Assn., one of the chip makers' leading lobbyist groups. Says Rodgers, 
a registered Republican who's more comfortable with Libertarian political 
beliefs: "We're not club members." 
</P>
<P>
What Cypress is, he says, is a group of entrepreneurs who believe they can 
build a big business without getting trapped by the traditional trappings of 
Big Business, like the other big chip companies dotting the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These semiconductor industry leaders, he says, used to think like the 
entrepreneur he is. But men like Advanced Micro Devices founder Sanders, 
National Semiconductor founder Charles Sporck and Intel co-founder Robert Noyce 
are "all big company guys now," Rodgers says. "They're not entrepreneurs. They 
have a different agenda than entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments obviously don't sit well among the large Silicon Valley 
companies. Executives there complain that Rodgers is biting the very hands that 
created the environment that feeds him. The large companies, they note, go 
after large markets and compete head-on with the Japanese, allowing Rodgers to 
pick off smaller niche markets where competition is less and profits often 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the pilot fish that follows the shark," says John Greenagle, a 
spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices. "The shark makes the kill, but isn't a 
particularly neat eater so the pilot fish get the leavings. But those pilot 
fish need the shark to make the kill. It's a symbiotic relationship. Rodgers 
just doesn't recognize it, and he's attacking the very companies that make it 
possible for Cypress to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Rodgers' critics question whether he is being intellectually honest 
when he criticizes big U.S. chip makers for coming in second to the Japanese, 
while offering himself up as an example of how to compete with the overseas 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be the first time Rodgers has been accused of speaking out of both 
sides of his mouth. Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo Alto), a Rodgers' supporter, even 
concedes that Rodgers -- an ardent opponent of government intervention in 
business -- was curiously quick to ask federal authorities to prevent U.S. 
Memories from forming on grounds that it could violate antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Intel's Noyce is quoted in a recent interview as saying that he was very much 
like Rodgers when he was in his seventh year of running his company. "His 
position is he wants to be front and center stage. I felt the same way. But T. 
J. will realize that he is dependent on the . . . industry." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Rodgers is unfazed by the criticism. "Even my friends will 
say, 'He's a cocky little guy, but he runs a good company.' "
