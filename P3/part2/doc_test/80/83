the 'glass ceiling' at Oxford University

Women stormed Oxford University's 'walls of Jericho' a century ago, when the
first women's colleges were established.
This afternoon, at a meeting in the Sheldonian Theatre of Congregation, the
university's governing body, they will attempt to breach the 'glass
ceiling'.
The rest of Britain's academic community will be watching with keen
interest. In universities across the country, women have succeeded in
gaining access to the student body on almost equal terms at the lower
levels, but the opportunities for promotion remain limited.
Only six out of 178 Oxford professors, and four of the 69 readers - the next
academic rank down - are women. This cannot be explained by low numbers of
applicants because female representation in the lower echelons is much
healthier - 12.5 per cent of university lecturers, 27.1 per cent of college
lecturers, and 42 per cent of undergraduates are women.
These figures are only slightly worse than the national averages. A survey
by the Association of University Teachers shows that only 5 per cent of
professors at 'old' universities (excluding former polytechnics which have
recently gained university status) are women, up from 3 per cent in 1989-90.
Two-thirds of current female professors have been appointed within the past
five years.
Critics say UK universities suffer from the phenomenon, noted in other
professions, of an invisible ceiling to promotion - women can enter, but
then find it very difficult to break through a layer of 'glass' to upper
tiers.
The experience of one female professor at a northern university sums up the
argument: 'Benevolent sponsorship is what a lot of us have up to a certain
level, and then the green-eyed monster comes in. Once you become a threat
unreasonable criticism is levelled at your work. It's very hard to
identify.'
Now, a group of 79 Oxford academics believes it has spotted systematic
discrimination, on top of the cultural barriers. The academics have forced a
vote in Congregation, which this afternoon will decide whether Oxford's
current system for apportioning funds and promotions is discriminatory.
The move follows a decision by Oxford to use the Pounds 100,000 available
for promotions this year to create new professorships, rather than
readerships for which the money had originally been intended.
The university did so because it felt that Oxford academics would enjoy more
clout nationally and internationally if they carried the title of
'professor'.
But an article in a university journal, Oxford Gazette, by two Oxford
lawyers, Sandra Fredman and John Gardner suggests that the decision to
create more professorships discriminates against women, because few women
are senior enough realistically to challenge for a professorship.
The article adds that the decision could fall foul of the Sex Discrimination
Act, and 'offers a splendid opportunity for a test case'. It claims that the
disproportionate number of men gaining promotion 'might be accepted by the
courts as sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination'.
In its defence, a spokesman for Oxford said four women have been appointed
to established chairs in the past two years, and that Oxford has started
from 'a very low base' - until 1979, two-thirds of its colleges admitted
only men.
The lawyers have won support from outside Oxford. Mr David Triesman, AUT
general secretary, describes the Oxford statistics as 'more like the dark
ages than the dark blues', but points out that the picture is hardly
brighter elsewhere in the UK. He adds, for example, that female professors
are paid less on average than their male counterparts, according to an AUT
survey.
Mr Triesman says government funding councils should take account of
universities' success in promoting women when distributing grants.
Yet woman academics appear more concerned by issues of culture than by pay
disparities. Many seem to agree that positive discrimination and quotas are
not the answer. Rather, their focus seems to be on reversing the culture of
British universities which many finding intimidating, as reflected by their
academic underperformance - Oxford women are only half as likely to get a
first as Oxford men, while nationally the proportion rises to two-thirds.
At higher academic levels women often fall victim to unconscious prejudice
from professorial committees, which are also male-dominated. Both professor
Joan Busfield, pro-vice-chancellor of Essex University, and Professor Ruth
Lister, of Bradford University, use the same word to describe the problem:
gravitas. Senior men are more likely to see this quality in other senior men
than in women.
Professor Lister says: 'It often comes down to man's judgment of gravitas.
You can see how sometimes women may not fit the implicit criteria, and which
may push male selectors towards male candidates.' Ms Emma Westcott, a
student at Oxford, expresses this more passionately: 'The problem is that
the system has been built around men for 750 years. Are we prepared to
change ourselves to reflect the diversity we now have?'
