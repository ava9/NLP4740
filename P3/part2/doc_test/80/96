A recent Harvard Business Review article suggested that there are two basic 
types of women managers -- those who put career first and those who need a 
flexible schedule to take care of their children. The article, written by 
Felice N. Schwartz, stirred controversy by recommending that companies should 
accommodate women with these differing goals by establishing separate 
"career-primary" and "career-and-family" tracks for women. But would such a 
system really help women meet their career and personal goals? Or would it 
pigeonhole women and institutionalize unequal treatment on the job? Free-lance 
writer Meredith Chen raised these questions with a variety of authorities, and 
excerpts from her interviews follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Felice N. Schwartz, founder and president of the researcher organization 
Catalyst: 
</P>
<P>
"The article I wrote for the Harvard Business Review is an essay that is my 
commentary as an informed, concerned person who has headed a research 
organization for over 27 years. We have probably done more research at Catalyst 
than any other group or research organization on the subject of women. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of women need to work out of economic necessity. I think 
also that a vast majority of women would like to have the opportunity to 
participate more actively in the lives of their children than they can within 
the present structure. I think that because of the new demographic realities 
and because women are so prepared to make a contribution to corporate 
management, companies now are going to enable women to have the flexibility 
that they need. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict companies will enable women to work on whatever schedule works for 
them and to come back part-time. . . . The thing that I think is great about 
that is that women will be able to be fully productive during those hours that 
they do work and they will be able to take the time for parenting that they 
want to take. Even poor women will be able to afford to cut back somewhat and 
have prorated pay and not be deprived of the opportunity to be with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that corporations aren't ready yet to respond to men. I think what 
they condone for women they condemn, or at least look at as a lack of 
commitment, from men. But . . . there is no question in my mind that the single 
most significant, cost-effective thing that companies can do to release the 
productivity of women is to legitimize and facilitate the role that men want 
increasingly to take in family life. I think that what they do in response to 
women, vis-a-vis flexibility, will be a model for what they do with men." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome M. Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute research group: 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism of Felice Schwartz's piece is a little bit of an over-reaction. 
I think to some extent, she was defining the reality of what's happening. What 
we see here is the leading edge of a trend of women with professional careers 
who are becoming a predominant part of the American labor force, trying to 
adjust the conflicts between work and family. Part of what we see in her 
definition of the two-track phenomenon is an expression of the fact that women 
need wider choices than men in their professional careers because they are not 
relieved of the child-rearing responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of being derailed from a career, but rather going on a 
slower pace. What we are seeing is an elaboration of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The article demonstrates the tremendous impact of the feminization of American 
workers. Large employers have been slow to adapt to the changing fact of women 
in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the mommy track as a permanent track. I see it as a temporary 
sidetrack for a large number of women who are highly motivated. Women who are 
not allowed by the corporation to get back on track will be apt to leave and go 
elsewhere where they are not treated like second-class citizens. The point is 
that if you are going to get this track, it has to be by choice and 
administered with equity." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Morrison, co-author of "Breaking the Glass Ceiling" and director of the 
Center for Creative Leadership: 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Felice has done is to assume some givens. Instead of trying to 
change the way some things are done, she has accepted that and proposed some 
solutions that fall into existing givens. Those givens are not entirely 
acceptable, and I think that is where the flak has come from. People are saying 
that women shouldn't have to be solely responsible for parenting. The bulk of 
her article assumes that women are going to continue to assume the 
responsibility for child-rearing as well as child-bearing. A way to help women 
out is to share the responsibility more fairly between two parents so that 
there doesn't have to be a mommy track. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports: 
</P>
<P>
"I think that what Felice Schwartz was really saying was that you should 
identify the fast-track people, the fast-track women who, in fact, don't want 
to drop out and have children, and make sure that you don't have any false 
barriers in their way. There is almost an assumption in business that these 
bright women are going to drop out after 10 years and have children. If you 
have some who are identified as not going to drop out, you can give them more 
responsibility and training and keep them going up. It is a positive if you can 
identify those few that will go straight up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a landmark subject, and it has not been talked about publicly 
before. I think the reason is that on the one hand the feminist point of view 
had been that women and men essentially are equal and there should be no 
discussion of differentiation. In big business, there is a great concern over 
being labeled anti-feminist. Men just don't want to do that, they'd rather just 
duck the issue. Consequently, it really took a prominent woman with impeccable 
credentials to bring the subject to the table. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be men who want to go on a daddy track, but there is a real world to 
consider here. Men accept the idea that a woman might take time off to take 
care of a baby. At the same time, they would not understand why another man 
would take time off, and men know that. They know that it would be out of step 
and that is just the cultural bias. That is just the reality. It may be a good 
idea, but I don't think at this point in time many men would do it." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.): 
</P>
<P>
"When you have something in a journal as prestigious as the Harvard Business 
Review citing two studies that they won't name or tell the methodology -- but 
that says that women that have families cost (businesses) more than men and 
therefore it is OK to have a second track -- I think we should jump on them. 
</P>
<P>
"The new government statistics say that young girls in school are five times 
more likely to be the sole support of their families as young boys. What 
happens is that women know that and they are terribly conscientious about their 
jobs, be they military or anything else. The way I read Schwartz's article is 
that she is saying that we professional women are just tired of being held back 
by you ladies who insist on having children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing to me is that (Schwartz) is getting back to the thing I 
thought we buried years ago and that is you can't have a family and a career. 
She is polarizing women and everybody loves it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very confusing and the most surprising thing is that Harvard would print 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk O. Hanson, a corporate ethics consultant who teaches a business ethics 
course at Stanford University that considers the trade-offs between work and 
family: 
</P>
<P>
"Many companies are structured in a way that makes it difficult for women to be 
on the fast track. The clearest indicator of that is the marital status of 
top-level executives. Some 95% of top-level male executives are married. Only 
50% of top-level women executives are married. 
</P>
<P>
"The dual track makes me uncomfortable if it is available only to women. In 
fairness, it needs to be available to both men and women. One reason that it 
should be available to men is so that it doesn't stigmatize women, and so that 
it serves as encouragement for men to take on more of the child-rearing 
responsibilities. It is inevitable that it will be primarily a vehicle for 
women to manage the conflicting pressures of family life and work. 
</P>
<P>
"In many companies a peculiar brand of macho has taken over where an 
unnecessary standard of work is the norm. Many women who object to the mommy 
track want to be more macho than the macho males who have run business over the 
last hundred years. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach a lot of MBAs who exhibit a peculiar brand of macho that leads them to 
believe they can do it all, have a happy family life, work 70 hours a week and 
achieve unlimited corporate success. There are trade-offs, and this is a 
fundamental ethical decision that every business person makes whether male or 
female. 
</P>
<P>
"Current evidence is that women are voting with their feet when it comes to 
making work and family trade-offs. Even among our most professionally oriented 
women, there is strong evidence that they chose to modify their working hours 
in order to put family priorities ahead at certain times in their careers. Few 
of them see and have the opportunity to reintegrate onto the fast track, and 
their talents, at the peak period of their careers, are lost to the companies 
that might have taken advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
R. Gordon McGovern, chief executive of Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to try to relieve some of the tension and pressures that keep you 
from getting at some of the talent that is in the female and male work force. 
There are specific cases where people have come here because we had a 
child-care center or have stayed because we had it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that job sharing is something we have to get accustomed to. There is 
not resistance to it philosophically. It is the problem of putting the time and 
energy into organizing it to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Felice Schwartz that maternity should not be the thing that cuts 
women off from getting to the top. . . . In the United States, 45% of our 
company's total work force is women, and 23% of our management positions are 
women. . . . I don't think it is enough."
