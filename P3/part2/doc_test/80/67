<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gnassingbe Eyadema; </F>
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Togolese, the parliamentary election campaign has 
ended. You will vote tomorrow in a sovereign manner as free and 
responsible citizens. I noticed that the Fourth Republic's 
first parliamentary election campaign took place peacefully; 
freedom of speech for all was respected. This is proof of your 
political maturity. Everyone was able to express himself fully 
and was granted the same access to the state media. Few 
countries in the world can boast of showing such a high degree 
of democratic principle. I wish to thank all those who assisted 
in organizing elections -- the International Monitoring 
Committee; foreign countries which sent us experts and election 
material; the National Electoral Commission, which worked with 
all the political forces through consensus; the government and 
the administration which worked relentlessly so that everything 
will be ready on time; and the Supreme Court, which is carrying 
out its constitutional mission by respecting people's rights. I 
must not fail to thank all those citizens who helped in issuing 
and distributing voter cards. Their action is even more worthy 
considering the fact that violence caused by people from outside 
tried to destabilize our country once again; it caused death and 
desolation in our capital and its surroundings. 
  The choice you are about to make is a decisive one for our 
country. I will respect whichever choice you make in accordance 
with the democratic law established by our Constitution. I am 
pleased that the elections will be held in the presence of 
several international observers. We are happy to welcome them. 
We also thank them for the selfless contribution they have been 
making to our democratic development. Our democracy is 
transparent so they are free to carry out their important 
mission the way they wish. On the eve of the elections, I wish 
to remind you of certain basic principles in my capacity as head 
of state and guarantor of national unity. I will direct all my 
energy to ensuring that democratic regulations, which require 
everyone to respect the Constitution, are followed. 
  After this long transitional period, our country needs 
stability and order. One cannot call for democracy and resort 
to violence at the same time. Similarly, one cannot call for 
respect for the law of the ballot boxes and incite people to 
rebellion at the same time. As a head of state, elected through 
universal suffrage for a five-year term of office, I will assume 
my high mission by serving you. My duty is to enable our 
country to resume its march forward on a sound footing with the 
contribution of the new assembly to be elected. I hope that 
your choice will enable our dear Togo to recover political 
stability without which nothing good can be undertaken. There 
is no magic solution to our problems. We have the solution, you 
have the solution, and it demands that each of us should get 
back to work and that the people's interests prevail over those 
of the political class. I hope that while voting freely and 
sovereignly, you will keep in mind these two periods: the 24 and 
1/2 years that we spend together and the three years of 
transition that we are currently going through. At the end of 
this transition, do not fail to support all those who are ready 
to help our country set back to work. 
  Democracy is not anarchy, laxity, or confiscation of the 
people's will. Democracy is discipline and the desire to serve 
the people. It is also self-denial and mutual respect. In 
democracy each citizen can express his preferences, but a 
multiparty system must not make people forget the national 
interest. Tomorrow's poll should enable people to express our 
different leanings, but in the absolute respect for our unity as 
well as ethnic and geographic peculiarities. There may be among 
us different leanings, but there is only one people. I hope 
that each Togolese will remember this before going to the poll. 
After the elections, my main concern will be to strive for 
reconciliation among all the sons of our people and to enable 
each of us to participate in the activities of national life. 
Before concluding, I should not forget to stress that an 
election is also a peaceful competition. 
  I would like to wish each of the candidates good luck, and 
may the best win. To you fellow countrymen and women, I wish 
that you choose the candidates that you will deem the best. I 
call on you to eagerly go the polls and do this in a calm 
atmosphere as well as in discipline so that in the days ahead 
our country can proudly recover all its lost positions in the 
comity of nations. 
  Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!
