  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- Minister of the Interior 
'Ali Mohammad Besharati met the Emir of Qatar Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani in Doha Sunday said the water supply project 
from Iran to Qatar is now past its feasibility study and was 
going ahead as originally planned. 
  He also suggested a concerted move by the petroleum 
exporting 
countries to reverse the downward trend of the oil price. 
  The emir of Qatar welcomed the proposal saying he would do 
everything possible, including a production cut, to ensure that 
oil prices would rise. 
  Besharati conveyed to Al Thani the greetings of Iranian 
President Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and said 
that the ties between the two countries are based on mutual 
respect and non-interference in each other's affairs. 
  He said that the recent setting up of the Bushehr-Doha 
shipping line between the two countries should speed up trade 
and related ties between the two countries. 
  The Qatari ruler welcomed the idea of Iranian exports to his 
country and extended an invitation from Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Rafsanjani to visit his emirate. 
  Later today, the Iranian minister met the Qatari heir 
apparent Shaykh Bin-Hamad Khalifah Al Thani and discussed 
promotion of economic and political ties between the two 
countries. 
  In the meeting which was also attended by the Qatari 
interior 
minister, Shaykh Hamad called for promotion of Tehran-Doha ties 
in accordance with international laws, and appreciated Iran's 
support for Qatar's principled stands. 
  He also referred to Iran's relations with the United Arab 
Emirates, saying Qatar was making efforts to prevent 
exploitation of the issue of the three Persian Gulf islands, 
although it appreciates iran's sincere stand in this regard. 
  Regional countries should cooperate with each other and 
should realize that economic development depends on security in 
the region, said the Qatari heir apparent. 
  In the evening, Besharati accompanied by his Qatari 
counterpart visted the police headquarters.
