  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has received a cable of 
congratulations from His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, the amir of Qatar, on the occasion of the signing of the 
Yemeni document of accord, which was held under the auspices of 
His Majesty King Husayn in Amman on Sunday, 20 February. 
  In the cable, his highness expressed his warmest 
congratulations to his majesty on the success of Jordanian 
efforts to reconcile the viewpoints of officials in the Yemeni 
leadership. He said: As we express our solidarity with your 
majesty's efforts toward cementing the rift in the Arab nation's 
facade and toward closing its ranks and uniting its word, we ask 
God the almighty to grant you continued health and happiness and 
your fraternal people more progress and prosperity. 
  His Majesty also received congratulatory cables on this 
pan-Arab occasion from His Highness Hamad Bin-Khalifah Al Thani, 
Qatar's heir apparent, and from the Lebanese defense minister in 
which they expressed their appreciation for his majesty's 
efforts in reuniting the Yemeni family and reinforcing Arab 
solidarity at this critical stage in the history of the Arab 
nation.
