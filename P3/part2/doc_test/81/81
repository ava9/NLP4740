Plan To Supply Israel With Gas"] 
  [Text] Washington--Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Than announced yesterday that the development of 
Qatari-Israeli relations is linked with the scale of progress in 
the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He denied 
that Qatar's policy toward Israel is aimed against any of its 
neighbors. However, he said that this policy is independent and 
that there are "differences between us and the other Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] states in this connection, but they 
are not major differences." The Qatari minister confirmed that 
he met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last Sunday. 
He also confirmed that Qatar is making contacts with Israel 
regarding a natural gas deal, but it will not begin 
implementation before progress is achieved in the peace process 
with Syria and Lebanon. He indicated that Qatar may 
independently decide to abolish the second- and third-degree 
boycott of Israel if progress occurs in the negotiations. 
However, he associated the abolition of the main boycott with a 
decision from the Arab League. 
  In a news conference he held yesterday after his talks with 
U.S. officials, especially with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Shaykh Hamad said that Qatar has special interests 
in developing the peace process and making it a success. He 
expressed his hope that progress would be made on the Syrian and 
Lebanese tracks in 1994. He said: "We hope that the peace 
process will lead to the establishment of a new order and a new 
Middle East free from bloodshed...." 
  He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the 
Palestinians 
and Israelis have sat together to resolve their differences 
directly and with support from the United States and Russia. He 
said that at the end of April Qatar will host a round of the 
multilateral negotiations and will receive Israeli diplomats 
like other diplomats. "And we feel that our people will welcome 
that, because the aim is peace and an end to bloodshed." 
  Asked whether he had managed to conclude a gas deal with the 
Israelis in London, he said: "True, a meeting was held in 
London, but so far we have not concluded a gas deal...." He 
pointed out that the Israelis know well "Qatar's position and 
its terms, as we clearly said that we want progress to be made 
in the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks..." He 
added, "We are thinking about a deal, but nothing has been 
achieved." 
  Asked whether his country "is playing with fire" with its 
neighbors in terms of its policy with Israel, the Qatari 
minister said that "it is exciting sometimes to play with fire. 
But this should be done safely. However, we do not believe 
that our relations with Israel are aimed against any of our 
neighbors. Qatar has good relations with Iraq and Iran and also 
with the other GCC states. Of course we have some problems with 
our neighbors, but it does not mean that we are doing things 
deliberately...." 
  Asked whether Qatar consulted or coordinated with its GCC 
neighbors over its new policy toward Israel, he said: "It is 
our policy and I can only speak about Qatar...." He said that 
"we have differences with the GCC states, but they are not major 
differences, and as I said, it is our policy." 
  Shaykh Hamad disclosed that he had discussed with 
Christopher 
the issue of Qatar's relations with Iran and Iraq and that he 
had told the U.S. secretary that "Iran is one of Qatar's 
neighbors. We clearly told the secretary of state that we wish 
to establish good relations with Iran...so that the opposite 
will emerge." [sentence as published] He said that Secretary 
Christopher understood the Qatari position because Qatar and 
Iran are "close neighbors."
