  [Text] Doha -- Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani opened the fifth multilateral 
meeting of the Middle East Arms Control and Regional Security 
working group at the Doha Sheraton Hotel this morning. 
  The four-day meeting is attended by 220 representatives from 
43 countries. His Excellency Muhammad al-Za'abi, United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] ambassador to Qatar, heads the UAE delegation to 
the meetings. 
  In a speech opening the meeting, the Qatari foreign minister 
said that he hopes that the meeting will succeed, and that this 
meeting confirms the desire to effectively participate in the 
Middle East peace process. He said this meeting falls within 
the framework of Qatar's eagerness to render this peaceful 
process a success and of its continued participation in the 
multilateral talks, which basically deal with the post-peace 
stage. He explained that the aspired peace is one that 
restores all the occupied Arab territories to their owners, 
foremost holy Jerusalem, as well as restoring the Palestinians' 
legitimate national rights, including the right to 
self-determination.
