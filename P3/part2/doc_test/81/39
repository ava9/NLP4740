  [Text] Qatar has rejected America's request to sever ties 
with the Islamic republic of Iran. Sharjah's AL-KHALIJ 
newspaper has printed a detailed report on the visit by Qatar's 
foreign minister, Shaykh Hamad bin-Jabbur al-Thani, to America, 
and his meetings with American officials, including Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  The report states: Despite America's caution to Qatar about 
its ties with Iran, and the request to Qatar to sever these 
ties, the Qatari foreign minister, in his meeting with 
reporters, described the stances of his country vis-a-vis 
strengthening relations with the Islamic republic of Iran and 
other regional countries. 
  According to this newspaper, the American secretary of state 
called Iran a dangerous country and cautioned Qatar against 
moving close to Iran. In response to Christopher's request, the 
Qatari foreign minister described Qatar's regional situation and 
its interests. He stressed: Qatar will not, under any 
circumstances, change its policy toward Iran, and will make 
efforts to establish the best possible relations with the 
Islamic republic of Iran.
