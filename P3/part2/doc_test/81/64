  [Text] The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali this morning. It reviewed Arab and 
domestic activities that took place in the Kingdom during the 
past few days, particularly the results of yesterday's visit to 
Jordan by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  The JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has learned that the prime 
minister 
explained to the council that during this visit, the negotiating 
position on all fronts was reviewed, with an emphasis on the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo, which were held with 
an Egyptian participation to arrive at an agreement on the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  Dr. al-Majali indicated that 'Amr Musa explained that there 
are three major points which are still being negotiated between 
the Palestinians and Israelis. The first is supervision of 
traffic over bridges and sovereignty over them. The second is 
the size of the Jericho region from which the Israeli Army will 
withdraw. The third point is the security control of border 
areas which will be evacuated, especially in the Gaza Strip. 
During the visit, Musa affirmed that contrary to the Israeli 
Government's allegation, the Palestinian and Israeli sides have 
not reached an agreement in Cairo, but that a paper was 
presented by the Israeli side which proposed that the 
Palestinian side study it and agree on it with competent PLO 
authorities. During Musa's visit, bilateral relations were also 
discussed, especially with respect to the meetings of the Higher 
Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee. It was agreed to activate 
this committee and to convene it under the chairmanship of both 
countries' prime ministers. In accordance with the regular 
order of its meetings, the committee will hold its next meeting 
in Amman soon. 
  During the session, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for foreign affairs, reviewed the most important results that 
have been reached on the bilateral level with the Qatari side 
during Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir 
Al Thani's recent visit to Jordan. It was agreed to set up a 
joint bilateral committee under the Jordanian minister of state 
for affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to discuss all 
bilateral issues of interest to the two countries, including 
economic, political, and media issues, as well as joint 
investments and cooperation between the private sectors in both 
countries.
