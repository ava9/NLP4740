  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Thani has stated that the Arms Control Committee of 
the multilateral talks will meet on 2 May in Doha, Qatar, adding 
that an invitation will be sent to Israel to attend the meeting. 
  Speaking to reporters here this afternoon on the sidelines 
of 
the Arab League Council meetings, the Qatari minister said that 
during his meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf yesterday, he urged Iraq to implement the Security 
Council resolutions on the Gulf war so that the embargo imposed 
on Iraq could be lifted. He noted that contacts are under way 
to study Iraq's proposal to form a popular committee from the 
Gulf states to visit Iraq to resolve the problem of Kuwaiti 
prisoners there. The results of these contacts, he added, are 
not clear yet. 
  On reports that Qatar will extend a natural gas pipeline to 
Israel, the Qatari foreign minister said: The Israeli side has 
proposed this matter to us but we told them that we could not 
talk about it as long as Israel is occupying Arab territory.
