  [Text] Doha, 5 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina visited the Umm Sa'id industrial zone 
located on the outskirts of the capital city of Qatar, as part 
of his two-day visit to this Persian Gulf state. The tour began 
with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that 
utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million 
tons of steel in 1993. 
  A management delegation representing this steel company 
visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing 
cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban 
foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's 
willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field 
in which the island has a considerable infrastructure. 
  Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the 
Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is 
considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the 
Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be 
received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief 
of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign 
relations, health, and finance. 
  In addition, tomorrow Robaina will officially inaugurate the 
new Cuban Embassy in Doha, which will be in charge of relations 
with Oman and other Gulf emirates with which Cuba recently 
established diplomatic relations. Relations between Havana and 
Doha received significant encouragement during the last few 
months as a result of the visit of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani to Cuba.
