  [Text] Gulf sources have disclosed that a meeting was held 
in London last Sunday [23 January] between Qatari Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and Minister of Energy Shahal [title as received]. 
They discussed ways to supply Israel with gas, an issue which 
AL-ANWAR has mentioned before. 
  The sources said the talks took place without the knowledge 
or consent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose territory the 
gas pipes must pass through to reach Israel. 
  Asked by AL-ANWAR of his view on these talks, a Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] official said he had not heard about 
these contacts and meetings before. Any developments between 
Qatar and Israel, he added, are absolutely not in accord with 
GCC policy.
