  [Text] [Iraqi] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf 
met in Cairo yesterday with Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Mohamed Salah Dembri. The foreign minister briefed the Algerian 
minister on the positive atmosphere and stands that have emerged 
on the part of most of the members of the Security Council, thus 
confirming Iraq's sound position and its call on the council to 
fulfill its obligations in Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, after 
Iraq has fulfilled all its international obligations toward it. 
  They also discussed issues related to joint Arab action and 
Arab developments, in addition to relations between Iraq and 
Algeria. 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf also met with 
Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Jasim Bin-Hamd Al Thani. He 
briefed him on Iraqi ties with the United Nations and the UN 
Special Commission, and the fact that there is now a large 
circle calling for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq, 
represented in some Security Council members and the 
international community in general. 
  During the meeting, they discussed brotherly relations 
between the two countries. 
  During the two meetings, the Algerian and Qatari foreign 
ministers reiterated their countries' constant position calling 
for lifting the blockade on the Iraqi people, especially since 
Iraq has implemented its obligations per Security Council 
Resolution 687 and cooperated fully with the Security Council 
and the Special Commission. 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf is currently 
visiting Cairo to attend the meetings of the foreign ministers 
of the Non-Aligned Movement. 
  The foreign minister also met in Cairo with the foreign 
minister of Rwanda who reviewed the motives for foreign -- 
especially U.S. -- intervention in his country. 
  The Rwandan foreign minister said the United States seeks to 
impose its hegemony on Rwanda and appoint its agents in the 
region as part of a plan to strike at international liberation 
movements and use force to impose a fait accompli in 
contradiction to the aspirations of nations. 
  The foreign minister briefed his Rwandan counterpart on 
Iraq's efforts at the Security Council to have the unjust 
blockade lifted and on the positive indications that started to 
emerge within the council. 
  The Rwandan foreign minister praised Iraq's principled stand 
in the face of U.S. hegemony and its resistance to all kinds of 
aggression, as well as its people's steadfastness in the face of 
the unjust blockade. 
  The Republic of Rwanda is a member of the Security Council 
in 
its current session. It had called for lifting the Iraq 
blockade at the council.
