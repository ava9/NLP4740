  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Envoy to Yemen 
Lakhdar Ibrahimi said here today that there has been "positive 
and encouraging progress" on the Yemen issue. 
  Before leaving the UAE capital for Doha, Qatar, Ibrahimi 
said 
there are some progress since both Sanaa and Aden have agreed to 
resume the former joint military committee and add new members 
to it. 
  The U.N. envoy was on a visit to Yemen and other Gulf and 
Arab countries for implementing the U.N. Security Council 
Resolution 924 for ending the five-week long Yemeni fighting. 
  The U.N. envoy said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
has 
accepted Aden's suggestion of keeping foreign members and 
increasing new members in the committee. 
  Ibrahimi said U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
today reappealed to the rival forces in Yemen to abide by the 
Security [Council] resolution of truce. 
  Commenting on his meeting with leaders of the southern part 
of Yemen in Mukalla on Monday, Ibrahimi said both Sanaa and Aden 
had accepted the cease fire suggestion, but it was regrettable 
that there was no truce, though the intensity of fighting has 
decreased. 
  Both Sanaa and Aden accepted the idea of dialogue, but both 
of them had their conditions, he added. 
  Ibrahimi denied the information reported by some news 
agencies that he planted in Mukalla a suggestion of settling up 
a Yemen federation or confederation, saying that to discuss the 
matter is too early. 
  Today, Ibrahimi also met with UAE President Zayed Bin-Sultan 
Al Nahayyan. 
  The envoy arrived here Monday night and left here today for 
Qatar. 
  Latest reports reaching here from Doha said Qatari Amir 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani received this evening the 
U.N. envoy in Doha.
