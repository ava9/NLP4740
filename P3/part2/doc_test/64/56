  [Text] Guatemala City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- A former officer 
of the defunct Panama Defense Forces (FDP) said here today that 
Panamanian military officers exiled in Guatemala could return to 
Panama following the election victory of opposition presidential 
candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
  "We will return when the victory of Perez Balladares in the 
general elections held this Sunday is confirmed," former FDP 
Lieutenant Carlos Alberto Rumbo told NOTIMEX. 
  The military officer said the young officers of the defunct 
Panamanian Army "will return to give back to Panama its dignity, 
which General Manuel Noriega, President Guillermo Endara, and 
the Americans trampled on." 
  At least 10 Panamanian military officers sought exile in 
various Latin American countries following the U.S. invasion in 
December 1989, which overthrew Noriega. Noriega was later 
sentenced to 40-years of incarcaration in the United States for 
drug trafficking activities. 
  Rumbo said he fled Panama after participating in a 
post-invasion, uprising by National Police members against 
President Endara; an uprising which Endara described as a "coup 
attempt." 
  Perez Balladares, from the United People coalition headed by 
the Democratic Revolutionary Party, became the virtual winner of 
the Panamanian presidential elections. 
  Perez Balladares, popularly known as "El Toro", has remained 
in first place with approximately 33 percent of the vote since 
the Electoral Tribunal (TE) started providing election results 
yesterday. 
  After 89 percent of the votes were counted, the TE placed 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber from the ruling Arnulfist Party in 
second place with 28 percent of the votes. She was followed by 
Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement, who gained 17 percent 
of the vote. 
  Regarding these figures, Guatemalan analyst Walter Robles 
said "Toro's" victory was the result of his ability to renew 
Panamanians' affinity for the policies of the PRD founder, the 
late General Omar Torrijos. 
  During the election campaign, PRD leaders were able to 
remove 
the party from the shadow of deposed General Manuel Noriega, who 
became Panama's "strongman" following the death of Torrijos in 
1981, according to Robles. 
  Panamanian writer Rafael Ruiloba said the new government 
must 
find the best way to lead the country down a nationalist path 
and the best way to recover the dignity lost following the 
humiliating U.S. invasion. 
  In San Salvador, the country's media reported on the virtual 
victory of the PRD candidate in Sunday's elections, in which 
deputies and mayors were also elected. 
  Conservative newspaper LA PRENSA GRAFICA printed on its 
front 
page: "Perez Balladares Virtual Winner of Elections in Panama," 
and right-wing newspaper EL DIARIO DE HOY published: "Balladares 
Wins Elections in Panama."
