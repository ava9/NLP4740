GETTING NORIEGA OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today was to have been the day Panama celebrated the return of genuine 
democracy -- the day a new president popularly elected last May 7 was to be 
inaugurated. Instead, Panamanians will mark this date facing the grim reality 
that their country is still controlled by a thug, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega tried to steal the May election for his hand-picked candidate, then 
annulled the electoral process when it became apparent he could not produce 
enough phony votes to outweigh the support his opponents received. Noriega's 
supporters then began attacking his opponents, who took to the streets in 
peaceful protest against the electoral fraud. It looked for a time as if the 
international outcry that followed those bloody beatings would finally lead 
Noriega to give up power. But four months later that hasn't happened. Noriega's 
foreign critics did not know how patient and cunning he could be. 
</P>
<P>
This week the general began the process of selecting puppets who will fill 
posts in an interim government. They will take office today, and will keep him 
in the pivotal post of commander of Panama's military, the most powerful 
institution in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For two years President Reagan tried to pressure Noriega by using economic 
sanctions that badly damaged the Panamanian economy. President Bush extended 
Reagan's unsuccessful strategy, with one notable exception. After the May 
elections were nullified, Bush wisely called on the Organization of American 
States to mediate the political crisis in Panama, but it botched the job. A 
four-member OAS commission sent to Panama barely spent any time in the country 
and allowed Noriega to bog it down debating legal technicalities. Last week the 
commission issued an inconclusive report insisting it needed more time to make 
more progress. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated OAS diplomats also pointed an accusing finger at the United States, 
claiming that U.S. military commanders in the Canal Zone did not make things 
any easier for the mediators by continually ordering their troops into armed 
standoffs with the Panamanian Defense Forces. Their point is well taken. At a 
time when Bush insists that this country's argument is with Noriega and not the 
defense forces, it seems contradictory and even foolhardy for U.S. forces to 
stand toe-to-toe with Panamanian soldiers, as has happened several times in the 
last few weeks. Even the slightest U.S. military action carries negative 
overtones in Latin America, and especially in Panama. It makes Noriega look 
like a nationalist standing up to the gringo bully -- the only stance in which 
he can win. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Bush must now resist calls for even tougher sanctions against 
Panama, such as threats to abrogate the Panama Canal treaties or to use 
military force against Noriega. Force would surely get rid of Noriega, but it 
would create other problems throughout Latin America. It was reassuring that 
Bush said Thursday that he intends to continue applying multilateral diplomatic 
pressure on Noriega. But this time, it must be pursued more firmly and 
consistently than the OAS did in the first go-round. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than negotiating with the dictator, the OAS should put a permanent 
human-rights team in Panama to document whatever repressive measures Noriega 
uses to keep dissatisfaction with his rule from boiling over. That team would 
provide the bill of particulars that can be used to further isolate Noriega, as 
surely as other international pariahs like Libya and Iran are isolated. It 
would keep diplomatic pressure on the dictator until he again oversteps the 
bounds of decency, as he did in May. Then the campaign to oust him can be 
renewed with greater vigor. Until then, however, Noriega's opponents will have 
to display the same patience and cunning that he has shown these last few 
months. Waiting Noriega out won't be pleasant or easy. But given his past 
crudeness and brutality, Noriega will surely make the mistake that helps bring 
him down.
