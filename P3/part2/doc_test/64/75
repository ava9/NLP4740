<TEXT>

Thousands of Panamanians chanted, applauded, sang and wept Sunday in support of 
the Roman Catholic Church's emergence as a leader in the struggle to force Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega from power. 
</P>
<P>
In Masses throughout the country, priests and ordinary church-goers read a 
pastoral letter signed by all 10 of Panama's bishops attacking Noriega for 
trying to steal last week's presidential election -- first through massive 
fraud, then by nullifying the vote -- and for violently assaulting his 
political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In wealthy churches with organs and choirs and in modest chapels where a single 
guitarist accompanied hymns, the clergy condemned Noriega for "violating the 
popular will" by refusing to accept the apparent overwhelming election victory 
of the Democratic Alliance for Civic Opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"What moral justification can be made for firing bullets and beating men and 
women whose only crime was to peacefully demand their rights?" the bishops' 
letter asked. "What moral justification can be made for terrifying the hungry 
masses with a hateful and false nationalism that neither respects nor 
recognizes the rights and safety of the rest of the Panamanians?" 
</P>
<P>
In demanding that Noriega turn over power to the opposition "in recognition of 
the will of the people" as expressed in the elections, the bishops said that 
"not to do so would be a sin of conscience." 
</P>
<P>
The pastoral letter was especially critical of the Noriega regime for ordering 
paramilitary and security forces to attack opposition leaders last Wednesday, 
when Democratic Alliance leaders Guillermo Endara, Ricardo Arias Calderon and 
Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten so badly they had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded condemnation of the military regime marked a turning point 
for the church in Panama, a country that is 94% Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the church was largely noted for its caution and reluctance to 
criticize Noriega, let alone call for his removal from power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Priests Are Foreigners 
</P>
<P>
Apart from a historical conservatism, reasons for the low profile include the 
makeup of the clergy. About 75% of the country's estimated 330 priests are 
foreigners. Required to renew their visas every two months, "priests feel 
pressure and constant threat," according to Father Fernando Guardia, a leader 
of the anti-Noriega clergy. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, as official corruption and Noriega's abuse of power, including a 
growing intimidation of the clergy, increased, the church began speaking and 
acting against the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
Priests spoke out against the government's failure to investigate crimes 
allegedly committed by military officers and other government officials, and 
then last month the church announced that because of concern over the honesty 
of the presidential election, it planned to conduct its own independent count 
of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was that count that helped convince diplomats and international 
observers that Noriega's candidate had been swamped in the election and that 
his government's claim of victory was a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence of the church as a power against the regime, some 
priests are worried that the political leaders are not keeping up with the 
dissatisfaction of the people nor applying enough pressure to force Noriega 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has opted for a political solution," said one important priest, 
"but what kind of solution can you get from a dictator?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Nerve 
</P>
<P>
The comment mirrors assessments from many diplomats and observers that the 
opposition and its followers have never shown the stomach or nerve to overturn 
someone as determined to keep power as Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Noriega made a threat of force, whether he used it or not, the 
opposition generally folded," said one diplomat. "No one expects them to get 
killed, but waving handkerchiefs, milling around and then going home as soon as 
troops show up won't get them power." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the singing, the chants and the cheers, Sunday's show of support for 
the Democratic Alliance never really got out of the pews and into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
With Endara, the opposition presidential candidate, still under medical 
treatment, Ford and Arias Calderon, who were the opposition's vice presidential 
candidates, attended several Masses separately but then got together at the 
Church of Christ the King to hear Msgr. Javier Villanueva read the pastoral 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
The thousand or more people who filled the church to overflowing applauded 
constantly, chanted "Justice! Justice!" and waved the white handkerchiefs that 
have become the symbol of the opposition, then sang "The Battle Hymn of the 
Republic" in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
After the noon Mass, Ford said the reading of the pastoral letter "gives me 
faith that things will get better."
