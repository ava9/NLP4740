<TEXT>
<P>
An international bank that handled accounts for ousted Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega pleaded guilty Tuesday to laundering millions of dollars of 
cocaine profits and agreed to forfeit more than $15 million in assets to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department hailed the 11th-hour agreement by the Luxembourg-based 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International as "the largest cash forfeiture ever" 
and said the bank has pledged to cooperate with federal investigations of money 
laundering worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the settlement was denounced by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) as "a sad 
commentary on a country that is supposed to be taking money laundering 
extremely seriously." Kerry heads a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that 
found evidence that the bank had helped Noriega shelter $10 million after his 
indictment in Florida on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
"When banks engage knowingly in the laundering of money, they should be shut 
down," Kerry said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Dist. Judge W. Terrell Hodges, in Tampa, Fla., accepted guilty pleas from 
two divisions of the bank but did not formally impose sentence. After the plea, 
the trial of six former officers of the bank and two Colombians began on 
charges of helping launder $32 million in cocaine proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoids Issue 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman, David Runkel, sidestepped a 
question on whether the guilty plea and the bank's cooperation would strengthen 
the government's drug-trafficking, money-laundering and racketeering case in 
Miami against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Noriega has been known to use this bank in the past," Runkel said. 
"Whether there is any connection to the Miami case, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all charges, the bank would have faced up to $40 million in 
fines. Under the agreement, the bank faces substantial penalties if it fails to 
cooperate, and it must implement strict guidelines to block money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Links to Noriega are expected to be detailed during the trial by Stephen 
Michael Kalish, a convicted marijuana dealer who is serving a 15-year prison 
sentence. Kalish already has testified in other proceedings that he gave 
Noriega an attache case stuffed with $300,000 in bills to arrange banking 
connections on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Before pleading guilty, lawyers for the bank had threatened to expose Noriega's 
links with U.S. intelligence agencies if he were brought into the case. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1973 by Pakistani bankers and Arab investors, the 
privately held bank has grown to about 400 offices worldwide and $20 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged that the bank's offices were part of an international 
network that laundered millions of dollars for Colombian and other drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Kerry's subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics began 
probing the bank as part of a lengthy inquiry in 1987 and 1988 into cocaine 
trafficking and money laundering in Central America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators accumulated evidence of strong ties between Noriega and the 
bank, including a secret, $25-million account maintained by the general there. 
But Jack A. Blum, chief counsel of the Senate subcommittee, said the full 
extent of the Noriega connection was never discovered because the inquiry was 
delayed at the request of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear this bank had been the bank to which Noriega had referred drug 
traffickers," Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was chief of intelligence for the Panamanian military when he opened 
the account, and he had sole authority over it, according to testimony before 
the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
He used the account to pay cash to Panamanian politicians and to finance 
extensive travel and lavish spending in the United States and Europe by himself 
and his family, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Amjad Awan, a former executive of the bank and a defendant in the Tampa trial, 
told Senate investigators that he was Noriega's personal banker from 1982 until 
early 1988. Noriega ordered the account closed after he was indicted on drug 
charges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handwritten Drafts 
</P>
<P>
Awan, a 42-year-old Pakistani national, said Noriega opened the account with a 
deposit of several hundred thousand dollars in cash and that later deposits of 
cash and checks pushed the balance as high as $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Awan claimed that he did not know the origin of the funds. He said he often 
dispensed cash from the account to Panamanian politicians who came to the bank 
with handwritten notes from Noriega authorizing the withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
After he left Panama in 1984 for Miami and later Washington, Awan said he still 
acted as Noriega's banker and flew frequently to Panama and New York for 
meetings with the general. 
</P>
<P>
One federal charge accused the bank of helping launder several million dollars 
for Kalish, starting with a $2-million deposit by Kalish at the bank's Panama 
City branch in 1983. Prosecutors say the transaction was handled by Awan. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Blum about the deposit during his sworn statement, Awan said he 
had no recollection of it.
