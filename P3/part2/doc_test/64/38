<P>
The United States today cut diplomatic ties with the new Panamanian government 
backed by Manuel A. Noriega, branding it an outlaw regime and vowing to tighten 
the financial screws on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not recognize any government installed by Gen. Noriega. 
Our ambassador will not return and we will not have any diplomatic contact with 
the Noriega regime," President Bush said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the announcement in Washington as Francisco Rodriguez was sworn in as 
provisional president in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
By citing "the outlaw Noriega regime," Bush summoned up one of the dominant 
phrases used by U.S. diplomats to describe how the Noriega government would be 
treated if the military leader refused to leave by today. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida 18 months ago, is also 
accused by the State Department of giving haven in the past to drug dealers 
from other Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States will take other steps, "including the tightening of 
measures to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the Panamanian 
people . . . and to counter the threat posed by Gen. Noriega's support for drug 
trafficking and other forms of subversion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Support 
</P>
<P>
The President did not specify what financial actions the United States will 
take against Panama but said he is confident that other countries would take 
similar measures to support human rights, democracy and self-determination and 
to fight drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Until today, Washington had recognized the government of President Eric 
Delvalle even though he had been removed from power in a February, 1988, coup 
and had been living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Delvalle, respecting the limits of his constitutional mandate, closed the 
Panamanian Embassy in Washington Thursday, handing it and more than $300 
million in Panamanian assets over to the United States for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of May 7 elections had been scheduled to take power Sept. 1, but 
the Noriega-controlled government annulled the elections after reports of a 
sweeping victory by opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
"On May 7, the people of Panama, by an overwhelming margin of votes, braved 
repression, intimidation and fraud to choose democracy over dictatorship. . . . 
But this act of self-determination was brutally repressed before the eyes of 
the entire world," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Legitimacy 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is, therefore, as of this date without any legitimate government," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said Washington, despite breaking relations, will 
keep open the U.S. Embassy in Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
If the break in relations continues, it will block the United States from 
taking crucial action called for in the Panama Canal treaties. Under the 
treaty, which calls for the United States to hand over the canal to Panama by 
the end of the century, the U.S. Senate must approve a Panamanian-appointed 
administrator for the canal by the end of 1989.
