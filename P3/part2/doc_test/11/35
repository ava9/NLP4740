Molly Ringwald, 22, finds herself in a supporting role for the first time in 
years in "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
It's an important distinction at this point in her career because she is a Star 
with a capital S. 
</P>
<P>
But her recent films suggest she has been the victim of poor advice and 
victimized by less than inspired choices of scripts, directors and co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, she had been one of Hollywood's hottest young acting talents, 
brilliant in a trio of John Hughes films, "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink" 
and "The Breakfast Club," stunning in her revelations of the minds and hearts 
of adolescent females. 
</P>
<P>
The pert and poignant redhead, who has lost her innocence on screen more often 
than any star since Mary Pickford, marches to the altar in her current movie, 
"Betsy's Wedding," a fact that brings a smile to her freckled face. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Ringwald has managed to escape the coming-of-age or rite-of-passage 
film in which a post-pubescent girl enters adulthood with all the ramifications 
such transitions imply, at least in movies. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplished actress who looks and photographs a half-dozen years younger 
than she is -- which makes a big difference when a woman is 22 -- Ringwald 
chose to abandon her familiar metier. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? She's an adult, even though she still looks like a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald made her first movie at 13 in "Tempest," a comedy based on 
Shakespeare's play. She was astonishingly good, winning a Golden Globe Award 
for best new actress. 
</P>
<P>
She had an equal impact in the TV movie "Surviving," dealing with teen-age 
suicide. And her reviews in the Hughes films were glowing. 
</P>
<P>
But Ringwald felt it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent films, however, have been less than successful at the box-office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pick-up Artist" with Robert Downey Jr. was a disappointment, both to its 
producers and the young actress. "For Keeps," in which she played a pregnant 
teen-ager, failed to thrill anyone. "Fresh Horses," co-starring Andrew 
McCarthy, was a rehash of "Pretty in Pink" and never got out of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
She flew to France to co-star with Robert Lindsay and John Gielgud in the 
British film "Strike it Rich," which didn't. 
</P>
<P>
She tried new directions, playing Cordelia in Jean-Luc Godard's stage 
presentation of "King Lear" and in the New York stage production of Horton 
Foote's "Lily Dale." 
</P>
<P>
In "Betsy's Wedding," Ringwald is back on familiar terrain, playing a girl 
whose wedding touches off a series of family crises. She plays an off-beat 
bride in the comedy directed by Alan Alda, who also portrays her father. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald plays the title role, but she is not the star. Alda is. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I've come full circle," Ringwald said in an interview. "I did this 
picture because I wanted to work with Alan Alda. I liked the script. It made me 
laugh. I liked the prospect of doing an ensemble film again. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself my family would never be like this, getting upset over 
such silly things. I wouldn't let my family control me like the parents do in 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my sister Elizabeth decided on a formal wedding and in essence we're 
doing this movie. It's amazing what problems a family gets into over a wedding. 
There's something about the tradition and the ceremony that makes people crazy. 
You argue about everything -- invitations, music, refreshments, the church, 
clothes, the reception." 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald, who began her career singing with her father's Great Pacific Jazz 
Band when she was 4, is a thoughtful young woman who has no matrimonial plans 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Her first priority is her career. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage is a long way off for me," she said, "but you never know. I think 
I'll have a small wedding with just family and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed from my mother's generation. They got married early, 
sometimes right out of high school. Mom married when she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed so much in the past five years -- I'm practically a different 
person every year. It would be a huge risk for me to marry now. I won't be the 
same person in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today a lot of women my age don't want to make marriage their career. It's a 
hard balancing act to have children and an acting career. But it's possible. 
Women are doing it every day. Compromises have to be made.
