Sheryl Lee Ralph has already conquered Broadway -- winning a Tony nomination 
for her performance in the 1981 landmark musical "Dreamgirls" -- and headlined 
two sitcoms, "It's a Living" and "New Attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Now she is making her bid for movie stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The actress is starring opposite Danny Glover in Charles Burnett's critically 
acclaimed first feature, "To Sleep With Anger," as a materialistic wife and 
mother whose life changes when an old family friend (Glover) meddles with the 
relationships among a family.

<P>
"I got a review from somebody," says Ralph, "and they said I was 'intelligently 
sexy.' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.' It's a wonderful thing to be able to 
combine those two things not only in life, but in film." 
</P>
<P>
The actress also has won the coveted starring role in "Romuald and Juliette," 
the American remake of the French farce, "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," 
about a married white executive who falls in love with his company's black 
cleaning woman. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulties in casting the male lead have pushed production into 1991. "I 
would be hard pressed to say why they haven't found an actor," says Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
But she says someone told her it was a race issue: "It just made me see that 
women are further down on the totem pole than we thought. I said (to the 
person), 'You mean to tell me that people are entertaining the idea that the 
reason why a white leading male actor would not take this role is because I am 
an upcoming black female actress?' If that is not one of the most sexist, 
racist things ever said to me, I don't know what else to say about the industry 
or the nation I live in -- both of which I love so deeply."SUSAN KING
