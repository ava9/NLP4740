THIS WEEK director Joel Schumacher began filming "Dying Young," starring Julia 
Roberts and Campbell Scott, in Mendocino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
But after much hoopla -- Schumacher has backed out of his commitment to direct 
the movie of "The Phantom of the Opera." He and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the 
screenplay together and spent months here and abroad making plans. But, as one 
observer says, "You know, in show biz, if people don't 'get married' right 
away, sometimes it never happens." 
</P>
<P>
Joel and Andrew say they are still friends, but someone other than Joel will 
direct the great London and Broadway stage hit musical for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
THE BRITISH are coming -- apart? London is agog over director Trevor Nunn. He 
has left his wife, Sharon Leigh, and their two children to trek off after 
actress Imogene Stubbs of the Royal Shakespeare Company. (She has just played 
the leading role in the coming Herbert Ross movie, "True Colors.") Nunn had 
directed Stubbs in "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn already had a go-round with American actress Judy Kuhn while married to 
Sharon Leigh. And, as a matter of fact, he was once wed to actress Janet 
Suzmann and left her for -- Sharon Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
Award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard (his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are 
Dead" recently won the Venice Film Festival) and his wife, Dr. Miriam Stoppard, 
are also suffering some apartness. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHER day I reported all wasn't so hotsy-totsy between those Columbia 
biggies Jon Peters and Peter Guber. They take exception and say my report 
"quite saddened" them. "Our relationship, both personally and professionally, 
has withstood numerous outside assaults. . . . There is not a scintilla of 
truth in your article." Then they invited me to come visit in their homes, 
which would "enable you to understand our relationship in person." 
</P>
<P>
Well, this is one of the most unusual denials I've ever received in this 
business. It's nice not to be yelled at or threatened with broken legs, for a 
change.
