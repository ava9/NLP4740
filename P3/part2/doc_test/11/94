RELATIONSHIPS: THOUGH THINLY WRITTEN, CARRIE FISHER'S SCRIPT FOR 'POSTCARDS 
FROM THE EDGE' CAPTURES THE COMPETITION AND LOVE BETWEEN A HOLLYWOOD MOTHER AND 
DAUGHTER. MERYL STREEP AND SHIRLEY MACLAINE MAKE THE MIXED EMOTIONS BELIEVABLE.

"Postcards From the Edge"!? We should be so lucky. You can write something on a 
postcard. This is more like fortune cookies; pithy, expert zingers from the 
mother-daughter battlefield, Hollywood division: a star of '50s musicals 
(Shirley MacLaine) and her movie actress-daughter (Meryl Streep) struggling 
back from a drug habit that lifelong insecurity has built. 
</P>
<P>
As Carrie Fisher has adapted her successful, somewhat autobiographical 1987 
novel about the physical and psychological rehabilitation of a spirited, 
wisecracking, just-turning-30 actress, she has taken one of the book's more 
minor preoccupations, the mother-daughter stuff, and made it the movie's whole 
shooting match. 
</P>
<P>
"Postcards" (opening citywide) is a puzzlement. It's possible to float out of 
it on the immense high generated by Meryl Streep's two final numbers -- singing 
as affectingly as Bonnie Raitt. If it needed proving, it's clear now that there 
is nothing Streep cannot do, except, possibly, oral surgery and high-platform 
diving, and only a sucker would bet against either of those. 
</P>
<P>
As director Mike Nichols speeds the movie by and Streep's Suzanne Vale gives 
behind-the-scenes Hollywood the benefit of her wry eye and bad mouth, it's a 
funny world to be let in on -- hip, inside and deadly clever. Unsurprisingly, 
with this director and this writer, "Postcards" cuts close to the bone with its 
insights about the workings of old and new Hollywood -- a past full of stars 
with ironclad images built by studios and nourished by fan mags, and an 
unsentimental and utterly forgetful present in which grosses alone are the 
measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
But apart from Suzanne and her egocentric mama, MacLaine's Doris Mann, who can 
suck all the oxygen from a room with one dazzling, artificial smile, 
"Postcards" is amazingly thin. Its subsidiary characters, The Director (Gene 
Hackman), The Producer (Dennis Quaid) and The Emergency Room Doctor (Richard 
Dreyfuss) have the depth of shrink-wrap. 
</P>
<P>
Defiantly underwritten, onscreen for mere minutes, these anemics get what clout 
they have from the sheer warmth and presence of their actors, a considerable 
amount in the case of Hackman and Dreyfuss. Quaid, playing a character so 
loosely sketched that it isn't clear whether he's a producer or Suzanne's 
fellow actor, still seems to be flailing away like Jerry Lee Lewis, although 
that song has ended. 
</P>
<P>
As we first meet Suzanne, she's tailspinning, bluffing and snorting her way 
through a crummy-looking movie about Latin American intrigue, directed by 
Hackman. Next, she overdoses in the other half of Quaid's bed and finds herself 
in a detox center, headed by a no-nonsense therapist played by C.C.H. Pounder 
-- her power reduced to slivers of scenes. Improbably brief as the detox 
section is, Streep gets memorable support from Robin Bartlett as her rehab 
roomie Aretha ("I think my parents were expecting someone black"), whose dry 
delivery and owlish take on life are the stuff on which lifelong friendships 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
Doris, a whirlwind of compulsive bossiness, arrives at detox, too, so 
conspicuously self-effacing she's brought Woolite to rinse out a few of her 
daughter's things. It's also clear that though she's judgmental about drugs, 
she's a hard-working alcoholic herself, heightening the irony that, to work 
again, Suzanne must live with her "responsible" mother. Screenwriter Fisher 
further nails Doris when an ecstatic patient-fan burbles that he's wanted to be 
her since he was 7. Doris hits the radiance button, then, under her breath to 
Suzanne as they leave, says, "Sorry, but you know how much the queens love me." 
</P>
<P>
With clear-eyed venom like this, or when they're characterizing slimeballs like 
Rob Reiner's unctuous producer, Fisher and Nichols are unmatchable. Best of all 
is the blistering irony behind MacLaine's musical high point, her own "Rose's 
Turn," when Doris allows herself to be pulled center stage to perform at the 
coming-home party she's thrown for Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
The number exposes every iota of support and competitiveness between mother and 
daughter: the bitterness of Doris' refrain in Sondheim's "I'm Still Here," and 
the ultimate professionalism of her delivery; the love and pride on Suzanne's 
face watching her -- and her twinge as her mother exploits her daughter's drug 
problems in public. If Doris complains that Suzanne won't use her singing 
talent, there's no doubt why after mama's triumphantly brassy piano-top finale. 
</P>
<P>
These and wickedly funny backstage snapshots of moviemaking are the good times 
of "Postcards," but even they can't hide its emotional starvation. While we 
chortle at the one-liners -- and Streep's running, grumbling delivery of them 
-- the real work seems to happen too fast and offscreen. Drug rehabilitation, 
family reconciliation, career regeneration. Peculiarly matched though Streep 
and MacLaine seem as a mother and daughter, they wring every drop of empathy 
from a last-minute hospital-bed scene of caring and contrition. Nevertheless, 
"Postcards" is a quick-sketch of a screenplay whose details are still to come. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it comes straight out of left field, Streep's performance as a country 
singer at the movie's close is irresistible. Just let your mind alone at this 
point; this is such unabashed fun that there's not much left to do but roll 
with it, in the same way you can luxuriate in Michael Ballhaus' fluid camera 
work, Patrizia Von Brandenstein's designs for the peculiarly awful movies 
Suzanne is making, Ann Roth's wittily perfect costumes and J. Roy Helland's 
superb hair and makeup, which in MacLaine's case is a devastating trip down 
Memory Lane.
