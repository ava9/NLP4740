Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine says her recent knee operation probably 
added 15 years to her dancing career. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a video taken of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said it was the best movie I ever made," said MacLaine, who is in 
town preparing for Tuesday's opening of a national performance tour. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery to repair torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap came after she 
was hurt while rehearsing a dance number earlier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
MacLaine, 56, says she lifted weights and exercised the knee underwater to 
rebuild her strength. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first operation ever, and I could have seen it as a tragedy," she 
said. "But it slowed me down to reflect, so I've almost finished another book. 
I think it has given me another 15 years of dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran actress won best actress honors for the 1982 film "Terms of 
Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
The actress-singer-dancer and best-selling author has written several 
metaphysical books, including "Out on a Limb" and "Dancing in Light." 
</P>
<P>
Her next movie project is to play silent movie star Louise Brooks in a 
biographical film.
