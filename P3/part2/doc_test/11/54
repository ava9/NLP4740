</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pretty Woman" actress Julia Roberts described her stay in these parts as 
boring and the people as racist. 
</P>
<P>
She stayed in Spartanburg and Abbeville, in the state's northwestern corner, 
during filming of "Sleeping With the Enemy" in May. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were horribly racist and I had a really hard time," Rolling Stone 
magazine quoted Roberts as saying in the Aug. 9 issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In Abbeville, I felt so assaulted and insulted by these people that I just 
didn't want to be nice anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbeville Mayor Joe Savitz said her remarks may stem from her attempt to take a 
black friend into a "real redneck-type place" that doesn't allow black 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"No self-respecting person would want to go there," Savitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In her latest movie, Roberts portrays an abused wife who stages her death and 
assumes a new identity. It is scheduled for release in February.
