Wearing his best suit and a construction worker's hard hat, Principal Gene 
Bedley waited for the next water balloon to smash into him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the moment he had asked for -- even created and titled. Bedley had 
promised that the "Blast Mr. Bedley With a Water Balloon" award would be 
bestowed on each class at El Camino Real Elementary School that raised $700 or 
more in a recent jog-a-thon for new school equipment. He even promised to wear 
his best suit. 
</P>
<P>
After more than $16,000 was raised, Bedley's best attire on Monday became a wet 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I even wore light-colored pants so the water would show better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the staff of El Camino Real again presented Bedley with balloons, 
this time filled with helium, as part of a Mr. Bedley Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second honor in two weeks. Last Thursday, Bedley received the George 
Washington Honor Medal for distinguished service at the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station. During an Appreciation Day breakfast, Bedley noted that "kids are 
our greatest teachers," and he dedicated his George Washington medal to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene sets the tone for the entire school with his positive approach to 
education," said second-grade teacher Jenni Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-grade teacher Sherri Ernst, inspired by Bedley to become a teacher, said 
she "would not work for anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a warm, loving, caring person," she said. "He's my hero." 
</P>
<P>
Bedley said he follows a simple philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect kids," he said, "and they will respect you." STEVE BILLITER
