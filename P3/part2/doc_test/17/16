Weston

Like latter-day Roman emperors, two brothers run the halves of a sprawling
food business which has brought their family considerable wealth - estimated
to run into billions of pounds, but largely owned by charitable foundations.
Garry Weston, 67, tall and somewhat shambling, resembles a wise, old family
doctor, complete with ill-trimmed moustache and understanding manner. Galen
Weston, 53, is also silver haired and tall, but he is dapper, a friend of
princes, and a renowned polo player.
As Garry says in his quiet, understated fashion: 'Our personalities are
rather different. He has done his thing, I've done mine.'
This week, Garry announced plans to reorganise the shareholdings owned by
his family and a charity in Associated British Foods for tax-planning
purposes. While some observers saw this as a loosening of the family's grip
on the business, Garry says he is determined that the dynasty will retain
control.
The Westons' is a remarkable saga. Cockney William Weston, born in 1820,
emigrated to Toronto, where his son George was born in 1865. After founding
a baking business he died young, leaving his son Willard Garfield, known as
Garfield, born in 1898, to take over.
Garfield, who lived until 1978, fathered nine children, three of them boys,
and set out, he said, 'to build a business that would never know
completion'. 'Growth forever' could have been his motto.
He moved to the UK and went on an acquisition spree. In 1935 he took his
Allied Bakeries company public, later changing its name to ABF. As his
health began to fail, he called on two of his sons to take over the
business. In 1967 he asked Garry, who had set up an Australian subsidiary,
to run ABF, the 'eastern' empire, covering the UK and Europe, South Africa,
Australia and New Zealand.
Some years later, Galen, who had been running the Irish business and married
an Irish model, was persuaded to go 'home' to head the North American
empire.
Since then, the paths of the two brothers have seldom crossed, even though
each is on the other's board. Garry is currently angry about an article in
this month's issue of the magazine Vanity Fair. It contains 'a lot of free
chat about my father I don't agree with at all', he says. His irritation is
directed at Galen, who was interviewed for the story and whose Florida beach
resort is the focus of attention.
The article suggests that Garfield groomed his sons to take over the
business. 'A piece of stupidity,' says Garry. 'Apart from the opportunity of
a good education, I received no training at all. At 23, I was given the
opportunity to take charge of a small company making a not very well-known
brand, Ryvita. I taught myself to run the business.'
He is clearly proud of turning the crispbread into a household name and also
of inventing and naming Wagon Wheel chocolate biscuits.
Garry thinks he has inherited some of his father's 'ideals and most of his
motivation. Apart from that I am not temperamentally like him. I've not got
the charisma he had.' Galen is like their father 'in some ways', says Garry.
'He acts more like an owner than a manager. He is restless like my father.'
Garry says he is more like his elder brother, Grainger, who left the
business years ago and became a Texas rancher.
When he was summoned home from Australia to chair ABF, the Sunblest bread
and Twining teas group, Garry found a business with a rambling structure,
low profits and more than 180 people reporting directly to his father, who
by then spent only half his time in the UK.
Garry pulled the business into shape, selling subsidiaries at a premium, and
eventually buying British Sugar for Pounds 880m in 1991. The ABF group,
worth Pounds 91m when he became chairman, is now valued at Pounds 2.6bn.
When Galen took over the North American company he found a similar mess.
According to Vanity Fair, he performed a 'textbook turnaround' of a business
in a state of near bankruptcy and 'whipped that chaotic collection of more
than 200 companies and subsidiaries into a sensible, streamlined
organisation'.
Garry is less generous. 'He has recruited some very good executives and
leaves them in charge. That leaves him a lot of time for his social life,'
he says. Garry, something of a loner, puts family first.
The North American company, George Weston, controls the Loblaw supermarket
chain and has interests in cyclical industries such as paper. It is
majority-owned by Galen and another charity and, according to Garry, has
performed badly for the past three years. 'The company's shape is very much
like it was 20 years ago. There has not been a sell-off or a British Sugar,'
he adds.
While the two emperors run their separate domains, they face a common
problem: the succession. Garry has six children, three of each sex. The sons
 -Guy, George and Garth - all work in ABF, the youngest as a management
trainee where, says Garry, 'there are a lot of opportunities for bright
young men and my sons will have to compete with them'. Two of his daughters
work for Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store also owned by the
family.
Will the next chairman of AB Foods be a Weston? 'That's a long way off, I
hope,' says Garry, and adds: 'There are a lot of able people in the
company.' Whoever chairs the business, though, he expects the family to
retain its shareholding.
As for Galen's half of the empire, it is too early to say whether his son or
daughter, both born in 1972 and still in full-time education, will follow
him into the business. But even if they do, the division between the two
sides of the family can only grow wider.
