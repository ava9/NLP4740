IN DESERT SOLITUDE, FAITHFUL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE ABBEY MYTH

ARCHES NATIONAL PARK, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Abbey died on March 14 at age 62. That evening, friends hauled the 
author of "The Monkeywrench Gang" into the desert and buried him under a big 
pile of black rocks, somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, some of those same friends, accompanied by hundreds of 
others, walked into another part of that vast slick rock and cacti cemetery to 
celebrate the life of a man, who, more quickly than any writer since Jack 
Kerouac, has been resurrected as a modern myth. 
</P>
<P>
In "Desert Solitaire," the 1968 book that incited a generation of 
environmentalists, Abbey described hauling the bloated carcass of a tourist 
from a remote canyon in Arches National Park. Then a seasonal ranger, Abbey 
congratulated the man on his good fortune in dying under the desert sky, away 
from meddling doctors and priests. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had loved him," he added, "we would sing, dance, drink, build a 
stupendous bonfire, find women, make love . . . and celebrate his 
transfiguration from flesh to fantasy in a style proper and fitting, with fun 
for all at the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, folks did just that -- presumably all of it. They also talked at 
length about why, as one speaker said, so many of the disparate people who had 
arrived at this remote mesa from around the country would recall the moment 
they heard Abbey had died as vividly as the moment they learned that John 
Kennedy had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning sun lifted layers of gray from the surrounding red and black 
bluffs, poet Wendall Berry told the congregation that Abbey's work gave people 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
Berry is forbidden to read Abbey at night because his laughter wakes up the 
house, he said. But concealed in Abbey's humor, he added, is a commitment to a 
serious vision and an antidote to the despair that sometimes seems integral to 
modern life. 
</P>
<P>
"I never laid down a book by Edward Abbey that I did not feel more encouraged 
than when I picked it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hike Up a Dirt Road 
</P>
<P>
The tribute was staged a short hike up a dirt road that had been the entrance 
to the park when Abbey worked there. Soaring Entrada sandstone cliffs framed 
one side of the setting; in another direction hovered the snow-capped 
Tukuhnikivats, which Abbey called "the mightiest mountains in the land of 
Moab." 
</P>
<P>
Someone had set an American flag beside the small podium, from which speakers 
addressed the several hundred people spread out across a gentle slope of 
lichen-mottled sandstone. 
</P>
<P>
More than one speaker remarked that Abbey's work was distinguished by a rare 
love of life and love of country, despite his anti-authoritarian disgust with 
government and his radical stands against much of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism," Berry said, "is not the love of air conditioning or the 
interstate highway system or the government or the flag or power or money or 
munitions. It is the love of country." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Literary Establishment made only grudging nods of recognition at 
Abbey. That apparently suited him fine. In one of his worst nightmares, he once 
said, the "effete" novelist John Updike moved into the scruffy neighborhood 
outside Tucson, Ariz., where Abbey and his fifth wife, Clarke, lived for almost 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
But now, even some of the Eastern literati are paying homage, said Barry Lopez, 
author of books such as "Arctic Dreams" and perhaps the best known of the new 
breed of nature writers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the literary Establishment ignored Ed, or dismissed him as a crank," 
Lopez said, before addressing the Abbeyites. "Now they're coming around 180 
degrees. The reason he is already a mythic figure is his quality of integrity 
and saying exactly what's on his mind. We live in a land where so much is based 
on duplicity of language. People have a real thirst for anyone who speaks with 
a clear voice in a direct and uncompromising manner, saying precisely what they 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
Few writers with their literary roots in the West ever doubted that Abbey was a 
force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McMurtry, author of "Lonesome Dove," has termed Abbey "a modern Thoreau." 
</P>
<P>
John Nichols, the author of "The Milagro Beanfield Wars" whose bad heart kept 
him at his Taos, N.M., home this weekend, said of Abbey by telephone: "I think 
'Desert Solitaire' will stand up as a powerful classic. And 'Monkey Wrench 
Gang' will always be a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Monkey Wrench -- the romantic tale of a ragtag band of river rats who 
rampage through the Southwest ripping up survey stakes, dismantling bulldozers 
and launching other quixotic attacks on alleged progress -- the author wrote: 
eight other novels (the last of which is scheduled for release in the fall); 
five coffee table photographic collections, and six collections of essays. All 
reflect his preference for the natural over the man-made world and a 
strong-headed individualism in combat against technocracy. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey's books, "were burrs under the saddle blanket of complacency," author 
Wallace Stegner wrote in a letter Berry read to to the gathering. "He was a 
red-hot moment in the conscience of the country, and I suspect that the 
half-life of his intransigence will turn out to be comparable to uranium." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beer-Can Salute 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman, who co-founded the radical environmental group Earth First!, 
raised a beer-can toast to the man who inspired what has been called "red-neck 
environmentalism." 
</P>
<P>
"Ed said that one brave deed is worth a thousand words. But every novel, every 
essay, every story Ed wrote has launched a thousand brave deeds," he said. The 
people cheered. A string quartet played Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Word about the tribute spread in a way the anarchist Abbey might have approved. 
Throughout his life, he had fired off fusillades of white postcards to praise, 
scold and maintain contact with the countless people, who, for whatever 
reasons, drifted into his field of influence, those who knew him said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's affair, announced with a postcard barrage and a few notices in 
publications of the environmental fringe, drew academic admirers and 
reverential young Abbey cultists who insist on chucking beer cans out car 
windows because their iconoclastic hero was known to have done so. A physician 
who attended said he had worked with Chico Mendes in the Amazon rain forests 
before that organizer of the rubber-tappers union was murdered. Another man who 
came said he spent his life exploring for gas and oil throughout the Southwest. 
He felt no guilt about what might appear to be hypocrisy. Abbey would 
understand his need to work outdoors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew Abbey conceded that he had a few inconsistencies himself. His 
attitude was, "So?" 
</P>
<P>
He has been accused of racism, sexism, fascism. Abbey supporters said such 
charges are made by people who have not read his work closely. Supporters found 
other things to fight with him about. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abbey once wrote: "If there's anyone still present whom I've 
failed to insult, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, who shared Abbey's environmentalism but denounced aspects of his 
politics, said that the author's humor defused any true antipathy. "When I 
think of Ed Abbey, I think of Emma Goldman, who said, 'If I can't dance, I 
don't want to be part of your revolution,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is now considering a bill that would make several million acres along 
the Utah-Colorado border a wilderness area. A congressional sponsor of the 
proposal has recommended that the area be named after Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the land he cherished, though, have fallen to his worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
In "Desert Solitaire," Abbey decried the "industrial tourism" he felt the 
National Park Service encouraged with its paved campgrounds and flush toilets. 
Such places disregard the adventurous urbanites who came for a rare taste of 
"the primitive and remote." Instead they attract "the indolent millions, born 
on wheels and suckled on gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, tourists now march into the air-conditioned visitor's center at Arches 
National Park and ask if there are sights they can see without leaving their 
motor homes. The winding main roads are now paved and lined with numbered signs 
pointing out each spectacular mesa and rock formation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the paradox" said Robin Wilson, widow of Bates Wilson, the park 
administrator whom Abbey credited with "much of what understanding I have of a 
country we both love." 
</P>
<P>
"All of us who know this area want to bring all our friends here and share it 
with them," said Wilson, now an activist in the area. "It builds and builds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dancing and Drinking 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, at a guest ranch outside Moab, hundreds of Abbey aficionados 
danced and drank. 
</P>
<P>
It probably was not as raucous as Abbey had wanted, but someone did let the 
horses out of the corral, and at least one young woman, wearing only a blouse, 
staggered across a lawn littered with cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch, complete with a bookstore well-stocked with naturalist writings, 
poetry, and wildflower guides, is run by Ken Sleight, widely acknowledged to be 
Abbey's inspiration for the Monkey Wrencher, Seldom Seen Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm meeting all sorts of people I thought were myths tonight," said Sleight's 
wife, Jane. 
</P>
<P>
Among the myths she knows well is Douglas Peacock, reportedly the man upon whom 
Abbey based George Washington Hayduke, the Monkey Wrench hero who is gunned 
down by a government helicopter like an American mujahedeen defending God's 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
About midnight, while young Abbeyites hooted and spun yarns and sashayed to 
twanging goat-roper music, Peacock and Sleight embraced, grappled, laughed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrowed Traits 
</P>
<P>
Peacock, 47, still sunburned and stocky, makes films about grizzlies. Sleight, 
a thin guy with a bowl haircut, glasses and a cowboy boots, takes dudes out on 
horse-pack trips into the canyons he and Abbey used to explore. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed borrowed traits from some of us to wrap the characters around," Sleight, 
59, said, his words coming slowly after a full day of toasting a friend. "But 
they were also very autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Abbey myth is going to get bigger and bigger," he said. "I 
encourage it, because I believe in what he had to say." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey was courted by Hollywood off and on throughout his life. He was pleased 
with the film "Lonely Are the Brave" in which Gregory Peck played the hero of 
Abbey's early novel "The Brave Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
Now companies are reportedly bidding on his latest novel, "Fool's Progress," 
and there is renewed interest in producing a film based on "The Monkey Wrench 
Gang." 
</P>
<P>
Before he died, Abbey completed the sequel to the Monkey Wrench Gang -- 
"Hayduke Lives!" Long before the sequel was announced, though, "Hayduke Lives!" 
bumper stickers became ubiquitous throughout the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's an addendum. 
</P>
<P>
On the road leading into Sleight's ranch, where a hundred or more cars and 
trucks with raft frames and kayaks and mountain bikes on top lined up, at least 
one sticker on one dirty Jeep had been defaced with the words: Abbey Lives!
