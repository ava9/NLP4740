Richard Chase was called the Vampire of Sacramento. Seized by a delusion that 
he had to consume human blood, he killed six people, including a 22-month-old 
baby whose organs he hacked open before drinking the blood. Convicted of six 
counts of first-degree murder, he died of a drug overdose in 1979 while serving 
a life term in prison.

Fumiko Kimura was a housewife and mother of two young children. When she 
learned that her husband was having an affair, she waded into the ocean in 
Santa Monica on a chilly January day with her children and held their heads 
under the waves until they died, then tried to drown herself. She ultimately 
pleaded guilty to a charge of voluntary manslaughter and was placed on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris met at the California Men's Colony in San Luis 
Obispo. Bittaker was there for robbery and Norris for rape. Within a year of 
their release in November, 1978, they had raped and killed five teen-age girls 
and recorded their screams on tape. Recaptured, Norris is now serving a life 
sentence, and Bittaker is on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Markman knows them all. He has sat in a room, alone, with each of 
them, sifting the method from their madness, thereby obtaining evidence to help 
the court determine how responsible each killer was for what he or she did. 
</P>
<P>
Markman is Southern California's leading forensic psychiatrist, the expert to 
whom judges turn repeatedly to provide impartial assessments of the mental 
condition of people accused of crimes. He has testified in more than 20,000 
cases, including such celebrated ones as the Hillside Strangler murders and the 
slaying of musician Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
The public fascination with these cases prompted Markman to write about them, 
and about the murderers and the murdered, to "satiate the morbid curiosity," 
Markman said in a recent interview at his Westchester office. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know more. There is something inside them (the murderers) that is 
also inside us, and we are attracted to them so that we can find out what that 
something is," writes Markman in his recently published book, "Alone With the 
Devil" (Doubleday). 
</P>
<P>
The book, for which Dominick Basco was co-author, is an anthology of the 
"high-visibility" homicide cases that have marked Markman's career as a 
forensic psychiatrist, a career that began in the late '60s, when Markman was 
teaching in the department of psychiatry at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Department 95, the mental health court of Los Angeles County, had 
its offices in the psychiatric ward at County-USC. When one of the four 
psychiatrists who regularly consulted for Department 95 died of a heart attack, 
Markman was offered his position. Thus began a career that would bring 
encounters with some of the most dreaded names in California criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
Although each case was unique in its complexities, Markman points out the 
common thread: the unpredictability of the urge to kill. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can commit homicide," he says, "the person who sits across from you at 
lunch, your partner in business, your partner in bed. The only real difference 
between most of the killers in the book and most of its readers is that most of 
the readers have not killed another human being. We are all capable of killing 
if we feel our existence is profoundly and imminently threatened." 
</P>
<P>
This idea first struck him when he was informed that the person he had bought 
his house from was charged with the murder of his partner. "That showed me we 
are all one step away from being the murderer." 
</P>
<P>
And the idea was reinforced when the father of his son's best friend was killed 
by a robber. "I realized that we are one step away from being an indiscriminate 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Markman says, the urges in all of us that make us capable of 
killing are offset in normal human beings by the civilizing powers of 
restraint. In some people, however, this restraint is weakened by inherent or 
environmental influences that retard proper psychological growth. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the widely publicized "wilding" incident in New York's Central Park, in 
which a group of teen-agers assaulted and raped a woman who was jogging, 
Markman explains: "These were youngsters without a superego, which is the 
internal policeman of the conscience. They couldn't be talked to in terms of 
right and wrong. They functioned simply on the basis of pleasure. I have run 
into youngsters who have severely injured their playmates, their relatives, 
their peers. But they have no remorse, because they don't have the capacity for 
remorse." 
</P>
<P>
It is the interpretation of this capacity of individuals to appreciate the 
nature of their actions that has yanked psychiatrists from their consultation 
rooms to the courts, Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that many critics dispute the value of psychiatric testimony, 
Markman insists, "To make inferences from the present state and go backwards is 
not witchcraft, sorcery or poppycock." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he outlined the way he works: 
</P>
<P>
"When I have to determine the degree of criminal responsibility, I have to do a 
lot of professional gymnastics. If a person is charged with a robbery committed 
seven months ago and he pleads not guilty by insanity, I first examine his 
present condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I ask myself, 'If he committed the crime right at this moment, would he 
be sane?' I take this condition and go backwards and say, 'Is it not likely 
that this condition existed then? Or is it possible that some intervening 
variable, like medication, affected his behavior?' I review this behavior and 
draw the conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
It is a rational, logical process, Markman says, and in concept a simple one. 
But as psychiatry has assumed a growing role in the legal process in the second 
half of the 20th Century, it has brought complications. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Kotler, USC professor of media law and an attorney for the California 
First Amendment Coalition, notes that psychiatric testimony is "based on a 
diagnosis rather than on facts." This, Kotler says, confuses things for the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
He complains that judges and attorneys do not trust the ability of the jurors 
to interpret the complex issues involved in a case. Hence, "hired guns," such 
as forensic psychiatrists, are brought in. 
</P>
<P>
Markman agrees. "Once the psychiatrist stepped in, terms that were once 
clear-cut became fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the interpretation of the words, "deliberation," and 
"premeditation," -- the two most important criteria for establishing 
first-degree murder -- had to be refined once psychiatrists could examine a 
defendant and offer an opinion as to whether he or she was capable of 
deliberating or premeditating, Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion was compounded when the legal system responded by introducing 
qualifiers, such as "meaningful and mature deliberation" in statutes and 
judicial opinions, Markman adds. 
</P>
<P>
As he traces the history of each case in his book, Markman analyzes the 
limitations of the legal system and their effect on the final verdict. He is 
severely critical of the "discriminatory attitude," of the courts, at one point 
describing them as "immoral and unjust because they are concerned more with 
technicalities than the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To Markman, there is no more classic an example of a murderer who almost got 
off on a technicality than Barry Braeseke, a 20-year-old man from Oakland who 
killed his parents and his grandfather in 1976. He confessed to the detectives 
after telling them that everything he said was "off the record." Later, he 
confessed to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At Braeseke's trial, his attorney argued that his client's confessions were 
invalid because they had been obtained without making him aware of his right to 
remain silent and his right to an attorney. But the court upheld his second 
confession, and he was convicted of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court and later the U. S. Supreme Court reversed the 
decision on the grounds that the confession was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when Braeseke confessed to the murders on the CBS program "60 
Minutes," the videotape was used as testimony and Braeseke was sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Another case that disturbed Markman -- he calls it the most "nagging and 
chilling case I have ever handled" -- was that of Lawrence Bittaker. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Markman's testimony that he was a "significant danger to society," 
Bittaker was released on parole. A year later, Bittaker was charged with the 
rape and murder of five teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the tapes of the young girls in agony while they were being 
brutalized, I found it difficult to understand the revolving door form of 
justice which arrests, releases, rearrests and releases a criminal. I don't 
think Bittaker should be released. Not that I am a redneck. But I think that he 
has lost the license to live in the society for what he has done." 
</P>
<P>
Such baffling contradictions of the legal system, and the disappointing feeling 
that "I wasn't doing the fullest justice to my patients," prompted Markman to 
go to law school after a decade of practice as a forensic psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
Though Markman emphasizes that law school didn't alter his methods of 
psychiatric examination, "It changed my perspective as a witness, because I 
became aware of questions that shouldn't be asked. I was more in touch with the 
legal machinations." 
</P>
<P>
Further, it gave him an insight into the role of the attorney in the legal 
system: "The lawyer, unlike any other profession, is taught solely to persuade. 
He is not interested in the facts. If you can persuade the jury to disregard 
the facts, you don't have to worry about the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Though he now has a law degree and has joined the American Bar Assn., Markman 
says he does not intend to appear in court as an attorney. "It would color my 
impartiality." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, however, Markman has missed his calling: Over the years, he has 
successfully fought 15 traffic violations. "I won them all on technicalities. I 
wasn't being devious. The cops had signed it in the wrong place or they had 
forgotten to give the date." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds a sobering thought: "If I can get technical acquittals in traffic 
violation cases, imagine the technicalities involved in a criminal case." 
</P>
<P>
Markman declines cases that he finds difficult to approach impartially. When he 
was called to examine Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian 
residing in the United States, Markman refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Sirhan had killed Kennedy for his warm feelings toward Israel, and I had come 
from Israel," Markman said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in what was then called Palestine, Markman and his family came to the 
United States in 1939, crossing the Atlantic on the last prewar voyage of the 
Queen Mary. The family lived for brief periods in New York, the Canadian city 
of Windsor and Chicago before settling in Los Angeles in 1945. After high 
school, he attended UCLA as an undergraduate and as a medical student. 
</P>
<P>
Although Markman admits that his job -- with its rapid-fire questions and the 
interaction with people who have been involved in heinous crimes -- can be 
draining and stressful, the psychiatrist says he is able to leave it behind 
when he leaves work. "I don't mix business with pleasure," he says. 
</P>
<P>
This is echoed by Nitza, his wife of 27 years, a teacher of Jewish studies at a 
private school. They first met at George Washington University, where Nitza was 
a student, fresh from Israel, and Markman was working as a psychiatrist in the 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never brought his work home," Nitza Markman says. "It's our upbringing 
that stresses the importance of the family. He's always there when anyone from 
the family needs him."
