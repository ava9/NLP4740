COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of this city's founding fathers and a councilman for 16 years, Robert M. 
Wilson is intimately familiar with "the ditch." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson watched with pleasure in the mid-1970s as lumbering bulldozers began 
slicing the deep chasm in the earth that would be necessary to allow the Costa 
Mesa Freeway to reach the sea. 
</P>
<P>
He grimaced when state money dried up and the earth movers fled, leaving the 
ditch to the weeds and the field mice. Wilson was there as frustrated residents 
took to derisively calling it "Costa Mesa's Panama Canal," or joking that it 
should be filled with water and stocked with fish. 
</P>
<P>
But now Wilson, who retired from the council in 1976, is smiling. Work has 
begun anew on the long-awaited extension of California 55 south into the heart 
of Costa Mesa. "I think it's great," Wilson said. "We need it badly. It's just 
20 years late." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, is happy. 
</P>
<P>
All the construction work has ushered in monumental traffic jams along the 
existing roads perched on the freeway's embankments. The long lines of 
grumbling motorists promise to only get longer later this year as the roads, 
Newport Boulevard north and south, are temporarily reduced to one lane in each 
direction to make room for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the merchants at the freeway's edges are also irked by the work. The 
construction has scared off customers, they contend, and the completed freeway 
may act only to further divert business away from their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Even when completed, the freeway extension falls more than a mile short of the 
original goal envisioned by planners more than three decades ago -- to link the 
San Diego Freeway with Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current construction project, the freeway will terminate at 19th 
Street, dumping traffic back onto Newport Boulevard in the heart of Costa 
Mesa's business district. These days, the money and political willpower to 
continue the freeway south to the coast are in short supply, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll see it in my lifetime," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
What he will see is a $38-million, two-mile stretch of pavement topped by seven 
bridges and featuring four lanes in each direction. Construction began nearly a 
year ago, and already three of the bridges on the northern end of the project 
are completed and two others are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Massive storm drains, some of them eight feet in diameter, have been laid along 
several stretches, and a mountain of dirt is being removed on the southern end 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
At the northern end, a mountain of recycled concrete and asphalt sits baking in 
the sun. There is already a base along the road bed onto which the concrete 
roadbed will be poured in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the bridges has conspired to tie up traffic on numerous occasions in 
recent months. One day last week, a fleet of concrete trucks was lined up, 
blocking a lane of traffic at the Del Mar Avenue crossing. Traffic was backed 
up for a half mile up the street, as motorists tried to shoot across the 
intersection when the signal light flickered green. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Chappelle, an engineer shepherding the project for the state Department of 
Transportation, didn't like what he was seeing, but said there was no way 
around it. Snarled traffic and headaches for motorists come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"You definitely have a gridlock situation here," Chappelle said, gazing toward 
the line of cars. "People in Southern California don't have a lot of time to 
waste sitting in traffic at a construction project. But they should know that 
none of this is being done for the contractor's convenience. It has to be done 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
With completion of the northern half of the project early next year, the 
traffic situation around the Orange County Fairgrounds and along Newport 
Boulevard south to Fairview Road should improve dramatically, Chappelle said. 
It's not the same story, however, further to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Along the southern stretch, the company building the project, E.L. Yeager 
Construction Co., will, in September or October, begin shaving back the sides 
of the ditch in order to erect a lengthy, 30-foot-tall concrete retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, which will take at least six months to complete, will entail taking 
away two of the three existing lanes on southbound Newport Boulevard. After the 
wall is built, the section behind will be back-filled with dirt and then the 
two lanes of roadbed robbed from Newport Boulevard will be repoured. The same 
thing will be done to northbound Newport Boulevard, probably beginning in the 
fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the result of such work will be monumental traffic jams along 
Newport Boulevard, the key route leading to and from the beaches, restaurants 
and night spots of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to have a major impact on traffic," Chappelle said. "There's not a 
lot of alternative routes, but most people will get used to it and find their 
way around the tie-ups. The worst will be the weekends. It's going to be a 
mess. No doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
Several merchants along the route, especially those who depend on drive-by 
business, are none too pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Daniels, night manager at Minute King Liquor-Deli on northbound Newport 
Boulevard, said the congestion has already cut into business. Many people, he 
said, seem too worried about dealing with the traffic to pull off and buy a bag 
of chips or six-pack of soda. Even when the freeway is completed, things may 
only be worse, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The store has been very slow," Daniels said. "I think it's only going to 
continue and probably get worse. The end result, I think, will be things going 
down big time. I think we're going to lose just about everything, profit wise." 
</P>
<P>
Just up the street at Rancho Market, store manager Libby Pike said the 
congestion has actually seemed to help business there, as "people who have to 
wait in traffic come in." But she said the owners worry about what will happen 
when the freeway opens. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Heinz, executive director of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, said the 
construction work "has in general had an effect on businesses on both sides of 
the freeway" but suggested that the "overall effect" of the freeway will be 
positive for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa still hopes that the freeway can be connected 
with Coast Highway in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we're very glad to see it happening," Buffa said. "But it 
doesn't mean a great deal until it goes somewhere, and the logical place is the 
Pacific Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for any further work, however, are dim. 
</P>
<P>
The project is not included on the state's long-range budget for transportation 
projects. It wasn't even included among the wish list of projects to be 
financed under Proposition M, the half-cent sales tax increase for Orange 
County highway and transit projects that failed at the polls last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a route below 19th Street," Buffa said, "but the bottom line to that 
story is that there is no funding. It's just not going to happen in the 
foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ratzlaff, deputy district director for planning at Caltrans in Orange 
County, said there is a possibility that the sort of traffic jams that 
historically have formed where the Costa Mesa Freeway funnels into Newport 
Boulevard may simply be moved further south when the current project is 
completed.
