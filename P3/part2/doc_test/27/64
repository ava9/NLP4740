If it is true that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the car
culture, then be sure that it will not go out without an explosion of blown
gaskets and a few righteous puffs of blue smoke. For hell - or the M25 -
hath no fury like a motorist, surrounded by traffic cones, juggernauts and
vapid environmentalists, being asked to pay more for the 'privilege' of
using his or her car.
This anger is not so hard to understand. Bizarrely, taking a car out for a
spin has come to represent one of the few expressions of personal freedom
left in a world of increasing uniformity and staleness.
Perhaps only the historians of the 25th century will be able to tell the
story with the necessary degree of detachment; how strapping yourself into a
confined space for a couple of hours came to symbolise the ultimate in
liberation from modern life's quotidian drudgery.
But such are the claims made for car culture. Listening to a mournful radio
phone-in following the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, which had the temerity to pronounce that Britain's road-obsessed
transport programme was unsustainable, it was as if we were being asked to
sacrifice the most inalienable of our rights.
Well, I like a whirl in my Alfa like the next man (and, my goodness, what a
boy's world it is). But the man ringing the radio station from his mobile
telephone in the middle of his traffic-jammed route to central London must
surely have realised how absurd he sounded when he talked, like an old
trucker, of 'the freedom of the roads'.
In truth, the romantic view of car culture, the world of throbbing engines,
hair-raising curves and consummate clutch control, is fast dying on its
wheels. There is not much fun to be had in driving today's bland, sanitised
cars; indeed, to talk of a 'culture' at all is to evoke a whimsical image
far removed from the belchingly slow reality of the average city vehicle,
power-steering (what a mocking misnomer) its way at 7mph into another
gormless queue.
Car designers have realised this. After a brief spasm of 'supercar' madness
in the 1980s, they have settled into their more pragmatic briefs of
producing neat, small, efficient cars for the 1990s.
Advertisers, ahead of the game as always, have plucked out a series of neat,
small, pretty girls to promote these otherwise charmless items. Nicole, in
her oh-so-wicked fling through the Provencal countryside, is the future of
car culture; slinky, surreptitious, a bit on the side, like a quick drag on
a Gauloise.
Soon, cars will become so naughty and so compact that we will deny that we
possess one at all, only to disappear for a couple of hours to a concealed
entrance, like the launchpad of Thunderbird Two, for some serious
clandestine pleasure.
Of course eventually, no one will be able, nor feel the need to drive
because we shall have a perfect public transport system. But we shall just
sit there, on a specially-painted double yellow line, challenging the world
at large to come and give us a ticket if it dares] It will be the
quintessential free thinker's act of civil disobedience, recalling a world
when the boundaries of state power were drawn well beyond the twinkling
horizon of the next service station.
In the meantime, we are stuck with what we have got: too few roads, too many
fumes, tempers fraying and time running out. When they all come together, as
they presently do if you are trying to drive into Heathrow Airport, for
example, they represent the very opposite of freedom, the flip-side of
culture, the most appalling example of over-consumption and stress
mis-management you could ever hope to see.
Political will is at last catching up with the public perception that the
cost of the motorist's freedom has simply grown too high to bear. It is time
for all of us, macho boys and furtive girls, to grow up.
