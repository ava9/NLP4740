Sir, I read with interest your recent report about motorway toll plans in
Great Britain ('Tories attack motorway toll plans', August 13), because the
questions raised have global relevance. Let me add a few observations about
the long-term trends as we can observe them over the world.
First, the total level of road user charging (taxes plus tolls) will go on
rising for decades to come, whatever we do, because all financial
administrations are increasingly resorting to road user charges as an easy
way to boost resources and help plug the yawning gap in public accounts. For
instance, in 1992 total income from road traffic in the 18 most developed
countries in Europe was approximately Pounds 150bn, whereas total road
expenditure (construction, maintenance, operation) was about Pounds 50bn.
Thus Pounds 100bn was diverted to other purposes: the rate of diversion has
been continuously rising for the past 12 years.
Second, the only question open now is what proportion of the total charge
may flow back to road users in terms of road improvement (network extension,
causeway widening, elimination of safety black spots, environmental
protection, high-tech services).
Third, the best way to make sure that road users' money goes back to road
users is to privatise road operations, ie concede toll, traffic and
maintenance management to autonomous, competing enterprises.
Fourth, this 'privatisation', thanks to the generalisation of automatic
tolling devices, can and probably must progressively apply to existing road
and street facilities as well as to new ones. Thus the 'traffic flight'
issue - which by the way rarely goes beyond a 10-15 per cent shift of
traffic, at most, during the first four or six months after commissioning a
toll motorway - would disappear in due time.
