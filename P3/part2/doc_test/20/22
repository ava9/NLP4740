FT  19 NOV 92 / Guidelines may be set up for human genetics research

THE government is considering establishing a national policy on human
genetics - an area in which research is moving very quickly and raising
important social, regulatory and industrial issues.
The policy could include guidelines to cover controversial areas such as
patenting human genes and preventing discrimination against potential
carriers of genetic diseases. It could also lay down a strategy to enable
industry, particularly drug companies, to benefit as much as possible from
genetic research.
Professor Bill Stewart, the government chief scientist, has held a
preliminary meeting with the research directors of leading drug companies,
medical charities and the government's Medical Research Council to exchange
ideas on what might be done.
The Office of Science and Technology has decided that genetics is an
important area of science which could benefit from such a co-ordinated
approach. The office was set up after the election with Mr William
Waldegrave as minister in charge.
If the move is successful, it could be a blueprint for similar action by the
office in other fields.
Researchers are discovering thousands of new human genes every year. Within
15 years they expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes which provide
the blueprint for human development from the foetus to old age.
They are developing tests to diagnose genetic defects that predispose people
to illness - and are beginning to find ways to correct defects through 'gene
therapy'.
The issues covered by the Office of Science and Technology review are likely
to include:
Ethics: how to protect the rights of individuals and families who are
carrying genes that predispose them to serious diseases such as cancer.
Legislation may be needed to outlaw 'genetic discrimination' by employers
and insurers.
Ownership: the terms under which researchers can patent human genes and
exploit them commercially. The Medical Research Council has followed the
controversial lead of the US National Institutes of Health in applying for
pre-emptive patents on thousands of genes whose function is not yet known.
Research: how to co-ordinate programmes in the UK with similar efforts
elsewhere. The country's leading genetic research centre is likely to be the
Pounds 50m Sanger Centre, which the research council and Wellcome Trust are
setting up near Cambridge.
Dr Richard Sykes, research director of Glaxo, said that from the
pharmaceutical industry's point of view, 'a key issue is how we can access
and manipulate the tremendous amounts of information generated about human
genes to fight disease'.
