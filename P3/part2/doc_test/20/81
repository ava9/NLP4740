<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction
of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving
viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which
are only vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1&hyph;N containment. A minimum containment
of BL2 or BL2&hyph;N is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Caution_Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with transgenic
animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or increased transmission
of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In such cases, serious consideration
should be given to increasing the containment conditions.

Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;a. Recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, from any source
except for greater than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any non-human vertebrate or any
invertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N
and appropriate to the organism under study (see Section V&hyph;B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not lead to transmissible infection either directly
or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in animals, may be propagated under conditions of physical
containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N and appropriate to the organism under study. Experiments involving
the introduction of other sequences from eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;b.
For experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified Class 2, 3, 4, or 5 organisms, see Section V&hyph;A. It is important
that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized does not lead to productive
infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Section V&hyph;R
and V&hyph;T).

Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom,
involving whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;1 or III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;a,
the appropriate containment shall be determined by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.

Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant DNA methods, to use such plants for other experimental
purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use plants together with microorganisms or insects
containing recombinant DNA, may be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a
through III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;e. If experiments involving whole plants are not described in Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5
and do not fall under Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, or III&hyph;E, they are included in Section III&hyph;D.

. For recombinant DNA experiments falling under Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a through III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;d,
physical containment requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological containment
practices, such as conducting experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence of that vector or
using a genetically attenuated strain.

Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a. BL3&hyph;P (Plants) or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended
for experiments involving most exotic (see Section V&hyph;W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious
detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant DNA techniques are associated with whole plants.

Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;b. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments

agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural ecosystems in which there
exists the possibility of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the infectious agent by genomic complementation
