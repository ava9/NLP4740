It's not unusual for 17-year-old Daniel Cooper to wake up at 4 a.m., tiptoe 
quietly out of his house and into his van, then pull slowly away from the front 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
Most parents would squawk that such behavior is for the birds. Cooper's know 
it's for the bird-watching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been interested in birds since he was about 5 years old," said Daniel's 
mother, Lily Cooper. "Before he knew how to drive, his dad and I would take him 
on these bird walks and he would be the only one there who wasn't an adult. In 
fact, there weren't even any teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cooper contributes a regular column on bird-watching, or birding, as it 
is called, to a monthly newsletter published by the Friends of the Los Angeles 
River, a conservation group. And recently, the San Marino High School senior 
completed his "Beginners' Bird Guide to San Marino and Vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper wrote and illustrated the 27-page booklet, which features pen-and-ink 
drawings of about 50 of the most common species in the area. The guide 
describes, among other things, each bird's markings, the sound it makes, its 
habitat and its migratory patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he embarked on the project after leading bird walks for the Los 
Angeles and Pasadena Audubon societies, as well as for the Huntington Library 
Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people who go out on the tours are really interested in birds, 
but they don't know a lot about them," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's booklet, which was put together with the assistance of the Huntington 
Library, is sold at the library's bookstore, as well as at the Eaton Canyon 
Nature Center and the El Molino Viejo, which is run by the San Marino 
Historical Society. He also plans to sell the guides while leading bird walks 
around the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the market is," he said, rolling his eyes. "If you can even call 
it that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooper spends many Saturdays at local parks and other areas where 
common birds can be found, the real thrill for him is spotting rare ones. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of such birds as the blue-footed booby, the yellow-bellied 
flycatcher and the black-billed cuckoo, Cooper has ventured on daylong and 
overnight expeditions to desert oases in the state such as the Morongo Valley 
and Mojave Narrows Regional Park. He also has traveled to coastal communities 
such as Newport Back Bay, Central Park in Huntington Beach and Point Loma in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Once while he was in Deep Springs, in Mono County about 300 miles north of Los 
Angeles, he and a birding companion spotted a rare eastern phoebe. When they 
returned and reported their sighting, they were met with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"We told these guys who are well known Los Angeles County birders, but because 
it's a rare bird they didn't believe us," he said with a shrug. "Sometimes 
people don't take me seriously because of my age." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when he was as young as 10, Cooper's parents indulged his interest in 
birding and accompanied him on organized tours and walks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to go out with my dad, people thought he was the birder and that I 
was just a kid who didn't know anything," Cooper recalled. "But really it was 
the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is older and doesn't have to take his parents along, Cooper's hobby 
has really taken off. Knowing about birds has meant learning about Southern 
California's natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain birds you can't find unless you can recognize a red fir or a 
lodgepole pine," he said, referring to the types of trees where certain birds 
forage. "You can't be into birding without knowing about ecology, nature and 
the seasons." 
</P>
<P>
He has even learned a bit about development and politics. "Suddenly it's not an 
issue you read about in the paper," Cooper said. "When you see barren land and 
a bulldozer where a row of Joshua trees used to be, you get involved on a 
personal level."
