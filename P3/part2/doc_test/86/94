THE MONKEY puzzle is probably Chile's best-known contribution to the world
of trees. But its commercial use being prohibited, the country's timber
business is built on the pine and other softwoods that thrive in its
temperate climate, writes David Lascelles in Santiago.
Five hundred miles south of the capital, near the provincial town of Los
Angeles, a newer industry is evolving round the eucalyptus. Once imported
from Australia, the tree is now a familiar sight in the rolling hills of
Chile's south central region.
The eucalyptus has taken well to Chile. In the right conditions it grows as
much as a foot a month, reaching a harvestable height of 25 metres within
eight to ten years.
Much of the pioneering work is being done by Santa Fe Group, a wood pulping
joint venture 60 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell, and 20 per cent each
by Scott Paper and Citibank, which converted some of its outstanding Chilean
debt into the investment. Founded in the late 1980s, Santa Fe now owns
49,000 hectares (120,000 acres) of plantations, of which 32,500 are planted.
According to Mr Ian Powell, resource manager in the forestry division, much
of the land needed thorough restoration before it could be used. Years of
cattle farming had compacted the soil, requiring it to be ploughed to a
depth of 80 cm to loosen it up. Large quantities of fertiliser and
weedkiller were also needed to 'control the competition', as he puts it.
In the nurseries on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the company is developing
two strains: eucalyptus globulus and the more frost-resistant eucalyptus
nitens. Considerable work has gone into genetic improvement using cloning
technology developed by Shell researchers at their laboratory in
Sittingbourne in Kent.
The highly automated nurseries have a capacity for 10m seedlings, which are
grown under wide net tents and watered with a special mix of nutrients fed
by sprinklers. The seedlings are kept for up to 10 months before being
planted out.
The nursery and plantations will eventually provide all the raw material for
Santa Fe's pulping plant to the west of Los Angeles. But at the moment the
18-month-old facility still has to buy in a third of its annual
800,000-cubic metre requirement from other sources.
The importance of eucalyptus is that it provides a ready source of
short-fibre pulp, as opposed to the long fibre in pine wood. Short fibre has
special uses, such as tissues.
The plant's output is 250,000 tonnes a year and the bulk of its Dollars
100m-a-year sales go to Scott Paper affiliates.
Although Santa Fe marks an advance for the Chilean timber industry, its
timing has been bad. Mr Nick Whalley, the executive vice president, expects
recent softness of the pulp market to delay the venture's move into profit.
'The short term profitability is not good,' he says, 'but we project
substantial financial returns two to three years from now.'
One of the heavy costs in establishing the plant has been environmental
control, which Mr Pedro Navarette, the plant's environmental engineer,
estimates to have accounted for Dollars 28m of the investment. Like many
foreign ventures, Santa Fe is expected to abide by the highest environmental
standards, while local, state-owned competitors have more leeway.
