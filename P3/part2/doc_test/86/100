SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environment
impacts of a proposal to harvest timber, use prescribed fire, and implement travel management changes on Crane Mountain,
on the Swan Lake Ranger District. This EIS will tier to the Flathead National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan
(LRMP) and EIS of January 1986, which provides overall guidance in achieving the desired future condition for the
area.

The Proposed Action is designed to implement the Flathead Forest Plan within the context of Ecosystem Management
principles. The primary purpose for development of the Proposed Action is to address an on-going Mountain Pine Beetle
epidemic which is causing extensive mortality in lodgepole pine on Crane Mountain. The Proposed Action is designed
to address the short- and long-term consequences of the epidemic. The Proposed Action will reduce the likelihood
of a large intense fire by reducing the accumulation of dry fuels through salvage of dead lodgepole pine and treatment
of residual slash, accelerate re-establishment of a variety of tree species in area of high mortality, contribute
to the current demands for timber and provide for long-term sustainability of wood products and other resource elements.

A portion of the Proposed Action is designed to address the effects of past fire suppression in fire-dependent forest
communities where ponderosa pine was once a major tree species. Use of prescribed fire is proposed to begin to reverse
the destabilizing effect of post-settlement fire suppression on dry sites, moving towards the relatively open stands
dominated by ponderosa pine and western larch which historically existed in these areas.

A third aspect of the Proposed Action is designed to improve on existing levels of grizzly bear habitat security. Changes
in Travel Management would bring the area into compliance with LRMP standards for open road density in grizzly bear
habitat, and take further steps to provide more effective road closures and increase, over time, the proportion of
unroaded secure habitat on Crane Mountain.

Preliminary scoping for this project began in the fall of 1992. At this time the Forest Service is seeking information
and comments from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may now be interested
in or affected by the Proposed Action. This input will be used in preparing the Draft EIS. This process will include:
