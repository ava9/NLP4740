Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were investigating Tuesday whether a 
16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found buried beneath a pile of pine 
needles near a flood-control channel in Lakewood was a murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
The fully clothed body of Zuleima Valdez was discovered at 5:45 p.m. Monday by 
two teen-agers riding bicycles near a paved trail on the Lakewood side of the 
Coyote Creek flood control channel, Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. The 
channel marks the border between Cypress and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
There were no visible signs of trauma on the body, Wahla said. An autopsy was 
scheduled for later this week to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found in a hollow dirt area about 50 feet from the paved path and 
was partially buried under a pile of pine needles, leading sheriff's 
investigators to believe someone attempted to hide the remains, Wahla said. 
Pine needles from evergreen trees rimming Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Cypress 
are lightly scattered throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez's parents had reported her missing to Cypress police at 1:25 a.m. 
Monday, Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer said. She was last seen at 9:30 p.m. 
Sunday, when she left her home with a friend to go to the beach, according to 
Wahla. 
</P>
<P>
Jack D. Weber, the principal at Cypress High School where Valdez was a 
freshman, described the girl as an average to above-average student who was 
quiet and well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, she seemed to be doing fine," Weber said. "Her attendance record was 
good. We had no knowledge of any conflict . . . in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez had moved with her family from New York to Cypress just before she 
started eighth grade at Lexington Junior High School, Principal Pat Savage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cypress High School, Weber announced the news of Valdez's death over the 
school's public address system and said counseling will be available for 
students. The flag was lowered to half-staff and a memorial service in the 
school theater was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Group counseling sessions held throughout the day drew many of Valdez's friends 
as well as students who barely knew her, Weber said.
