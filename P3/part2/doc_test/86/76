<P>
In one of the most sweeping consumer actions ever mounted by the Orange County 
district attorney, prosecutors Tuesday filed suit against a Garden Grove 
property management firm accused of illegally withholding security deposits 
from hundreds of apartment renters. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein also issued a preliminary injunction 
against the firm, Elerding Properties, prohibiting its operators and employees 
from withholding refundable deposits, falsifying records, or inflating repair 
and cleaning bills sent to former tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that over the last four years, Elerding Properties has 
"engaged in and (is) still engaging in certain acts of unfair, unlawful and 
fraudulent business practices." It seeks restitution and at least $2,500 in 
penalties for each alleged violation, according to the complaint filed in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of affected renters is still being tallied, "This is one of 
the most widespread violations of consumer laws that our unit has had to deal 
with," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Kralick of the office's consumer and 
environmental protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Elerding Properties have maintained that the firm is not guilty 
of any wrongdoing and that it will contest the lawsuit. The firm's lawyer, 
Arthur Morello, was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Fair Housing Council say the failure of 
landlords to promptly refund security deposits is a significant problem that 
contributes to homelessness. During its last fiscal year, the agency received 
5,278 complaints of non-refunded security deposits valued at about $2.85 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these (renters) could not afford the loss of this money at a time that 
it was needed for relocation," fair housing officials wrote in a recent report 
to the Orange County Community Development Council. "Consequently, hundreds 
faced homelessness due to the wrongful taking of their deposits. . . . Many 
managers have virtually institutionalized their own process so as to be in a 
best position to take a helpless tenant's money." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported five weeks ago that at least 113 renters had filed small 
claims suits against Elerding and that the Marine Corps had taken the 
extraordinary step of removing the firm's 10 Orange County and two Los Angeles 
County complexes from its approved housing list. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred other former renters have not filed suit to recover their 
security deposits but have written letters of complaint to Elerding Properties, 
according to two company employees who asked not to be identified for fear of 
losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's complaint does not specify the number of alleged 
violations uncovered by investigators. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kralick said 
several investigators have been working full-time during the last month to 
compile a complete list of the renters whose deposits were illegally withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"They are literally going through thousands of documents," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the list is completed, Kralick said he would file an amendment to 
the lawsuit along with a list of alleged building violations. The Orange County 
Environmental Health Division had received at least 43 complaints since January 
of 1989 of substandard housing conditions at some of the firm's apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names as defendants the estate of Dr. Charles E. Elerding Jr., his 
wife, Janet R. Elerding, two trusts held in each of their names, and their 
three sons -- Charles III, James and Joseph Elerding. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Elerding served as company president before he died of cancer last 
May. Two years ago, he was featured in Sports Illustrated when he and his wife 
provided a $1.75-million endowment to the USC football team -- the largest 
single contribution ever made to the school's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also identifies 10 apartment complexes and 27 other properties 
owned and operated by the rental company. The Orange County complexes owned by 
Elerding include: Amberwood in Buena Park; Casa Madrid in Cypress; Mountain 
View Apartments and Villa Viejo Apartments in El Toro; City Park Plaza in 
Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments and Bahia Puerto in Huntington Beach; 
Tustin Arms Apartments in Orange, and Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree 
Apartments in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Civil Code, a landlord is allowed to withhold all or part 
of a renter's security deposit to cover nonpayment of rent, clean the premises 
or repair "damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear." 
Within two weeks of the termination of a tenancy, the landlord is required to 
give every former renter an itemized statement listing the basis for any amount 
that is being withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Several renters' groups have charged that some landlords arbitrarily withhold 
the entire amount or a portion of the security deposit by claiming that the 
apartment needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the injunction specifically enjoins officials of Elerding Properties 
from "falsifying any 'vacating statements,' or inflating expenses listed on 
'vacating statements' when determining the cost of restoring a vacated unit to 
its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
As part of an agreement struck with the district attorney's office, Elerding 
Properties has agreed to make available to investigators copies of all written 
rental agreements for four years after the termination of each tenancy. The 
firm has also agreed to allow its employees and apartment managers to be 
interviewed by district attorney's investigators.
