Noted author Michael Herr ("Dispatches," the just-out "Walter Winchell") has 
signed on to rewrite "Wounded Knee," which producer Christopher Mankiewicz at 
one time hoped to have in theaters by Dec. 29. That's the 100th anniversary of 
the infamous confrontation between the 7th U.S. Cavalry and Sioux at Wounded 
Knee Creek on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, which left 153 Indians 
dead, many of them women and children.

But the WGA strike and other circumstances intervened, and Mankiewicz tells us 
he'll now be happy to be in production by that date.

Tab Murphy (who co-wrote "Gorillas in the Mist") wrote the first script, 
telling dual stories: the 1973 occupation of the historic battlefield by 
American Indian Movement militants, who were under siege by government troops 
for 71 days; and a risky airlift of supplies to the stranded activists by a 
bunch of "average white guys" from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Mankiewicz calls Murphy's draft "a first-rate action adventure script" that 
needs a more serious, socially conscious tone -- Herr's task. "We're trying to 
use the overall structure of Murphy's script but emphasize the Indians' story . 
. . re-balancing to the Indian point of view. It's a drama of a culture trying 
to survive and maintain its identity, a struggle that continues today."

The Warner Bros. feature, one of a number of films in development focusing on 
American Indian culture, is not related to author Dee Brown's "Bury My Heart at 
Wounded Knee," a project that Marlon Brando and others have tried 
unsuccessfully to turn into a film over the years. John M. Wilson
