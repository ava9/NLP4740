FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Stamping out Greece's pine
fires

There are few trees so inflammable as the resinous Aleppo pine that provides
a green backdrop for summer villas and tourist resorts along much of
Greece's coastline. When fire breaks out, exploding pine cones shoot out in
all directions.
Last year, a record number of fires devastated more than 50,000 hectares of
forest, scrub and grazing land around Greece. The forestry service logged
2,100 fires - almost double the average for the three previous years - in a
season marked by prolonged hot weather and fierce winds.
Despite increased spending on firefighting aircraft, communications systems
and hiring several thousand temporary forest guards for the summer,
governments have failed to establish an effective fire protection system.
Indeed, as firefighting methods grow more sophisticated, it becomes harder
to enlist public support for the forestry service. 'People just sit in the
cafe watching the fire and waiting for the aeroplanes to start dropping
water,' says Dimitris Katsoudas, the government's secretary general for
forestry.
However, the disastrous fires in 1992, including blazes on Rhodes and Crete,
Greece's two most popular tourist islands, prompted a switch in policy. The
government says it will shortly seek bids from private companies to set up a
nationwide fire protection service.
Greece's pine forests have grown more vulnerable to fire because of steady
depopulation of the countryside, together with the encroachment of tourism.
Access to forest areas became easier as the coastline was opened up for
development. Villagers who return home for the summer to cater for tourists
no longer make use of the forest.
'Woodland isn't considered a resource. The charcoal-burners and
resin-tappers are gone. Dry branches and undergrowth aren't collected for
fuel so when a fire starts there's a wealth of combustible material,' says
George Mavrommatis, head of the Forest Research Institute in Athens.
What Greece needs is better prevention techniques and improved co-ordination
in firefighting, according to Conair, a Canadian company that has studied
forest fires in Greece and operates fire protection services in other
Mediterranean countries.
'Communications and training are crucial in firefighting. Aircraft should be
used with discrimination - after all, you have no guarantee the fire is out
without people on the ground,' says Jim Dunkel, Conair's vice president.
Without better prevention, the coastal forests will go on shrinking.
Regardless of the law on reforestation, only about 10 per cent of burned
acreage is replanted in an average year, mainly because the forestry service
is chronically short of funds. This year, the figure will rise to 20 per
cent thanks to support from the European Community, which will cover 75 per
cent of the Dr8bn (Pounds 24m) cost of replanting 10,000 hectares.
Although Aleppo pine is often used for replanting as it grows quickly, the
Forest Research Institute has pioneered cultivation of less inflammable
trees. It recommends planting spiny varieties of oak similar to those that
covered Greek hillsides in ancient times.
Yet the chances of restoring forest cover are sharply reduced unless
barriers are built to stop soil erosion and water loss. And even if the
water-table remains high enough to support tree growth, young saplings are
often eaten by roaming goats.
'The biggest enemy of forest regeneration is the huge goat population in
Greece of about 6m. Goat herds are in short supply these days, but EC
subsidies encourage farmers to keep goats, who let them run free much of the
time,' says Katsoudas.
