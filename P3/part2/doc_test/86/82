SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

The Proposed Action has been developed to respond to existing conditions in the Crane Mountain area, ecosystem management
principles, and Forest Plan direction for the area. For the past several years, Crane Mountain has been experiencing
a Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) epidemic. The Mountain Pine Beetle is a wood boring insect which affects primarily mature
lodgepole pine trees. When beetle populations are high, as is the case on Crane Mountain, they can cause widespread
mortality. Approximately 3500 acres (20%) of the Crane Mountain landscape is occupied by trees which are susceptible
to MPB mortality. At present, extensive mortality has occurred on approximately 2000 acres where lodgepole pine
is the primary tree species. An additional 1000 acres of mixed species stands have also been impacted by more scattered
lodgepole pine mortality. Additional mortality is predicted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Without management action, MPB activity will result in considerable change on the landscape over time. During the
next decade or two, most dead trees will blow over. Areas which used to have dense lodgepole pine forests will become
open, dominated by grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Dead trees will result in an increased fuel loading and increased possibility
of stand replacement wildfire. Extensive mortality will change the habitat conditions for many wildlife species
over time. Areas of hiding cover and thermal cover for large mammals will be lost in the short-term. The changes in vegetation
will also affect water yield and water quality, and the visual quality of the area. With or without fire, trees will
gradually become re-established, but without management action it may take an additional 10 to 20 years for openings
to become fully re-stocked with trees.

Proposed management activities have been designed to address both long- and short-term consequences of the current
Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic on Crane Mountain. Specifically, the proposal includes the following components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reduce the likelihood of a large intense fire, by reducing the accumulation of dry fuels through salvage of dead
lodgepole pine and treatment of residual slash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Accelerate re-establishment of a variety of tree species in areas with high levels of MPB mortality. Timely reforestation
of harvested areas will help ameliorate the affects of wide-spread mortality more rapidly than if nature is allowed
to take its course in the area. Proposed actions will provide for more rapid stabilization of exposed soils in riparian
areas, more rapid return to wildlife cover conditions, and provide for more insect and disease resistant conditions
across the landscape.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Contribute to the short-term demands for timber and provide for utilization of a variety of wood products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accomplish other resource objectives in conjunction with proposed harvest activities, including:

A portion of the Proposed Action is designed to reverse the destabilizing effect of post-settlement fire suppression
on dry sites, historically dominated by open grown stands of ponderosa pine and western larch. The objective is to
create stand conditions more characteristic of those found on these sites under the pre-settlement fire regime.
This stand type and structure provides an important, and quickly disappearing, niche for a variety of plant and animal
species, including flammulated owl and old growth management indicator species. Treatment would be accomplished
through a combination of slashing and prescribed fire. This would reduce the stocking in understory Douglas-fir,
moving towards the relatively open stands dominated by ponderosa pine and western larch which historically existed
in these areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Action is designed to incorporate a variety of Travel Management changes to reduce open road densities
to within current LRMP standards and to balance public access with measure to provide improved grizzly bear habitat
security in areas of high quality spring and summer habitats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management activities under consideration would occur in an area encompassing approximately 40,000 acres of National
Forest lands in the East Shore and Lower Swan Geographic Units, on the Swan Lake Ranger District, as delineated in the
LRMP. Proposed harvest or burning activities would occur in portions of the following: Sections 21, 22, and 26&hyph;35,
T26N, R19W, and Sections 2&hyph;4, 9&hyph;11, 13&hyph;16, and 21&hyph;36, T25N, R19W, Principal Montana Meridian.
Proposed changes in Travel Management would be distributed across a larger area, including portions of T26N, R19W;
T25N, R19W; T26N, R18W; T25N, R18W; and T24N, R18W.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Action includes harvest treatment on approximately 960 acres and use of prescribed fire in three areas,
totalling 400 acres. Harvested areas would be treated to reduce fuels accumulations and to prepare sites for reforestation.
Tree planting is proposed on approximately 800 acres to ensure rapid reforestation. No new road construction is proposed,
but approximately 3 miles of temporary road would be required to access harvested areas. A portion of the proposed
treatments would require helicopter logging. A variety of changes to travel management are also proposed, including
road closures via rocks or berms and reclamation measures designed to remove some roads from the long-term transportation
system. The Proposed Action would close approximately 51 miles or road which are currently open to motorized use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Action would require a site-specific amendment to the LRMP to vary from the grizzly bear distance to cover
guideline and the duration of activity/re-entry period criteria for grizzly bear habitat. These deviations are
proposed in order to address the on-going MPB epidemic and meet the Purpose and Need for Action on a timely basis.
