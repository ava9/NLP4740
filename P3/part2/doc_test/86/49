God Spends His Vacation Here' is the claim inscribed on the ashtrays of the
Rustic Pine, Dubois, Wyoming.
It is a bar that might have been lifted out of any classic Hollywood
western: a hugely long counter, wooden cubicles on the side, lots of elk and
moose heads, a pool-table out back and square dancing on Tuesdays.
On the street, with its many log buildings and wooden sidewalks, the Rustic
Pine makes another resonant boast with its neon-lit board: 'The World's Most
Unique.'
With their long, straggling main streets, their depressing line of motels,
supermarkets, gas stations, shops selling American-Indian tat, trailer homes
and camper parking lots, there must be scores of places like this scattered
all over the American West.
Dubois offers all these eyesores, but it has some redeeming features - most
notably, spectacular country in every direction, all of it strangely
familiar from dozens of movies.
To the north lie the Absaroka mountains, tree-covered and alpine on their
lower slopes, rising to snow-covered peaks even in July. To the east and
west are the vivid rose-red and yellow badlands.
Passing close to the town is the lovely, sinuous Wind River, famous for its
variety of trout. Take a dirt road for half a dozen miles and you will be on
the threshold of the Wind River mountains, Wyoming's premier back-packing
area, with its many lakes and peaks rising to almost 14,000 ft. And two
hours' drive away you can reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
For most of the past century, Dubois has lived off its cattle rearing and
logging, but now the riding, trekking and fishing communities have begun to
wake to its tourist attractions.
There are no decent hotels or restaurants yet; they will come in time.
Meanwhile, if you are content to eat beef - especially prime rib - you will
not lack for calorific intake.
All along the Wind River valley, guest ranches are springing up, sometimes
attached to a working cattle ranch. Accommodation tends to be in rustic log
cabins with wood-burning stoves. Some have all the amenities of a good
hotel: pools, saunas, hot tubs, decent cooking.
My party comprised seven geriatric dudes - dude being a term of contempt for
some, but in these parts a neutral description of city folk holidaying on a
ranch. Six of us were in our mid-60s to mid-70s and only one of us had done
any serious riding before.
Were we nervous? You could say so. One so-called friend told us of an
article by Clement Freud who had come out to do some riding - he's an
experienced horseman - but had fallen off on his first day. The horse fell
on him and he broke a limb and wrote a funny piece about his hospital
experiences.
We were advised before leaving to bathe in vinegar to minimise our saddle
sores; to buy a stock of Arnica ointment for the abrasions we would surely
get along our thighs; and to be prepared for ticks, leeches, snakes and
mosquitoes.
Our ranch had sent us in advance a list of recommended items: riding boots
and lightweight walking boots (bought locally for a fraction of the price
they would have cost in Britain); powerful sunblockers and chapstick; lots
of warm clothing and sleepwear (the nights can be bitterly cold); and
mosquito repellent (another must).
We did not encounter the leeches or the snakes, but were given instructions
for dealing with the ticks which, we were told, like to attach themselves to
private parts and can give you a nasty disease if you don't quickly light a
match, blow it out and apply the hot end to the little beast.
As for the riding, it was for all of us wonderful. We trotted and cantered;
we hacked through beautiful scenery; and on an all-day expedition rose
effortlessly up precipitous slopes from 7,500 ft to a summit of over 11,000
ft.
After eight hours in the saddle we were exhausted, but exultant to have
stayed so long on our mounts without aches or sores.
How do I account for our painless initiation? First, the high quality of our
wranglers, those in charge of the corral, and their helpful instructions.
Second, the sure-footed confidence of our horses and their tolerance of our
inexperience. Finally there were those wonderful western saddles, with
pommels in front as an extra security and a back moulded to the human
buttock.
The pleasures of our ranch holiday were not confined to the riding. We went
for long treks; canoed up river creeks - magical at dusk when nocturnal
birds and beasts came out to drink; swam in glacial lakes. We even took
ourselves to Dubois one evening for the weekly square-dancing.
It seemed absurd to have travelled so far and not seen anything of the two
great national parks in the vicinity. So, at the end of our fortnight at the
ranch, we decamped to Jackson, an up-and-coming mini-Vail of a resort, 100
miles to the west, where we spent a morning white-water rafting, and then
drove to Yellowstone.
We were told that nearly a third of the US population has visited
Yellowstone, and each year another 2.5m tourists swell the total.
Yellowstone has many marvels, but we were determined to see one of its
best-known attractions, the Old Faithful geyser, which, every 75 minutes or
so, spews up 11,000 gallons of scalding water to a height of 180 ft. It is a
fine sight, even if you have to share it with hundreds of fellow-gawpers and
endure the bumper-to-bumper chain of campers and trailers on the long,
monotonous drive.
For climbing, we preferred the Grand Tetons, a staggeringly impressive range
of peaks that rears up from a flat plain and comes replete with canyons,
waterfalls and lakes, and also, if you are lucky, bears and elks.
Others were more fortunate in that respect than we were (though we did eat
elk steaks, even more boring than venison), but in our brief visit we
notched up plenty of wildlife sightings - moose, buffalo, coyotes, beavers,
badgers, marmots and chipmunks, plus many blue herons, pelicans, bald-headed
eagles, hawks and ospreys.
For most of us it was one of the most energetic out-door holidays we had
ever taken, and we were naturally chuffed that in advanced middle-age we
could derive such unremitting pleasure from our exertions. Would we go
again? Emphatically yes.
Recommended ranches in the Dubois area: all four ranches are personally run
by resident owners, with superior home cooking, and are flexible about
