against deforestation - A look at initiatives aimed at saving the world's
second biggest forested area

In Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, seemingly endless forests
cover the landscape, creating the impression of an infinite resource. It is
difficult to picture this vast, rugged, sparsely populated region stripped
of most of its trees.
Yet the World Bank warns that harvests from Indonesia's tropical forests,
the world's largest after Brazil's, are running about 50 per cent higher
than the estimated sustainable cut.
Indonesia's minister of forestry, Mr Djamaludin Suryohadikusomo, has set in
motion a plan to deal with the problems of deforestation, the first
Indonesian minister to take such action.
In September he introduced a restructuring of government regulations on
forestry management, promising to crack down on logging companies that fail
to manage their concessions responsibly. The regulations are aimed at
loggers who cut trees outside their concession areas, illegally convert
logged forest land to agriculture or fail to replant.
Mr Djamaludin admitted there were only 113m ha of natural forest cover left
in Indonesia, as opposed to earlier claims of 141m ha.
The minister announced that as the current 20-year logging concessions
expired, forest areas would be converted into a new type of management unit,
operating on a long-term basis and having an average size of 100,000 ha. 'If
someone is managing a forest area, as opposed to just having a licence to
sell the stock in a concession area, then there is a far greater incentive
to protect it,' commented a Jakarta-based forestry consultant.
The current duration of concessions does not encourage replanting of trees
that will take about 70 years to mature.
Supporters of the new system argue that it will encourage loggers to make
inventories of tree stocks, providing the data needed to maintain a constant
growing stock and facilitating sustainable development of the resource.
Not everyone is convinced, however. It could take 25 years to implement the
system and at current rates of deforestation, Indonesia's forests do not
have that much time left. It would be far more effective, argue some
consultants, to create an independent policing system to ensure government
regulations were observed.
The Institute of Eco-labelling, set up by Indonesia's former minister of
environment Mr Emil Salim, could take on this task. But progress has been
thwarted by arguments between pressure groups, consultants and officials,
who cannot agree on how the institute should be managed or what its purpose
should be.
The idea initially was to label forest products from a sustainable forest
resource as 'environmentally sound', with manufacturers subscribing to the
system voluntarily. The problem is that most Indonesian timber products are
exported to Taiwan, Japan and Korea, where environmental concerns have low
priority.
This has convinced some that eco-labelling needs to be compulsory. An
independent inspection team publishing its reports would ensure public
accountability and a degree of transparency in the forestry sector that has
not existed to date.
The punishment of offenders would be left to the Ministry of Forestry.
There is no doubt that Mr Djamaludin's team has powers to deal with
offending loggers. Recently, the ministry took over 49 per cent of the
shares in two concessions supplying timber giant PT Barito Pacific Timber,
as punishment for irresponsible forest management. It was an unprecedented
move that tackled one of the most powerful forces in the forestry sector and
was designed to send warning signals to other concession holders.
The question is whether Mr Djamaludin has the political clout to deal
effectively with illegal and irresponsible logging. Indonesia's forestry
sector is politically powerful and Mr Djamaludin's crackdown on offenders
has been irregular and arbitrary as a result.
The forest products sector is run almost single-handedly by timber merchant
Mr Bob Hasan, who is close to the presidential family. There are five
different forestry associations, all headed by Mr Hasan.
The most significant, Apkindo, the association of plywood producers, is
often regarded as a major culprit in accelerated deforestation. It operates
as a cartel, setting prices for plywood below international levels, ensuring
that Indonesian manufacturers keep the lion's share of the world market.
Indonesia earned Dollars 4.5bn from exports of forest-based products last
year, of which 75 per cent was from plywood.
The association decides who gets an export licence, where a manufacturer
will export to and at what price.
Apkindo's political clout has been sufficient to ensure that concessions to
manufacturers are cheap. Royalties on logs average about Dollars 22 a cubic
metre, compared with between Dollars 60 to Dollars 80 in other parts of the
world. 'This creates a cavalier attitude towards the resource,' said a
forestry consultant.
In an effort to slow down the rate of deforestation, Mr Djamaludin announced
that the total annual allowable cut would be lowered to 22m cu m from 33m.
It is a bold move, but does not address another cause of accelerated
deforestation in Indonesia - illegal logging.
Mr Indro Tjahjono, a co-ordinator at Skephi, an Indonesian pressure group
working for forest preservation, says 40 to 60 per cent of all logging is
illegal. Other estimates put the demand for illegal logs at around 60m cu m
a year.
The scale of illegal logging underlines the urgent need for effective
policing.
Ms Emmy Hafild, of the environmental pressure group Walhi, points out that
about half of the Ministry of Forestry's employees work in Jakarta. 'They're
in the wrong place,' she says. 'They should be out in the field guarding the
forest.'
