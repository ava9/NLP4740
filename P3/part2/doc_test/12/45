stand-off with Kuala Lumpur

IT takes two-and-a-half hours to fly from mainland Malaysia to Sabah in the
far north of the island of Borneo, almost as long as the flight from Kuala
Lumpur to Hong Kong.
Sabah is the most far-flung state in the Malaysian Federation and has always
had a large degree of independence from the federal government authorities
in Kuala Lumpur.
But trouble is brewing in what the early explorers called 'The Land Below
the Wind'. The government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, accuses Sabah's leaders of plotting to take Sabah out of the
Malaysian federation.
Several people, including the brother of Sabah's chief minister, have been
locked up. The chief minister himself is fighting petty corruption charges
brought by the Malaysian public prosecutor.
The origins of the present stand-off between Kuala Lumpur and the
authorities in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah, go back to the last
Malaysian national elections in late 1990. A few days before polling the
ruling Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) in Sabah decided to pull out of Dr
Mahathir's National Front government.
'We felt the opposition offered more to Sabah than the National Front,' says
Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, leader of the PBS and Sabah's chief minister. The
opposition also looked at the time as if it would win. In the event Dr
Mahathir's National Front government was returned to power, though the PBS
retained its control in Sabah.
Since that election relations between Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu have
gone from bad to worse. 'These people,' says Dr Mahathir of Mr Pairin and
the PBS, 'have no principle, or any commitment at all.'
The PBS says Kuala Lumpur has cut off much needed development funding. While
much of the rest of the Malaysia is fast industrialising, Sabah is
stagnating.
'I feel,' says Mr Pairin, 'like a man under siege.' Mr Pairin insists the
PBS has no wish to take Sabah out of the Malaysian Federation, nor does he
seek a confrontation with Dr Mahathir.
'We want good relations with the federal government,' says Mr Pairin, 'but
Kuala Lumpur has a responsibility to develop the country as a whole - it
should not matter whether the PBS is in power in Sabah or not.'
Race and religion as well as politics are involved in the conflict between
Kuala Lumpur and Sabah.
Dr Mahathir's National Front government is dominated by the United Malays
National Organisation (UMNO), the main party of the Moslem Malays. Sabah has
a population of only 1.7m. More than 50 ethnic groups plus many hundreds of
thousands of immigrants from the Philippines and Indonesia make it one of
the world's more colourful cultural crossroads.
Whereas politics on the Malay peninsula has tended to be split down racial
and religious lines, Sabah has a more pluralistic political tradition.
While Sabah was a member of the National Front government, Kuala Lumpur left
its politicians alone. But now UMNO is using its considerable financial
resources to organise in Sabah. The PBS, many of whose senior members are
Christians, says UMNO is recruiting Moslem immigrants into its ranks. It
says UMNO's arrival in Sabah is divisive and threatens the state's racial
and religious harmony.
Mrs Dayang Mahani, a native of Sabah and an UMNO supporter, disagrees. 'The
PBS has caused the disharmony. We need UMNO here so as to restore relations
with the federal government and make sure Sabah shares in Malaysia's
economic progress.'
Local businesspeople are also concerned that the state is falling behind the
rest of the country. Sabah, with its abundance of natural resources
including timber and off-shore oil deposits, was once one of the richest
states in the Malaysian federation. Now it is one of the poorest. Power
costs twice as much in Sabah as it does in peninsular Malaysia.
The PBS accuses the federal authorities of doing nothing to encourage
foreign investors into Sabah while the big domestic concerns - many of whom
have connections with the governing political parties - will not risk
official disfavour by investing in the state.
There were many in Sabah who objected to the state joining the rest of
Malaysia nearly 30 years ago. Over the intervening period both Indonesia and
the Philippines have launched claims to the state. Now Dr Mahathir is
determined once and for all to claim Sabah for his UMNO party. 'The Land
Below the Wind' will be buffeted by some strong political storms over the
coming months.
