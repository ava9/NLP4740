'WELCOME TO the last frontier,' said an official of the state government in
Sabah.
The state, in the far north of the island of Borneo, certainly feels remote
from the rest of Malaysia. It takes two and a half hours to fly from Kuala
Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's capital - longer than the flight from Kuala
Lumpur to Bangkok, and not much shorter than the journey from the Malaysian
capital to Hong Kong.
Kota Kinabalu, on the South China Sea, has only 200,000 people and the pace
of life is considerably slower than on the Malaysian peninsula. The people
are different: there are more than 50 groupings of native peoples with
distinct languages and dialects. There are settlers from the peninsula, plus
Chinese, mostly the descendants of immigrants who came south in search of
work more than 100 years ago, during the time when the British North Borneo
Company had control over the territory.
It is a wild and beautiful land, still relatively undiscovered by tourism.
Though it is the second biggest state, after Sarawak, in the Malaysian
Federation, it has a population of only 1.7m. Commodities - mainly timber,
cocoa and palm oil - dominate the economy. There is only a small
manufacturing sector in Sabah. Agriculture accounts for 37 per cent of GDP,
compared with 17 per cent in peninsular Malaysia.
Though the good economic times are rolling in most of the rest of Malaysia,
Sabah is going through a difficult period. Part of the problem is its
remoteness and its lack of infrastructure. But politics is also involved.
Since it joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963, Sabah has had a variety of
governments, which in some cases ran the state like a private fiefdom. There
were occasional clashes with the federal authorities, but on the whole Kuala
Lumpur was content to leave Sabah politicians to themselves - so long as
they gave their support to the Barisan Nasional, the National Front
government.
But things changed in 1990. Shortly before federal elections, Sabah's ruling
party, Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), pulled out of the National Front and threw
its weight behind the opposition to the government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister.
Against the odds, the National Front won the election, though the PBS still
retains its hold on power in Sabah. Politicians and local businesspeople
agree that the economy has suffered as a result of Sabah's breakaway from
central government.
While growth has been averaging more than 8 per cent per year in Malaysia as
a whole, in Sabah it has declined to under 5 per cent. There are allegations
from the PBS and others that Kuala Lumpur is withholding federal development
funds.
'We were once one of the richest states in Malaysia,' says one PBS member.
'Now we are one of the poorest.'
One frequently heard gripe is that Sabah receives only a 5 per cent share of
revenues from the state's petroleum resources. There is also concern
expressed by the PBS that the United Malays National Organisation (Umno),
the main party in government, is now for the first time organising in Sabah.
PBS people allege Umno will be a divisive element in Sabah's multi-racial
political system.
While Dr Mahathir and other Barisan partners have made no secret of what
they regard as Sabah's political treachery, the prime minister's supporters
in Sabah say the federal government still puts far more funds into the state
than it takes out.
'Kuala Lumpur has put an enormous amount of money into Sabah,' says Mrs
Dayang Mahani, a member of the Sabah assembly and an Umno supporter. 'We
should be part of the great developments going on elsewhere in the country -
but the PBS has upset Sabah's relations with the federal government and as a
result all Sabahans are suffering.'
Mrs Dayang Mahani also rejects PBS allegations that Umno will cause trouble
in Sabah. 'They say Umno will threaten Sabah's harmony. But there has been
no political harmony.'
All parties seem to agree that Sabah has not received anything like the
investment - both foreign and domestic - that has been going to most other
states in Malaysia. But this trend was evident before the election split of
1990.
Sabah's remoteness means that costs are considerably higher than on the
peninsula - calculated at about 25 per cent above the national level. Its
vast land is sparsely populated, and infrastructural development is
expensive. Four-wheel drive vehicles are the norm in Sabah - it is only
recently that a tarred road connected the west to the east coast. Many roads
are only logging tracks.
Successive governments have tended to indulge in project politics -
investing large amounts of funds in schemes to win votes, rather than with
any overall development plan in mind.
The PBS government has encouraged downstream development of the timber
industry. But so far this has been limited mainly to sawmills for cut timber
products. A large-scale cocoa planting programme was started in the late
1970s. Malaysia has now become one of the world's top four cocoa producers,
and Sabah accounts for about 70 per cent of the country's total crop.
Malaysia, through its Sabah-based Cocoa Board, is acknowledged to be a
leader in cocoa research and development. But cocoa prices have in recent
years been steadily falling, and are now at a their lowest for nearly 20
years. Some plantations are already replacing their cocoa with palm oil,
while acres of other cocoa land are being abandoned.
Another problem - and a very sensitive political issue - is Sabah's
immigrant population. Historically, Sabah has acted as a collection point
and crossroads for travellers between the Philippines, Indonesia and the
Malay peninsula. Thousands of people from Mindanao, in the southern
Philippines, have fled to Sabah over the years as a result of fighting
between Manila's military and separatists based in Moslem Mindanao.
Other people from the Philippines and from Indonesia have arrived in search
of jobs. There are no exact figures of just how many immigrants - legal and
illegal - are now in Sabah. Some estimates put the figure as high as
800,000, or nearly half the population.
On one hand, there is concern about the immigrants' use of large amounts of
vital educational and health funds. According to some, immigrants are
responsible for a rising crime rate. But on the other hand it is also
realised that without the immigrants the economy would collapse: it is
estimated that about 80 per cent of workers on the plantations are from
either the Philippines or Indonesia.
Yet despite its present difficulties, Sabah is potentially one of the
richest states in Malaysia. It has a large amount of still untapped natural
resources. Further development of the petroleum industry is likely.
Perhaps most important of all, Sabah has great potential as a tourist
destination. The visitor is spoilt for choice: to climb Mt Kinabalu (at
4,101 metres, Malaysia's and south-east Asia's highest mountain), to dive at
Sipadan off the east coast (acknowledged as offering some of the best diving
in the world), to wander in search of the proboscis monkey, or to wonder at
the Rafflescia, the largest flower in the world.
It's all there in Sabah - and much more.
