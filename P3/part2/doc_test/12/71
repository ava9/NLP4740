<F P=106> [Editorial: "Better and Better in ASEAN"] </F>
  [Excerpts] When President Fidel Ramos visited Malaysia last 
year, he was the first Philippine leader to do so after 25 
years. Last week, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed returned the 
courtesy. Not since Tunku Abdul Rahman had a Malaysian prime 
minister been there on an official visit in 30 years. Such 
reserve showed in the modest trade links: the two countries did 
no more than [Singapore dollar] $555 million worth of business 
in the first nine months of last year. [passage omitted] Talking 
to Filipinos in Manila, one gets the feeling that more than a 
few do not share an ASEAN destiny. It is not insularity, but an 
apartness built on the country's Spanish-American past and 
Christian outlook. That is changing, however. 
  Improved relations with Malaysia are a key element of that 
process. This impinges on ASEAN cohesion, as the number of 
territorial disputes, apart from the one on Sabah, are a 
constant reminder that good neighbourliness cannot be taken for 
granted. The Spratlys dispute concerns three ASEAN nations; 
Malaysia and Indonesia have not settled the issue of Sipadan and 
Ligitan; while Malaysia has not given up its claim on Pedra 
Branca. Sabah, lest it be forgotten, is not a closed file. 
There are complexities which will take much negotiation and 
goodwill to disentangle. Neither Dr. Mahathir nor Mr. Ramos 
pretend that a settlement can be had in their lifetime. [passage 
omitted] What bodes will for ASEAN is that after three decades, 
Malaysia and the Philippines accept that, one, the Sabah 
resolution need not be tied to a time-frame, and two, that 
economic co-operation should not be held hostage to it. The 
Sabah question, as agreed upon before Dr. Mahathir went to 
Manila, is now held in suspended animation. [passage omitted] 
  What is "positive" was what the Mahathir visit was about: 
trade and investment links. If there is sustained economic 
expansion, no political problem can remain intractable for long. 
It was significant that on the Malaysian side, the initiative 
came from the private sector which was a big part of the 
Mahathir party. The nine memoranda of understanding signed with 
Philippine interests cover infrastructure work that the 
Filipinos need badly to ignite growth: highways, hotels, power 
and water plants, rail systems. Intriguing was the Malaysian 
offer of a financing instrument called the Bilateral Payments 
Arrangement (BPA) to boost trade. Under this system originally 
meant for the Group of 15 developing countries, importers and 
exporters are guaranteed payment through the central banks of 
trading partners. Malaysia has BPA links with 21 countries with 
trade amounting to [Malaysian dollar] $4 billion. It will be a 
help to the Philippines. Less clear is the concept of an East 
Asian growth crescent covering Mindanao, Brunei, the East 
Malaysian states, and eastern Indonesia. If it takes off it 
will energise development on a big scale, on a par with the 
ASEAN free trade area scheme. The framework and growth 
mechanisms will take time to evolve. Conditions are favourable, 
however, such as the greatly reduced threat from the Muslim 
separatists and jungle guerillas in the Philippines. This may 
be Manila's biggest contribution to ASEAN and to itself.
