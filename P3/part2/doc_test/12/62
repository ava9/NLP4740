Renong, a Malaysian investment holding company, and Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
one of Indonesia's largest state-controlled banks, are investing USDollars
100m to set up an Indonesian venture capital company to be called P. T.
Malindo Ventura Nusantara.
The deal brings together two large and well-connected groups to invest in
medium-sized companies. Renong's wholly-owned subsidiary, Renong Nusantara,
will have a 50 per cent stake in the company, whilst Bank Rakyat Indonesia
will have 43 per cent. Indonesian enterprises and individuals will hold the
remaining 7 per cent.
The deal highlights growing business ties between Malaysia and Indonesia. In
June, Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an Indonesian businessman, announced plans to
list his non-Indonesian timber-related assets on the Kuala Lumpur stock
exchange through a USDollars 1bn reverse take-over of Construction &amp;
Supplies House, a building supplies company.
The investment presented an avenue for Renong to participate in the growing
Indonesian economy, said Mr Raja Aman Ahmad, Renong Nusantara's chairman,
However, analysts said investment commitments were small with profits
expected only in the longer term.
