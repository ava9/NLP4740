  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Non-ASEAN 
Southeast Asia can also spawn viable and active growth triangles 
(GTs) to the same level of success as those in the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations, says Deputy Finance Minister Mustapa 
Mohamed. 
  He said that although the idea of GTs, aimed at accelerating 
sub-regional economic growth, has not progressed in these areas, 
it was a matter of time before there was greater collaboration 
and collective action with ASEAN, which groups Brunei, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. 
  Most regional trade and investment links had been chiefly 
among countries in ASEAN and North-East Asia and a lot more 
needed to be done within the non-ASEAN Southeast Asian 
countries, he said when opening the fourth Southeast Asia 
roundtable on economic development growth triangles in 
South-east Asia, organised by the Institute of Strategic and 
International Studies (ISIS) here Monday. 
  Mustapa said while ASEAN was home to some of the fastest 
growing economies, it was also home for a number of poorer 
states, thus there was a need to step up growth in the slower 
regions as the faster ones surge ahead. 
  ASEAN has, within a short span of time, seen the emergence 
of 
several successful GTs such as the Batam Triangle or Sijori 
involving Singapore, Malaysia's southern Johor state and 
Indonesia's Riau, the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand GT (IMT-GT) as 
well as the recently agreed East-ASEAN Growth Triangle 
comprising Brunei, Kalimantan, East Malaysia and southern 
Philippines. 
  Nevertheless, Mustapa said ASEAN was heartened to see the 
few 
seed-beds of regional growth zones beginning to take more 
concrete forms such as among southern Laos, west Cambodia and 
eastern Thailand.
