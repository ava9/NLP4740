  [Text] Indonesia has urged Malaysia to respond to its 
statement on the status of Sipadan and Ligitan in order to 
accelerate the settlement of the dispute over ownership of these 
islands. This came up during additional talks between the 
Indonesian and Malaysian delegations in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. 
Indonesia had hoped that the two countries would agree on some 
principles to serve as a basis for the next round of talks. 
According to Indonesian chief delegate Izhar Ibrahim, the 
Indonesian Government reiterated its position on the ownership 
of Sipadan and Ligitan in 1992 through a memorandum and 
supporting documents, such as a territorial map. Malaysia has 
yet to respond, however. Meanwhile, Malaysian chief delegate 
Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said the two countries would be able to 
settle the matter amicably.
