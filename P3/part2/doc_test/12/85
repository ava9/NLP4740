  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. [23 February] -- The army is 
planning to replace the present 1,500 Malaysian Battalion 
(Malbatt) troops serving under the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the army had 
yet to identify which unit would take over the peacekeeping 
duties from the Third Royal Armoured Regiment, which was sent 
there in batches from last September 21. 
  He said the troops needed to be relieved after undergoing a 
lot of tension and stress for long periods at designated 
battle-zones. 
  Under the present arrangement with UNPROFOR, the troops are 
expected to serve for between a year and 18 months. But their 
stay could be prolonged depending on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He was speaking to reporters after meeting Canadian Minister 
for Industry, Commerce, Science, and Technology Gerald Tremblay 
at his office today. 
  Najib said two consignments of Hari Raya [end of Ramadan] 
gift parcels, army vehicles, and equipment would be sent to 
Malaysian troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia. 
  One consignment would be flown to the Malbatt troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday while the other consignment of army 
logistics would be shipped to Mogadishu tomorrow. 
  "Due to the lack of air flights between the countries, many 
of our soldiers in Somalia go to neighbouring countries for 
their holidays. The two most common places they frequent are 
Mombasa and Nairobi." 
  Najib also said the cabinet decided today to contribute U.S. 
$100,000 in clothes and medication for victims of last 
Wednesday's earthquake in Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake 
killed more than 200 people and injured 1,000. [passage omitted]
