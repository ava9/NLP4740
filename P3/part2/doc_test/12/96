an Asian opportunity - American-style fast food is catching on in a region
hungry for western tastes

Kenny Rogers, the US country and western crooner, rode into Kuala Lumpur
recently. He wasn't playing his guitar or singing a tear-jerking song. He
was cooking chickens.
Kenny Rogers Roasters boasts of being the fastest-growing fast-food chain in
the US, with more than 1,000 restaurants opened or about to start operations
across the country. In May the first Roasters store in Asia opened in the
Malaysian capital.
The crowds who wait in line in Kuala Lumpur for one of Rogers' chickens,
marinaded in a special herb sauce and cooked on a wood-fired rotisserie
('It's wood that makes it good') testify to one of the marketing phenomena
of Asia: American-style fast food is catching on as fast as it can be
cooked.
The Florida-based Roasters chain was founded three years ago by Rogers and
John Y. Brown Junior, a former Kentucky governor. Earlier this year Berjaya,
a Malaysia-based conglomerate, bought a 24 per cent stake in Roasters for
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m). Berjaya paid Dollars 10m for a 50 per cent stake
in the chain's Asia Pacific operations.
'We've only been open a few weeks and already we are selling far more
chickens per day - about 1,400 each Saturday and Sunday - than stores in the
US,' says Syed Ghazali, general manager of Roasters in Kuala Lumpur. 'We
plan to open eight more stores in Malaysia this year with further openings
in Singapore and the Philippines. South Korea and Indonesia will follow
after.'
It's the same story all over Asia. At one time the sceptics said that Asians
would never give up their diet for the blander tastes of American fast food.
But the traditional corner coffee shop selling chicken, rice and noodles is
disappearing and being replaced by McDonald's, Pizza Hut or Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
The taste of the food is only one element in the success story. 'Our
marketing people tell us that people here love the American way. People come
to the stores not only for the food but to enjoy American style and American
service,' says Syed.
The region's economic success has brought about the rise of an increasingly
affluent middle class. A plate of chicken and rice might only cost MDollars
2.50 (95 cents) in Kuala Lumpur. But more and more city dwellers have the
money to pay twice or three times as much for a Roasters meal.
Karl Faux runs the south-east Asia operations of Tony Roma's, a Texas-based
chain specialising in ribs. The chain's 140-seat restaurant in Singapore
serves up to 800 meals per day. 'Anything that's American sells well.
Business is better than we ever dreamt it would be,' he says.
Faux, an Austrian hotelier who manages Tony Roma's regional operations on
behalf of Indonesian franchise holders, says a vital ingredient in the
attractiveness of US-style fast food is that it caters for the family.
'Asians like eating as a family. It's a very important part of the
business.'
Fast-food chains make some adjustments to local conditions. Kenny Rogers
Roasters cost about half as much in Malaysia as in the US. Some chains use
local sauces and ingredients. Others insist that all supplies come from the
US. Tony Roma's has expanded into Indonesia. It now ships a container of US
pork ribs each month into the world's largest Moslem country.
McDonald's opened one of its first outlets in Asia in Singapore in 1979.
Now, eight of its 10 best-selling restaurants in the world are in Asia:
seven of them are in Hong Kong while the recently opened outlet in Beijing
is the company's top performer.
In Malaysia, where the fast food industry is growing at an estimated 10 to
15 per cent each year, Kentucky Fried Chicken outsells McDonald's. Chicken
is the one mass consumption meat that all Malaysians - whether Malay,
Chinese or Indian - can happily feast on. By the end of this year Colonel
Saunders will be smiling over 150 branches throughout Malaysia.
Not everyone is happy about the US invasion of Asia's high streets. There
are suspicions that along with the food, US values are being imported.
Asia's leaders worry about a directionless, undisciplined younger generation
lounging at eating joints.
Perhaps the tourists will be the most disappointed. If Asia continues on its
present course the visitor will soon be able to walk down the road in Hong
Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta - only to find the same restaurants
as at home.
