  [Text] Malaysia and Indonesia have agreed to resolve 
[their claims to] the disputed Ligitan and Sipadan islands on 
the basis of the principles of international law. Both 
countries are of the view that a solution to the issue should 
have a positive impact on their friendly relations. The 
agreement was contained in a joint statement issued by the 
Malaysian and Indonesian delegations at the end of the second 
meeting of the Joint Working Group on Sipadan and Ligitan 
Islands in Kuala Lumpur. Both parties agreed that the solution 
of the issue should be sought through consultations and other 
peaceful means. 
  The Malaysian delegation was led by the secretary general of 
foreign affairs, Tan Sri Ahmad Kamil Jaffar. The Indonesian 
team was headed by the director general for political affairs, 
Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Izhar Ibrahim. The records 
of the two-day meeting will be submitted to the third joint 
commission meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in May. Both 
delegations will meet again in Jakarta in four months time.
