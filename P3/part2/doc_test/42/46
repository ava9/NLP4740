<P>
Some people might relish the attention, but chances are their lives are hardly 
as young and fresh and full of promise as that of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena. 
</P>
<P>
So if this youngster would rather watch cartoons or send a paper airplane 
sailing across a room full of serious-minded adults than appear on national 
television, write it off to the frivolity and innocence of youth. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony cannot escape the limelight, and as the San Juan Capistrano 
fourth-grader continues his quest to become the youngest person to fly an 
airplane across the world, there are few places where he is not considered to 
be news. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make the shy, soft-spoken preteen break into a huge grin on one 
those rare occasions -- like his stop in Moncton, Canada -- when the press 
isn't around to greet his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The Moncton stop stood in stark contrast to his European landfall here and 
United States stops in Salt Lake City, Denver, Lincoln, Neb., and St. Louis, 
where Tony was greeted like a politician on the campaign trail, stepping out of 
his small Cessna Centurion to the flash and whirl of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting at the airports were throngs of local reporters, as they were here, 
where Norwegian news photographers asked him in thickly accented English to sit 
astride his plane's propeller for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, reporters have been ready to pounce on Tony with the same questions 
he had answered a dozen times before. Tony has politely fielded the inquiries 
and posed for pictures, but he has quickly tired of the press attention. 
</P>
<P>
At a stop in suburban Boston, it was all Tony could do to pull himself away 
from a card game and do yet another interview with local television, this one 
with WLVI reporter Joe Shortsleeve. 
</P>
<P>
The interview went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "How did you pick out where you were going to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "Umm, it was the easiest way around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "Are you excited?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "Anything else I should have asked you?" 
</P>
<P>
Tony: "No." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Tony dashed off to more enjoyable pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena, Tony's father, said his son does not like dealing with the 
press because he finds it tiring -- more tiring, it seems, than flying an 
airplane for hours on end. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter, Shortsleeve, said he was not surprised to find Tony so 
unenthusiastic about his trip. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way he was when we interviewed him last year (following Tony's 
record-breaking flight, at age 9, across the United States)," Shortsleeve said. 
"The problem we have, as reporters, is we don't normally interview 11-year-olds 
and can't relate. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if we had an 11-year-old asking him questions, he'd probably do a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Wiesner, a Colorado businessman who is piloting one of the two chase planes 
for the flight, said that as father of a 10-year-old boy, he understands Tony's 
predicament with the press. 
</P>
<P>
"What you've got is an 11-year-old doing a very adult thing like flying around 
the world. But he is still just an 11-year-old kid," said Wiesner, 52, whose 
son, Michael, is accompanying Wiesner and his wife, Janet, on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is always accompanied at press gatherings by his father, a certified pilot 
who is riding with his son in the co-pilot's seat. Aliengena, 39, a real estate 
investor, is close at hand to help Tony field questions. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the constant grilling from the press, Tony is apt to answer questions 
as he did in Lincoln, when a reporter inquired how long the trip was. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's response: "Umm, it's long." 
</P>
<P>
In the press conferences, Tony's boyishness is underscored by the fact he has 
to stand on a chair to be seen over the lectern. He also needs a booster seat 
in his plane to see out the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is in the habit of horsing around with other members of the entourage 
before and after the press questioning. He is accompanied on the trip by his 
10-year-old sister, Alaina, and 10-year-old Roman Tchermenekyh, his Soviet pen 
pal, in addition to Wiesner's son.. 
</P>
<P>
And Tony is not immune to childish antics. Before a Denver press session, for 
instance, he sent a paper airplane sailing across the room as his father spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is equally unimpressed with big-time celebrity journalists. 
</P>
<P>
When Guy Murrel, the public relations consultant for the trip, arranged an 
interview between Tony and his father and Jane Pauley on NBC's "Today" show, 
Tony responded to the news with typical aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's Jane Pauley?," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Roman (pronounced Ro-mar) has become almost as much of a media curiosity as 
Tony. At every press conference and public gathering, Tony introduces Roman as 
his pen pal, and Roman is called to the podium, usually wearing an oversized 
baseball cap and a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman, who is the son of a powerful air minister who helped approve Tony's 
flight across the Soviet Union, knows little English and usually manages only a 
weak, "Hi, I Roman." He smiled widely in St. Louis, though, when a reporter 
asked through an interpreter what he had liked most about his journey across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting thing was the amusement park in California and the cowboy 
saloon in Denver," Roman said, referring to his visits at Knott's Berry Farm in 
Buena Park and a country-western steakhouse in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
After Tony's "Today" appearance in Boston, his interpreter, Maxim V. Chikin, a 
correspondent for the Moscow youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, arranged for 
him to be interviewed by telephone by a reporter for the Soviet news agency, 
Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Later that same morning, he signed autographs for a mob of 300 elementary 
school students who had unfurled the 1,000-foot banner of U.S. friendship 
signatures that he hopes to deliver to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, however, Tony got to do what he really likes: he sat in front 
of the television, along with Roman and the other two children, watching 
cartoons.
