If all the world is a stage, the Whitbread 'Round-the-World sailboat race has 
finally switched the klieg lights on in Earth's last, great, remote wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Yachts bearing the logos of beer brewers, cigarette makers, kitchen equipment 
manufacturers and ladies' shoemakers are streaking across wild seas these days, 
risking death and destruction in a quest for market share and corporate 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It presents an interesting ethical puzzle: high sport, but in the name of what? 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks in Punta del Este, Uruguay, observing and chatting up Whitbread 
voyagers while they rested between legs of their 33,000-mile torture test, I'm 
still unsure how to rate the event. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it's the grandest sailing imaginable -- hurtling around Antarctica 
in full race rock, flying spinnakers for days on end in 40 knots of wind, 
surfing down mountainous waves in the dark of night as icebergs whiz by. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," marveled a young New Zealander after his maiden Cape Horn 
rounding. "We had 80 knots (of wind) across the deck; we were knocked down, 
fighting for our lives for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you can't help noticing the message these folks defy death 
to deliver. It's plastered all over the spinnakers and the sides of the boats: 
"Drink our beer, smoke our cigarettes, get your latest stock quotations from 
our computerized service." 
</P>
<P>
Nautical NASCAR, in short, and it's only just beginning. After 17 years, the 
Whitbread is finally finding its way into big corporate boardrooms. "Tobacco 
wars next time," promised Mike Pavitt of Rothman's, the British cigarette 
company's entry. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his success this time, Pavitt expects at least two fully funded U.S. 
tobacco entries in the 1993-94 Whitbread from R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris. 
Why? Because the race, he said, offers what cigarette makers can't otherwise 
buy: Their brand names in the worldwide media, bathed in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman's spent more than $6 million launching and campaigning its maxi-boat, 
with a fully paid crew and a world-class skipper, former America's Cup helmsman 
Lawrie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And with more than 100 hours of global TV in the books, it was worth every 
shilling, said Pavitt, chain-smoking his own brand over an elegant lunch at the 
Yacht Club Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Rothman's is lurching along in fourth place, the exposure in 
yachting-mad England, New Zealand and Australia, where Rothman's sells big, has 
been thoroughly gratifying, Pavitt said. His company can hardly wait to do it 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Whitbread heads for the first time to the world's greatest consumer 
marketplace -- the United States -- leaving Punta del Este on Saturday for an 
expected arrival three or four weeks later in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors aren't exactly clicking their heels at the prospect of head winds 
up to Rio de Janeiro, then the doldrums before reaching the easterly trade 
winds in the Caribbean. "The best part of this race is over," said Dale 
Tremaine, a paid hand on Fazisi, the first Soviet entry in a transoceanic race. 
</P>
<P>
But for the market-share moguls, the best part is just coming up. They want to 
see whether free-spending Americans stand and salute when the big racing boats 
roll over the horizon and up the Florida Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of that, by most accounts, is slim. "It's not unusual for our 
country to be oblivious to events like this," said John Marshall, Dennis 
Conner's right-hand man in the last four America's Cups who has just signed on 
with Italian industrialist Gianni Varasi to help organize a 1993 Whitbread 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
So why the Whitbread for Marshall? "I think it's one of the most, maybe the 
most, challenging and difficult of sailing events," he said, "and this year it 
was elevated to the highest levels of intensity and competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall counted off the five boats at the top of the maxi-boat class -- 
Steinlager II, which has won every leg so far; Merit, the Swiss entry; Fisher 
&amp; Paykel, representing a New Zealand kitchen appliance manufacturer; 
Rothman's, and Charles Jourdan, the French sloop. 
</P>
<P>
Big boats, big budgets, big names, big businesses: beer, cigarettes, 
appliances, women's apparel. But is this yachting? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, whether by accident or not," Marshall said, "commercialism came in at 
the same time the event was elevated to the top levels of competition. And if 
it takes commercial sponsorship to get the best boats and the best sailors into 
the most challenging event, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
All of which puts the Whitbread on a bit of a collision course with its 
founders, the small, tradition-bound Whitbread brewery in England and the 
creaky Royal Naval Sailing Assn., which Whitbread assigned to oversee the race 
from its inception 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Is the Whitbread destined for world-class commercial sporting event status? Not 
if the founding fathers can help it. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," said race committee chief Charles Williams, a retired Royal Navy 
admiral. "The RNSA would never permit itself to be involved in a race where 
there was something in it -- $1 million or something like that -- for the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"These fellows (the sailors) are in for the adventure. It's exciting, dangerous 
-- an Everest expedition. They're competing for the thrill, the challenge, the 
endeavor. Money has nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmm . . . .
