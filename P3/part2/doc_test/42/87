recession - Nick Garnett meets a man who reacted to redundancy by buying a
company

STATISTICAL tables of the unemployed are littered with countless senior
managers pushed on to the street by company restructuring and recession. But
recession also spells shrunken asset values and the opportunity of acquiring
tiny production businesses at low cost.
Chris Ward found himself out of work in the middle of 1990 when he was made
redundant from his job as managing director of the UK domestic products
division of the Hicksons group. Six months on and Ward was a boat builder,
the owner of a tiny yard near the Norfolk Broads making cruisers, motor
yachts and catamarans and fitting out lifeboats and other vessels. It cost
him Pounds 79,000 to buy.
It is hardly Swan Hunter but it gives 40-year-old Ward a new perspective on
life. 'What you have is freedom to design your own strategy for the business
and implement that unencumbered by boardroom politics. I like being involved
with boats but had no experience of running a boat-building business.'
The downside of paltry asset values, though, is feeble demand. 'It's a bad
time to be in any business. It makes the potential new boat buyer very wary,
not because they have lost money in the recession but because they are
hanging on to it in case their own business gets into trouble.'
Ward has felt it necessary to inject a further Pounds 35,000 of his own
money, mainly to cover part of the cost of building a particular style of
motor yacht as the yard's own product which is yet to find a buyer. He has
been a keen sailor for a long time; his own sailing yacht is moored in the
marina at Ipswich where he lives. 'I started looking for a business
connected with the marine industry,' he said.
An advert caught his eye in Yachting Monthly, for a yard in one of those
dreary places near Lowestoft, an hour's drive away. The owner wanted Pounds
50,000 cash, a further Pounds 50,000 over five years. A one-off cash price
was eventually agreed. Ward coughed up Pounds 50,000 immediately; the
balance of Pounds 29,000 was supplied by National Westminster bank without a
visit to the yard, but with Ward's business prospectus.
What Ward got for his money was a company, Crown Fletcher (he renamed it
Crown Fletcher Boat Builders), with a boat-making name since 1906, a
building housing five boat bays on a 21 year lease, equipment like bandsaws
and steam machinery to bend wood into shape, and a workforce of six
craftsmen and an apprentice.
The business, he says, generated a turnover of Pounds 250,000 in the last
year before he bought it, though over Pounds 100,000 of this derived from
buying-in, then using, raw materials. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
12,000. He bought the yard in January last year. Since then it has turned
over Pounds 203,000 and made a profit of Pounds 18,000.
The yard can build complete wooden vessels from the keel upwards, usually
using Columbian pine, teak and mahogany, as well as fitting out fibreglass
vessels whose hulls are supplied from outside.
Ward has so far taken out no salary and has pumped in that further Pounds
35,000. It has been hard work. He leaves home at 6.30 am and returns in the
evening.
'I bought the yard because it had a good level of skills, access directly
from the sea, and from Oulton Broads through a lock, and because it had a
record of supplying and refitting lifeboats.'
The company came with a 62-year-old foreman who helped Ward find his sea
legs in costing jobs. Ward also had a stroke of luck when John Perryman, a
professional boat designer and naval architect once employed by Crown
Fletcher, offered his services, bringing two orders in his back pocket.
'When I bought the yard it didn't have a designer,' Ward says. 'It was doing
a lot on subcontract. I probably could have used a third party designer but
it makes you more competitive having someone on the premises. For some
vessels we can design it, price it and do a bill of specification in four
days. Without John's skills we would have struggled to break into the new
boat build market.'
Since Ward bought the company, Crown Fletcher has built a 60-seat catamaran
for Pounds 70,000, using a fibreglass hull, and is part way through a 41
foot all-wooden traditional Broads cruiser, sold for well over Pounds
100,000. It has also refitted two large lifeboats. Ward is trying to switch
the yard towards more wooden boat building and refit work and away from
buying-in fibreglass hulls.
Boat building is a competitive industry, much more so now the market for new
boats has slid by more than 30 per cent.
'Almost every job comes from competitive tendering,' Ward says. 'Normally
the buyer goes for the cheapest yard. Over the long term that is not good
because it is mainly marginal profits.'
Trying to circumnavigate this problem, Ward acquired a fibreglass mould and
produced a hull for what will be the yard's own product, a 32 foot motor
yacht.
'Part of our strategy is to develop something of our own to get out of all
this competitive tendering.' This vessel though, which is part finished and
with a price tag of Pounds 105,000, has no buyer yet, and is absorbing some
of Ward's personal cash.
Avoiding the odd sour contract is also tricky.
'We had a Pounds 60,000 job in the yard before Christmas to repair a
burnt-out fishing boat, but the owner's bank foreclosed on the proceeds of
the insurance policy. So we had sewn up four months work for two people and
found ourselves without that job through no fault of our own. We got our
costs back, but that was small compared with Pounds 60,000.'
Ward has found that company and family are entwined when running a new
venture. 'After the recession my expectation is that the yard will provide a
good living. But like all business ventures, you have to put a lot in to get
a lot out. What you need is a totally committed wife who understands all the
risks when you take on a venture.'
