FRENCH ORCHESTRA AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM

Don't try to tell anyone in the Orchestre National de France, or Lorin Maazel 
for that matter, that Beethoven is a greater composer than Saint-Saens. They 
might get angry. At least so it would seem if their Wednesday night concert at 
Ambassador Auditorium is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
Maazel began with Beethoven's "Fidelio" Overture, in a polite, tidy rendition, 
notable more for nimbleness than weighty heroics. He followed with more 
Beethoven, the Symphony No. 4. It started promisingly enough, the opening 
Adagio taking on a sinister quality with the measured calm of Maazel's pacing 
and poised balances in the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
But thereafter it was as if Maazel and orchestra had switched to automatic 
pilot. He made graceful, sometimes cute, always dapper gestures; the orchestra 
responded with nonchalant neatness. The outer movements lacked robustness, 
moving along at times with a certain elegance, but with little feeling for 
their playfulness. The Adagio became a leisurely stroll, a pleasant rehashing 
of the notes. 
</P>
<P>
This orchestra plays well; its strings are a unified body in tone and 
execution, and the woodwinds have a distinctive, grainy blend. And there were 
good moments: some telling rhythmic points in the Minuet, an alertly shaped 
trio and beautiful clarinet solos in the Adagio. But these remained just 
moments in a musical whole of cool indifference. 
</P>
<P>
It was a different matter altogether with Saint-Saens' "Organ" Symphony. Here, 
the orchestra dug in with aggressiveness and fire, the strings in particular 
taking on a powerful, brilliant sheen. There were sweeping lyrical lines and 
big, rich-toned climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble played the Adagio with clear passion, and, in the lurid Finale, 
made a brassy, muscular noise, with the help of the guest soloist, Douglas 
Major, on the Allen Digital Computer Organ. Instant bravos at the end and a 
standing ovation -- but it was still only Saint-Saens. TIMOTHY MANGAN
