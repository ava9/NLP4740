Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the 'Choral', is not long enough to fill an
evening, but what to play before it is always a puzzle. At the Barbican on
Sunday, the conductor Libor Pesek opted for something completely different:
his countryman Bohuslav Martinu's late, almost unknown Rhapsody-Concerto for
viola. The soloist was one of the London Symphony's two viola-Principals,
Paul Silverthorne. This was one of those occasions when an unfamiliar work
bears the unarguable stamp of devoted preparation. The concerto has just two
movements, each of them lyrically ruminative at unhurried tempi. The homely,
wistful air of the first gives way in the second, however, to a darker
elegiac tone and a sharp sense of loss. This performance conveyed all that
with penetration and dignity.
Nonetheless, a really distinguished 'Choral' must erase from memory anything
that has gone before. While it lasted, Pesek's 'Choral' achieved that
superbly. Though the LSO and their Chorus were on splendid form, and young
Michael Druiett's imposingly large bass led a fine solo quartet (with Nancy
Gustafson, Linda Finnie and Dennis O'Neill), it was Pesek's confident,
self-effacing hand that secured the triumph. This was the most satisfying,
un-quirky, beautifully gauged Ninth that I've heard in several years.
Nothing was forced, least of all the orchestra's tone. The peaks of the
score were reached by calmly assured ascents. All the instrumental voices
were encouraged to sing, which ensured a luminous polyphony - not just in
the Scherzo, where clarity is relatively easy (and Kurt-Hans Goedicke proved
yet again to be a peerless master of Beethoven's timpani-part), but in the
recherche thickets of the opening Allegro and the grand Adagio.
Keen music-lovers have long admired Pesek's smooth, soft-grained subtlety,
but his liquid command of this noble score demonstrated a rare authority
that one mightn't have imagined. The chock-full house was hugely
appreciative; it was heartening to find that a 1990s audience can be moved
by a purely musical Ninth, without theatrical Semtex.
