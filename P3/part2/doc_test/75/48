ON THE RECORD: KARAJAN: IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF

<P>
The recent death of conductor Herbert von Karajan ended a recording career that 
spanned a full half-century -- exceeded in duration only by that of Leopold 
Stokowski. Quantitatively, Karajan was -- and is likely to remain -- in a class 
by himself, having made an estimated 800 recordings, with sales of 150 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded at least a bit of nearly everything including, forgettably, the 
Baroque staples. But while one reads over and over of a primary identification 
with the core 19th-Century symphonic repertory of Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, 
Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Bruckner and Richard Strauss, listeners who grew up in 
the 1950s associate the name of Karajan above all with opera. It is in that 
field that he may well have made his most enduring contributions to 
discographic history. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the following mid-1950s trio from EMI/Angel, studio-made with London's 
magnificently responsive Philharmonia Orchestra, and now on CD: Verdi's 
"Falstaff" (49668, 2 discs) -- Tito Gobbi in the title role -- an 
interpretation of such darting lightness, wit and precision as to put all 
subsequent recorded efforts (including Karajan's remake, c. 1980, for Philips) 
to shame. Then, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as prima donna, the first commercial 
edition of Richard Strauss' "Ariadne auf Naxos" (69296, 2 CDs), an unbeatable 
combination of suavity and sinew. And the dazzlingly bright "Cosi fan Tutte" of 
Mozart (with whom Karajan would prove increasingly uncomfortable in coming 
years) featuring a dream ensemble including Schwarzkopf, Leopold Simoneau, 
Rolando Panerai and Sesto Bruscantini (69635, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
Indispensable too are a couple of souvenirs of live performances: the 
shatteringly intense 1956 Berlin "Lucia di Lammermoor," with Callas, di 
Stefano, Panerai (available on several different labels), and the white-hot 
1962 Salzburg Festival "Trovatore," with Price, Corelli, Simionato and 
Bastianini (Price-Less 20791, 2 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
These opera recordings disclose an incisiveness, an ear for dramatic pacing and 
just balances that would in subsequent decades give way to an obsessive desire 
for thickly textured, rhythmically sluggish washes of sound, irrespective of a 
specific score's requirements. This soggy aural picture begins to assert itself 
in Karajan's mannered Wagner "Ring," made between 1967 and 1972, now available 
on a mass of Deutsche Grammophon CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Better to recall the Karajan of the keen rhythmic edge and crystalline sonority 
or, broadly, treatment of the composer as an individual rather than as a 
reflection of the conductor's ego. Cherishable examples -- and there are some 
from the later years -- include a grand and stormy 1959 Brahms Fourth Symphony, 
with the Philharmonia Orchestra (EMI/Angel 69228); the searing 1985 Vienna 
Philharmonic Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony (Deutsche Grammophon 415 348); 
hypnotically mysterious Sibelius, the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, from the 
late '70s with the Berlin Phil (EMI/Angel 69244). 
</P>
<P>
To these should be added the somber but unfailingly mobile Berlin '69 Prokofiev 
Fifth Symphony (DG 423 216); the sumptuous coupling (on EMI/Angel 69242) of 
Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" Symphony and the Bartok "Music for Strings, 
Percussion and Celesta" dating from the late-1950s; and the noble yet taut 1965 
Brahms "German Requiem" (DG 427 252), the second of his four recordings of that 
work. 
</P>
<P>
With his career so exhaustively documented by the microphones at every stage of 
its unfolding, certain scores were done over and over again, giving Karajan the 
opportunity to refine the life out of them. To cite the most obvious example, 
he recorded the Beethoven symphonies so often -- the entire cycle at least five 
times -- that only the most manic comparison shopper is able to keep them 
straight, or to care. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahms symphonies approach this sort of death by multiplication as well, as 
do select works by Dvorak, Schubert and Richard Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan achieved some of his finest latter-years work with repertory new to 
him. For instance, the Mahler Sixth and Ninth symphonies (DG 415 099 and 417 
726, respectively, 2 CDs each), both dating from his last decade and both 
combining spontaneity with depth of expression. Remarkable too are the warmth 
and vigorousness of his 1979 recordings of the first three Tchaikovsky 
symphonies (DG, various packagings). 
</P>
<P>
Karajan was, in his later productions, noted for manipulating singers to 
conform to his vision of opera as basically an orchestral form. If he did not 
go quite so far with his instrumental soloists, their individuality was 
nonetheless more often than not subordinated to his will. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on one occasion he was confronted with talent so intimidating that he had 
no choice but to become part of an ensemble, joining Sviatoslav Richter, David 
Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovitch to create the monumental 1969 version of 
Beethoven's Triple Concerto (EMI/Angel 69032). 
</P>
<P>
At other -- equally distant -- times less glamorous associations produced 
felicitous results, such as Karajan's DG teaming with the late Christian Ferras 
in the violin concertos of Sibelius (419871) and Tchaikovsky (423 224). 
</P>
<P>
And, as further evidence of the humanity suspected to be lurking behind that 
parched-leather face, imperiously eyeing us from countless record jackets, try 
the Offenbach overtures supermaestro did, ever so lithely and insinuatingly, 
with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1981 (DG 400 044).
