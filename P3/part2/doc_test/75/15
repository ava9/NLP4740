Luigi Nono, who died in May, was one of the most prominent and socially engaged 
composers of the Italian postwar avant-garde scene. Yet when it came time to 
grieve, Nono turned to the simple sounds he heard around him -- the church 
bells of his native Venice -- when he composed ". . . sofferte onde serene . . 
. " for piano and tape in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be played at 8 tonight as part of a program by the Southwest 
Chamber Music Society at Chapman College in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"The title means 'Sorrowful Yet Serene Waves,' " said Jeff von der Schmidt, 
artistic director of the music society. "The piece was composed amid a series 
of deaths in both his family and his wife's family. It became a funeral piece, 
even back in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece is a description of the various bells ringing in different ways 
throughout the city of Venice -- bells coming from different sounds and 
different registers, sometimes very high and sometimes very low. The effect of 
the piece is of one large bell." 
</P>
<P>
The work, which lasts about 15 minutes, was commissioned by pianist Maurizio 
Pollini and dedicated to Pollini and his wife, Marilisa Pollini. 
</P>
<P>
The taped part "elaborates and enlarges" the live piano part, and "the two 
parts are not in opposition, nor are they in counterpoint," von der Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Cheng will be the live pianist in the program today. "She will be 
playing with Pollini," said von der Schmidt. "He is the taped pianist. It's not 
as if a computer made the sound." 
</P>
<P>
Von der Schmidt described the work as "a very virtuosic piece." 
</P>
<P>
"It's notated on four staves -- sometimes two fingers on one stave and two 
fingers on another," he said. "That's very difficult. For rhythmic clarity, 
it's notated that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very slow piece. The dynamic range is pretty subdued. From time to 
time, there comes the clanging of the bells, but basically they're in the 
distance. It's very haunting. 
</P>
<P>
"The texture sometimes is very dense. If you hit a lot of bells at once, you 
get a lot of clanging at once. That's where the electronic part keeps the 
ringing going. 
</P>
<P>
"The piano is well-suited to this because a string once struck will vibrate 
until the damper falls on it. He uses both of those sounds against each other 
as if the piano has been turned into the city of Venice." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Italian Resistance during World War II, Nono envisioned music 
from the point of view of an "engaged" or politically committed artist. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his works reflect his political beliefs. (He joined the Italian 
Communist party and was elected to the Central Committee in 1975.) 
</P>
<P>
For instance, his 1955 work, "Il Canto Sospeso" (the Suspended Chant), sets 
excerpts from the last letters written by European Resistance fighters before 
their execution. His 1960 opera "Intolleranza" (revised a decade later as 
"Intolleranza 1970") is an attack on capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
"The aesthetic of Nono comes from the 12-tone works of Schoenberg," von der 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Nono married Schoenberg's daughter, Nuria, in 1955. (She has recently 
moved to Los Angeles to be with her brother and sister-in-law, according to von 
der Schmidt, but is not likely to be at the concert in Orange.) 
</P>
<P>
"Nono developed his thinking through the serial thinking of the '60s, and as 
every composer of the period did, relaxed his tensions and became an extremely 
vibrant political composer. He was a member of the Italian Communist Party and 
was viscously opposed to American involvement in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Von der Schmidt has programmed the work as "a fitting tribute" to Nono, who 
died May 5 at the age of 66. 
</P>
<P>
Framing the Nono piece will be two works by Beethoven -- the Sonata for Cello, 
Opus 102, and the Piano Trio, Opus 70, No. 1, the "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
"We think that Beethoven's aesthetic (in the Cello Sonata), with its first big 
fugue, the first fugue of the late period, is the best preparation for the type 
of concentration needed to listen to Nono," von der Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the 'Ghost' Trio: Of all the trios to do, we thought it might be nice to 
have the 'Ghost' show up. Any musician is saddened by the passing of a musician 
of the stature of Nono. They don't make a lot of them like that. They're not a 
dime-a-dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first Nono we've ever played, but it won't be the last," von der 
Schmidt added. "The music is wrapped up, as with any Italian composer, with 
something dramatic, which makes it very accessible. All you need to do with 
this work is imagine bells going off in Venice. You'll have quite a good time."
