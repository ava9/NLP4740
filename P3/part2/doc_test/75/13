THE QUESTION is not utterly stupid; for if 'No' is an impossible reply,
there is still healthy room for a 'Yes - within limits]' The limits will
depend upon how much you include within 'musicianliness'. If that takes in
everything that makes for an effective performance, there can be no
argument; but as pianists become more and more reluctant to be identified as
'brilliant technicians' - thought to be a glut on the market, though I would
not agree - the recognised marks of the Serious Musician become ever more
austere.
The trouble with that is that the best part of the piano repertoire makes
knowing room for virtuoso magic on its unique instrument. Composers are well
aware that each note on a piano is unalterable, once struck, though it can
be allowed to die away more or less quickly; not being a true 'sustaining'
instrument, it can only mimic a singing legato. On the other hand, with its
multi-fingered attack, its damper-pedal and its rich octave-resonances, the
piano can conjure up sounds like nothing else.
Figuration is the name of the game, the art of titivating music for the
keyboard. Too many performances on my current batch of piano CDs make too
little of that, especially where the composers expected pure pianism to
carry the day without extending the musical argument by very much. On Sony
SK 53 108, for example, Andreas Haefliger offers as searching and purposeful
readings of eight Schubert Impromptus - the wonderful late sets, D899 and
935 - as I have heard in some time; I shall return to them often.
And yet: these pieces contain some of Schubert's most memorably pretty
piano-writing, passages of inspired delicacy that no music-lover can forget
 -and Haefliger is resolutely un-charming with them ('charmless' would be
unfair). Lesser pianists often capture the authentic shimmer better.
Melvyn Tan's EMI programme of mostly lesser Beethoven (CDC 7 54526 2) makes
an intriguing comparison. On Beethoven's own Broadwood piano (much restored,
I think), he plays Bagatelles early and late, and the G minor Fantasia, with
the basically silly variation-sets on 'God Save the King' and 'Rule
Britannia' fore and aft. There is any amount of quirky charm here, just as
required. Nothing over-fanciful, but Tan's clever rubato - and the chunky,
sinewy appeal of the instrument - bring the music immediately to life; and
he is equal to the visionary last Bagatelles, op. 126 (virtually
contemporary with those Schubert Impromptus).
The remarkable Yevgeny Kissin, who is still young enough to count as a
prodigy, is immaculate - if a touch sober - in solo Grieg and Liszt on Sony
SK 52 567. The main offering, however, is the evergreen Schumann Concerto,
where Kissin is unsuitably yoked with the veteran conductor Giulini and the
Vienna Philharmonic. There are exquisitely realised passages, but too often
the pianist is audibly struggling against Giulini's moody tempi: a fresh,
buoyant performance is half-stifled amid all that leisurely reverence.
On EMI (CDC 7 54548 2), Lars Vogt - distinguished second prizewinner at the
last Leeds competition, after Arthur Pizzarro - underplays the salon charms
of his Tchaikovsky fill-ups, the Dumka and three of the 'Seasons' pieces. A
sonata by his Russian wife, Tatiana Komarova, is sweetly Skryabinesque, and
leaves no great mark. In Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition, however,
he has any number of subtle ideas, deeply musical and always respectful of
the text. All that one misses is a sense that the chicks' 'Ballet', the
'Marketplace at Limoges' and 'Baba Yaga' are tremendous pianistic fun: Vogt
is excellent, but excessively polite.
We have needed a proper account of Balakirev's posthumous Piano Concerto,
and Malcolm Binns - with David Lloyd-Jones conducting the English Northern
Philharmonia, thoroughly idiomatic - has now supplied one (Hyperion CDA
66640), along with Rimsky-Korsakov's less substantial concerto. Binns is
fully equal to Balakirev's athletic demands, as also to his twinkling charm.
Just here and there, one would like harder fingers: some of Balakirev's best
pianistic trouvailles trade upon the effect of an unstoppable mechanism.
In Busoni's monster Concerto with male chorus (Koch CD 311 160 H1), the
American pianist goes through the hoops with tireless panache - which is all
he needs to do, for his is essentially a noisy concertante role. The music,
broad but not very complicated, rests in the safe hands of Michael Gielen,
conducting the Sudwestfunk Symphony. Busoni fans will have to have it.
