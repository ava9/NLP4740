As Michael Tilson Thomas's Mahler cycle at the Barbican approaches its
midpoint, we begin to have a clear overview of this conductor's strengths
and foibles. The former outweigh the latter by far, but Mahler shows
everything up, since he was a master conductor-composer.
On Sunday (and Monday) the London Symphony played the Fourth for him. It has
a dewier, more innocent surface than Tilson Thomas could make plausible: TT
never twinkles. The first movement, with its sleighbells, pranced and
curvetted artfully, every moment of it calculated to the hilt. The same
anxious care, applied to the great Poco adagio - here a Molto adagio - left
it gluey. TT lacks the gift of his master, Leonard Bernstein for drawing
'natural' playing from his orchestra; they sounded thoroughly practised,
hardly ever spontaneous.
Yet the Scherzo was dazzling, kaleidoscopic. TT revelled in bringing out
lines - a bassoon melody here, a string of pizzicati there - that nobody
else uncovers; the score churned with excitement. For the finale he had the
soprano Renee Fleming as soloist: lovely singing, but the voice is really
too womanly-mature for the child's-eye Wunderhorn sentiments. Earlier, she
had delivered Schubert's 'Shepherd on the Rock' with such fine grace as to
make it seem almost a good piece, abetted by Nicholas Rodwell's elegant
clarinet and TT at the piano.
That was part of a strange mixed first half, comprising Morton Feldman's The
Viola in my Life IV and a John Tavener premiere, The Myrrh-Bearer. Yuri
Bashmet was the peerless viola soloist in each. The Tavener is much the
usual mixture, with a semi-chorus whispering 'Kyrie Eleison' over and over
again beneath repetitive shouts from the main chorus, while the viola goes
floridly up and down a couple of scales for well over half an hour.
Bashmet made that sound almost interesting. He did as much for Feldman's
solo part, which plays almost continuously for 20 minutes while the
orchestra does Feldman's customary thing: deliberately, polemically
low-profile, apparently quite unstructured.
Two nights earlier, Anne-Sophie Mutter's violin recital in the same hall had
been remarkable chiefly for the height of her stiletto heels, surmounted by
a slinky black number. Miss Mutter is of course a performer of the highest
professional competence, and in the right repertoire - passionate virtuoso
stuff - she wields a scathing authority. Here, however, she essayed
Beethoven's last sonata, op. 96 in G, and Schumann's second-last, his op.
121 in D minor: the one mostly gentle and reflective, the other lean and
dramatic but formally patterned.
Her way with the Beethoven was to play it all sweetly, declining to read any
particular character in it. A 'soft, oleaginous mutter' indeed, though with
a very fast, sentimental vibrato applied to everything. Her svelte Schumann
had plenty of energy - but a work so full of repetitions should not have
them all repeated with such literal exactitude. A touch of waywardness is a
bonus in this sonata.
Aftersong, a workmanlike piece composed for Miss Mutter by the American
Sebastian Currier, gave her - and her excellent pianist Lambert Orkis - bold
things to do. Its heart remained in Samuel Barber territory, its nerves
recalled Walton; Messiaen surfaced later on. There was more red-blooded
music in the suite Stravinsky arranged from his Pulcinella, pastiche though
it partly is. They played not the familiar arrangement for Dushkin, but an
earlier, more virtuosic one Stravinsky made for Szymanowski's violinist Paul
Kochanski: and they delivered it with engaging flair.
