Beginning its 11th season with a concert at St. Andrew's Presbyterian 
Auditorium, the Mozart Camerata continued to shine with the same polish that 
has distinguished previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Music Director Ami Porat bills his ensemble as a "Classical Orchestra," and 
though the selections do not always fall into that historical period, the 
transparent clarity associated with that era is a hallmark of this group. 
Friday night, a program of Rossini, Beethoven and Mozart emerged clean, precise 
and energetic, admirably controlled despite echoey acoustics in the church. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Daniel Pollack joined the orchestra as the protagonist in Beethoven's 
"Emperor" Concerto. Pollack is perhaps best known to the general public for his 
prize-winning, pyrotechnic ghost performance (for actress Amy Irving) of 
Prokofiev's Third Concerto in the movie "The Competition." He brought the same 
technical mastery to serve an abundantly lyrical reading of the fifth Beethoven 
concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven offers the pianist a wealth of opportunity for virtuosic display in 
this work. But Pollack emphasized beauty over bravura, even in some of the most 
tempting chordal passages of the opening movement. And while the pianist drew 
less contrast between lyric and tense sections than did his orchestral cohorts, 
he nevertheless held appealing command. 
</P>
<P>
There were some exciting moments of abandon in Pollack's performance -- 
larger-than-life chordal sections and fiery scale passages with which to close 
the Rondo. Still, his caressing attention to a naturally unfolding, sweeping 
line in the Poco adagio, defined by thoughtfully weighting each note, created 
the most lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
On their part, orchestral members brought the same spirit to their well-honed 
machine that characterized their reading of Rossini's Overture to "L'Inganno 
Felice" and Mozart's "Linz" Symphony. Porat knows how to demand a gracefully 
majestic phrase and still keep overall structure in sight. As witnessed 
particularly by the symphony, he seems to encourage sympathetic listening among 
his players, both individually and in sections. The piece shimmered with an 
illuminating interplay of lines defined by apt control of dynamics and accent, 
all unhindered by even the most vigorous of presto finales.
