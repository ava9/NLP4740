It was difficult to tell why there were empty seats at this concert at the
Royal Festival Hall. Perhaps some people had been put off by the advertised
programme and others turned away in disappointment when it was changed, for
this Philharmonia concert had undergone more wholesale transpositions than
an ageing prima donna's songbook.
Suffice to say that the original and rather adventurous plan to give us
Mozart and Britten (Act 2 of Gloriana and the Spring Symphony) evaporated
some weeks ago into an Elgar symphony and a Beethoven concerto, but by the
time the audience had settled into their seats the concerto had gone as
well. The evening's soloist had been taken ill. In her place John Eliot
Gardiner had been persuaded to take the orchestra through Beethoven's
Seventh Symphony - on no rehearsal.
No doubt the Philharmonia Orchestra could play this symphony on autopilot
anyway. But Gardiner is not the sort of conductor to let an orchestra get
away with that. If they really had not had any rehearsals for this
performance, the players were in for a surprise. He set a galloping fast
tempo for the main Allegro of the first movement (no easy matter to keep
dotted rhythms clear at that speed) and after that the symphony never
stopped for breath.
The importance of Gardiner - and the reason why a traditional orchestra like
the Philharmonia is well advised to get him on board its roster of
conductors - is that he has the will and the intelligence not just to go
along with accepted notions of how well-known pieces of music should be
played. The Beethoven may only have been an outline of a performance, but it
was stamped with his own personality. His Elgar after the interval was
wholly original, unidiomatic perhaps, but unforgettable.
Coming from working with early music, Gardiner approaches late 19th-century
orchestral works with different expectations. He wants clarity of sound and
precision, not grandiloquence (the Philharmonia pinned down inner parts
astonishingly for him). In shaping the music, he is not content to take the
long view; every single phrase has to be given its own meaning.
The result was a performance of Elgar's Second Symphony that had more to say
about the music than any other I have encountered. Instead of vague romantic
gestures, it seemed to speak urgently of personal passion and the gathering
storm-clouds of the First World War, the latter in a fearsomely articulated
scherzo. Forget Tate's rather bloated Elgar and Sinopoli's debilitating
efforts with the same orchestra. Gardiner is the new, thinking Elgarian for
the 1990s.
