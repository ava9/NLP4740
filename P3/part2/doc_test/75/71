Summer is upon us and there is a huge number of repeats. Watch the Lausanne
Grand Prix meeting in Athletics (8.00 BBC1, then 9.00 BBC2) and you will be
able to decide where the most amazingly brief clothing is worn on TV these
days: the dance floor in 'Come Dancing' or the athletics track. Stars such
as Heike Drechsler and Linford Christie are expected to compete.
BBC2 repeats a good documentary about Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of
propaganda, called We Have Ways Of Making You Think (8.10). This programme
reveals that Goebbels' own tastes were for Hollywood schlock and that he
arranged for the making of very conventional entertainment movies to keep
the people happy.
In Discovering Beethoven (9.30 BBC2) Michael Tilson Thomas conducts the LSO
at a concert-lecture in which he explains why Beethoven's 5th symphony was a
turning point in music and influenced nearly every other symphony composed
during the following 100 years. The programme ends with a full performance
of the symphony. Channel 4 completes its thriller An Exchange Of Fire
(10.00).
