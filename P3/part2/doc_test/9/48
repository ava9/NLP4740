  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Russian Ambassador to 
South Korea Georgiy Kunadze said Wednesday that North Korea, as 
a member of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), should 
fulfill all of its obligations under the treaty. 
  He told a symposium in Tokyo titled "Peace and Stability in 
East Asia" that, even though North Korea has been insisting that 
it be given a special position ever since it announced its 
intention to withdraw from the NPT, there are no other positions 
in the international convention than that of either a member or 
a non-member. His remarks were seen as tantamount to urging 
Pyongyang to accept full-fledged inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "As a main member of the NPT, Russia will make the maximum 
effort in trying to see to it that nuclear weapons do not appear 
in Northeast Asia," he said. But Kunadze struck a cautious note 
on the issue of sanctions against North Korea, saying that 
isolating the communist state might produce unwanted results. 
  Meanwhile, former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama 
pointed out that international countermeasures against North 
Korea, assuming that it persists in rejecting nuclear 
inspections, depend on the stances of Russia and China. Japan's 
diplomatic ability, he added, will be tested as a result because 
Tokyo may have to control remittances from pro-Pyongyang Koreans 
in Japan to North Korea. 
  Professor Izmi Hazime addressed factors which could trigger 
a 
crisis should the nuclear standoff continue to drag on. He said 
the major factors are whether North Korea could endure extreme 
economic difficulties and whether the United States could 
tolerate the situation. He captured attention by saying that 
the world needs to prepare to use military power under the 
worst-case scenario. 
  An Pyong-chun, a professor at South Korea's Yonsei 
University, said that in order to settle the nuclear problem 
North Korea should remain in the NPT, accept special inspections 
and agree to mutual checks with South Korea. 
  "Although not desirable," he added, "we can think of 
economic 
sanctions by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea. If the 
sanctions are imposed, Japan's exertion of its economic 
influence including suspension of remittances to North Korea is 
essential."
