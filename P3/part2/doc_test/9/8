  [Text] Seoul, 8 Feb -- Hwang Pyang-tae, South Korean 
ambassador to China who is now temporarily back in Seoul, met 
with an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 8 February and disclosed his 
noteworthy views on North Korea. Hwang said that since last 
November, North Korean President Kim Il-song has again started 
"his direct rule over the nation" in dealing with issues of top 
priority such as the alleged DPRK nuclear development so as to 
get over the most serious crisis ever since the nation's 
founding; and that North Korea is now moving toward implementing 
the policy of granting limited rights of independent cultivation 
to farmers, which is a policy basically modeled on the reform 
program that was started in China in the late 1970's, as well as 
the policy of setting up special economic zones. 
  As for the reasons why President Kim is restoring "his 
direct 
administration," Ambassador Hwang cited the following points: 
members of the "interim generation," meaning the generation born 
between the first and second revolutionary generations and 
including Kim's brother Kim Yong-chu, have been reappointed to 
front-line political posts in the personnel reshuffle last 
December; Secretary Kim Chong-il as well as other prospective 
leaders of his generation such as Kim Tal-hyun and Kim Yong-sun 
are now made to play only lesser roles; and in his recent talks 
with various guests such as UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, American missionary Billy Graham, and VIP's from 
China, President Kim Il-song hinted at his posture of directly 
controlling the state administration. 
  However, Ambassador Hwang also pointed out that the 
restoration of President Kim's direct rule seems to be limited 
at this point to important pending diplomatic issues such the 
nuclear issue, the normalization of diplomatic relations with 
the United States and Japan, and the issue on dealing with the 
south on the one hand, and those issues related to the basic 
principle of the government administration on the other. For 
example, there are problems related to the partial reform and 
open-door policy, which was started on a trial basis by leaders 
of the second revolutionary generation such as Secretary Kim 
Chong-il but which has now come to a deadlock. 
  Secretary Kim Chong-il has so far rejected the Chinese-type 
reform and open-door policy, terming it as "revisionism". 
However, President Kim Il-song sent Secretary Hwang Chang-yop 
to China early this year to put an end to its relations with 
China which have become rather awkward since China established 
diplomatic relations with the ROK in the summer of 1992, and at 
the same time to instruct him to make an inspection tour of 
special economic zones in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. It is reported 
that experts in economic affairs have been dispatched to special 
economic zones since then. 
  Ambassador Hwang also maintained that President Kim 
Il-song's 
intention to restore his direct control is not an indication of 
his attempt to change his decision on assigning Kim Chong-il as 
his successor. As a basis for this observation, Ambassador 
Hwang cited the fact that Kim Pyong-il -- who is Kim Chong-il's 
half brother and who had returned home late last year after 
completing his assignment as ambassador to Bulgaria -- has been 
reappointed as ambassador to Finland.
