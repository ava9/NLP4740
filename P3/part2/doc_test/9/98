<F P=106> [Aleksandr Krasulin report: "Pyongyang Intends No </F>
Concessions"] 
  [Text] The U.S. statement on the holding of the "Team 
Spirit `94" military exercises with South Korea, the rejection 
of a third round of talks with the DPRK on nuclear security on 
the Korean Peninsula, and the intention to submit for 
consideration by the UN Security Council a resolution on 
economic sanctions against North Korea if its authorities do not 
allow the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA] to carry 
out a repeat full inspection of nuclear facilities and refuse to 
exchange special envoys between North and South have been 
assessed in Pyongyang as an attempt to exert blatant pressure. 
This was said in a 21 March DPRK Foreign Ministry statement, 
whose contents were announced to journalists Tuesday by Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador in Moscow. 
  The document notes in particular that, in its demands, the 
United States has gone considerably beyond the bounds of the New 
York accords of 25 February and is "proceeding on the basis of 
its former policy of a hostile attitude toward Korea"; the 
failed IAEA inspection is being used as a pretext to "isolate 
and stifle the DPRK." 
  The ambassador also announced that under the complex 
conditions of holding an extraordinary inspection of nuclear 
facilities, the Korean authorities did everything possible to 
make it a success. As for the analysis samples which IAEA 
specialists failed to obtain from one laboratory, the Korean 
side gives an assurance that the agency's control instruments 
installed during a previous inspection are still there, and the 
IAEA seals have not been broken. 
  He stressed that, since the United States and the IAEA are 
using the results of the inspection to exert pressure on the 
republic, the DPRK no longer considers it "its duty to provide 
uninterrupted guarantees for the IAEA." "We will not be making 
any unilateral concessions, and if Washington takes tough 
measures we will be forced to respond appropriately. We are 
still ready for a dialogue, but if the United States chooses a 
military way to solve the problem, we will respond in kind," Son 
Song-pil stressed. "In this complex situation America should 
make a more realistic assessment of the possible consequences." 
  The ambassador warned of the danger which could be posed by 
the ending of the negotiating process. In this event the DPRK 
would be forced to carry out the government decision -- 
currently in abeyance -- to withdraw from the Nonproliferation 
Treaty. This, in his opinion, could lead to the galvanization 
of nuclear developments in a number of other countries, which 
are already near-nuclear-capable, and, as a result, to the 
breakdown of the entire system of nuclear arms control. 
  It seems as though the United States is not ruling out the 
possible use of military force in the Korean question. THE 
WASHINGTON POST reports that, apart from the plans to increase 
the U.S. military contingent and to deploy another 48 Patriot 
surface-to-air missile systems in South Korea, it is also 
planned to redeploy USN aircraft carriers closer to the Korean 
seaboard. 
  At the same time, the United States is trying to find UN 
allies to support its policy in regard to Pyongyang. Naturally, 
without the help of Japan, China, and Russia, any restrictive 
measures would be ineffective. On Monday, Albright, U.S. 
representative to the United Nations, met with delegates from 
the UN Security Council countries. A draft resolution calling 
on North Korea to agree to all the IAEA inspectors' demands was 
discussed, and soundings were taken on the attitude of Britain, 
France, Russia, and China toward sanctions against Pyongyang. 
According to Radio Liberty, Russia and Britain supported the 
U.S. position. France opposed tough measures, and China 
abstained. We would recall that each Security Council member 
has the right of veto -- consequently, the agreement of all of 
the "big five" is needed for sanctions to be imposed. 
  In the opinion of Professor James Morley of Columbia 
University, the Security Council members may be able to draft a 
resolution in general terms, but they are unlikely to reach a 
unanimous view on the use of sanctions. It is hard to imagine, 
he stated in an interview with a Radio Liberty correspondent, 
that China, Japan, and even South Korea would agree to military 
action. Clearly, Russia would give its verbal assent to the 
resolution, but would hardly want to get involved in military 
operations. 
  The leaders of the Russian foreign policy department are 
themselves being quite restrained in their statements on the 
subject of Korea. Thus, commenting on recent talks with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Aleksandr Panov, Russian 
Federation deputy foreign minister, stated that "both sides 
consider it necessary to main permanent contact, to continue 
talks on the DPRK nuclear problem, and, possibly, to seek some 
new approaches, since current approaches have proved 
insufficiently effective." 
  Western observers are in practice failing to take account of 
the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid between the DPRK and 
Russia, to which the latter is party as the successor to the 
former USSR. At the same time, they are not ruling out the 
possiblity that the Russian Federation may adopt some kind of 
independent stance on this issue, as was the case recently on 
Sarajevo. 
  Judging by everything, Washington does not expect any 
immediate exacerbation of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Confirmation of this was the Pentagon decision to send the 
Patriot systems by sea rather than by air. The idea is that 
this will not only allow Washington to defuse the political 
tension with respect to this step, but will clearly also give 
the DPRK time to review its position vis-a-vis a full inspection.
