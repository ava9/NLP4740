  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Japan's envoy asserted 
Thursday that his country would not go nuclear even if North 
Korea possessed atomic weapons. 
  "This (North Korean) nuclear issue has become a top priority 
issue and a symbolic issue for Japanese-Korean cooperation in 
the international society," Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Toshio 
Goto said at a luncheon hosted by the Korean Council on Foreign 
Relations. 
  "I would like to assure you, new Prime Minister Hata stands 
firm on this issue," he said. 
  Asked about the possibility of expanding bilateral military 
cooperation through such means as conducting joint drills, the 
ambassador said it could happen but first required careful 
consideration. 
  South Korea's defense minister visited Japan recently and 
agreed on exchange calls by naval vessels, an important symbolic 
gesture for two countries whose history is stained by more than 
three decades of colonial rule that culminated with the end of 
World War II. 
  "...It's a matter requiring delicate consideration from the 
standpoint of the sentiments of the Korean people," said Goto, 
referring to the colonial years. 
  He voiced hope that a time will come when people on both 
sides can cooperate "without prejudice." 
  Certain media reports were raising "unfounded suspicions" 
that Japan might change its non-nuclear policies should North 
Korea develop nuclear weapons, the envoy pointed out. 
  "There is no such possibility that Japan would decide to go 
nuclear... I would like to stress here that nuclearization 
would run counter to Japan's national interest," said Goto. 
  The ambassador highlighted regional stability and three key 
tasks involved -- encouraging coordination to settle regional 
conflicts, cooperating in promoting region-wide political and 
security dialogue, and enhancing the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum as the region's economic engine. 
  On bilateral terms, he agreed with South Korean President 
Kim 
Yong-sam's view that an accurate recognition of history is the 
only way to point their ties in a future- and world-oriented 
direction. 
  "I fully share the view that the Japan-Korea relationship is 
moving beyond the bilateral framework and has reached the phase 
of promoting cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and, 
moreover, in the international community," he said.
