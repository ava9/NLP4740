  [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
ambassador for nuclear affairs will fly to Washington this week 
for bilateral and trilateral talks, including Japan, on the 
North Korean nuclear situation, a Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said Monday. 
  Ambassador Kim Sam-hun's visit precedes a third round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue slated to open in Geneva 
after a one-year hiatus following the second round. 
  Kim is to meet with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci, chief American delegate to the dialogue with North 
Korea, for bilateral consultations. 
  The meeting will be followed by a trilateral consultation 
including Yutaka Kawashima, director-general for Asian affairs 
at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the spokesman said. 
  The three-way meeting is expected to address issues related 
to freezing North Korea's nuclear development program, 
recounting its past activities, and financial aid in switching 
the North's outdated nuclear system to safer light-water 
reactors.
