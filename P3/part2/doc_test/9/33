  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- No new ambassador 
to Russia was named after Anatol Taranu's recent resignation. 
Alexandru Buruian, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, declared to 
BASA that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet nominated 
any candidate to the post of ambassador to the Russian 
Federation. Decisions of this type are first examined by state 
leaders," he mentioned. Buruian affirmed that the views of the 
future ambassador on the problem of the 14th Army's withdrawal 
will not constitute a criterion of selection for the future 
chief of the Moldovan diplomatic mission to Moscow. "The fact 
that previously the Moldovan delegation at the negotiations was 
headed by the ex-ambassador to Russia Anatol; scan was rather a 
coincidence. In my opinion, the activity of the ambassador 
could have been more efficient if he had not led the Moldovan 
party at the negotiations. The activity of the ambassador to 
Russia should involve all aspects of the Moldovan-Russian 
relations, while the 14th Army problem is just one element of 
these relations," stressed the Moldovan vice-minister of foreign 
affairs.
