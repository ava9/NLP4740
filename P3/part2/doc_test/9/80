  [Text] North Korea has warned that unless the United States 
stops its pressure tactic, it will mean war on the Korean 
peninsula. The warning by North Korea's ambassador to China, Chu 
Chang-chun, is the latest threat in the stand off over North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. Mr. Chu says the 
deployment of American Patriot missiles in South Korea will only 
accelerate the speed towards war on the Korean peninsula. The 
ambassador also says if international sanctions are imposed on 
North Korea, Pyongyang would, what he called, make the necessary 
response. From Beijing Ali Moore reports. 
  [Moore] North Korea's ambassador Chu Chang-chun says America 
should not forget the Korean war of the 1950's and should use 
the experience as a lesson. As well, he accused the United 
States of organizing international pressure against North Korea 
and said all the moves will only accelerate the speed towards 
war. If there is another war he said the United States and 
South Korea will be fully responsible. North Korea has a large 
diplomatic presence in China, its most important ally and 
trading partner. Chinese leaders say they oppose using pressure 
to resolve the nuclear dispute. Ali Moore, Beijing.
