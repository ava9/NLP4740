  [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- If Russia makes its proposals 
about an international conference on security and the 
nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula more concrete, North 
Korea is ready to study them and reply in concrete terms, Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Moscow, told journalists today. 
  He said: "The attractive side of the Russian initiative is 
the desire to resolve the nuclear issue in the region through 
talks, without the use of force and threats, based on the 
principle of equal rights." According to the ambassador, only 
methods based on the use of force and pressure have been applied 
to his country so far. The United States, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and certain states have frequently 
used such methods. Son Song-pil said: Regrettably, Russia has 
also been unable to refrain from using them, and for a while it 
toed the line of the U.S. Administration with respect to the 
issue of nuclear safety on the Korean peninsula. This has 
caused relations between North Korea and the Russian Federation 
to cool in the past few years. Now some aspects of their 
bilateral relations have started to inspire hope, and the 
present Russian initiative reflects this hope. 
  Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the 
obstacles preventing the nuclear problem from being solved 
immediately, Son Song-pil spoke primarily about the IAEA's 
so-called "double standards" when estimating the level of 
nuclear activity of different states. He said conclusive proof 
of this is the 70 kg of plutonium that is unaccounted in 
Tokaymura, Japan, and only recently made public. Given the 
well-developed and efficient system of monitoring the security 
of nuclear installations by this international organization, 
this incident can only signify that the IAEA is "far from being 
impartial." The North Korean ambassador does not rule out that 
the plutonium found in Japan is "merely the tip of the iceberg" 
and that thorough and unbiased inspection could lead to the 
discovery of other serious Japanese violations of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty.
