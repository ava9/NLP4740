<F P=106> [Aleksandr Chudodeyev report in the "Korean Peninsula" </F>
column: "The Russian Foreign Ministry Denies Possibility of Aid 
for Kim Il- song. The National-Patriots Shift Their Sympathies 
to the North Korean Dictator"] 
  [Excerpt] The 29 March INTERFAX report quoting Aleksandr 
Panov, former Russian ambassador to South Korea and currently 
Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, saying that Moscow 
will render assistance to North Korea in the event of unprovoked 
aggression against it because Russia, as successor to the USSR, 
is linked with the DPRK by a corresponding treaty of 1961, 
according to Foreign Ministry officials distorts the essence of 
the Russian position. In response to a request from SEGODNYA's 
correspondent to provide the full text of the deputy minister's 
statement, however, Foreign Ministry employees said that so far 
they had no verbatim record of the speech themselves. 
  Even so, such statements like those cited by INTERFAX are 
already being heard from deputies of the Russian State Duma. On 
28 March North Korea's main communist paper NODONG SINMUN 
printed, in the place where odes glorifying the "great leader" 
Kim Il-song are usually published, an "angry statement" by 
Viktor Ilyukhin, Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and other 
Russian parliamentarians about their "profound concern" over the 
aggravation of the situation in Korea (which is true in itself). 
They condemned not the North Korean blackmailing, however, but 
"certain U.S. circles advocating the so-called new world order 
and setting new unjustified demands on our traditional ally -- 
the DPRK -- which only exacerbates the situation and arouses 
surprise and indignation." [passage omitted]
