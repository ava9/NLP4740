It will be a dark day for the music business if Tracy Chapman's male-bashing 
anthem "Fast Car" is awarded even one Grammy ("Tracy Chapman: The Grammy 
Favorite," Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: If Bob Dylan wrote a song about quitting school to take care of 
his troubled mother but then abandoning her, getting married but later taking 
the children and abandoning his troubled wife, people would think he was a 
monster. But when Chapman sings of abandoning troubled men, she is roundly 
applauded. Is there a double standard at work here? 
</P>
<P>
And after seeing the video for this song, it is obvious to me that Chapman, for 
crass commercial gain, is exploiting a racist stereotype of black men as lazy 
people and lousy fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast Car" is designed to portray the singer as a victim. But an inspection of 
the lyrics reveals that the woman in the song is calling all the shots. She is 
not a victim but a victimizer. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose that we shouldn't blame Chapman. We all live in a society where 
male-bashing is used to sell everything from cigarettes to automobiles. Why 
shouldn't she get to join the party?
