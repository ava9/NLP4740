COLE PORTER: RED, HOT AND NEW; 
</P>
<P>

Cole Porter couldn't have been farther from the working-class-hero profile of 
your average rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
Born into privilege, the man who wrote such pop classics as "Night and Day" and 
"I've Got You Under My Skin" before Elvis entered grade school attended Yale, 
where he led the Glee Club and was a member of the Whiffenpoofs. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana native studied composition in Europe and spent much of his life 
hobnobbing with what is now called the jet set. 
</P>
<P>
So why does the music of Cole Porter, who died in 1964 at age 73, serve as the 
foundation of an AIDS campaign that is shaping up as the most ambitious pop 
charity project since the 1988 Amnesty International world tour? 
</P>
<P>
The campaign begins Tuesday with the Chrysalis Records release of "Red, Hot and 
Blue," an album that features interpretations of Porter songs by 22 
contemporary pop artists, including U2, Talking Heads leader David Byrne, 
Sinead O'Connor, k.d. lang, Tom Waits, Neneh Cherry and the Neville Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Blake, a London-based filmmaker and the project's co-director, said 
Porter's music was chosen for both aesthetic and thematic reasons. Porter 
himself, Blake said, was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"Cole Porter was one of America's greatest songwriters, and his music spoke 
about love and sex and experimentation with intelligence -- and that's what you 
want when dealing with an AIDS benefit," Blake said by phone from London. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember in the early days of the project, listening to the lyrics and 
thinking, 'My god, how appropriate.' Lines like 'Just the thought of you . . . 
makes me stop before I begin . . . 'cause I've got you under my skin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Blake said, there was great enthusiasm among today's artists for 
Porter's songs -- and the challenge of interpreting music from an earlier era. 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry, the London-based singer whose "Buffalo Stance" was one of the 
most enticing singles of 1989, opens the warm, imaginative album with an 
especially bold version of "I've Got You Under My Skin." 
</P>
<P>
Using only a trace of Porter's original lyric and melody, Cherry turns the 
lighthearted expression of romantic obsession into an aggressive hip-hop 
warning about AIDS. The title line, in the new context, can be seen as either 
the statement of an AIDS victim or a pregnant woman who fears her baby may have 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Porter's own classic rhyme "Use your mentality / Wake up to reality" 
-- which Cherry preserves -- becomes an AIDS slogan, both a warning and a cry 
for greater support of AIDS research and its victims. Cherry adds her own rap 
slogan: "Share your love / Don't share the needle." 
</P>
<P>
A few other artists also take considerable liberties with Porter's music, but 
most keep it pretty much intact. U2 approaches "Night and Day" -- one of 
Porter's most memorable love songs -- with the same anxious rock intensity the 
group brings to its own expressions of devotion. And O'Connor sings "You Do 
Something to Me" in a '40s torch style that preserves the confessional tone of 
her "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" album. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne offers an appropriately playful treatment of "Don't Fence Me In," while 
lang gives an especially affecting vocal intimacy to "So in Love." Not 
everything, however, works; "Love for Sale," for instance, a once-scandalous 
song about prostitution, is embarrassingly labored by the Fine Young Cannibals. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Porter's songs hold up better than almost any other pop composer of 
his day is that there was an underlying tension in many of them -- a sly, 
almost mocking humor in the lighter tunes and a melancholy pessimism in many of 
the most beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lyrics on "Red, Hot and Blue" serve as a poignant and uncanny 
commentary on the suffering and heartache of the AIDS struggle -- a commentary 
that Annie Lennox seemed to sense in her moving vocal on "Ev'ry Time We Say 
Goodbye." Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
"Ev'ry time we say goodby / I die a little / Ev'ry time we say goodby /I wonder 
why a little / Why the gods above me / Who must be in the know / Think so 
little of me / They allow you to go." 
</P>
<P>
Blake, who's organized the project with New York art critic and lawyer John 
Carlin, said one disappointing note about the "Red, Hot and Blue" campaign was 
the inability to secure a corporate sponsor, which would have made initial 
financing easier. "We approached lots of potential sponsors and were given all 
sorts of excuses, but the (truth is) there is still a stigma associated with 
AIDS that people and corporations don't want to deal with," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
The album will be followed by an ABC-TV special Dec. 1 and a home video in 
April. Both will feature various short films as well as videos of more than a 
dozen of the songs made by directors Alex Cox, Jonathan Demme, Jim Jarmusch, 
Wim Wenders and others. Proceeds will go to AIDS charities.
