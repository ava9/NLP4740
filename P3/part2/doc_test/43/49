POPLINE: NO 'JOKE' BAND LABEL

The three former Bostonians who bill themselves as Christmas don't mind being 
told that their music has a certain flair for the absurd -- as well they 
shouldn't, with titles like that of their new album, "Ultraprophets of the 
Psykick Revolution," and satirical college radio hits like "Stupid Kids" and 
"Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
What they do mind somewhat is being thought of as a "joke" band, even while 
writing songs about AIDS, wife beating, nuclear destruction and the like, and 
showing sure signs of solid pop-rock craftsmanship amid their 
left-of-centeredness. "We have definitely -- I hate to use the M-word -- 
matured," admits singer/drummer Liz Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Like Camper Van Beethoven, perhaps? "Camper Van Beethoven has turned out to be 
less of a novelty act than they appeared at first, and in some ways we do have 
something in common with them," says singer/guitarist Michael Cudahy, sporting 
a nude-Madonna T-shirt and acting just a little like an insidious Ed Grimley. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that humor -- or, musically, any kind of weirdness -- corrupts the 
rest of it so that people go, 'Oh, they're a funny band.' But absurd isn't the 
antithesis of serious. It's more than just finding everything to be a joke when 
you find everything to be absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"Ya talk about absurd!" exclaims Cox. "We're living there: Absurd, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
She's referring to the group's new hometown: Las Vegas. Upon leaving its 
previous independent label (Big Time) to sign with a West Coast major (I.R.S.), 
Cudahy, Cox and bass player Dan Castelli packed up and moved from Boston, a 
city with a thriving music scene befitting its offbeat stance, to a city with a 
music scene thriving around Frank Sinatra Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Says Cox, "It's the big fish in a little pond scenario: 'Hi! We're the best new 
band in town! Where do we park our van?' I suppose that sounds conceited, but 
there aren't too many bands there." 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," confirms Cudahy. "We are the best rock band in Las Vegas. I'm sure 
of it. As the Legendary Stardust Cowboy says, 'They're not such a big market 
for our kind of entertainment here.' " Chris Willman
