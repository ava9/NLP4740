NIGHT LIFE: UNITED NATIONS HIP-HOPS WITH RACIAL HARMONY

It's somewhere around 1 a.m. somewhere on the eastern fringe of Hollywood, and 
somebody on a tiny stage in a big hall steps up to a microphone and bellows: 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody, everybody, anybody . . . screammmmm." 
</P>
<P>
He tells the crowd to throw their hands in the air and to wave them as if they 
just don't care. He asks the ladies in the house to say "owwwww." And many of 
them do. 
</P>
<P>
By now, most everyone realizes that the people with the man on stage are 
members of the progressive hip-hop posse Boogie Down Productions -- guests on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" just a few hours earlier -- making a surprise 
appearance at this club. 
</P>
<P>
The club deejay at the side of the stage gestures wildly, the beat from Audio 
Two's rap hit "Top Billing" thuds from the massive speakers, and the man with 
the microphone begins to rap, first haltingly and then more fluently, until a 
woman rapper seizes the mike and embellishes the beat with her melodic island 
lilt. 
</P>
<P>
Boogie Down's KRS-One takes over, rapping in a quick, reggae-toaster style, 
lashing out in raw, spontaneous rhyme against racism and the bullies of the 
Bush Administration, darting in and out of and enlivening the monotonous, 
bass-heavy beat. 
</P>
<P>
He works the crowd, prodding it, flirting, building to a delighted roar. 
KRS-One's never been much live -- he depends on the audience to know every word 
-- but he's electric here. As suddenly as the rapping started, it ends, a mere 
10 minutes later. And half the house keeps on dancing, oblivious to anything 
but the beat. 
</P>
<P>
MTV and Rolling Stone look for the Summer of Love in every Parisian soca joint 
and Ecstasy-soaked Manchester disco, but the real thing might be going down 
every Tuesday night in an aging L.A. ballroom: an ongoing festival of peace, 
love and understanding that vibrates to the sound of rap music, a crossroads of 
Afro-centric youth culture that just happens to work as a wildly popular dance 
club. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations is the cultural arm of the Zulu Nation, a loose, international 
collective of musicians, organizers and graffiti artists that dates back to the 
earliest days of rap. (Any time you see an artist wearing an Afrika medallion 
in a video or on stage -- Public Enemy, Kool Moe Dee, Ice-T, De La Soul, even 
Milli Vanilli and Bobby Brown -- he or she is probably down with the Zulus.) 
</P>
<P>
The club is a utopian fantasy of a '90s hip-hop discotheque, 1,500 young people 
of every conceivable ethnic group bobbing mostly drug-free until 3 a.m., 
brightly colored peace signs and tie-dyes and Afrika medallions everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of groovy racial harmony rarely seen outside a Soul II Soul 
video: black and white and Asian and Latino slamming side-by-side to the beat. 
If you could set the Rainbow Coalition to music it would look something like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Hip-hop is a true culture, and we present it as honestly as we can. . . . The 
music, the dance, the African fashion, the graffiti art," says Zulu Nation 
leader Afrika Islam. "The kind of freestyle dancing you see in videos and at 
the club dates back to Africa -- it's a genuine part of our culture. Even break 
dancing is coming back, because the music is intense and United Nations is a 
place to do it among peers." 
</P>
<P>
Islam, United Nations' star deejay and the man who creates the beats for 
Ice-T's records, has been involved in hip-hop since at least the mid-'70s, 
first as the right hand to hip-hop innovator Afrika ("Planet Rock") Bambaataa 
in the South Bronx, then in the Rock Steady Zulu Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Brought to California by Ice-T about 10 years ago, he has spun at many of the 
best L.A. dance clubs -- including Radio, near MacArthur Park, the first local 
rap club -- and he brought out, in turn, several of the early Bronx rappers to 
work with Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate and with the club. Old-school Bronx hip-hop 
makes its home in Hollywood these days. 
</P>
<P>
The core Zulu audience coalesced near the end of the '80s at Water the Bush, a 
rap-oriented dance club at Hollywood Live, a hall across the street from Mann's 
Chinese Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
After that club closed late last year, United Nations opened its doors at the 
Stardust Ballroom, on Sunset just west of Western. 
</P>
<P>
In L.A., dance clubs move around a lot -- some people think a new location 
renews a club's energy. Since Boogie Down Productions' impromptu performance at 
the Stardust, United Nations has moved twice. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of weeks back at Hollywood Live, it's now ensconced in the 
cavernous, 1,500-capacity dance hall called the Casa, south of downtown at the 
corner of Washington and Oak. Whatever the location, the spirit remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Branches are scheduled to open in Tokyo in October and in London next January. 
Zulu Nation members work the door, make the art, furnish the music, provide 
security. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations partner Fareed estimates there are 100 Nation members in L.A., 
but maybe 5,000 "affiliates." What is an affiliate? 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who will come to the club and buy a T-shirt and dance." 
</P>
<P>
Over the dance floor swing black lights and disco balls, red-glowing globes and 
fluorescent ankhs, peace signs, Africa-shaped cutouts, Islamic stars and 
crescent moons and Zulu-type masks; the flags of all nations hang in an arc. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the room, Bruce Lee and Ice-T videos play, without sound, on a 
screen. At the other is a deserted bar. . . . People here mostly don't drink. 
In a corner, a photographer takes a picture of three blondes against a 
wild-style graffiti mural. 
</P>
<P>
A percentage of the club's profits goes to Justiceville, Ted Hayes' coalition 
for the homeless; Earth Day and Malcolm X's birthday are celebrated in a big 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The songs blasting are mostly familiar to any "Yo! MTV Raps" listener -- Tone 
Loc, Heavy D, Big Daddy Kane, Queen Latifah -- and flow seamlessly, often for 
only a minute or two each. The original cowbell version of LL Cool J's "Rock 
the Bells" slides into Eric B.'s "I Know You Got Soul" so smoothly that it's 
impossible to decide where one record ends and the other begins. 
</P>
<P>
Two records play at once more often than you would think, one beat reinforcing 
the other; the scratching is usually slick enough to have been part of the mix 
to begin with. At least half the music is rap "oldies." Time hasn't made 
Run-DMC's "Rock Box" any easier to dance to, but people try. 
</P>
<P>
In an incense-scented room off the entrance, a few dozen slower-moving people 
skank methodically to reggae and the funkier types of world music -- island 
versions of the "Ghostbusters" theme -- under a dim, black-light glow. 
Somewhere else, vendors sell African beads, dashikis and all manner of bootleg 
Bart Simpson shirts, also tithing to Justiceville. 
</P>
<P>
The club's flyers, thrust on you at rap shows and underground clubs, specify 
Zulu attire. What constitutes Zulu attire? Well, anything really: tight body 
shirts and biker shorts, if you can get away with them, polka dots or bold 
stripes, berets, Egyptian toques, clean college sweat shirts, big hoop 
earrings, overalls with one strap hanging off the shoulder, or a tight dress. 
"Anything but jeans and T-shirts, really," Islam said. "A peaceful attitude 
extends to peaceful attire." 
</P>
<P>
United Nations -- whatever its location -- is the place to wear that special 
saffron-and-scarlet Nefertiti gown. If you're a rapper yourself, or know one, 
you might wear a black cap with your crew name or a sports emblem on it; if 
you're a Japanese tourist, you'll wear many yards of West African kinte cloth, 
maybe a blouse-like dashiki with wildly contrasting bloomers, because that's 
what it says to do in the magazines. Leather Afrika medallions, Rastabart 
shirts and anything red, black and green. 
</P>
<P>
Late most nights, Islam takes over the turntables, and he layers bits of songs, 
speeding some up, kicking a short phrase from turntable to turntable so the 
groove seems to last forever. When you're dancing, you may not notice Big Daddy 
Kane asking, "Won't you be my beefaroni" until the sixth or seventh repetition. 
</P>
<P>
"Whassup," says a young black man to the big Samoan with ceremonial braids. The 
young man adjusts his L.A. Kings cap, then sweeps across the club, people 
nodding in recognition, and disappears into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Later he pops up in a corner of the room, doing a credible imitation of someone 
who has stuck his finger into an electric socket, jerking to a Cool Rob G tune, 
and a circle forms around him. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour or so, when the break dancers are exhausted and the hangers-on 
are bored, a skinny kid jumps into the circle, falls face first, catching 
himself at ground level, and launches into a complicated whirl, flipping and 
vaulting and tucking his legs in a spectacular display. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, a couple of dancers rush him, and boom, Zulu security hustles them out 
the back door in seconds, before anyone realizes what's happened. Even in a 
club dedicated to peace and unity, the real world sometimes intrudes.
