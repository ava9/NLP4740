So what's wrong with perfection? It was certainly on offer at Wembley on
Wednesday when Paul Simon brought his Born at the Right Time tour to the
capital. Here was musicianship of consummate skill; here catchy songs of
four decades, which stretch from the homesick musings of an American in
Wigan, where Simon wrote 'Homeward Bound', to a joyous celebration of the
'world music' which Simon has almost single handledly popularised; here was
an orchestrated performance which would have won the approval of the
military. And here were quite a few yawns.
For everything on stage was as sanitised and well behaved as the audience,
which sat in awestruck wonder for an hour before finally rising as a man to
'You can call me Al'. Simon was so pleased to have broken the spell that he
played the song twice.
From then on the tingle level rose steadily and by the time he had shed his
baker's dozen of supporting musicians, shouldered his guitar, and stepped
back in time three decades for the songs of his youth, you could accept his
old fashioned standards.
Simon does not come across as a member of the monster raving looney party.
He is a stocky, immobile figure in black suit and T-shirt. He obviously took
pleasure in the enjoyment of the audience but he equally obviously rules his
band with a rod of iron. Since they are mainly uninhibted African musicians,
including five percussionists, it rather hints at a party which never really
starts.
But few musicians have given so much to popular music as Simon and he is
still experimenting, not only with his dashes into Soweto and Salvador for
the rhythms for his last two albums, but also in his repackaging of chewed
over chestnuts like 'Bridge over troubled water', here revived to a reggae
beat.
This was a concert rather than a show, with no screen to magnify the tiny
star, and with an array of musical hardware on stage which severely
inhibited scope for movement. Not that there was much desire to dance - to
sway, yes, to 'Graceland'; to re-live pretty songs like 'Still crazy' and
poignant songs, like 'The Boxer', and to admire the way that Paul Simon has
made pop politically, musically and aesthetically respectable.
But not quite as respectable as Monday night on the same stage when MC
Hammer, the most successful rapper in the world, brought a very bland
version of the art to the UK. He has made money by adapting rap for Middle
America - no 'burn whitey' talk here, more love your neighbourhood cop. MC
is quite without charisma, using the hammer of a non-stop 'posse' of
dancers, singers and musicians to crack some very small nuts.
