FRANCE is proposing to launch discussions with the other four big nuclear
powers on future policies for weapons testing, writes David White, Defence
Correspondent, in Paris.
The talks are expected to take place at ambassador level in Geneva. The
initiative comes as both France and Russia face decisions on whether to
resume underground nuclear tests.
Tests by both countries, as well as by the US and Britain, are currently
subject to a temporary freeze as a result of separate national decisions.
France followed Russia by announcing a one-year moratorium in April. A
recent US bill, reluctantly signed into law by President George Bush,
brought in a nine-month freeze followed by a restricted programme of tests
over the following three years.
After then, as the law now stands, there would be a complete ban on
underground nuclear explosions in the US unless tests are carried out by
other nuclear powers (understood to mean principally Russia).
The US curbs are also binding on Britain, which relies on facilities in the
Nevada desert to test its nuclear warheads. None of the western nuclear
powers favours a complete ban on testing. Defence chiefs of both the US and
Britain have continued to argue that tests are needed to ensure the safety
and reliability of nuclear weapons.
France also wants to bring China into the discussions. Senior French
officials said the initiative was aimed at a 'reflection' on testing
policies in the light of overall security concerns.
