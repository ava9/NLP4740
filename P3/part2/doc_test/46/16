  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed regret Saturday over the underground 
nuclear test China conducted in the Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous 
Region on Friday. 
  In an official statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was 
regrettable that China had again carried out a nuclear test at a 
time when all other major nuclear powers are refraining from 
conducting such tests and as active negotiations have been 
underway for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) since 
January. 
  The Chinese test does not contribute to efforts to maintain 
international peace, it said. 
  The South Korean Government urges all nations that possess 
nuclear weapons to stop testing nuclear devices to ensure early 
conclusion of the CTBT, and to refrain from undertaking any 
action that may have a negative impact on the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, the statement said.
