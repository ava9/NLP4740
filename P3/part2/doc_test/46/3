  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- China conducted an 
underground nuclear test earlier today, a Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here. 
  "China always stands for complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons and, within this context, the 
realization of a comprehensive nuclear test ban," the spokesman 
said. 
  Proceeding from this fundamental position, China has all 
along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and 
the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely 
limited, he said. 
  China fully respects and understands the position and 
concern 
of many non-nuclear weapon states on the question of nuclear 
testing, he said. 
  Right now, the spokesman said, China is actively 
participating in negotiations on a "comprehensive nuclear test 
ban treaty", and supports the conclusion of such a treaty no 
later than 1996 after negotiations. 
  He said the treaty should be a step towards the complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  "We call on other nuclear weapon states to give up their 
policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit 
terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of 
nuclear weapons," he said. 
  "We are ready to make continued unremitting efforts with the 
international community for an early realization of this 
ultimate goal," the spokesman said.
