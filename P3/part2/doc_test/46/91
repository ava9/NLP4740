  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa wants his March 19-21 visit to China to emphasize the 
development of future ties with Japan's neighbor rather than 
dwell too much on the past, government officials said. 
  During the trip that will take him to Beijing and Shanghai, 
Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier 
Li Peng to discuss bilateral and international affairs, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  In Shanghai, he will visit the Pudong development district 
and attend a luncheon hosted by Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. 
  The officials predict that recent exchanges between Japanese 
and Chinese leaders will result in "frank discussions." 
  Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year. 
  Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
met Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in September, and 
Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November. In 
January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month. 
  Officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued 
support for Beijing's market-oriented reforms and backing for 
China's bid to become a member of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  Hosokawa said earlier this week there are no major pending 
issues between the two nations. He cited the signing of a 
bilateral environmental treaty and discussions on North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons as events scheduled 
during the trip. 
  Japan has closely consulted with the United States, South 
Korea and China over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program, agreeing to seek a "diplomatic solution" to the problem. 
  Hosokawa is expected to urge Beijing to continue its efforts 
to persuade Pyongyang to allow international inspections of all 
its nuclear cites to eliminate international concern that it is 
developing nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday 
that North Korea refused to allow IAEA inspectors to conduct 
tests at a laboratory in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers northwest 
of the capital. Washington said a third round of talks with 
Pyongyang, scheduled for Monday, would be postponed because of 
the refusal. 
  Among other topics on the agenda for talks between Hosokawa 
and the Chinese leaders are disarmament and bilateral 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, the officials said. 
  The officials said both sides will confirm that Tokyo and 
Beijing should work together to maintain the free trade system 
in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum while 
taking into account the region's diversity. 
  Japan and China will also seek to increase their dialogue on 
security matters, they said. 
  Hosokawa may be briefed by the Chinese on Sino-U.S. 
relations 
in the wake of last week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, the officials said. In that connection, 
Hosokawa may urge China to take immediate steps to improve its 
human rights record "in a way understandable to the 
international community," according to government sources. 
  Hosokawa is also likely to voice concern over China's 
increasing defense expenditure and call for greater openness or 
"transparency" in its defense budget, the sources said. Last 
week China announced an increase of some 22.4 percent over 1993 
in its defense budget to 52.04 billion yuan (about 653 billion 
yen), up from last year's 42.5 billion yuan (about 533 billion 
yen). 
  The officials said Hosokawa will also call on Beijing to 
institute a permanent ban on nuclear tests and ensure the 
peaceful transition of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. 
China resumed nuclear tests in October. 
  Hosokawa also plans to offer an apology over Japan's wartime 
atrocities by citing examples of such actions by the Japanese 
Imperial Army, but the specific wording has yet to be worked 
out, sources close to the prime minister said. 
  Hosokawa is also expected to tell the Chinese side what kind 
of projects Japan is interested in extending yen loans for from 
fiscal 1996. The Chinese Government has not yet given Japan an 
official list of projects it wants the loans to cover. 
  Under the environment cooperation treaty to be signed during 
Hosokawa's visit, Japan will provide China with technology to 
combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in the wake of 
China's rapid industrialization the officials said. 
  In the cultural field, Hosokawa is to pledge Japanese 
financial cooperation to restore Sheyuan Palace in the ancient 
capital of Xian, the officials said.
