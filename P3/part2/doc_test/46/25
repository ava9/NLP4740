  [Text] Geneva, March 31 (TASS) -- Talks on complete and 
universal nuclear test-ban began "in a good tempo". "Of course, 
we would like to move toward our goal more swiftly, but, since 
this forum is multilateral and positions of all the states have 
to be taken into account, one may say that the start was good 
enough," Grigory Berdennikov, permanent Russian representative 
to the United Nations, commented om the results of the first 
meeting of the annual session of UN conference on disarmament, 
which concluded here on Thursday. 
  Participants in the conference worked out a convention on 
prohibition of chemical weapons in 1992 and in January 1994 
proceeded to prepare a multilateral agreement on complete 
nuclear test-ban. 
  Although the UN General Assembly unanimously supported the 
idea of beginning such multilateral talks in December 1993, 
representatives of 37 member states which participate in the 
conference are fully aware that they will have to face many 
stumbling blocks on their way to mutual accord. Control over 
the would-be agreement poses a most difficult problem. 
  Discussions on total test-ban have been going on for 
decades. 
The treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in the atmosphere, in 
outer space and under water, signed in Moscow in 1963, was a 
landmark agreement. 
  Russian participants in the Geneva meeting proposed that 
this 
treaty and other international agreements form a basis for 
defining the sphere of application of the would-be agreement on 
complete and universal nuclear test-ban, which should include a 
ban on underground nuclear-weapon tests. 
  They declared for interminable and indiscriminate nature of 
the treaty, for equality of rights and responsibilities of all 
the parties. 
  In Russia's opinion, an effective mechanism of international 
control over the treaty is needed; not only the nuclear powers, 
but also the countries, which are capable of creating nuclear 
weapons, should get involved. 
  Russia declared also for envisaging strict measures to be 
taken against violators, including the sanctions specified in 
the UN charter. 
  How much time will it take to work out the document? The 
Chinese representatives believe, that the work may be completed 
by 1996. 
  "In our opinion, it would be better to accelerate (the 
procedures) and coordinate, at least, major provisions by the 
spring of 1995, that is, before the conference on the treaty of 
nuclear non-proliferation begins," Berdennikov told ITAR-TASS. 
  "So far, there is no standard wording (of the would-be 
agreement). We hope, that it will be worked out in the 
forthcoming sessions. To this effect, however, we shall have to 
pass through the current preliminary stage, when the 
participants state their positions," he concluded. 
  The session of the UN conference on disarmament is to resume 
its work in Geneva next May.
