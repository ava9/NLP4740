FT  02 JUN 93 / Clinton in firing line over future of nuclear testing: A
moratorium expiry

OPPONENTS of nuclear testing are preparing for a last-minute battle to win
over President Bill Clinton as he nears a decision on whether to resume test
explosions when a nine-month moratorium expires on July 1.
Senior US officials, backed by the UK government, have made a preliminary
recommendation for a resumption of testing but President Clinton is under
strong pressure from leading members of Congress - both Republicans and
Democrats - to extend the moratorium.
Under the terms of a law passed by Congress last year, against the
opposition of then President George Bush, the US may make up to 15
underground tests to improve the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons
over the next three years.
Nuclear tests would be completely banned thereafter, unless another country
conducts its own tests.
The administration has abandoned any thought of challenging the full ban
from 1996 onwards, but the decision on whether to resume testing over the
next three years appears to be more finely balanced.
While the US Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories
enthusiastically favour a resumption of tests - and the arms control and
disarmament agency, an autonomous agency within the US government, argues
keenly against - the Pentagon and the State Department are less forthright.
The disagreements have already delayed any possible tests until much later
this year, because the legislation requires the president to give Congress
90 days' notice of his plans.
On the sidelines of the debate are the UK, which uses the US test site in
Nevada and is therefore in effect bound by Mr Clinton's decision, and
France, which started what has become almost a general moratorium by the
nuclear powers but is eager to resume tests at Mururoa, in the South
Pacific, to complete the modernisation of its nuclear arsenal.
Russia, which has not exploded a nuclear bomb since October 1990, is also
watching; it would like to continue the moratorium but says it will align
itself on the policy adopted by the other nuclear powers - although it no
longer has access to the test site in Kazakhstan.
China has not signed the moratorium; it detonated a nuclear bomb estimated
at one megaton last May, and is reported to be preparing another 150-kiloton
test.
The Senate coalition against the resumption of testing is particularly
muscular, being led by Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority
leader, Senator James Exon, a senior Democrat from Nebraska, and Senator
Mark Hatfield, top Republican on the crucial spending committee.
Test opponents have been encouraged by some of Mr Clinton's remarks to them
in recent weeks, and are pressing for a full meeting to discuss the issue.
Those who advocate more tests say more work is needed on missile safety,
particularly for the Trident II D-5 submarine-launched missile, which a
commission headed by Professor Sidney Drell of Stanford University said
posed a threat because its plutonium warhead core is surrounded by
vulnerable high-explosive and propellant.
Test opponents say that to stop now could save perhaps Dollars 30m to
Dollars 60m per test, and help Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who can
ill-afford the cost, to fend off the demands of his own military-industrial
establishment to resume testing.
What is most important, they argue, is that a resumption of nuclear testing
by the big powers would undercut efforts to win support for renewal of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is to expire in 1995, and could only
encourage countries such as North Korea and Iran to move ahead in their
attempts to acquire nuclear weapons technology.
'If we are testing when the NPT review conference meets, even if we are
negotiating a comprehensive test ban, there would be a perception of
cynicism by the superpowers,' says Mr Jack Mendelsohn of the Arms Control
Association, a Washington-based disarmament think tank.
If Mr Clinton does decide to go ahead with further tests, arms control
advocates are urging, as a fallback position, that testing should at least
be halted before the NPT review in 1995.
