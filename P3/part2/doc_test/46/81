  [Text] In a joint statement on nuclear non-proliferation, 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have asked India and 
Pakistan to be a part of the multilateral talks aimed at 
"transforming the subcontinent into a nuclear-free zone". While 
Mr. Clinton's crusading zeal to keep Asia tethered on the other 
side of the nuclear divide is old hat, the surprise package is 
Mr. Yeltsin's adoption of Mr. Clinton's preachy role -- to India 
and Pakistan -- on missile and nuclear non-proliferation. No 
doubt, Mr. Yeltsin is toeing the American line, but it is 
totally at variance -- therefore, the surprise -- with the more 
guardedly prudent stand of the former Soviet Union, which had 
not publicly joined the London Club on the nuclear issue. And, 
therefore, tactfully avoided pressing India too hard on the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. Mr. Yeltsin apparently has no 
such compunctions in joining the Big-League in its 
discriminatory attitude of keeping the Third World away from 
nuclear technology. India's reluctance to do so is a morally 
justifiable one. While she has not balked at the prospect of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty coming into force in 1996, India 
has taken exception to the regional pressure that is being 
applied on her to accept the NPT, or its regional variation 
cobbled together by Islamabad and Washington. The position 
taken by the presidents of America and Russia makes little sense 
if the nuclear weapons powers continue to exercise their 
prerogative of testing and developing their nuclear arsenals. A 
vapid declaration of "no first use" sounds even sillier, if also 
discriminatory, when the U.S. in particular laughs at any 
suggestion of a global ban on nuclear testing as a first step 
towards eliminating all nuclear weapons. The "have's", it would 
appear, are not so susceptible to U.S. pressures on nuclear 
disarmament, and can with impunity cock a snook at Uncle Sam's 
vain glorious threats of applying economic sanctions on those 
found guilty of testing. China exploded her nuclear device with 
aplomb; and North Korea unequivocally showed that "tough 
measures" just would not work. But what of the U.S. indulgences 
that have been responsible for furnishing Israel's "clandestine 
nuclear arsenal," and of overlooking Pakistan's boast of 
possessing military nuclear capability? Mr. Clinton and Mr. 
Yeltsin would do well to desist from feeding us such pious 
homilies on NPT, and revise their opinions on what India should, 
or should not, do. India's security imperatives -- surrounded as 
she is with nuclear warheads cutting a wide swathe from the 
Central Asian Republics to the Indian Ocean and eastwards in 
China -- demand a certain policy. There should be global action 
for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Pakistan's premier 
Benazir Bhutto has said that her country will not roll back its 
nuclear programme "under any circumstances". Surely, there is a 
limit to which India can be pushed.
