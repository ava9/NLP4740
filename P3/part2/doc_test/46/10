  [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, addressing a press conference here this 
afternoon, stated that a complete nuclear test ban should be 
established through negotiations. 
  Asked about China's attitude towards such a policy, Li said 
that while China is a nuclear country, its nuclear weapons take 
up only a very small portion of the world's total. 
  ``China has initiated the proposition of not using nuclear 
weapons first and not resorting to threats with nuclear 
weapons,'' he noted. 
  He pointed out that the Chinese Government always stands for 
a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons, and for the realization of a complete nuclear test ban 
in such a context. 
  Towards that aim, he said: ``the Chinese Government holds 
that it is of positive significance to reach a pact on a 
complete nuclear test ban through negotiations.'' 
  He added that China has stated clearly that it would work 
towards reaching such a treaty in 1996. 
  ``At the moment, China is positively participating in 
negotiations on a complete nuclear test ban of the Geneva 
Disarmament Conference,'' he said.
