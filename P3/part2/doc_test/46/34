<F P=106> [Article signed "SM/AZ": "Disarmament Conference in Geneva </F>
Heads Toward Stopping All Nuclear Tests"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva 30 Mar (ATS) -- Nuclear tests have been 
partially prohibited since 1963. The Disarmament Conference 
devoted most of its winter session, which ended in Geneva on 
Wednesday [30 March], to drawing up a treaty that would prohibit 
all nuclear tests. The stage of declaring good intentions is 
now past, and a treaty could be ready within the next 12 to 18 
months, affirmed Mexican Ambassador Miguel Marin-Bosch. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch, who is the chairman of the committee 
responsible for negotiating such an agreement reiterated that 
since the signature of the Treaty of Moscow in 1963 -- banning 
nuclear tests within the atmosphere, in extra-atmospheric space, 
and underwater -- more than 2,000 nuclear tests had been carried 
out by the United States and the former USSR. Both these 
countries, along with Great Britain, are signatories to the 
agreement on a partial stop to tests. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch underlined that a treaty prohibiting all 
nuclear tests constituted a "very important" part of a universal 
regime aimed at nuclear non-proliferation. In particular, this 
regime involves negotiations on certain fissile materials, and 
an agreement protecting those countries which have no nuclear 
weapons. 
<H5>  Ratified by 160 Countries </H5>
  Some 160 countries have now ratified the treaty partially 
banning nuclear tests. Moreover, the United States and Russia 
have decided on a moratorium of their underground tests, 
prolonged until 1995. Great Britain is de facto applying the 
same rule. 
  For France, President Francois Mitterrand stated that his 
country would also observe a moratorium for as long as he 
remained president. China may shortly go ahead with a test in 
the atmosphere. However, when deciding on its moratorium, the 
United States probably estimated that fresh Chinese tests would 
not undermine their technological progress, asserted Mr. 
Marin-Bosch.
