  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has called upon 
the government and the opposition to negotiate their political 
differences and sort out the important critical issues facing 
the nation. In an interview last night, he said what is needed 
now is for both sides to sit together and evolve a joint 
strategy to reach a consensus on such major issues as Kashmir, 
the nuclear program, and economic stability. 
  Refuting the opposition's allegation that he is biased, the 
president said he resigned from the Pakistan People's Party 
following his election as president because of an evident 
polarization in the country's political environment. Sardar 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said the country's political structure 
is such that nobody can bargain on important issues of national 
interest. Matters relating to the country's security and 
economic affairs are fully under the government's control. 
  On the nuclear program, the president said that Pakistan's 
nuclear program is peaceful. He added that Pakistan has made 
several proposals to India, including the creation of a 
nuclear-weapons-free zone in South Asia. The president asked 
the United States and the United Nations to take note of India's 
expanding missile program, which could start a regional missile 
race. 
  Answering a question, the president said the armed forces 
played their role in conducting free and fair elections and they 
are in favor of democracy in the country. 
  On the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution [giving 
discretionary powers to the president to dismiss the government 
and dissolve the National Assembly], the president said he has 
expressed his desire to abrogate it many times.
