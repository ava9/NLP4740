  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto have appealed to the Afghan 
president, Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani; the prime minister, 
Engineer Golboddin Hekmatyar; and all other political parties in 
Afghanistan to cease hostilities and observe a permanent 
cease-fire effective from 0600 on Friday [14 January] morning. 
The appeal has been made by the Pakistani leaders being 
encouraged by positive response to Pakistan's earlier request 
for a temporary cease-fire and keeping in view the brotherly 
ties existing between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is also 
based on a (?view) to restoring peace and stability in 
Afghanistan. All Afghan parties have further been urged not to 
resume hostilities until the Islamic Conference Organization and 
friendly countries have had a full opportunity to effect 
conciliation and to resolve their differences. 
  Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Ms. Benazir Bhutto have 
noted with alarm the situation in Afghanistan over the last 10 
days and the resort to force by contending parties which have 
resulted in the tragic loss of life and large-scale destruction 
of property. In order to alleviate the sufferings of Afghan 
brothers and sisters affected by the recent hostilities, 
Pakistan has extended immediate humanitarian aid containing 
medicines and fully equipped field hospitals. These will be 
sent to Afghanistan as soon as the cease-fire is agreed. 
Pakistan is already actively participating in relief facilities 
for displaced Afghans who have left Kabul.
