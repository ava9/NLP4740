<F P=106> [Article by M.D. Nalapat: "Debate Over Prime Minister's U.S. </F>
Trip"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, April 12--During the past month, there 
has been a difference of opinion between the "pragmatists" and 
the "nationalists" over whether the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha 
Rao, should or should not visit the United States at this 
juncture in Indo-U.S. relations. 
  The pragmatists point to the U.S. emergence as India's 
largest trading partner, foreign investor and supplier of 
technology while pressing for an early visit. The "nationalists" 
point to the Pakistan tilt, and now to the F-16s, as reasons why 
Mr Rao should stay at home. 
  According to members of the Prime Minister's official 
family, 
the Prime Minister has plumped for the "pragmatic" line, though 
the exact dates for the trip have "yet to be finalised." In an 
earlier invitation--to which no reply was sent from the Indian 
side--the U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, had suggested May 6 
as a convenient date. A second invitation, brought by the U.S. 
deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, did not specify a 
date. It is this second invitation that has been accepted by Mr 
Rao. 
  The 7 Race Course Road is of the view that the Talbott visit 
"significantly succeeded" in removing the bad taste of the 
earlier remarks of the U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel. 
  During his visit, Mr Talbott did not "press India to make 
concessions on Kashmir," and instead made it clear that the 
United States had no prescription to offer; it was for India and 
Pakistan to resolve their differences by themselves. This stand 
has gone down well with the Prime Minister, as also the explicit 
delinking by Mr Talbott of India and Pakistan on the nuclear 
issue. This is in contrast to the Pakistani stand of linking its 
nuclear policy to India's capabilities. 
  It was considered significant that not just in Delhi, but in 
Islamabad as well, Mr Talbott did not make any statement 
"embarrassing to India." This reticence--in contrast to his 
junior colleague--helped create an atmosphere for acceptance of 
the invitation. 
  According to members of the Prime Minister's official 
family, 
one of the primary objectives of the visit will be to attempt to 
"deter the United States from escalating the arms race in South 
Asia through supply of F-16s to Pakistan. Indeed, this one 
objective by itself makes the trip necessary." 
  During the visit, Mr Rao is expected to lobby against the 
supply of the aircraft not just with the U.S. President but also 
with other members of the U.S. power elite: members of the U.S. 
Congress, academicians in leading think-tanks, and 
representatives of the American media. 
  Mr Rao is expected to make clear that the supply of F-16s 
under pressure from the Lockheed Corporation would lead to an 
immediate response from India, in the form of purchase of fresh 
high-performance aircraft and the deployment of additional 
missile batteries for defense. The PMO [Prime Minister's 
Offixce] is convinced that there will be few takers for the U.S. 
administration line that the F-16s are "almost some kind of toy, 
rather than efficient nuclear weapons carriers." 
  According to the PMO, the decision to go to Washington was, 
apart from the need to pursue every avenue to block the F-16 
deal, taken because of three factors: 

  -  As a signal to the emerging pro-India lobby among U.S. 
business houses that India too is serious about better relations 
with the world's largest economic power, and to establish direct 
contacts with the million-strong Indian community in that 
country. 
  -  To further the process of contacts between various 
levels of U.S. and Indian officialdom. At present, numerous 
contacts are taking place at all levels between India and the 
United States. This process will gain speed after a Prime 
Ministerial visit. 
  -  Because a Democrat administration has been, 
thanks to the lingering Kennedy magic, always perceived as being 
"closer to India" than a Republican one. The PMO "cannot see the 
harm in going to Washington to meet a democrat president, 
especially the one who has already been called on by leaders of 
major countries such as China, Russia, Germany, the U.K. and 
France, not to mention Pakistan." Rather than "sit on a high 
horse," it is better to take advantage of the opportunity "to 
expand the areas of agreement and narrow down the areas of 
friction." 

  It is accepted that there will be some negative political 
fallout from the visit, but this has been taken as being an 
argument for an early visit, in that such a visit would give 
time to contain the fallout before assembly elections fall due 
in November. Thus, barring yet another Raphel-like 
embarrassment, the Prime Minister should be in the United States 
on a four-day visit by May.
