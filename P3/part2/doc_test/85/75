<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pakistan Agrees to Allow U.S. Build </F>
Three Military Bases"] 
  [Text] Islamabad (API)--Pakistan has made an agreement with 
the United States of America to allow it to establish three 
military bases in Siachen, Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir, 
in exchange for resolving the Kashmir issue. General Joseph P. 
Hoover, during his recent visit to Pakistan, has also made a 
list of the possible locations for building these bases, and 
gave that list to Pakistan. The United States and Pakistan will 
sign this pact in March. This information was revealed by PULSE, 
a weekly English newspaper published in Islamabad, through 
information collected from intelligence agencies and diplomatic 
sources. The newspaper reported that the United States, after 
this agreement on building military bases, changed its policy on 
Kashmir, accepting it as a disputed region. The United States 
has included Gilgit, Balistan, Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir, 
and Jammu-Kashmir, as well as the Aksai Chin, now under China's 
control, as part of the disputed region. The United States has 
decided to resolve the disputes of this entire region. The 
newspaper further reported that the intent of the United States 
in signing this pact with Pakistan was to end China's supremacy 
and control Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan's 
Islamic movements. Great Britain will also be used for this 
purpose. The Kashmir Press International, referring to the 
newspaper, said that the U. S. Central Command's 
commander-in-chief, General Joseph P. Hoover [as published], had 
visited Pakistan during caretaker Prime Minister Moin Qureshi's 
time. After Hoover's visit, high Pakistani government officials 
visited the United States and obtained more details about this 
plan. The decision on specific sites for these military bases, 
however, was made by General Hoover during his recent visit, 
when Benazir became prime minister. Hoover also gave a list of 
sites where the bases can be built. PULSE also revealed that a 
few days ago, a U.S. spy plane was hangered in the Islamabad 
airport for a few days. During that time, the plane made several 
flights and inspected the proposed sights. Both countries will 
sign an agreement on this plan at the end of March, and in the 
beginning of April, the United States will begin cooperating 
with Pakistan at the international level to resolve the Kashmir 
issue. According to the newspaper, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's recent reaction to the Kashmir issue was part of this 
plan, and she did this at America's bidding.
