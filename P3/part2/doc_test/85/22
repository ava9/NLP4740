<F P=106> [Editorial:"Nuclear Nonproliferation ... President Leghari's </F>
Categorical Announcement"] 
  [Text] Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan 
correspondent in London, President Farooq Ahamd Khan Leghari has 
said Pakistan will not accept any unilateral restriction on the 
nuclear nonproliferation issue, because a solution that imposes 
restrictions on Pakistan but not on India is unacceptable. We 
want restrictions on the entire world, especially on all 
countries in the region. From the very beginning, Pakistan has 
adhered to a principled and just stand on nuclear 
nonproliferation -- to forcefully support the issue, especially 
to extend all sorts of cooperation to the international 
community in eliminating a nuclear arms race in South Asia -- 
provided India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
at the global level or be prepared to endorse any acceptable 
solution on the issue at the regional level. But, as India is 
crazy to become a mini-superpower in the region, forcing its 
hegemony on other countries, it is bent on rejecting every 
proposal on nuclear nonproliferation which impedes any progress 
in the direction. Now, after Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's visit to the United States, President Clinton himself has 
admitted that India is not willing to extend any cooperation on 
nuclear nonproliferation and human rights issues and has refused 
to accept the U.S. proposals as well. Under these 
circumstances, the sincerity and truthfulness of Pakistan's 
position has come to the foreground that it is not Pakistan 
erecting obstacles in the way of nuclear nonproliferation but 
rather India, which is not prepared to curtail its nuclear 
program at any cost. As long as India does not do it, Pakistan 
is not ready to accept any unilateral restrictions on its 
nuclear program. Now that the differences between India and the 
United States on the nuclear nonproliferation issue could not be 
removed, Pakistan should take advantage of the situation and 
intensify its efforts to convince the United States of the 
soundness of its position so as to get the illegitimate embargo 
on economic and military aid lifted.
