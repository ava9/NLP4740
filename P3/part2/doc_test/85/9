  [Text] Islamabad, May 18 -- As President Farooq Ahmed 
Leghari embarked on a two-week "unofficial", but "working" visit 
to the United States, official circles here on Wednesday 
expressed cautious optimism on improvement of bilateral 
relations between Washington and Islamabad. 
  "The delivery of F-16s to Pakistan and the issue of 
non-intrusive inspection of our nuclear facilities by the United 
States, will possibly come under review during President Farooq 
Leghari's deliberations with the Clinton Administration," 
Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told newsmen. 
  In the light of India's refusal to the US proposals on its 
nuclear non-proliferation Sardar Asif was asked to clarify 
Pakistan's position on its acceptance of nuclear "non-intrusive" 
inspection. He said: "If the US proposals are acceptable to 
Pakistan and are totally in line with our nuclear policy, we 
will accept them." 
  Would Pakistan then be accepting them unilaterally, given 
the 
fact that India had already rejected all such American 
proposals? The Foreign Minister was unable to give a 
satisfactory reply. 
  Conceding that the "United States through its non-intrusive 
technical means was satisfied that Pakistan had not as yet 
produced nuclear weapons," the Foreign Minister listed recent 
positive developments which indicated a renewed US understanding 
of Pakistan's stated position on its nuclear programme, which 
was now more "even-handed." 
  "The fact that the United States has not asked us to roll 
back our nuclear programme, but to cap it instead, and its 
viewing of the non-proliferation issue in the context of 
regional security," puts Pakistan on a "high moral ground", as 
opposed to India, who has bluntly refused the US proposals on 
capping and verifiable physical or nonphysical inspection of its 
nuclear sites, he said. 
  The Foreign Minister was confident about Pakistan would not 
only get the 38 F-16s but also succeed in resolving the nuclear 
issue with the United States by the end of this year. "But, our 
view on receipt of F-16s and capping of our nuclear programme is 
very clear: the two have nothing to do with each other," Sardar 
Asif pointed out. 
  On the downside of US-Pakistan relations, Sardar Asif, 
reacting sharply to the American State Department spokesman, 
Mike McCurry's statement on alleged official Pakistani support 
to the Kashmiri Mujahideen and that Pakistan could be put on the 
terrorist list any time, said: "We are extremely surprised that 
a senior official should make such an allegation against 
Pakistan. It leads us to believe that these kinds of statements 
are made perhaps to please Mr Narasimha Rao." 
  Sardar Asif said the Western world was bending backwards to 
please the Indian Prime Minister. "Selling cokes appears more 
important than solving the human rights problems," he remarked 
in reply to a question about the West disregarding India's human 
rights violations in lieu of economic trade-offs. 
  Sardar Asif, who leaves for Afghanistan on May 24 carrying 
peace proposals for the Afghan leaders, told newsmen that apart 
from re-opening the Pakistan mission in Kabul in the building 
the British government has partly handed over, he will discuss 
the possibility of opening another mission in Herat with General 
Ismail Khan. 
  The foreign minister will float the idea for an Afghanistan 
peace making fund, because when normality is restored, 
Afghanistan will need a lot of money for reconstruction.
