MS Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, strengthened her political
position yesterday with the victory of Mr Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari in the
weekend's presidential elections, Farhan Bohkari reports from Islamabad.
Mr Leghari, one of Ms Bhutto's most trusted lieutenants who became the
foreign minister after last month's national elections, won by a large
margin over his main contender, Mr Wasim Sajjad, the acting president.
Mr Leghari polled 274 votes against Mr Sajjad's 168 in Saturday's voting.
Legislators from Pakistan's four provinces, the national assembly in
Islamabad and senate, all took part in the vote.
Under Pakistan's constitution, the president has wide constitutional powers
including those of sacking prime ministers and dissolving elected
legislatures.
The results were welcomed by many business leaders. Stock prices on the
Karachi stock exchange, Pakistan's leading stock market, yesterday rose by
43 points - almost 2.5 per cent, as investors and brokers bought heavily,
hoping that Ms Bhutto's government was now in a stronger position with Mr
Leghari's election.
