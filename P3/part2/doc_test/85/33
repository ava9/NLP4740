  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Leghari has said that 
Pakistan has no intention of interfering in Afghanistan's 
internal affairs, but it is ready to play a role for peace there 
with the consent of the Afghan leaders. He was talking to the 
Afghan president's special emissary, Engineer Ahmad Shah 
Ahmedzai, who apprised the president about the latest situation 
in Afghanistan. 
  Expressing deep concern at the present crisis in 
Afghanistan, 
Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that the entire Islamic 
world, including Pakistan, is anguished at the outbreak of 
fighting in Afghanistan. He said that is why he and Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto have appealed to all the Afghan 
groups to observe a cease-fire to provide an opportunity to 
friendly countries to forge an agreement between the rival 
groups. The president urged the Afghan leaders to adopt the 
path of dialogue to end their differences peacefully for the 
sake of preserving Afghanistan's territorial integrity. 
  Reports say fighting resumed in the Afghan capital Kabul 
this 
morning after an overnight lull. A spokesman of Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar has reported further aerial attacks and 
artillery shelling.
