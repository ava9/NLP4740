<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pulling the United States"] </F>
  [Text] There was a time when European rulers frequently 
used to refer to the phrase "the white man's burden." Those 
were the days of imperialism. By this burden they meant the 
black people of Africa and Asia. These colonial rulers 
considered themselves the guardian of the black people. It is 
true that these blacks were a cause of anxiety for their white 
masters. Although those days are gone, there is no reason to 
heave a sigh of relief. At present, the two neighboring 
countries in the Indian subcontinent, which have become engaged 
in a dispute over the Kashmir issue, are willing to accept the 
United States as a mediator to resolve the discord. This 
reminds us of the bygone days of imperialism. Benazir Bhutto is 
pulling one hand of President Clinton while the other is being 
pulled by Narasimha Rao. This is a matter of great delight for 
President Clinton as the United States wants to be the only 
protector of the world. What consolation or satisfaction does 
Islamabad or New Delhi gain by doing all this? What special 
gains do they expect by calling upon the United States to 
mediate their dispute? The finance committee chairman of the 
U.S. Senate and former U.S. ambassador to India, Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, was told by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao that all 
bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan should be resolved 
in accordance with the Shimla Agreement. He also urged the 
United States compel Pakistan to sit down for a dialogue to 
resolve this issue. On the other hand, Pakistan is saying that 
the situation in Kashmir is gradually becoming explosive. It 
wants the United States to exert pressure upon India so that an 
early settlement is reached on this issue. 
  It must be said that a big game is being played with the 
Kashmir issue. If New Delhi wants to inform the world community 
about the involvement of Pakistan in the militancy in Kashmir, 
it should do this work properly and stop issuing contradictory 
statements. Otherwise, this country will have to face a lot of 
miseries. It should be admitted that Indian diplomacy has 
failed to deal properly with the Kashmir issue and Pakistan is 
taking advantage of this situation. Pakistan is using the 
United Nations and the Islamic Conference Organization to 
achieve their designs. It is also approaching anti-Indian 
officials in the U.S. administration and pleading for the 
protection of human rights in Kashmir. India has done the right 
thing by rejecting the offer given by the Islamic Conference 
Organization to mediate in this issue. As Jammu and Kashmir is 
a state of India, the sovereignty of the country would have been 
violated had India accepted this proposal. It should also be 
realized by India that this is not the proper time to take a 
stubborn attitude on this issue. India should soften its stand 
and see whether the allegations of human rights violations is 
true or not. It would be wise to soften the Indian stand under 
international or U.S. pressure. There is nothing wrong in 
saying that India will not accept the illegal demands and evil 
designs of Pakistan. At the same time no one should be allowed 
to think that the attitude of India is self-contradictory.
