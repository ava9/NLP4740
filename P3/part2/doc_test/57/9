Holland &amp; Holland, the Mayfair gun-makers bought by Chanel in 1989, has
appointed a Frenchman to the position of chief executive and chairman.
Alain Drach, 43, is not from Chanel, but otherwise Holland &amp; Holland seems
to know astonishingly little about its new boss. He has a marketing
background and has run a famous French shoot - which just happens to belong
to the Wertheimer family that owns Chanel.
New deputy chairman is the managing director Roger Mitchell - who contended
at the time of the French acquisition, which caused something of a stir
among the gunmaker's gentrified patrons, that 'we will remain an English
firm under English management'.
Stock Exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who has chaired Holland &amp;
Holland for the past four and a half years, moves to the sidelines as
non-executive chairman of the holding company.
While Holland &amp; Holland patted itself on the back over the Chanel deal,
which cost the perfume-makers Pounds 10.9m, the company - where a pair of
Royal 12-bore tooled by its mastercraftsmen start in excess of Pounds 56,000
 -has subsequently been hard hit by the recession. It may also have been
affected by the recent successful entry of Asprey into the hand-made gun
market - even if one country gent describes the latter's weapons as vulgar
enough to frighten away any pheasant.
'The company remains quintessentially English and few, if any, Holland &amp;
Holland customers are even aware that it is no longer an independent
company,' is the parting shot of the London spokeswoman.
