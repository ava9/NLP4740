In July, 1942, the Navy opened its ranks to women. The female recruits were 
known as WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service), the idea being 
that the women could perform tasks here while the men were sent off to fight. 
Oceanside resident Luella May Holland, wanting to do her part for the war 
effort, joined the Naval Reserve in May, 1943, from Chicago, with her parent's 
permission because she was only 20. Holland studied radio and was stationed in 
Santa Ana for most of the war, where she met her soon-to-be husband, Bill 
Holland, at the Santa Ana base. Last May she founded WAVES of North County, 
which meets every other month for members to trade experiences. Holland 
discussed the war and her adjustment to the regimented life style with Times 
staff writer Terry Rather in her Oceanside home. Don Bartletti photographed 
her.

 It was a different world then. This was war, our country was at war. We had 
been bombed at Pearl Harbor, and you just wanted to do your part. Right at the 
beginning of the war, women couldn't go in. So, when they opened it up for 
WAVES, I just started percolating to get on in and do something. The patriotism 
everyone felt in those days is so different from now. 
</P>
<P>
I expected boot camp to be rough because I heard the fellows talking about it. 
But I didn't realize how rough it would be for me to adjust to it, for all of 
us to adjust to it. The instant you went to boot camp, you had a huge culture 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't know what to expect. The officers told us when we first got there, 
"As long as you're here, except on the weekends, if you look around and you're 
alone, you're in the wrong place." I'm sure it's still something of a shock to 
people going in. 
</P>
<P>
After having been a free agent all my life, in radio school I had absolutely no 
free time. We had a few hours on Friday and Saturday night until midnight and 
Sunday until 9 p.m. The rest of the time you're in the barracks, or studying. 
It was very demanding, physically, emotionally and mentally. None of us had 
ever studied anything like radio. We had tests every weekend, and if you didn't 
pass, you were out. Lights out may have been 9:30, but many of us studied under 
our blankets with a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
For day-to-day living that was it, and that was rather confining. We worked 
close to the fellows, but it wasn't like you might imagine. Here you are in the 
midst of a bunch of men, you'd think you'd be dating and having parties. You 
weren't. You were working, and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
But I enjoyed the feeling of being in the thick of it. I didn't particularly 
enjoy the regimentation, the you do what the Navy says whether you like it or 
not. That part I could do without. But, for what I did, when I did it, I 
wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world. You felt well, until the 
war's over, I'm going to do all I can to help. You lived life for today. 
</P>
<P>
When I went in, I had no intention of getting married. The fellow I married, 
Bill Holland, had been overseas for the war. Then he came back to the states to 
Santa Ana, where we worked together. We worked through these long nights 
together in the radio room, so we became very well acquainted. He asked me to 
marry him still early in our relationship. We had been dating for two months, 
so we agreed to be engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Then we found out they were going to ship a whole lot of fellows from the base 
overseas. We thought, hey, we could get some leave for a honeymoon if we get 
married now, so why not do it now? We were married Dec. 29, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I didn't really think in terms of where we would live, how many 
children we would have, how's he going to make a living for us. We didn't think 
like that. We didn't know how long the war would last. When we got married, the 
war seemed to be stretching into infinity. So you kind of lived for today, 
enjoyed what you can for today and let tomorrow take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, it was a complete switch for everyone in the war, including the 
men as well as the women. "Oh boy, its over, let's get back to civilian life!" 
</P>
<P>
The WAVES of North County was started last May, so we former WAVES can get 
together and talk about those days. We consider ourselves kind of dinosaurs, we 
date so far back. Nobody can really share our reminiscing unless they were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone says what a great experience it was being in the WAVES. We don't know 
if we'd do it again, but it sure was great then. We enjoyed the feeling of 
participation, being part of what was going on. It was a bad time for America, 
but it was very exciting times. It was all devoted to the war effort, to 
getting the war over.
