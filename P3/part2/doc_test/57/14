Arthur J. Holland, mayor of Trenton, N.J. for nearly three decades and recent 
president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, died Thursday of cancer in a 
Trenton hospital. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Holland ended his term as president of the conference in June, 
the nationwide group gave him its highest honor, the Distinguished Public 
Service Award. Previous recipients included Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey 
and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Holland had announced last June that, because of inoperable lung and liver 
cancer, he would not seek reelection but would remain in office as long as 
physically possible. His term ends next June. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning his public service career in Trenton's Department of Public 
Affairs in 1951, Holland was first elected mayor in 1959, when the city still 
had a commission form of government. He had served continuously since then, 
except for four years after he failed to win reelection in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
In his four years out of office, Holland served as adjunct research professor 
in the Urban Studies Center at Rutgers University, acting city manager of 
nearby Passaic, N.J., and consultant to the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, the Brookings Institution and the National Institute of 
Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the versatile mayor wrote a children's book, "The Adventures of Bernie 
Bean," about a happy Mexican jumping bean who travels from Manhattan to Paris 
and then winds up living in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
A respected national spokesman for the urban poor, Holland enjoyed talking with 
inner-city children. To demonstrate his commitment to civil rights, in 1964 the 
mayor moved his family into a racially mixed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush took office last January, Holland optimistically sought $6 
billion for U.S. cities through Urban Development Action Grants, law 
enforcement assistance, money for the homeless, clean-water construction 
grants, and funding for child care and youth education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a mayor," he explained of his wish list, "is to live in hope." 
</P>
<P>
Holland was born Oct. 24, 1918, in Trenton and earned his bachelor's degree in 
social studies and a master's degree in public administration from Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic, he spent six years at a seminary, but did not enter the 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, during his first term as mayor, Holland married Elizabeth Anne 
Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year against Rep. Christopher 
H. Smith (R-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife and their three sons and two daughters.
