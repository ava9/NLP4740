  [Text] The largest seizure of cocaine in the UK, valued at 
250 million pounds sterling, was found in drums of bitumen on 
its way from South America to Poland, it was disclosed today. 
  The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were 
discovered in a consignment of 48 drums by officers who searched 
a ship when it called in at Birkenhead, Merseyside, on January 
24. 
  Customs officers removed the cocaine and substituted other 
drums on board the Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which was 
en route from Venezuela to Poland, and tracked it to Gdynia 
hoping to identify the smugglers, chief investigations officer 
Douglas Tweddle said today. 
  One man is being interviewed by Polish police after the 
drums 
were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw on 
February 3, but customs officers were not able to identify the 
Western European figures behind the deal. 
  Mr. Tweddle said: "This massive seizure confirms 
intelligence 
reports that the South American `narco barons' are targeting 
cocaine shipments on Western Europe and are seeking to use South 
American countries as a back door. 
  "We are delighted to have been able to work with the Polish 
authorities to inflict this major blow on these drug 
traffickers." 
  Customs believe some of the cocaine would have filtered on 
to 
the streets of the UK. 
  Forty officers were involved in Operation Ayala, named after 
a racehorse which ran in the Grand National. 
  Customs identified the shipping route from South America to 
former Soviet states as a likely path for cocaine shipments. 
  Based on that intelligence they decided to carry out an 
intensive search of the MV Jurata's load. The crew of the ship 
were not involved and the substitute drums were sent on 
unnoticed. 
  It is the second large seizure of cocaine being routed by 
the 
South American cartels to Poland. UK customs tipped off Polish 
authorities about another consignment which led to 520 kilos of 
cocaine being seized in Poland. 
  Suspicion had fallen on 48 barrels of bitumen found in the 
drums. The first one was genuine but the other 47 had inner 
containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine. 
  They had been insulated to protect the drugs from the heat 
of 
the bitumen. 
  Mr. Tweddle said in early January they had been able to 
identify a separate consignment travelling direct from South 
America to Poland which enabled the authorities there to seize 
520 kilos of cocaine. 
  The two operations meant the authorities had prevented two 
tonnes of cocaine with a UK street value of 400 million pounds 
sterling flooding on to the western European market. 
  "There is little doubt some of it would have ended up in 
Britain, probably via Germany and Holland. We hope this success 
will act as a catalyst for further ones in the future," Mr. 
Tweddle said at the Customs House in London. 
  He said the Jurata was a "tramp steamer" which had stopped 
off at Birkenhead to unload some legitimate cargo. It had then 
stopped at Hamburg before completing its journey to Poland. 
  The seizure was the largest, not only in the UK, but also in 
central and eastern Europe. There have been bigger hauls in 
Spain and Holland. 
  "With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Customs 
services in central and eastern Europe are not particularly well 
developed and traffickers see places like Poland and Russia as 
an easy back door to western Europe," he said. 
  The previous biggest UK haul -- 907 kilos -- was discovered 
two years. [sentence as received]
