MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the loss-making builder of sheltered housing for the
elderly, was optimistic about prospects in the property market in spite of
revealing deeper losses of Pounds 6.9m for the six months to February 29.
Mr Kevin Holland, sales director, said all the elements of recovery were in
place, following the end of political uncertainty in the UK and the demise
of many competitors during the recession. Sales for March, normally a slow
month, were double those of last year, he said.
'The marketplace is still difficult, but we have certainly seen a
turnround,' he said. 'It is slightly more alive than dead.'
The stock market was less optimistic about the future, and marked McCarthy's
shares down 14 per cent from 73p to 63p.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.6m - taken above the line - dealt a heavy
blow to the interim results, which compared with pre-tax losses of Pounds
6.4m last time.
The exceptional costs, due to closing a regional office and rationalising
operations, offset the benefits of lower interest charges which fell from
Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 5m.
Bank debt was down from Pounds 87.4m to Pounds 69.2m, following the Pounds
13.3m rights issue last May and tighter control of costs. Gearing stood at
75 per cent.
Turnover for the period was 21 per cent down at Pounds 26.2m. This was the
main reason for the decline in profitability of the UK retirement homes
division, which fell from trading profits of Pounds 700,000 to break-even.
However, a lower average selling price of Pounds 68,500 - compared with
Pounds 68,900 - also contributed to the decline.
Mr Holland said the price fall had been due to a larger proportion of older
stock. He added, however, that new stock was coming on stream at a higher
rate than last year, and would improve margins in the second half.
The French subsidiary incurred losses of Pounds 300,000 during the first
half. Mr Holland said all further investment overseas had been halted.
Losses per share improved from 14.1p to 11.1p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.5p.
