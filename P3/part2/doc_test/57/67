Last week I made some disparaging remarks about the currently dishevelled
condition of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. Now is the moment to make
partial amends by recommending two rewarding exhibitions in the Louvre's
Pavilion de Flore (enter on the Tuileries side by the Porte Jaujard).
You need to move quickly to catch Antonello da Messina's 'Christ at the
Column' which closes on August 9. It will be worth it to see a model of the
kind of small, highly-focused exhibition on which museums should
increasingly be concentrating their resources.
Last year, the Louvre bought 'Christ at the Column' by Antonello, the
15th-century Sicilian master, for FFr42m (Pounds 4.78m). It is a small,
grimly intense painting of the head and shoulders of the weeping Christ, a
noose round his neck. There are only about 40 known paintings by Antonello.
The exhibition traces his contribution to the evolution of the 'Man of
Sorrows' type of single-figure devotional image required by patrons for
private worship. As evidence of Antonello's influence we also see Mantegna's
sublime 'Ecce Homo', borrowed from the Musee Jacquemart Andre.
Pure, undemanding enjoyment is provided by the Louvre's principal show this
summer, French Master Drawings from the Pierpont Morgan Library (until
August 30). The sponsor, JP Morgan &amp; Co., has brought 125 drawings to Paris
to mark 125 years of the House of Morgan's involvement in French financial
life. The Morgan Bank's finest hour in France was 1870 after the country was
on her knees after suffering defeat in the Franco-Prussian war. Alone among
the London banks, Morgan &amp; Co. was prepared to help with a Pounds 10m loan.
Pigeons took documents to and from the blockaded city and one particularly
heavy batch went in by hot air balloon. J. Pierpont Morgan, legendarily
avaricious collector and founder of the Library in New York, adored France
and all things French. In the 1900s he started to amass drawings; more have
since been added to make this one of the finest collections in the US.
Lovely things abound in the exhibition, not least the earliest exhibit, a
remarkable little sketchbook made in about 1400 from wafer-thin sheets of
boxwood. Poussin, Greuze, Claude, and six Watteau drawings of delightful
spontaneity are just a few of the particular pleasures of a selection which
ends with Gauguin and Redon. (The show runs until until August 30 then moves
to the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, September 5 - January 2.)
If you are interested in 19th-century Orientalism I recommend Album de
Voyage at the Musee Hebert. This is the obscure but atmospheric
studio-residence of Ernest Hebert, a grandee of the art scene in late
19th-century France. The exhibition is on until September 27; the museum is
at 85, rue de Cherch-Midi (open from 12.30 on weekdays, closed Tuesdays).
In 1868, six French painters, a photographer and one Dutchman set out on a
five-month journey through the Levant. Two decades after Delacroix's
delirious reaction to the colour, grace and nobility of native life in
Morocco, Orientalist painting was at its peak. Professional artists
descended on the Levant, hungry to sketch, take photographs and buy studio
props.
Sketches, paintings and photographs of the trip have been brought together
from collections in France and the Netherlands. Most of the work which
survives is by Gerome, leader of the trip, and Leon Bonnat. Both were to
become enormously successful academic painters. Whatever one feels about
their full-scale productions, their small oil sketches of landscapes in
Egypt and Palestine are most attractive.
The same cannot be said for the tedious, careful studies of bedouin by the
Dutchman, Willem de Famars Testas. He, too, did well out of the experience
and became the first and premier Orientalist of the Netherlands. His journal
for 1868 was recently discovered and is published (in French) in the
catalogue (FFr280). It appears that the Middle East traveller was not
obliged to rough it. A birthday feast on Mount Sinai cooked by the dragoman
consisted of more than 20 dishes including conserved dishes of artichokes,
turkey, fillet of beef, truffled partridges, chicken, woodcock, and four
different puddings.
Bonapartists will want to revisit the lovely Musee de Malmaison (take the
RER to Grande Arche) where Queen Hortense: An Artistic Woman describes the
joys and sorrows of that lady. Daughter of Empress Josephine and Queen of
Holland, Hortense possessed an above average aptitude for the arts, from
writing novels to musical composition. (Show ends September 27; closed
Tuesday and 12-1.30 daily.)
One final suggestion for your Parisian wanderings; from August 1, the 'Lady
and the Unicorn' tapestries, one of the most famous works of art of the
entire middle ages, will go back on display in a new, halogen-lit
installation at the former Musee Cluny, which now goes by the altogether
less evocative title of Musee du Moyen Age.
