Simply commending JCB, the Midlands based manufacturer of construction
equipment, for winning two Queen's Awards would be only to scratch the
surface of what many in the construction plant sector will undoubtedly
acknowledge is a remarkable achievement.
It is not so much that the company has scooped two Queen's Awards in one
year for the second time - JCB Hydrapower has received an export award for
its mini-excavator range and the backhoe loader division of JC Bamford
Excavators has won a technology award - but more the way it has achieved its
goals.
When JCB Hydrapower entered the mini - excavator market (a segment of the
industry for diggers up to six tonne operating weight) with its own product
in 1989 the news prompted mixed reactions from the competition.
JCB had built its reputation on the success of its now famous backhoe loader
digger. The mini - excavator market, however, was saturated with well -
established brand names, many belonging to Japanese manufacturers which had
built up big sales in their domestic market. By the late 1980s they were
feeding European customers from factories within the Euroepan Union.
But JCB had identified a growth market and the company argued that the mini
 -excavator was a natural extension of the backhoe loader concept, the
cornerstone of the JCB empire.
To attack what was predominantly a Japanese - controlled industry in Europe
JCB moved a small subsidiary, JCB Hydrapower, to its own facility in
Rugeley, Staffordshire, away from the hub of JCB's operations at Rocester,
Staffordshire.
Under the guidance of Mr Martin Coyne, now JCB's group's chief executive, a
single status plant was established and an assembly line laid down in 1988.
The company addressed the largest segment of the UK market first, launching
a 1.4 tonne machine in early 1989. It was robust and simple to operate and
maintain.
'We went for the largest segment of the market to prove our ability and
technology without overstretching our position,' explains Mr Howard
McCallum, JCB Hydrapower's director and general manager.
The company then turned to continental Europe, developing a three tonne
machine in 1991 which would appeal to owner - operators. It also developed
three machines around 1.5 tonne but to higher specifications than the
original unit.
This further enriched the range of machines it could offer into this high
volume market segment which could 'cater for the vastly different tastes in
continental Europe,' says Mr McCallum.
The tactics worked. Total sales in Europe grew from some 14,470 units in
1989 to 20,380 units in 1992 before easing back to around 18,000 last year,
according to London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. And JCB Hydrapower
says that between 1991 and 1993 its market share in Germany grew from 1.3
per cent to 2.6 per cent (the German market peaked at 11,000 units in 1992
according CIG), in France increased from 4 per cent to 7 per cent and rose
marginally in Italy.
During the same period the value of its mini - excavator exports increased
from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 8.3m. The company this year has increased
production from six to 11 machines a day and is changing the factory layout
to triple capacity to 3,000 units a year.
It was the needs of a much smaller market which prompted the group's backhoe
loader division to develop the award winning 4CX 4x4x4 Servoplus. The
machine is a derivative of the equal - sized wheel, all - wheel steer 4CX
which cost around Pounds 4m to develop and was launched three years ago.
A backhoe loader digger, the 4CX combines the stability of a rigid chassis
machine with the manoeuvrability of its articulated competitors through the
introduction of four wheel steer and four wheel drive.
The Servoplus version was developed some 18 months ago at a cost of about
Pounds 250,000. The Servo system itself - joystick controls built into the
armrests which allow the operator to control many functions with fingertip
movements rather than moving levers - is not new but JCB has developed what
it claims is a unique double command servo system which allows the operator
to drive and operate the machine from two standard operating positions.
The machine was developed initially for the demanding conditions experienced
in the Nordic countries, a small but technically sensitive market.
Since the introduction of the Servoplus, JCB's market share in the Nordic
countries has increased from 14 per cent to 25 per cent. Dr Henry Shirman,
managing director of the backhoe loader division, says the Servoplus
machines have generated interest in other technically sensitive but much
larger markets such as Germany, France and North America.
