A sophisticated computer- dating system for pigs has won Cotswold Pig
Development an award for technological achievement.
The Lincolnshire-based company has developed a breeding scheme to speed up
genetic improvement in pigs and produce the consistently leaner, healthier
pork that international markets now demand.
It enables the performance, in terms of speed of growth and litter size, of
the same genes on different farms to be compared for the first time, in
effect separating hereditary and environmental influences. It uses a
statistical technique, best linear unbiased prediction (Blup), which makes
calculations based on detailed computer records kept on each pig's ancestry,
development and habits.
Once ideal mates to produce the next generation have been selected by the
computer, the Cotswold system loses its similarity with blind dating
agencies. Genes with desirable characteristics are brought together through
artificial insemination. This means that genes can be spread around the
country without having to move the animals, making the process much faster.
Dr John Webb, genetics director at Cotswold Pig Development, says that he is
carrying on a long tradition. 'Britain is pig breeder to the world. Britain
invented the science of breeding,' he said. Cotswold has updated what pig
breeders have been doing for centuries, and made the process far more
accurate.
Cotswold is the first livestock company to win a Queen's award for
technological achievement, but according to Dr Webb, the pig breeding
industry is a fertile ground for technological innovation. 'It is a small
industry, high-tech, very competitive, with a very short technology transfer
time. Because it is so competitive, it forces companies to get the
technology in as soon as possible,' he says.
The system which has won Cotswold the award was developed from technologies
which have been available for a long time. 'Really, we have taken two
technologies and married them. One was Blup, the other was artificial
insemination,' says Dr Webb. 'The world has been very slow with many
technologies. They sit on the back burner until somebody finds an
application for them.'
Blup itself was invented in the US 20 or more years ago and originally
applied to cattle breeding. As cows produce only one calf a year, the
calculations were much simpler. But pigs can have around two dozen offspring
a year. 'It was not on to use this for pigs until we had very cheap,
high-speed computing,' says Dr Webb.
High rates of artificial insemination, around 80 per cent, were also needed.
AI is not widespread in pig breeding - only 3 per cent of pig matings use
it. Cotswold has developed the technique and now runs the largest AI centre
for pigs in the world, using 360 boars a year.
Old-fashioned breeding methods are able to produce leaner and hardier pigs,
but find it difficult to increase litter size, as this is not a
well-inherited trait. Cotswold's techniques have changed this.
'What Blup does is give us a very accurate projection of a pig's genetic
merit for litter size. We can improve pigs born per litter by around one
extra pig every five years, which in biological terms is quite a lot,' said
Dr Webb.
The system also makes it easier to breed pigs with characteristics tailored
to specific markets. For example, conditions in south-east Asia are not
always as 'pig-friendly' as in the UK, so hardier specimens can be bred to
cope with the different environment.
Four years ago Cotswold Pig Development won a Queen's award for its
achievement in exporting pig breeding stock all over the world, from South
Korea and the Philippines to Italy and France. Around half the pigs bred by
Cotswold are for the export market.
Dr Webb kept pigs as a teenager. He has become so attached to them that he
prefers not to eat pork, but he describes that as a 'human frailty' and does
not let his own personal prejudice interfere with business. 'There is
nothing wrong with pig meat at all,' he says.
