THESE days the vikings invade Newcastle not to loot and pillage but to drink
and shop. More than 100,000 Norwegians, Danes, and Swedes brave the North
Sea crossing every year.
After an overnight stay at the local County Hotel, John Martinsen, a
catering manager from Stavanger, his wife Wenche, and a friend carry out an
early morning raid on a costume jewellery store and a women's lingerie shop.
They buy a pair of imitation crystal rings at Pounds 6.50 each, and several
pairs of pink satin bras and panties.
The Martinsen group plans to spend at least Pounds 1,800, including drink,
during the three-day stay in north-east England. They believe everything is
a bargain - at least half the price they would pay in Norway.
PORN BROKER
Sunday trading has a special meaning for Heiga Holmsteen. While the majority
of retailers in Copenhagen take the day off, Mr Holmsteen is open for
business as usual from an early hour. His clientele includes Danes, but is
mostly Japanese, English and German. Visiting Swedes, even on a Sunday,
concentrate on drinking.
Mr Holmsteen works as an accountant for a leading Danish company three days
a week. But for the remaining four his Dana-Expo does a brisk trade in
hardcore pornography of a kind that is not freely available elsewhere in
Europe.
'My clients take things away in suitcases or else I send selective items by
mail order,' says Mr Holmsteen. The magazines he sells are mainly produced
in Denmark where VAT is high. But he keeps his costs down by exporting the
magazines to Germany and then re-importing them - after having paid a lower
German duty.
DRUG STORE COWBOY
Soft drugs in Amsterdam have relatively the same status as beer. In cafes
and coffee houses they are listed on menus and can be consumed on the
premises as long as customers do not buy above a certain limit. As borders
come down, therefore, police forces will need to be on the ball.
Driving from Germany into Holland the frontier post is empty. When a clerk
in a bank nearby is asked 'Where's the border?' she replies: 'It's 1993
already. Don't you realise we are all in Europe now. Perhaps in England you
feel differently.'
Well, maybe the Germans feel differently too. Returning across the same
border from Amsterdam, and crossing the same frontier post from Holland into
Germany, the German border guard barks: 'You come from Amsterdam, you smoke
hash, you bring shit no?' He then orders a complete search of the hired
Volkswagen Golf GTI.
FILL 'ER UP
In a petrol station on the French A-7 autoroute a Spanish long-distance
lorry driver fills up on fuel and then asks for four receipts. Who's
counting?
DOUBLE TROUBLE
Robert Blasco, the owner and cook of a fine restaurant in the spectacular
fortress town of Carcassone in southern France, is pinning his hopes on a
Europe sans frontieres and modern police computers.
Robert has often been detained at the Franco-Spanish border because he
shares the same age, name and surname as one of the most wanted Basque
terrorists. 'All they had to do was check on my stomach. It was full of good
food, much fatter than my alleged double,' he says.
SNOOZE AND BOOZE
Across the border in Spain he has a great chance of getting a good drink
too. Latest statistics show the land of the siesta and fiesta boasts 133,000
tapas bars, giving it more watering holes per capita than any other country
in Europe.
