<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Fury Spreads Over Japanese Minister"] </F>
  [Text] China is demanding the Japanese Government treat 
with "all seriousness" the remarks made by Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano about the Japanese atrocities during their 
invasion of Nanjing. 
  The Foreign Ministry contacted the Japanese yesterday to 
express their concern over the remarks and open talks over the 
issue, spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  Wu said the Chinese were shocked and incensed by Nagano's 
distorted historical view of Japanese aggression. 
  Nagano told Tokyo reporters that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, 
which killed 300,000 civilians in the city that was then the 
Chinese capital, was a "fabrication." 
  Wu described the massacre as one of the most notorious 
atrocities committed by the Japanese military during their 
invasion from 1937 to 1945. 
  The international community has already reached consensus on 
the nature of the war and the massacre itself. 
  Nagano was trying to whitewash the militarism, Wu noted. 
  He said China has noted Japanese Prime Minister Hata's 
attitude toward this episode of history when he spoke in Paris 
yesterday. 
  Hata reiterated Japan's view on the history and said 
Nagano's 
remarks were "inappropriate." 
  Wu said it is in the Japanese people's interests and for 
peace and stability in Asia for Japan to adopt a correct 
attitude about its history of aggression. China always stands 
for a forward-looking approach to history and hopes Japan draw 
lessons from history, the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin said in Shanghai yesterday 
that Chinese and Japanese should live in friendship from 
generation to generation. 
  "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the 
future," Jiang told Bunhei Hara, President of the House of 
Councillors of the Japanese Diet, the parliament. 
  He called the Japanese invasion the "unfortunate historical 
period" between the two countries.
