  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese trade minister 
today urged Japan to implement as early as possible its planned 
fourth package of yen loans to China through official 
development assistance, so as to help China with its shift to a 
market economy. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, made the request during a 15-minute meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutoma Hata in the Japanese Diet 
(parliament) building, a Chinese trade official said. 
  The official quoted Wu as saying that yen loans had played a 
vital role in developing the Chinese economy and in boosting 
Japanese investment in China since 1979, when Japan began to 
implement its first package of loans to China. 
  Hata, who met Wu last November in Seattle, said that Japan 
should try to develop long-term relations with China based on 
repentance for its wartime invasion of its neighbor, 
  He mentioned former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's 
remarks 
about the war that have been roundly condemned by Japan's Asian 
neighbors. 
  Nagano resigned in early May after saying that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor during World War II. 
  The prime minister also hailed the "rapid increase" in 
bilateral trade, the volume of which reached some 39 billion 
U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 54 percent over 1992. 
  Wu, who arrived here on Tuesday [31 May], is on a week-long 
visit to Japan at the invitation of the minister of 
international trade and industry. She is also leading a 
ten-member delegation to the regular conference on investment 
between China and Japan.
