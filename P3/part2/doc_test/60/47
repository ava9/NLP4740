  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS) -- Spokesman of China's 
Ministry of Foreign affairs, Mr. Wu Jianmin, replying to a 
question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held here today 
asking for his comments on and China's hopes regarding the 
forming of the Japanese cabinet by the new Prime Minister, Mr. 
Tsutomu Hata, said that the Chinese Premier Mr. Li Peng had sent 
a congratulatory message to Mr. Hata on his election as prime 
minister of Japan and he added that Mr. Hata was a well-known 
statesman to the Chinese people. China appreciated his zeal and

of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation. All Japanese political 
parties both in power or not had the same stance on the 
development of mutual cooperation in various fields between the

the new Japanese government, the two countries would continue 
their close coordination and cooperation and make joint efforts 
to promote the development of Sino-Japanese ties in a long-term 
and steady way.

in the inauguration ceremony of the new president of South

would like to express its congratulations to the inauguration 
ceremony of the new president of South Africa.
