17 May China DAILY REPORT, page 1, column 1, headlined "Jiang 
Urges Tokyo, Beijing To Put Nagano Remarks in Past"] 
txt}[Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin on Tuesday [17 May] urged Japan and China to put the 
remarks of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano behind them 
and move forward with the development of friendly bilateral 
relations for the future, Japanese officials said. 
  "Let's put the Nagano remarks in the past and move ahead 
thinking of the future," Jiang told Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. 
  Kubo on Monday delivered a letter to Jiang from Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata expressing regret over Nagano's claim that 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. 
  Jiang told Kubo that he appreciated the apology from Japan. 
  Regarding concerns that North Korea may be trying to build a 
nuclear arsenal, Kubo said he hopes the issue could be resolved 
through dialogue and he had expectations for China's role in 
unlocking the stalemate. 
  Jiang also hoped to see the issue resolved through 
negotiations but cautioned the international community should 
not overestimate China's influence on North Korea. 
  "Looking forward to a resolution through dialogue, China 
hopes to play a positive role," Jiang said but added, "it is 
unrealistic to overestimate China's role." 
  Jiang told Kubo that China, North Korea's only major ally in 
the world, wants to see a stable Korean peninsula free of 
nuclear arms. 
  Kubo is currently in China on an eight-day visit through 
Sunday as head of an SDPJ delegation marking the 10th 
anniversary of the party's exchanges with China's Communist 
Party. 
  He told Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in a 
meeting later Tuesday that China should join working-level 
negotiations among North and South Korea, the United States and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency on concerns over North 
Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  Tang replied that talks between the United States and North 
Korea will be effective in resolving the issue, SDP officials 
said. 
  Tang also said that China is making an effort to bring about 
a third round of high-level talks between the U.S. and North 
Korea, and that he wants the SDP to work on the U.S. through the 
Japanese Government. 
  Kubo is expected to meet with Hata after returning to Tokyo, 
according to government sources in Tokyo.
