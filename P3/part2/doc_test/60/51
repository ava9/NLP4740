  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Recent remarks by a cabinet 
minister denying Japan's wrongdoing before and during World War 
II has reopened deep scars in Asia. 
  When Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre was a "fabrication" and that it was wrong to call 
Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors aggression, it also revived 
doubts about the way Japan perceives history, particularly its 
wartime role. 
  "The Japanese may often be confused about their history," 
said a passage in an editorial in THE PHILIPPINES DAILY INQUIRER. 
  Another Manila paper, today, expressed fear of living under 
the "spectral threat of a militarily resurgent Japan which 
hasn't learned one thing from its shameful history of 
aggression." 
  The South Korean and Chinese Governments also protested 
Nagano's remarks as distorting historical facts. 
  For the Japanese Government, Nagano's blunder occurred at an 
"unfortunate" time since the new administration of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata was expected to follow in the footsteps of 
his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, regarding Japan's wartime 
role and offer formal apologies for Japan's wartime atrocities. 
  Last summer Hosokawa became the first Japanese prime 
minister 
to use the words "aggression and colonial rule" in referring to 
Japan's actions before and during World War II. 
  But the 71-year-old Nagano, who had been first lieutenant in 
the Japanese Imperial Army and later chief of staff of the 
Ground Self- Defense Force, is the latest in a number of 
politicians to create an international uproar by the slip of the 
tongue regarding Japan's wartime actions. 
  Nagano resigned after only 10 days in office. 
  In 1986, then Education Minister Masayuki Fujio was 
dismissed 
by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for saying Koreans were 
partly to blame for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the 
Korean peninsula. In 1990, a lower house member, Shintaro 
Ishihara, said the story of the Nanjing massacre was made up by 
the Chinese. 
  China estimates that Japanese Imperial Army troops massacred 
more than 300,000 civilians following their invasion of then 
Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. Japanese 
historians cite lower estimates of around 100,000. 
  "I think people of that generation truly believed what they 
said," said Roger Buckley, professor of history at International 
Christian University, about politicians who make remarks 
downplaying Japan's wartime role. 
  Buckley, while pointing out that formal apology is 
necessary, 
said he fears such comments by politicians will influence 
Japan's younger generation. 
  Education authorities have frequently been criticized, both 
at home and abroad, for not giving sufficient attention to 
teaching that period of history. Textbooks for use at schools 
also are subject to government approval. 
  A senior diplomat said the concept among the Japanese of the 
period from around late 1930s to World War II is fuzzy, while 
good history books about the era are also unavailable. That, 
said the official, is why university entrance exams hardly 
include any questions about the country's modern history. 
  But efforts are being made to ward off criticism about 
history teaching. 
  A foreign ministry-affiliated organization recently 
published 
"Japan in Modern History," which offers translations of history 
textbooks used in Japan's elementary and junior high schools, 
the first such attempt in Japan. 
  The books, published by the International Society for 
Educational Information, extracted and translated parts dealing 
with Japan's role in the world from the late 19th century 
through early 1900s from three textbooks each from elementary 
and junior high schools used since 1992 and 1993, respectively. 
  The three texts each account to about 70 percent of 
textbooks 
used by primary and junior high students in Japan, according to 
the institute. 
  The "Japan in Modern History" is also available in Chinese 
and Korean and the translations of high school textbooks are 
also on the way. 
  "By solely offering translations of the textbooks without 
giving any comments or analysis, people interested in Japanese 
textbooks can see for themselves how Japan is teaching modern 
history at schools," said Fumi Miyamoto, director of an 
institute which aims to boost mutual understanding among people 
everywhere. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada, in distributing 
the English translations to foreign reporters, said the 
publication aims to show that, "we're seriously teaching our 
schoolchildren." 
  "I think its quite true... That in the early 1980s 
historical 
facts were not well reflected in school textbooks," Terada said. 
"But gradually the quality of textbooks has improved." 
  Two of the elementary school texts and all three junior high 
texts translated in the "Japan in Modern History" described the 
Nanjing massacre. 
  The institute plans to distribute the books to schools, book 
stores, local governments and local education boards in Japan 
while the Foreign Ministry will distribute them abroad, the 
institute said.
