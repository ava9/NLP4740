  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Monday [9 May] he and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
have agreed to do their utmost for an early reopening of the 
stalled trade "framework" talks. The accord was reached when 
Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hata met with 
Brown during an east-west conference of trade ministers that was 
held in Warsaw for two days until Saturday. 
  Hata told a news conference that he and Brown shared the 
view 
that an early resumption of the framework talks would meet 
expectations not only of both countries but of the global 
community. But he said he has clarified anew to Brown Tokyo's 
stance against numerical targets as a tool to measure foreign 
access to Japanese markets. 
  Hata said the meeting with Brown did not touch on specifics 
of three U.S. demands presented to Tokyo earlier as conditions 
to resume the framework talks. But both parties agreed that 
accords on the conditions should be struck before the July 
summit of the seven leading economic powers in Naples, Hata said. 
  During the April meeting between then Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, now prime minister, and U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Washington demanded that 
Japan offer new proposals on a macroeconomic policy, overall 
goals of the framework talks and "objective criteria" to gauge 
openness of Japan's markets. 
  On the recent controversial remarks by former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano over the 1937 Nanjing massacre, the 
trade minister said the cabinet of Prime Minister Hata has been 
"damaged greatly." 
  Japan should "deepen its regret" over wartime conducts 
toward 
the next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, 
Hata said. 
  Nagano said in an interview with a newspaper that the 
Nanjing 
massacre was a fabrication, a remark sparking global criticism 
and forcing his resignation as justice minister.
