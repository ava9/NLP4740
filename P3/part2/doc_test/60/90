  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Saudi Arabia on Monday [23 
May] urged Japan to make efforts to break a deadlock in a joint 
project to refine Saudi crude oil in this country, a Japanese 
Trade Ministry official said. 
  Saudi Arabia made the request when its Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources Minister Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir met with Japanese 
International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata in Tokyo, 
the official told a press conference. 
  The joint project calls for building or acquiring three 
refineries in Japan to refine 450,000 barrels of Saudi Crude oil 
per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been 
on hold since last November, however, due to a policy rift 
between Nippon Oil Co. and Japan Energy Corp., both major 
Japanese partners in the scheme. 
  During the half-hour meeting with Hata, Nazir voiced hope 
that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
will play a role of "catalyzer" in resuming the project, 
according to the MITI official. 
  If crude oil exporters like Saudi Arabia can ensure "secured 
markets" for their crude supplies, it would benefit Japan as 
well as the exporters by helping prevent rapid fluctuations in 
crude prices, Nazir said. 
  Saudi Arabia is prepared to continue talks on the scheme, 
Nazir was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied the stalled project is basically a matter for 
the private sector but his ministry will do its utmost by 
upgrading related business conditions for an early resumption of 
the scheme, the MITI official said. 
  The Japanese trade minister asked Saudi Arabia to make a 
decision on extending oil-exploring concessions currently given 
to Japan's Arabian Oil Co. beyond the scheduled expiration in 
2000, although Nazir did not make a specific commitment, the 
MITI official said. 
  Arabian Oil has been operating in Saudi Arabia for 30 years 
as a core oil supplier for Japan, Hata noted. 
  On a Japanese request for Saudi Arabia to ensure a stable 
crude oil supply to Japan, Nazir said, "that is no problem." 
  "Saudi will continue to be a constant crude supplier for 
Japan," Nazir said. 
  Nazir arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a seven-day visit to 
Japan. 
  On Tuesday, he is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  During his meeting with the prime minister, Nazir will hand 
over to him a personal message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, 
which is believed to contain the Saudi Arabian request on the 
joint refinery project.
