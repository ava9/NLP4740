  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Tsutomu Hata will make his 
parliamentary debut as prime minister next week with a 
relatively high public rating but surrounded by increasingly 
hostile opposition forces determined to topple his minority 
government. 
  The Hata coalition itself already appears to be in disarray 
with rifts emerging within two of its partners -- the Japan New 
Party (JNP) headed by Hata's predecessor in the premiership 
Morihiro Hosokawa and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  Another headache for the Hata cabinet, inaugurated in late 
April, is a controversial remark on Japan's wartime actions by 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano which angered its Asian 
neighbors still harboring memories of Japanese aggression before 
and during World War II. 
  Political sources said Nagano, a former chief of staff of 
the 
Ground Self-Defense Force, will likely be forced to resign only 
a few days after he was installed in the post. 
  Nagano, who participated in the invasion of China as an 
Imperial Army soldier, told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper this 
week that the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in which China says more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians were killed, is a "fabrication." 
He also challenged Hosokawa's statement that Japan waged "a war 
of aggression and a wrong war," saying Japan fought the war to 
liberate Asian countries from their Western colonizers. 
  His remark immediately sparked sharp and bitter reactions 
from China, South and North Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and other 
Asian countries. 
  Hata, now touring Europe, also criticized Nagano, saying the 
remarks were "inappropriate" and Japan's wartime aggression 
inflicted "unbearable pain and sorrow on many people." 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the country's No 2 
opposition party, has calLed on Hata to sack Nagano. The 
Japanese Communist Party and Komeito, a coalition partner, have 
also demanded his dismissal. 
  The prime minister will deliver a policy speech to both 
houses of the Diet next Tuesday, and will answer questions from 
both ruling and opposition legislators Thursday and Friday as 
well as May 16. 
  The prime minister is taking the helm at a time when Japan 
faces such major issues as a trade row with the United States, 
tax reform and the suspected North Korean development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  But the most immediate task for his cabinet is the 
parliamentary passage of the overdue national budget for fiscal 
1994 which began April 1. Speculation is mounting that the 
cabinet will be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House 
of Representatives for a snap general election after the budget, 
badly needed to rev up an economy in the doldrums, has been 
cleared through the Diet. 
  The major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ousted 
from power by Hosokawa last August after steering the nation for 
38 years straight, is poised to join hands in Diet business with 
the SDP, which bolted the Hata coalition to become the No. 2 
opposition force. 
  With the withdrawal of the SDP, the largest power group in 
the former coalition in terms of number of Diet members, the 
Hata camp's strength in the lower chamber has been reduced to 
182, far short of the 256 majority in the 511-member house. 
  Since both the LDP and the SDP have pledged to cooperate 
with 
Hata in passing the national budget, no major political upset is 
predicted before its clearance, but Diet business thereafter 
will be tough going for the Hata administration, political 
commentators concurred. 
  Political sources said Hosokawa's JNP, from which three 
lawmakers have already deserted, will see a further desertion 
this week -- possibly more than 10 of its 37 members -- as 
dissatisfaction mounts over its leadership's inclination toward 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the core power 
blocs in the coalition. 
  Similar disgruntlement is also swirling among members of the 
DSP, whose head Keigo Ouchi masterminded a plan to form a 
parliamentary group -- the plan which eventually drove the SDP, 
antagonistic to some of the political initiatives of Shinseito 
and Komeito, out of the coalition, the sources said. 
  Despite the political waves, the Hata cabinet maintains a 
high public popularity, although the rating is considerably 
lower than that of the Hosokawa government when it was 
inaugurated. 
  A KYODO NEWS SERVICE poll conducted this week gave the Hata 
cabinet a 51.6 percent public approval rating, 24.1 percentage 
points less than the Hosokawa administration at its inception. 
  Important economic figures to be released next week include 
the international balance of payments for April and fiscal 1993 
(Monday). 
  The Economic Planning Agency will release a monthly economic 
report Tuesday. [passage omitted]
