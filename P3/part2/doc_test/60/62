  [Text] Seoul, May 5 (YONHAP) -- A senior South Korean 
Foreign Ministry official expressed regrets Thursday over 
controversial comments by a top Japanese justice official that 
Japan was not an aggressor in World War II and the war was aimed 
at liberation of colonies. 
  Saying that the Seoul government is looking into a real 
intention behind the remarks by Japan's Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano, the official said he felt sorry for a cabinet minister 
of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and 
contribution to the international community to have such a 
consciousness of history. 
  "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to 
redress the past," the official maintained. 
  Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the 
national daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN Tuesday by contending that the 
Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead designed 
for liberation of colonies and a greater East Asia coprosperity 
sphere. 
  Nagano also argued that the "rape of Nanjing" in China was a 
hoax.
