FT  09 MAY 94 / War wounds still not healed in Tokyo: Nagano is only the
latest to say Japan was really the victim

Nearly 50 years after the end of the second world war, Japan has yet to find
a stable consensus on whether it came through that conflict as aggressor or
victim.
Just how far Japan's fragmented political establishment remains from coming
to terms with the country's wartime record has been vividly illustrated by
the events leading up to the resignation on Saturday of Mr Shigeto Nagano as
justice minister, a mere 10 days after taking office.
Mr Nagano was asked to resign by an angry prime minister Tsutomu Hata after
claiming in an interview with the Mainichi Shimbun that one of the worst
atrocities of the Pacific war, the massacre of more than 150,000 people in
the former Chinese capital of Nanking in 1937, never happened. He also
claimed that it was not a war of aggression.
Mr Nagano's claim - withdrawn later - angered China, South Korea and other
important Asian neighbours at a time when one of the prime objectives of
Japanese foreign policy is to make friends with them. It also contradicted
successive governments' officially apologetic line over the war, pushed
harder than ever by the former Hosokawa administration and supported by the
new Hata government.
So it looked, from the moment Mr Nagano's words were published, that he had
condemned himself to have one of the shortest Japanese ministerial careers
on record. He could not have been more out of line with the thinking of the
new reform-minded political establishment.
Mr Hata, who yesterday admitted partial responsibility as the one who
appointed Mr Nagano, has been weakened by running into this colossal blunder
in only the first week of his government.
He opened himself to charges of equivocation by saying, soon after hearing
of Mr Nagano's statement, that he still wanted to work with the justice
minister and described him as a man of balance. He was in Brussels at the
time which may account for his caution over events many thousands of miles
away.
Yet the Japanese press is not so forgiving. The affair was reminiscent of
the pre-Hosokawa tradition of vague apologies for the war, later devalued by
equivocation.
The two biggest-circulation daily newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri
Shimbun, yesterday criticised Mr Hata's slowness to axe the errant minister.
The Asahi seized on the wider repercussions, pointing out that Japan should
shelve its campaign for permanent membership of the United Nations security
council until it has first won its neighbours' full trust.
The Nagano affair shocked many people in Japan. But the signs are that his
remarks were no mistake; indeed they may have come from the heart.
As a conservative former army chief of staff, the 71-year-old Mr Nagano's
views were almost as well known as those of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a member
of the right wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic party who colourfully
complained last year that Mr Hosokawa had gone too far in his war apologies.
So the Mainichi probably knew what it was doing when it invited Mr Nagano to
produce his standard line on Nanking.
Neither was he the first cabinet minister to prompt his own resignation with
such a remark. Two others in the past eight years have gone the same way.
Mr Seisuke Okuno resigned in 1988 as head of the National Land Agency after
arguing that Japan fought the war to secure its own safety. He refused to
apologise. Before him, Mr Masayuki Fujio was almost instantly fired as
education minister in 1986 after saying Japan's 1910 invasion of Korea was
justified.
Mr Nagano created more of a domestic fuss than did Mr Okuno and Mr Fujio,
indicating that Japanese public opinion feels more war responsibility now
than it did then.
Yet the affair is a reminder that many Japanese still feel their country was
a victim of the war, where the national record focuses on the US
fire-bombing of Tokyo and the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Visitors to Hiroshima, for example, report that the local war museum carries
almost no commentary on what caused the atom bomb to be dropped.
School history books remain vague on some crucial details of the war,
despite a series of highly publicised court cases against official
censorship.
Japan's international ambitions will force its public to face this rift in
the national consensus, between the reform-minded establishment and the
arch-conservatives of the older generation. War history will be a persistent
theme in public life as Japan's economic relations with its Asian neighbours
grow closer and as the government lines itself up for the UN security
council in the next few years.
