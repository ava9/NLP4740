  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano's controversial remarks on the Pacific war are 
expected to stir up a political debate in the Diet (parliament). 
  Social Democratic Party Secretary-General Wataru Kubo said 
in 
an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday evening that 
the justice minister's remarks would prompt the Diet to call 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to account and question Nagano's 
fitness to serve in the cabinet, suggesting that his party would 
make an issue of the comments when the House of Representatives 
(the lower house of the Diet) opens. 
  Nagano has said the war was intended to liberate the 
colonies 
and create a greater East Asian co-prosperity sphere. He also 
called the Nanjing massacre of Chinese civilians and prisoners 
of war a hoax. 
  "We have to attach importance to his having said that it is 
wrong to call the Pacific war a war of aggression," Kubo said. 
  Pointing to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
remarks 
that the Pacific war was wrong and Japan was the aggressor, he 
noted that Nagano's comments indicate the new cabinet's policy 
has changed from that of its predecessor. 
  All Japanese television networks, including NHK, reported 
that the justice minister's remarks were causing ripples in 
South Korea, China, Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia on 
their news programs Thursday. 
  In particular, NHK reported that Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin had expressed regret over Nagano's comments in a 
roundabout way on Thursday when he met Bunpei Hara, speaker of 
the Diet's Upper House. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and the ruling coalition, 
concerned about the unexpectedly strong reactions from Korea, 
China and other countries, will take action to clear up the 
fallout from the controversial remarks to preserve friendly 
relations with these nations. 
  The steps will include having Nagano accept political 
reponsibility for the remarks and issuing a statement that they 
were his personal opinion and not related to the Hata cabinet's 
policy in any way. 
  A government source said Friday the steps would be taken as 
soon as Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
return from tours of Europe and the Middle East, noting the 
ruling minority coalition is in a difficult position as the 
majority opposition, including the Social Democratic Party, is 
moving to make a political issue of the remarks. 
  The Hata government is worried that Nagano's remarks will 
harm relations with South Korea, China and other countries as 
they brought up memories of past suffering, he added.
