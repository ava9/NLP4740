  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir at the Ziguang 
Pavilion of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Both sides expressed a 
willingness to peacefully resolve the Nansha [Spratly] Islands 
issue through dialogue on the basis of friendly cooperation. 
  Li Peng extended a welcome to Mahathir for paying a working 
visit to China and for participating in the 1994 China Beijing 
international high-level economic forum. 
  During the meeting, both sides satisfactorily reviewed the 
all-round and rapid development of bilateral relations since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations 20 years ago, and 
they said that they would work together to further develop 
bilateral relations. 
  Li Peng said: After the end of the cold war, the world has 
been developing in the direction of multipolarization. This is 
the positive side, but many contradictions and problems exist 
that need to be resolved. 
  He said: World affairs should be managed jointly by all 
countries of the world. The practice of hegemony and power 
politics will get one nowhere. All countries, big or small, 
rich or poor, and strong or weak, are equal, and they should 
enter into friendly cooperation. Disputes between nations 
should be solved peacefully through consultation and dialogue on 
a equal footing. It is necessary to establish a world political 
and economic order that is just and reasonable. The United 
Nations should do something more for the developing nations. 
  In discussing former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano's remark on the Nanjing Massacre, Li Peng said: Nagano's 
remarks, which reversed black and white and distorted history, 
show that there is a force in Japan which is attempting to 
negate and beautify its history of aggression. Naturally, the 
remarks were condemned by all Asian countries that suffered from 
Japan's aggression. 
  He said: After Shigeto Nagano made his remarks, the Hata 
administration has made many speeches and has taken some 
measures. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Hata himself has conveyed an oral 
message to Premier Li Peng. He expressed his regret over what 
happened and reiterated that he will carry out a deep 
self-examination on Japan's past aggression and colonial rule, 
and that the young generation will be educated accordingly. Li 
Peng expressed his appreciation for such efforts. 
  Li Peng said: Sino-Malaysian relations are very good. We do 
not have any problems that need to be resolved urgently. 
  Commenting on the Nansha Islands issue, Li Peng said: "We 
should resolve peacefully the issue through dialogue with 
statesmen's farsightedness and friendly attitudes. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping proposed long ago that we should put aside disputes and 
carry out joint development. We should explore and discuss the 
issues with Malaysia based on the above principle." 
  Mahathir said: Both Malaysia and China are developing 
countries which share many common points in dealing with both 
regional and international affairs. 
  He indicated: Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand 
of peacefully resolving the Nansha dispute and opposes the 
internationalization of the Nansha issue. Malaysia is willing 
to hold bilateral talks on the basis of friendly cooperation to 
seek ways to resolve this issue. 
  Commenting on democracy, Mahathir expressed his belief that 
we should respect the specific situations in various countries. 
It is not commendable or feasible to apply the same democratic 
concept to countries that are undergoing different stages of 
development.
