  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano hinted at his resignation Friday [6 May] over his earlier 
remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, saying 
the remarks were "inappropriate." Nagano told a news conference 
that he wants to completely recant his denial of the 1937 
Nanjing massacre which he had made in Wednesday's edition of the 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN, saying the slaughter was an "undeniable fact." 
  "My remarks regarding the historical incident (of the 
Nanjing 
massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I 
would like to withdraw them," Nagano said. 
  Nagano said, "I share exactly the same view with Prime 
Minister (Tsutomu) Hata, who said in Paris that our country's 
invasion and colonial rule (of Asian neighbors) inflicted 
unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people." 
  "I feel responsibility deeply, so I would like to live up to 
the decision of Hata who appointed me to this office," he said. 
  Hata, currently on a four-nation European tour, reprimanded 
Nagano over the phone on Friday for his remarks, government 
sources said. 
  Nagano told the mass-circulation MAINICHI that "the Nanjing 
incident was a fabrication," and that "I still think it wrong to 
define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)." 
  The sources said Hata was "very concerned" about the Asian 
reaction to this latest attempt to reinterpret Japan's prewar 
history. "The aggressive behavior of our nation and colonial 
domination caused unbearable suffering and sorrow on many 
people," Hata reportedly told Nagano while outlining his 
cabinet's position. 
  Supporting former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks 
that Japan made the invasion toward Asian nations, Nagano said 
during Friday's news conference, "Japan with its self-righteous 
attitude invaded (those nations) and gave unbearable pain to 
(their) people." Nagano said, "each Japanese citizen must 
recognize these historical incidents and share the resolve not 
to repeat these things." 
  Nagano, 71, a graduate of the former elite Japanese Military 
Academy, assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese 
Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended. 
  Nagano, a House of Councillors member of the coalition's 
core 
party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is a former chief of 
staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force. 
  Nagano, saying he had visited Nanjing several times before 
the end of the World War II, however, said that the number of 
people who were killed in Nanjing is not certain. "But, there 
must have been a massacre even if the number of those killed 
differs according to historians." 
  On the so-called foreign "comfort women" who were forced to 
provide sex to Japanese soldiers during World War II, Nagano 
said the government "should deal with the issue sincerely." 
  Beijing and Seoul led Asian nations in condemning Nagano's 
remarks, with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu calling 
the remarks a distortion of historical facts. 
  Domestically, the chorus of reprimands continued to build.
