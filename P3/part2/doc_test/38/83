FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (9): Speed-skating
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-track speed-skating has been part of the Winter Olympics since its
inception in 1924. Women were included in 1960. Short-track speed-skating
was a demonstration sport at Calgary in 1988. Short-track was raised to full
Olympic status for 1992 but in a limited form with only one distance for men
(1,000m) and one for women (500m), plus a relay race for each sex. Part of
short-track's appeal is that four or more skaters race against one another -
rather than against the clock. Tactics are vitally important and there are
many thrills and spills. In long-track skating, competitors race in two
against the clock.
Enthusiasts need the skills of an accountant to figure out whether a
competitor is in contention for a medal.
