Zoya Ivanova led a Soviet sweep in the women's marathon, winning in 2 hours 34 
minutes 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova, 38, and Irina Bogacheva ran side by side for virtually all of the 
first 17 miles of the 26-mile, 385-yard race. Ivanova, who has won 10 
marathons, then charged in front as her teammate began to tire under humid 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova's best time was 2:27:57 in finishing second in the 1987 World 
Championships. She also was second in the 1985 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Bogacheva, runner-up in the first Goodwill Games in 1986, again finished 
second, in 2:36:24. Ravilya Barangulova was third in 2:37:40. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kindelan of Kirkland, Wash., a last-minute replacement, was the first 
American, placing fourth in 2:42:05. 
</P>
<P>
Kindelan said she only learned on Wednesday that she would be included on the 
team, adding that she might have declined if the event wasn't in her home town. 
</P>
<P>
Winthrop Graham of Jamaica won the men's 400 intermediate hurdles by about two 
meters over American David Patrick, his coach, in 48.78. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught me at hurdle six, and I knew I still had a chance, because in 
practice, he usually catches me by the third," said Patrick, who also trains 
with Graham at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Canto of Mexico, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist and world 
record-holder, won the 20-kilometer walk in 1:23:13. 
</P>
<P>
Texas senior Carlette Guidry led a U.S. sweep in the women's 100 meters, 
clocking 11.03, the fastest by an American this year and the third-best in the 
world. Sheila Echols and Michelle Finn followed in 11.05. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Ana Quirot, ranked No. 1 in the world in the women's 400 meters, got off 
to a good start and clocked 50.34 to beat Soviet Lyudmila Dzhigalova by five 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's discus, 21-year-old Ilke Wyludda of East Germany extended her 
two-year winning streak to 23, with a throw of 223-4. It was the fourth victory 
in a week for Wyludda, ranked No. 1 in the world and No. 2 on the all-time 
performers list with a throw of 244-7. 
</P>
<P>
In men's gymnastics, Vitaly Scherbo won two gold medals in the individual 
apparatus events. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, who dominated the gymnastics at the Tacoma Dome, took four 
individual titles outright and tied for the other two. One of the other gold 
medalists was Lance Ringnald of Albuquerque, N.M., who tied with Scherbo on the 
horizontal bars. 
</P>
<P>
In women's sculling, American Alison Townley, a 25-year-old Harvard graduate 
and Olympian, won her second silver medal of the regatta, closing strongly on 
West German Titie Jordache in the single sculls before losing by 1.32 seconds.
