SWITZERLAND
A small valley, by a middle-sized valley, near a large valley in southern
Switzerland is a temptress. Do not resist. Leave civilisation behind for a
while and slip into the dream of the Roseg valley.
On either side of the gentle and silent uphill track, the mountains jump
with chamois and deer. Ahead of you is the sheer wall of the 4,000m Bernina
massif that doubles up as the Italian border. At your feet, a river slithers
beneath a snow crust. Apart from the river, there is silence. No cars are
allowed in the Roseg.
Close to the end of the 7km valley, almost at the glacier's foot, is an
outpost of civilisation just when you want it. Bring your appetite with you
to the restaurant Morteratsch. And if the skiing and wine make you too
slothful for the run back to town, catch a horse-drawn sleigh (thick
blankets provided).
The large valley is the Engadine, and St Moritz its most famous name. The
cross-country skier should stay in the prettier, more understated but
equally luxurious Pontresina in the middle-sized valley.
As well as the Roseg, there are long trails in the Engadine. The highlight
is skiing across the frozen lakes south of St Moritz. In the crystalline
air, the landscape of ground glass looks as if it would take a few minutes
to cross. Think again. The other skiers become specks before they get half
way across.
Pontresina is good for learning cross-country. The trails can be as easy as
you want. But Pontresina is not perfect: many runs require a car or train
ride to reach and the town is a little soulless.
NORWAY
Cross-country skiing in Norway is part of the culture. A typical Norwegian
family is happy to consider a four-day trek from chalet to chalet as a
holiday. Resorts are functional rather than luxurious. The food is
calorie-packed rather than gourmet. And the skiing has little to do with a
gentle slide along a bubbling brook and everything to do with going straight
up a mountain.
But the hotels and chalets are cosy with vast open hearths and wood
everywhere. A snack consisting of warm sour cream and hot melted butter,
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, will do little for your waistline but is
delicious. You can make up for it by choosing from half a dozen kinds of
pickled herring and mackerel, and have a berry-packed dessert.
The skiing need not be challenging. Rolling hills make it easy to follow
contours. And the feeling that you are on the edge of civilisation is no
illusion.
But the best skiing is difficult by Alpine standards as many of the tracks
go straight up. It is rarely steep, but you need to be pretty fit and have a
good uphill technique to enjoy it.
Those who make it are rewarded with truly panoramic views. The landscape is
reminiscent of Scotland, New England or France's Massif Central.
The sensation of emptiness is partly psychological. Norwegians claim more
second homes per head than any other nationality. There are hundreds of
chalets and cabins hidden around the cross-country skiing village of
Sjusjoen alone.
Learn cross-country before you go to Sjusjoen. There are two part-time
instructors - farmers really - and most of the visitors learnt to ski before
they could run.
Non-skiing activities, too, are very Scandinavian. Do not miss the
extraordinary experience of dog sledding.
This is not a comfortable Alpine holiday, but it is real. Norwegians are
modest and gentle and cross-country skiing is their way of life.
AUSTRIA
Seefeld's pedestrianised high street seems, after a snowfall, to have been
designed for picture postcards. The motorway to Munich and Zurich is just
over the mountains and there is a railway station at the edge of town.
There is cross-country skiing ranging from attractive beginners' routes in
sunny meadows to hilly woodland trails that are the experts' raison de
skier.
Add to that medieval houses, open-air ice skating and bath-hot swimming,
even some downhill skiing, and you have a winter resort worthy of the
phrase.
The cross-country skiing is as well organised as you would expect from a
town that has twice hosted Austria's Winter Olympics' Nordic events.
Most of the trails fan out from a point a few minutes walk from the town
centre. On the beginners' routes there are always at least two parallel
tracks, making lessons straightforward.
The expert trails can be difficult in places with steep curving descents.
But in the silent pine forests, it is worth the effort.
Seefeld is not cheap. And at 1,200m the season is short.
ITALY
Most cross country skiers at the last winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer
spent their final few weeks of preparation in the host country. Not Manuela
de Centa, however, who went on to win two gold medals for Italy.
Her town is Livigno, for training and living. It is an extraordinary winter
resort that has more in common with a wild west boomtown than other Alpine
resorts or sedate Norway.
It lies in one of the most isolated valleys in the Alps. A treeless bowl
whose inhabitants have exploited their duty-free status by building 200
shops and half a dozen petrol stations.
Straggling along the valley floor, the shopping attracts bargain-hunting day
trippers from Switzerland and downhillers from Italy, Germany and the UK.
The valley itself has plenty of Alpine skiing, but little to excite the
langlaufer. The official runs are through summer meadows that, because of
the one-valley nature of Livigno, never stray far from buildings and petrol
stations.
Away from the official tracks, however, it is possible to ski in serenity
and as such would make a passable introduction to cross country for a day or
two.
