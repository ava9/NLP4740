Greg Evangelatos is at the top of Mammoth Mountain, about to take his first 
ride on a run called the Cornice. Reaching up to the sky like a frozen tidal 
wave, the Cornice is the hill of choice for thrill-seeking skiers. The 
faint-hearted are warned to stay on their chairlifts. Evangelatos stands on the 
precipice and thinks back to the first time he ever saw the Cornice. He was in 
his early teens, a novice skier. The bunny run was merely intimidating, but the 
Cornice was worse, the great unknown. He remembers telling his family that 
there was no way he could ever ski it. But that was then. Kids grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos pushes off from the lip of the Cornice and makes it to the bottom, 
conquering both the mountain and teen-age angst in one glorious swoop. He heads 
for the lodge: It's Miller Time. 
</P>
<P>
This might sound like just another coming-of-age story, but it has a special 
twist. In between the time he first saw the Cornice and first skied it, 
Evangelatos lost his sight. 
</P>
<P>
What he didn't have the courage to do when he could see he managed to 
accomplish in total darkness. To him, his journey down the Cornice is a 
metaphor for overcoming obstacles and living a go-for-broke lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people, they just live their lives in a dark corner," says Evangelatos, 
now 28. "But you can't fear the unknown. You have to have challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Blinded in a fireworks accident 10 years ago, Evangelatos lost his sight but 
found meaning and purpose in his life. "I want to prove to myself and to others 
that the blind can do everything they want, that we can lead just as exciting a 
life as anybody," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most people would find Evangelatos' life too exciting. He water skis, sky dives 
from 12,000 feet and speed skates on Venice Beach. Everything he does is done 
at breakneck speed, especially skiing. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a blind skier -- or a lot of sighted ones -- who can keep up with 
him. A few weeks ago, he won two gold medals, including the overall title, at 
the World Disabled Championships in Winter Park, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Blind skiers follow closely behind guides, who shout directions over their 
shoulders like "hard left" or "big right." Evangelatos and his guide, Robey 
Lizama of Gardnerville, Nev., often reach speeds of 50 m.p.h., which doesn't 
leave much margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
At the worlds, Lizama slowed too quickly at the finish line and Evangelatos ran 
up on his skis, got tangled and went tumbling, breaking his left collarbone. 
The next day, arm taped to his side, he won a bronze medal in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a one-armed skier," Evangelatos says, adding with irony, "for 
once, I felt like I was skiing with a disability." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos is talking in the living room of his parents' Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
Outside by the swimming pool, Ricky, a golden Amazon parrot, is tormenting the 
family dog, an old pit bull named Samson, by chirping his name and doing a 
pretty good barking imitation. Samson comes inside. Evangelatos gets up and 
closes a sliding door to muffle the sound of the parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she likes doing that to him," he says with a laugh before heading to 
the kitchen. A moment later, he returns with a cup of coffee and sits down. 
"When I blew myself up, that old dog lay next to me and wouldn't leave until 
the firemen came to take me away." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos has no trouble talking about the accident that changed his life a 
decade ago. Like the occasional foolhardy 18-year-old, he was trying to make 
the world's biggest firecracker by dismantling bottle rockets and mixing the 
powder in a porcelain bowl. But the powder suddenly exploded, taking his sight 
and mangling his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
The next few months were physical and emotional torture. "I didn't want to live 
any more," Evangelatos says. "I felt so ugly. I felt I'd be an outcast in 
society the rest of my life. I pictured myself on an L.A. corner with a tin 
cup. I didn't want to go on." 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital, his sister, Patricia, read him an article about a blind skier 
named Mike May, who was a world champion. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, Evangelatos was attending the Braille Institute in 
L.A. when his judo instructor mentioned a ski program run by the local chapter 
of National Handicapped Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos began skiing, disregarding the caution of his youth. Within a year, 
he had won the overall championship at the U.S. Assn. of Blind Athletes 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I got bored with regular slopes," he says. "The advanced runs were the 
challenge that gave me excitement, and racing became the challenge in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Evangelatos was coasting along "without any plans or 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
He played football at Birmingham High -- he was a 5-foot-8, 170-pound starter 
at running back and defensive end -- but didn't distinguish himself 
athletically. College was a possibility, "but I didn't know what I wanted to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
His disability suddenly gave him a cause. "I know when I accomplish something," 
he says, "I open doors for blind people." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteering at the Foundation for the Junior Blind's summer camp program, "I 
try to be a role model," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help children realize their recreational capabilities and understand 
that they can make their dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos' father, a lawyer, helped him set up Demo Video Inc., a nonprofit 
production company that specializes in educational videos. If he can get 
corporate sponsors, he hopes to distribute the videos to schools to increase 
society's awareness of the capabilities of the blind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to educate children so they don't think blind people are 
foreign creatures who belong in an institution," Evangelatos says. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, Evangelatos proves that being blind doesn't have to be a prison 
sentence. He trains in Colorado during the ski season and attends L.A. City 
College in the off-season, majoring in radio and TV. Although he usually lives 
with his parents, he's moving into a Venice Beach apartment this summer so he 
can train on roller blades. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg is very independent," says Lizama, his guide for the past three years. 
"On the slopes he's really aggressive and likes to go for it. He's the same way 
in his living skills. We lived together last winter. He was never timid walking 
around the room and he always figured out how to get to the local lodges and 
the Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
"One time at a restaurant, he got mad at me over something we were discussing 
and just took off. He wasn't afraid to go alone." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't surprise Lizama. "Greg," he says, "is definitely not scared of 
the unknown."
