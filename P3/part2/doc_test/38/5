American racers dominated the World Disabled Ski Championships, which ended 
this week at Winter Park, Colo., taking a total of 83 medals, more than twice 
the number earned by runner-up West Germany, which had 37. 
</P>
<P>
Southland competitors contributed substantially to the U.S. team's success -- 
which included 35 gold medals to West Germany's 16 -- in several divisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Evangelatos, 28, of Sherman Oaks, who is blind, earned a gold medal in 
the super-G and a bronze in the giant slalom, a performance that also netted 
him a gold in the combined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Kiley, 36, of LaVerne, a paraplegic athlete who races on a monoski, 
came away with golds in the super-G and the slalom and a silver in the giant 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Mannino, 27, of Yorba Linda, who had one leg amputated above the knee, 
got a couple of bronzes, in the super-G and the downhill, as West German 
Alexander Spitz swept all four events in this category -- as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cathy Gentile, 27, of Torrance, also an above-the-knee amputee, won the 
gold medal in the downhill when favored Diana Golden fell, then wound up with 
the combined gold by placing second in the super-G and the slalom and sixth in 
the giant slalom -- as Golden won all three. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the medalists in the world championships, which First Interstate Bank 
brought to the United States for the first time, are en route east for the 
weeklong Chap Stick U.S. Disabled Ski Championships, which begin Sunday at 
Stratton Mountain, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos, who swept the gold medals in his division at last year's 
nationals, will not be able to defend his titles, however. He broke his 
collarbone in a finish-line collision with his guide after winning the super-G 
at Winter Park and needs about three months' healing time before resuming 
training for next season on Mt. Hood in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors permitted him to race in the giant slalom Tuesday, with one arm taped 
to his side, but only on the condition that he then take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
"And I got the bronze," Evangelatos said from Denver. "Not bad for a one-armed 
skier." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos, who lost his sight in a fireworks accident when he was 18, trains 
in Colorado during the winter and attends L.A. City College in the off-season. 
He is a volunteer worker with the Foundation for the Junior Blind's summer camp 
program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be a role model for totally blind children, helping them to realize 
their recreational capabilities and to understand that they can make their 
dreams come true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kiley also works with the disabled, heading the wheelchair sports program at 
the Casa Colina rehabilitation center in Pomona. He is proficient in several 
sports and has only recently added skiing to his activities. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a World Cup slalom Thursday at Geilo, Norway, Alberto Tomba told 
the Associated Press: "It's Mother's Day in Italy today, so I dedicate this 
victory to my mother and all women in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, 23, who has apparently regained the form that earned him two gold medals 
in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, and the other male racers are scheduled 
to compete in a super-G today at Hemsedal, Norway, and in a slalom Monday at 
Salen, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., finished seventh at Geilo, two places 
ahead of Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen, who last weekend clinched his fourth 
World Cup overall title -- equaling the record of Italian Gustavo Thoeni. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the "White Circus" will race in a giant slalom today and a slalom 
Sunday at Stranda, Norway, where a heavy snowfall forced postponement of 
Friday's scheduled downhill. 
</P>
<P>
After a slalom Tuesday at Vemdalen, Sweden, and a giant slalom Wednesday at 
Klovsjo, Sweden, the women will join the men for the World Cup finals next 
weekend at Are, Sweden. 
</P>
