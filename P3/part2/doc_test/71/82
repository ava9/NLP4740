  [Text] Residential areas of Kabul city were the target of 
heavy weapons fired by Golboddin-Dostam militia last night. 
  An official source in the Kabul garrison told a BAKHTAR 
military correspondent that missiles were fired on Kabul city 
from the south and southwest, from areas under the control of 
the shameful militias of Golboddin-Dostam. As a result a number 
of our compatriots were martyred and injured. 
  The report adds that in addition to the loss of life, four 
houses located in the 2d and 11th wards of Kabul city were also 
destroyed in the course of the missile attack.
