  [Text] Ten members of Golboddin's militia were killed in 
Kabul yesterday when a mine exploded. Eyewitnesses told a 
BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY [BIA] correspondent that Golboddin's 
militia members were killed as they were trying to steal 
equipment and electricity lines from the Breshnakot electricity 
distribution center. The mine had been planted by militia 
members. In addition to the loss of life, the explosion also 
destroyed one of their vehicles. 
  The BIA correspondent says that members of Golboddin's 
militia have previously clashed over the distribution of 
equipment from Breshankot, Jangalak factories, and Afghan 
carpentry (?workshops) and have mined one another's areas. As a 
result, several militia members have been killed and dozens of 
others injured.
