  [Text] The Supreme Court of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan [ISA] condemns the Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin coup 
attempt, and considers the ISA a legal government. The court 
describes the uprising against the ISA as a rebellion and its 
perpetrators as rebels. According to a report by Bakhtar 
Information Agency, the leadership and officials of the Supreme 
Court of the ISA held a session at the headquarters of the 
Supreme Court yesterday. In the meeting they insisted that 
because the president of the ISA has been elected by the 
Resolution and Settlement Council, and later this election was 
approved under different agreements by leaders and jihadi 
parties or their representatives, obedience to him is the 
Islamic duty of all citizens of the country. As a high judicial 
source of the country, the Supreme Court supports the order of 
the president for jihad against the infamous triangle of 
Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin, and it asks our all faithful people to 
take part in this holy jihad.
