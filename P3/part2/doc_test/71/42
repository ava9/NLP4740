  In today's meeting the current problems of the country were 
comprehensively discussed and necessary decisions were taken 
unanimously. The following statement was approved at the 
meeting: 
  1. The recent armed rebellion that was launched by militia 
of the 53d Division and communists belonging to the Babrak 
Karmal wing in an attempt to topple the Islamic state, is 
condemned and rejected. Rebellion against Islamic sovereignty 
is considered war against God and corruption on earth. 
  2. Jihad declared by the head of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan against atheist conspirators is affirmed. 
  3. Every communist belonging to Khalq-Parcham groups or 
other leftist organizations who proves that he is still loyal to 
their atheistic beliefs and launches struggle and conspiracy 
against the Islamic government is deprived of the privilege of 
general amnesty. They can be tried as apostates and traitors. 
  4. Every sort of foul interference, provocative action, and 
foul propaganda that is carried out by foreign sources is 
considered condemned and rejected. 
  5. All Islamic formations, jihadi brothers, and independent 
social personalities are asked to take active part in this 
sacred jihad to reject atheist individuals and groups.
