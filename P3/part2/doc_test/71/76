  [Text] Airplanes of the Islamic State of Afghanistan Air 
Force bombarded civilian and military airfields of Dostam's 
militia in the area surrounding Mazar-e Sharif. A Ministry of 
National Defense source told BIA's military correspondent that 
fighter planes of the country's air force inflicted crushing 
blows at civilian and military airfields and installations in 
the area surrounding Mazar-e Sharif today. As a result of those 
successful operations, the runways of the airfields have been 
completely destroyed, and planes and installations in the fields 
have been heavily damaged. During the successful operation, 
dozens of militia, stationed in the airfields, have been killed, 
and one fuel store of the militia was set ablaze.
