  [Text] Esteemed Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani, leader of the 
Mahaz-e Meli-ye Eslami [National Islamic Front], asks for a 
cease-fire, first of all, for solving the country's current 
problems. After meeting the UN secretary general's special 
envoy in Peshawar, Pir Gaylani in his interview with a VOA 
reporter said: After the cease-fire a Loya Jerga [great council] 
or an urgent invited council should be set up. The council 
should have the power to appoint the future government and its 
leader, in order to take the place of the present government 
after the end of term of esteemed professor Borhanoddin 
Rabbani's leadership. Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani further said: 
The above Shura council is to start work under the supervision 
of the United Nations and Conference of the Islamic Countries 
and is to take urgent action for the restoration of security. He 
added: The future government can devise the constitution through 
the Loya Jerga, in which the people's genuine representatives 
can take part. Thus, the ground will be prepared for a free 
election.
