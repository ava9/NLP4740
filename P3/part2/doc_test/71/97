  [Text] Two fortified positions of Dostam's militia were 
captured this morning by the mojahedin and the forces of the 
Islamic army. Security sources reported to the BIA military 
correspondent that on top of gaining control of two fortified 
positions of Dostam's militia, capturing some strategic points, 
and killing dozens of the militia near the old town of Baghlan, 
the mojahedin and the forces of the Islamic army continue their 
advance toward the old city of Baghlan. In the course of this 
operation some heavy and light weapons of the militia have been 
captured by the devotees of Islam. Security sources added that 
due to the loss of the control of those positions, the moral of 
the militia was extremely weakened and that they mostly abandon 
their positions and trenches without any resistance and escape.
