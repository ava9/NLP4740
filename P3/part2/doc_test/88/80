Helena Bonham-Carter was a bit wary when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her as 
the tragic Ophelia opposite Mel Gibson's melancholy Dane in Shakespeare's 
"Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Franco would try to make me into this decorative thing," the petite 
British actress explains. "But, in fact, he sort of allowed me to make her a 
strong character. She can be quite wimpy and passive. There is no space these 
days to play Ophelia too passive or too obedient or too vapid. She has to have 
spirit and character." 
</P>
<P>
Bonham-Carter, who previously appeared in "Lady Jane" and "Room With a View," 
is annoyed with audiences' usual reaction to Ophelia. "They want to dismiss 
her," she says. "There's not much compassion or respect for her. She is done a 
disservice and I wanted to champion her." 
</P>
<P>
The actress believes Ophelia goes mad because she is not allowed to have any 
sexual feelings. "Then Hamlet dumps on her all of these feelings about his 
mother," she says. "If Hamlet had said, 'I got a bit of a problem,' it would 
have been great. He and Ophelia would have been able to talk about it. Instead, 
Ophelia thinks it's all her fault -- Hamlet's madness and his rejection of her 
and his killing her father. She can just imagine it's over her. I think it 
would be great to rewrite the play from Ophelia's point of view." 
</P>

Ophelia's death scene took four days to film. "I didn't have any lines because 
I was dead, but it was difficult to stay still," Bonham-Carter quips. It was 
also difficult not to laugh. "I didn't laugh until it was my close-up. I had 
been lying there for four days and they had almost forgotten about me. Then 
Franco put the cameras on me and then he decides to have a wind blowing across 
my face. That was created by Franco blowing across me like a cherub. There's a 
term called 'corpsing' in the business and that is when you break down in 
uncontrollable giggles. I gave new meaning to the word."SUSAN KING
