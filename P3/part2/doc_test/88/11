Shakespeare Company

An upbeat Adrian Noble unveiled yesterday his first full programme as
artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Sir Peter Hall returning
to Stratford after twenty four years to direct All's Well That Ends Well at
the Swan; Terry Hands returning after 24 months to direct Antony Sher in
Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great, also at the Swan; and Kenneth Branagh
playing Hamlet, again, at the Barbican in Adrian Noble's first production of
the play, are among the highlights.
The five Shakespeare plays opening at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in
Stratford include Antony and Cleopatra for the first time since 1978, with
Richard Johnson and Clare Higgins in the title roles. Also on offer are The
Taming of the Shrew, As You Like It, The Winter's Tale, and Merry Wives of
Windsor.
The Swan, which had a very successful 1991, presents its first musical, The
Beggar's Opera, and a revival of A Jovial Crew, written in 1641 and last
revived in 1724. It marks the Stratford directorial debut of Max
Stafford-Clark.
The Other Place has a production of Richard III, with Simon Russell Beale as
the King, which will tour the country when a sponsor can be found, plus two
new works, The Odyssey, a reworking of the Greek myth by the Caribbean poet
Derek Walcott, and The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, which is set in the
London of Christopher Marlowe.
Apart from Hamlet the Barbican has transfers from last year's Stratford
season, with the exception of Julius Caesar and Twelfth Night which were not
reckoned to be worth the trip. There are also two premieres, Columbus by
Richard Nelson and a play, not yet titled, by Peter Shaffer, which will also
be directed by Sir Peter Hall.
Despite the Pounds 3m deficit which hangs over the RSC, Adrian Noble was in
bullish mood. Audiences were up in 1991, when the Company played to over one
million people, and the year will show a small profit. Noble is making minor
innovations both in opening a Shakespeare play - Hamlet - in London and then
transferring it to Stratford in 1993, and by building up successes from last
year's season at the Swan, such as The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The
Alchemist, for the big stage at the Barbican rather than condemning them to
the Pit.
