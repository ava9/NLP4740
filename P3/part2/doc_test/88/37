The chairman of a Commons committee considering the Pounds 2bn CrossRail
plan for an east-west underground railway link across London yesterday
dismissed claims that the project is doomed.
Mr Tony Marlow, chairman of a committee of MPs considering a bill providing
for the link between British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street
stations, said the committee was 'nowhere near reaching any decision on
anything'.
Mr Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, spoke after reports
that the committee had accepted evidence that the link would be uneconomic.
His assurance was welcomed by London Transport and British Rail, the
promoters of the bill, which was tabled after Mr John Major, prime minister,
overruled a Treasury attempt to block the project.
The link is regarded as essential by British Rail but Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, argued that the benefits would not justify
the proposed public investment of Pounds 1bn.
Observers of the committee, which has been sitting for several weeks, say
members have, however, taken a sceptical approach to the project.
The main critic of the bill, Tower Hamlets council in east London, says the
link would cause more congestion than it would relieve.
The council argues that the link should join the proposed high-speed rail
line from London to the Channel tunnel at Stratford, in east London.
The committee is expected to take a decision on the Tower Hamlets argument
after Easter, after further evidence from British Rail and London Transport.
But Mr Marlow told Mr Steven Norris, the London Transport minister, last
Wednesday that the project might not 'stand up' unless this link was agreed.
The bill's promoters yesterday argued that CrossRail would provide greater
benefits than projects such as London's Victoria Line and the Newcastle
Metro. Tower Hamlets disputed the promoters' figures.
