FT  20 DEC 93 / Lib Dems under attack over racism inquiry

The Liberal Democrat leadership was last night besieged by complaints from
the Labour party - and its own councillors in the London borough of Tower
Hamlets - that it had mishandled allegations of racism against its members.
The Liberal Democrats published an inquiry into racism in the borough last
week but Ms Gwynneth Deakins, who chairs Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat
group, said that two party councillors had quit 'in disgust' at the weekend
and a third councillor, who was severely censured in the report, would
'fight to clear his name'.
Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the majority Liberal Democrats on the council,
last night issued a statement which strongly criticised the national
leadership and said: 'If any group members resign from the party we would
continue as a single group and maintain the administration of the council.'
A meeting of local Liberal Democrats last night moved to set up a breakaway
group, Liberal Focus.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday pressed home his
claim that the inquiry had censured the party leadership for 'incompetence
or worse'.
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the party, said the matter had been
investigated thoroughly following the Tower Hamlets by-election which
resulted in the far-right British National party winning a seat. He told BBC
1's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'We have been accused of circulating
racist literature. We set up an inquiry. It reported, we published it in
full and we are taking action.'
He accused Labour leaders of covering up an inquiry into their party's
conduct in the September council election. 'Jack Straw, who is accusing us
of not having dealt with this properly, knows that Labour has had an
internal inquiry,' he said. 'They are not publishing it and we don't know if
they are taking any action.'
Mr Straw highlighted a section of the Liberal Democrats' report that accused
Mr Graham Elson, the party's general-secretary, of 'failing in his duty'
when he was checking the distribution of allegedly racist pamphlets at a
by-election this year.
Liberal Democrat leaders were reported to be furious that Mr Straw had
requested Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to refer the allegations
against Liberal Democrat councillors to the Metropolitan police on the
grounds of incitement to racism.
Scotland Yard said on Friday night that the attorney-general had referred
the matter to it. The Liberal Democrat leadership said the referral was 'of
a standard nature in response to any such approach from an MP'.
