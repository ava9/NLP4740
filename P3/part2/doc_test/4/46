A CHALLENGE to President Lee Teng-hui's leadership of the ruling Kuomintang
Nationalist Party has widened internal divisions which pose a growing threat
to the party's 44-year hold on power in Taiwan.
Delegates to the KMT's 14th congress, which opened yesterday, said that they
were seeking sufficient signatures to nominate a rebel candidate - Mr Chang
Feng-shu, 65, a former minister of state and mayor of Taipei  - in
tomorrow's elections for the party chairmanship.
Mr Lee is expected to retain the post. But the dissidents' move underlined
growing anger within the party at the slow pace of democratic reform and of
measures against corruption. In last December's parliamentary election, the
KMT's share of the vote fell to a record low partly because of popular
disquiet about corruption.
Unrest within the party was highlighted last week when six prominent members
of parliament broke away to form the New Party, saying the KMT had become
corrupt and paid too much attention to interests of wealthy businessmen.
Mr Lee acknowledged yesterday that the party was threatened by internal
factional struggles and growing political opposition.
'In recent years, pluralism in society has led to differences in political
ideology among our comrades, posing a severe challenge to us in elections,'
he told the congress.
'Implementing internal reform is more difficult than tackling external
challenges. But our goal has been set and we must overcome all obstacles,'
Mr Lee said.
The congress is expected to drop most of the 12 'mainlanders' - veterans who
fled to Taiwan with General Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 when the Communists took
power in China - from the 31-member Central Standing Committee. This will
virtually complete the transfer of power from the veterans to local-born
politicians such as Mr Lee.
The internal travails are partly a reflection of this transfer, as Taiwanese
people take an increasingly pragmatic view about relations with China. The
New Party is advocating direct transport links.
