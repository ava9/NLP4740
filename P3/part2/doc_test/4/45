  [Text] A House Foreign Affairs Committee member yesterday 
claimed that Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui's "private holiday" 
to Thailand would only benefit a certain political party. 
Kuthep Saikrachang, the deputy House committee spokesman, made 
the comment to Parliament reporters but refused to identify the 
party. He said that during the last general election campaign, 
a rumour was spread nationwide that some countries could "buy" 
Thailand through some political parties that have spent "huge" 
sums of money to win elections. 
  Mr Kuthep who is also Phalang Tham MP for Si Sa Ket, said he 
did not know if Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, deputy leader 
of the PDP, was told in advance of the Taiwanese leader's trip. 
He also denied that PDP members have vested Interests in Taiwan. 
  Other House committee members also questioned why some New 
Aspiration Party MPs and executives were seen at the dinner 
meeting hosted on Valentine's Day at the Pacific Island Resort 
Hotel in Phuket. 
  The NAP's Labour and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong led a Thai delegation consisting of MPs and job 
placement agency owners to Taiwan last year to seek more work 
positions on the island nation for Thai workers. 
  Mr Kuthep told the press that the House committee would next 
Wednesday invite Deputy Premier Amnuai Wirawan, Sqn Ldr Prasong, 
and Mr Phaithun to give testimony about their alleged 
involvement with the Taiwanese delegation. 
  Mr Amnuai was present at the party at the Pacific Island 
Resort Hotel in Phuket while Mr Phaithun has denied that he 
attended the meeting. The House committee deputy spokesman said 
the Taiwanese leader's trip has prompted China's House Foreign 
Committee to postpone its trip to Thailand from February 23 to 
March 1. The postponement was seen by the Thai House committee 
as a protest by the Chinese delegation. Mr Kuthep insisted that 
his House committee would again invite the Chinese delegation to 
visit the kingdom.
