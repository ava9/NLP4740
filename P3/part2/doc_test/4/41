<F P=106> [By Yu Chao-chi (0151 0340 0679): "High-Level Talks Will Be </F>
Held Between the Two Sides of the Strait"] 
  [Excerpt] 
<H3>  There Will Be High-Level Talks Between the Two 
Sides of the Strait </H3>
  "There is likely to be high-level contact between the 
decision-making hierarchies on both sides of the strait later 
this year," a senior official told this reporter in Beijing. 
  "High-level, naturally, means higher than the level of 
either 
Wang-Koo talks or Chiao-Tang talks. Under the current 
situation, playing for time is unfavorable to Taiwan and the 
international environment is also unfavorable to it. In recent 
months, Sino-U.S. relations have taken a turn for the better, 
China and France have normalized their relations, Lesotho has 
restored diplomatic relations with China, and South Africa is 
deliberating the issue of establishing diplomatic relations 
soon. As far as Taiwan is concerned, the closer Hong Kong gets 
to 1997, the greater will be the impact on Taiwan. Furthermore, 
the drastic increase in contacts between the two sides of the 
strait has made it impossible for them not to talk to each 
other. The higher the level of talks, the bigger the issues 
which can be solved and the easier it will be for Taiwan to 
extricate itself from a passive situation." In short, "so long 
as we sit down and hold talks, everything can be discussed." The 
senior official further said: "Since the reorganization of the 
Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, with Jiang Zemin 
taking over from Yang Shangkun as head, Qian Qichen as deputy 
head, and Wang Zhaoguo handling routine work, new people have 
new work styles. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping's policy 
decision, China's work toward Taiwan will forge ahead more 
quickly this year." 
<H3>  Before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai 
Contacted Taiwan on the Issue of Reunification Through a Certain 
Channel </H3>
  For many years past, Luo Qingchang was responsible for both 
the central investigation department and the work toward Taiwan, 
the two sensitive departments of the CPC. He disclosed that, 
before the "Cultural Revolution," Mao and Zhou contacted Taiwan 
through a certain channel to discuss the issue of reunification. 
The contact was later suspended as a result of the "Cultural 
Revolution." In 1994, contacts between the two sides of the 
strait have increased in every aspect and the level is also 
higher. Further talks and consultations at a high level have 
become an irresistible trend. 
  Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations 
Across 
the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], also looks forward to meeting Koo 
Chen-fu again this year to solve differences, consolidate 
achievements, widen the scope of consensus, and to make 
preparations to hold a joint economic fair. He hopes that, in 
marching toward a new century, we should not, due to political 
differences, bungle the good opportunity of bringing benefits to 
the Chinese nation. 
<H5>  "Vacationing Diplomacy" Draws the Attention of the CPC </H5>
  As cross-strait exchanges increase in frequency, the level 
of 
contacts has also higher. Early this year, Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the 
CPC Central Committee, and Nan Zhenzhong, deputy president and 
editor in chief of XINHUA News Agency, visited Taiwan in turn 
leading the delegations, and ARATS and the Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] have also started new contacts. Following the 
secret meeting between Chang Chien-pang, member of the 
Kuomintang [KMT] Central Standing Committee, and Jiang Zemin, 
high-level Taiwan personnel are again deliberating on new trips 
to the mainland. 
  In the meantime, however, Taiwan "President" Li Teng-hui, 
"Executive Yuan President" Lien Chan, "Economic Planning and 
Development Council" Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang, "Information 
Bureau" chief Hu Chih-chiang, and others have been, or are 
going, to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the name of 
"spending their vacations" to "coordinate and adjust policies" 
and "pursue pragmatic diplomacy." 
  Taiwan's recent "vacationing diplomacy" and "south-bound 
policy" have drawn the close attention of the CPC. Wang 
Zhaoguo, director of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs and 
head of the United Front Work Department, has criticized Taiwan 
for attempting to create, under the pretext of solving practical 
affairs, the so- called "independent sovereignty" and "equal 
judicial jurisdiction" to attain the objective of "two equal 
political entities." 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Reaffirms That Taiwan Will Not Be Allowed To 
Become Independent </H3>
  Deng Xiaoping said: The problem with Li Teng-hui is that he 
practices "two Chinas." "One China, one Taiwan," "one country, 
two governments," "independent political entity," and even the 
recent "vacationing diplomacy" are all manifestations of overtly 
and covertly practicing "two Chinas," which is, naturally, 
unworkable. 

<H5>    Beijing Works Out Policies in Light of Taiwan's Reality </H5>
  China's basic policies regarding Taiwan work are "one 
China," 
"peaceful reunification," and "one country, two systems." In 
the view of the CPC, there is only one China in the world and 
the central government is in Beijing. This is a precondition 
for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue. The "two systems 
coexist" under "one country," with Taiwan and the mainland 
preserving their own original system. They should "coexist for 
a long time and attain common development, with neither 
swallowing the other." Under the present circumstances, however, 
the CPC will never renounce the use of force against Taiwan. 
Especially if foreign forces interfere in Taiwan's internal 
affairs and Taiwan breaks away and becomes independent, it is 
even more necessary to be prepared. Now, if the central 
authorities renounce the use of force, it would hamper 
reunification and the Taiwan independence forces will become 
even more dizzy with success. 
  As the CPC top hierarchy sees it, in light of the latest 
developments in Taiwan, it is necessary to realistically 
understand changes in Taiwan's situation today. The elderly KMT 
party, government, and army leaders, who retreated to Taiwan in 
1949, have withdrawn from the political arena one after another. 
Those in charge in Taiwan today are from the third and fourth 
generations. Many of them are either native Taiwanese or were 
born in Taiwan. They are profoundly affected by Western 
influence in terms of education, culture, and ideology. This 
generation is different from the previous "older-level" figures 
and so the Chinese side should approach them differently. 
Having a thousand and one links with the mainland, the 
"older-level" figures of the KMT have a strong anti- Communist 
feeling. The new generation, however, has fewer ties with the 
mainland and they hold weaker anti-Communist sentiments. Their 
local mentality and their concept of "Taiwan first" are more 
conspicuous but they should not on this count be regarded as 
engaging in "Taiwan independence." 
<H5>  Carry Out Contacts With All Parties and Factions </H5>
  According to the CPC top hierarchy, given the party politics 
in Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] has a certain 
number of supporters. Under this new situation, in its work 
toward Taiwan, the CPC should not just have dealings with the 
KMT but should have contacts with all parties and factions, 
including the DPP and the New Party and, in the process of 
contact and work among them, try to quicken the pace of China's 
reunification. 
<H3>  Make Preparations for Direct Shipping By Setting Up an 
Economic and Trade Coordination Group </H3>
  Given that China's comprehensive national power and people's 
economic life are continuously improving, the cross-strait 
business has accelerated, and exchange visits have drastically 
increased, the CPC top hierarchy has suggested that the State 
Council should speedily set up a Taiwan Economic and Trade 
Coordination Group to coordinate business affairs with Taiwan 
and create a better investment environment. In light of the 
increasingly close cross- strait business contacts, the central 
authorities have agreed to the setting up of a joint venture 
bank and, in keeping with the latest development in the 
situation, to make all preparations for three communications, 
further boost peace talks through trade, exchange, and contact, 
and strive for the early reunification between the two sides of 
the strait. [passage omitted]
