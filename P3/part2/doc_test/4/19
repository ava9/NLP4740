Relations

RELATIONS between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were, until recently,
relatively straightforward. Both sides laid claim to the other's territory
and both were locked in a theological debate about who were the rightful
rulers of 'all China'.
Taiwan's rapid industrialisation, as well as China's economic reform, have,
however, significantly complicated the issues. Cold War-era antipathies are
being submerged by today's booming - although officially indirect - trade
across the Taiwan Straits with mainland China.
At the same time, Taiwan, with its new-found wealth and democratic liberties
is anxious to achieve western recognition and play a fuller role in the
world community. Yet movement on this front is largely dependent upon
Taiwan's status in relation to China.
The simplicity of the past has been replaced by hand wringing and confusion
in Taiwan about how to deal with the 'China question'. No longer
incommunicado, Taipei and Beijing are committed to promoting greater
understanding between their peoples. Yet critical questions remain. Taiwan
is asking itself at what pace contacts with mainland China should proceed,
and what the ultimate result of increasing contacts will be.
Relations between Taiwan and the mainland have become the most divisive
issue in Taiwanese society and politics, leading to the recent fracturing of
the ruling Kuomingtang (KMT) party and weakening business support for the
government.
To fully understand what is happening in Taiwan, one needs an acute sense of
the difference between appearance and reality, of words and deeds. The
current KMT leadership under the guidance of President Lee Teng-hui says its
wants a reunited China. But its every action suggests that what it really
seeks is an independent Taiwan, in part to placate the increasingly powerful
DPP opposition party. This was best exemplified last month by Taiwan's
abortive attempt to seek membership of the United Nations, from which it was
ejected in 1971 when the communist government of the mainland replaced it as
the representative of China. Re-entry into the UN represents Taiwan's
ambition to achieve broad international recognition of its sovereignty.
In the event, China voiced strong objections, saying that admitting Taiwan
to the UN would set an 'abominable precedent' and would interfere in China's
internal affairs. The steering committee of the UN General Assembly declined
to put Taiwan on its agenda, dismissing the issue without even voting.
Taiwan's was backed by a handful of Central American nations with strong
economic ties: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua. These, together with several African nations, constitute the rump
of the international community which still affords Taiwan full diplomatic
recognition.
Most western countries have only de facto relations with Taiwan, stationing
officials in Taipei at quasi embassies called trade offices and limiting
official diplomatic contacts.
The US and Europe (with the exception of the Vatican) recognise Beijing as
the sole legal government of China, including Taiwan. Western democracies
are keen to take full advantage of the huge potential for trade and
investment that China's economic reforms have created. Rather than risk
conflict with China, the US, which is Taiwan's greatest supporter in the
developed world, has warned the Taipei government that its attempt to
penetrate the UN and its system of multilateral agencies is ill judged.
'It would be unwise (of Taiwan) to confront the Clinton administration with
a choice between Beijing and Taipei,' said Professor Ralph Clough of Johns
Hopkins University at a recent conference. 'Taiwan's long-term interests
will be better served and US support more easily maintained by continuing
the existing policy of pursuing economic and other interaction with mainland
China, while at the same time seeking an improved position in the
international community.'
Nevertheless, Taiwan is not giving up. 'We are fully aware that it would be
extremely difficult for us to achieve our goal to join the UN,' said
President Lee Teng-hui,' but we will. . . continue to work hard for our
cause.'
Echoing the sentiment, Mr I-Jen Chiou, a senior opposition DPP official,
says: 'We do not think we can join the UN easily. Maybe we will need 10 or
20 years of effort. We quite understand we have a long battle to fight, but
we want to take the first steps.'
The government's decision to push for UN membership and alleged foot
dragging on closer commercial contacts with the mainland is cited as one of
the reasons for this summer's split in the ruling KMT. A number of leading
members left to form the China New Party.
Mr Chao Shau Kang, leader of the New Party, believes that the government is
wasting precious time in delaying more substantive talks with Beijing. 'We
have the advantage now; if we wait another three years then our advantage
will be less and we will lose our bargaining chip,' he says.
His view finds widespread support among business people who believe the
government is powerless to stop economic integration across the Taiwan
Straits. Trade between the two is growing rapidly. China is now Taiwan's
fastest growing export market - exports were 20 per cent up in the first
eight months of this year compared with a year ago - and the second-largest
market in terms of size. It is forecast to be worth more than Dollars 8bn
this year.
Where trade flows so, too, does investment. There are no reliable figures on
the actual amount of Taiwanese investment which has flowed to the mainland
since restrictions were relaxed, but the Mainland Affairs Council thinks it
could be as much as Dollars 20bn.
The intensity of interest in China is underlined by recent mainland figures
putting Taiwanese investment in Shanghai at more than Dollars 1bn in the
first eight months of the year, more than the entire stock of Taiwanese
investment in the previous eight years.
It is further underlined by Taiwan's retailers organising for a big push
into mainland retailing. Well-known stores such as 7-Eleven and less well
known ones such as Wua Shin Steak House, will soon be trading in especially
designated 'Taiwan shopping streets' in Beijing and Shanghai.
Mr Jack Huang, managing partner of the US law firm Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;
Pogue, says: 'The government should lift restrictions on investment. They
were a nice idea - a nice try - but it is clear today that China can get
investment from anywhere in the world. Our investment is not that critical;
our technology is not more advanced than what China can get from elsewhere.
The fact is that Taiwan business has a greater need to go into China than
China needs the business.'
Like many business people who value the political liberalisation of the past
five years, he thinks the challenge facing the government is how to prolong
the process of inevitable integration to ensure that when unification comes,
it poses no threat to Taiwan's newly won liberties. Others fear that
Taiwan's economy will become increasingly linked to that of the mainland,
intensifying its dependency upon the Chinese market and giving Beijing
unacceptable power over Taiwan.
Clearly, Taiwan's relations with China, and therefore the rest of the world,
are now being shaped by economic trends rather than the territorial disputes
of the past. It is not clear that Taiwan knows quite what to do about it.
