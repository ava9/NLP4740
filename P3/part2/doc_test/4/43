  [Text] Taipei, March 24 KYODO -- Taiwan President Li 
Teng-hui called Thursday [24 March] for improved ties with 
Japan, telling a group of Japanese parliamentarians he wants to 
see the Japanese people develop better feelings about their 
neighbors to the south. 
  Members of the inter-party group of eight Japanese 
legislators said Li made the remarks in a 45-minute meeting with 
them. 
  The group arrived in Taipei on Tuesday to discuss the issue 
of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled debts, including postal 
savings deposited by Taiwanese before and during World War II. 
  Their talks on the issue Wednesday with 18 Taiwan 
legislators 
headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of the National Assembly, ended 
inconclusively. 
  Li was quoted as thanking the Japanese parliamentarians for 
facing the tough issue head-on, despite tough remarks directed 
at them by the Taiwanese side. 
  Such remarks, he said, probably stem from dissatisfaction 
with the Japanese Government's "cool" stance towards Taiwan 
after Taiwan severed relations with Japan in 1972. 
  He noted that Taiwan, unlike other former Japanese colonial 
possessions, has not brought up with Japan the issue of 
compensation for women who were forced to provide sex for 
frontline Japanese soldiers during the war.
