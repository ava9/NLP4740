Voters opted for stability in Taiwanese local elections on Saturday as the
ruling party retained an overall majority despite losing the mayoralty of
the capital Taipei to Mr Chen Shui-bian, a legislator from the leading
opposition party.
Mr James Soong, the incumbent candidate of the governing Kuomintang (KMT),
easily won the polls for the provincial governorship with 56.3 per cent of
votes in what was interpreted as an affirmation of the status quo in the
island's delicate relations with China. The victory for mainland-born Mr
Soong also helped heal ethnic divisions between native Taiwanese and recent
immigrants from China which flared during the campaign.
The poll was the first for provincial governor and the first in three
decades for mayors of the municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, a southern
port city. The KMT retained a majority of seats in the assemblies of
Kaohsiung city and Taiwan province, but lost its majority in the Taipei city
assembly.
The Democratic Progressive party (DPP) appeared to be moving towards the
political centre on winning its first important administrative post since
political reforms began with the lifting of martial law in 1987. Mr Chen,
who had been involved with the dissident movement from the late 1970s,
played down the party's traditional advocacy of Taiwanese independence in
his victory speech.
Mr Chen's election to the mayoral post is doubly significant as he will
participate in cabinet meetings - the first time a DPP member has been able
to do so.
The polls, regarded as an important milestone in Taiwan's democratisation,
went off peacefully despite widespread allegations of vote-buying.
Mr Parris Chang, a DPP legislator, called the result a 'political and
psychological victory' for the leading opposition group. 'The KMT has so
many more resources, organisationally and financially, that there's no way
we can compete with them in the provincial election,' he said, alluding to
the ruling party's strong grassroots political machine.
The outcome had been predicted by pundits and thus had been largely
discounted by financial markets. 'The stock market's reaction should be
generally bullish,' said Mr William McGrath, general manager of the Taiwan
representative office of S G Warburg Securities.
Mr Chen yesterday pledged to gather a group of Taiwanese and foreign experts
to conduct a comprehensive investigation of Taipei's corruption-plagued
urban mass transit system. A 'red paper' detailing the team's findings would
be released to the public.
Prof Hu Fo, a political analyst at National Taiwan University, said these
elections represented little change in the existing balance among the
political parties but legislative elections in late 1995 would be crucial.
'Opposition parties could topple the KMT's absolute majority in parliament,
potentially leading to the appointment of a prime minister from the
opposition and a reduction in the power of the president,' he said.
The reaction of China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory in
rebel hands, is likely to be muted.
