FT  18 AUG 93 / Old guard hangs on: Political infighting in Taiwan

Taiwan's Kuomintang, the ruling nationalist party, has overseen the island's
extraordinary economic development since it was driven out of China by the
Communists in 1949. But internal disputes are threatening to tear it apart
and end its dominance.
President Lee Teng-hui, addressing the party's 14th congress this week,
acknowledged that the party was plagued by factional struggles.
'Implementing internal reform (of the party) is more difficult than tackling
external challenges,' he said.
The pressures on the KMT are similar to those faced by a number of
long-standing ruling parties in Asian countries, where rapidly growing
prosperity has fostered pluralism, democratisation, and a distaste for
corruption.
In Japan, disillusionment with the Liberal Democratic party, especially over
corruption in high places, has just ended its long hold on power. In South
Korea, President Kim Young-sam, the opposition campaigner who became the
candidate of the ruling conservative party, has launched a crackdown on
bureaucratic corruption. Even in China, the communist government has found
it necessary to take a stern line on official malpractice, which has
mushroomed in the current economic boom.
'A lot of the old ruling parties are going to have to come to terms with the
corruption that they tolerated and indeed benefited from,' says Mr Peter
Ferdinand, director of the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London.
In Taiwan, there is an additional element in domestic political struggles:
the relationship with mainland China. The opposition Democratic Progressive
party has called for a formal declaration of independence from China. The
KMT is officially against this, although factions within it differ on how
strongly to oppose such a move. All are conscious that Beijing, for which
the top long-term foreign policy goal is reabsorption of Taiwan, would view
with great concern any shift which looked likely to lead to a formal
declaration of independence.
Last week, six members of the Yuan, Taiwan's legislature, broke away to
establish the New party, attacking the KMT's corruption. One of them, Mr Lee
Ching-hwa, son of a reformer prime minister, said: 'The old KMT is going in
the direction of money politics, dictatorial policies and Taiwan
independence, while the New party is opposed to all of these.'
This week's congress has shown that their departure has not ended internal
dissidence. President Lee had to give way to rebels yesterday and make
concessions on the election of party vice-chairmen. They are likely to be
leaders of the faction harking back to the KMT's mainland origins, whose
influence he has been seeking to reduce.
The arguments within the party have been growing for decades. Until recent
years, the KMT's right to hold power and its methods were unquestioned. Its
leader, Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan with 2m soldiers, bureaucrats and
others in 1949, driven out by Mao Zedong. Their stay was intended to be only
temporary, the prelude to a return to the mainland, since they regarded
themselves as the rightful rulers of China. Firm government and martial law
were needed because of the constant military stand-off with the mainland.
But as the years have passed, that pretext has become outmoded. Though China
remains determined to reabsorb Taiwan, the threat of imminent military
action to achieve this goal has receded. Mr Chiang's son and successor,
Chiang Ching-kuo, realised that the KMT would have to strike roots in
Taiwan. People born in Taiwan have increasingly dominated the KMT,
displacing the 'mainlanders'.
Mr Lee, who took over as president in 1988, overcame resistance from
Chiang-era KMT elders to carry out political reforms including elections of
the National Assembly in December 1991 and the Legislative Yuan in December
1992. The effect has been to strengthen the power of Taiwan-born politicians
at the expense of those who saw Taiwan's future bound up in that of mainland
China.
While the KMT has yet to face a serious external challenge to its control,
its attempt to transform itself from an authoritarian revolutionary party
into an electoral machine has not been smooth. The congress is intended to
speed the process.
Its showing in last December's legislative elections, when the Democratic
Progressive party - the main opposition party - won 52 seats compared with
the KMT's 102, underlined growing disquiet at its policies and practices.
The KMT is finding it hard to adapt to democracy. Accustomed to decreeing
measures and seeing their successful implementation, it has found itself
forced to backtrack several times in recent months.
Its ambitious six-year Dollars 300bn (Pounds 201bn) plan for massive
improvement of the island's infrastructure has had to be delayed and scaled
down amid political and financing problems. Last month, parliamentary
defeats forced it to cancel a Dollars 17bn high-speed railway project.
Though the party has long had open factions, party leaders have been
accustomed to iron discipline. Now, however, they have found themselves
floundering in their dealings with dissidents.
The party has also been undermined by the success of its economic policies,
which have fostered highly efficient industrial companies. Independent
businessmen resent the preferential treatment afforded to companies within
the KMT's own extensive corporate holdings.
At the root of the KMT's problems, however, remain divisions between the
'mainlanders' and Taiwanese-born. Mr Lee has succeeded in putting virtually
all arms of government under the control of people who, like him, were born
in Taiwan. But yesterday's developments, and the formation of the New party,
have shown how difficult it is for him to exorcise the mainlanders'
influence.
There are few signs that the KMT leadership is taking firm action to produce
new policies and internal reforms which will satisfy the party's dissidents.
If it does not, it could face a growing electoral challenge from the New
party. A first test will be local elections later this year. Success for the
New party could create a three-party system representing a range of views on
China, from independence to closer links, perhaps with the KMT occupying the
middle ground.
The transition to a more complex democracy will be viewed closely by the
west - which wants to avoid Taiwan's status leading to eventual conflict
with China - and by the island's Asian neighbours, especially China itself.
Mr Ferdinand, of the Royal Institute, notes that 'the power of Taiwan to
serve as a model for the rest of China should not be underestimated'.
