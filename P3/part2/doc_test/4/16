FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (1): Strength wins recognition - In five
years the island has changed course. Once an autocracy, it is now a
quasi-democracy. Its frosty relations with mainland China have thawed, and
import and other barriers are slowly being removed. But there has been a
price to pay

JUST five years ago Taiwan was an autocracy run by the Nationalist
government which fled China's mainland after the civil war in 1949. The
economy was successful, but highly discriminatory against foreign
competition. Relations with the Chinese communists, who still regard Taiwan
as a renegade province, remained hostile and Taiwan's international standing
was at a nadir.
Today, Taiwan is a quasi democracy with its first Taiwanese, as opposed to
Chinese, president in Lee Teng-hui. Its economy remains successful, in spite
of world recession, while import and other barriers are slowly being
removed. Family visits and trade with China are growing rapidly and the two
sides are holding regular, if unofficial, talks. Last month, as a rites of
passage for the island's economic emergence, its application to join the
Gatt was accepted for serious consideration.
Such rapid change has not come without a price. To cope with new demands,
the government budget is in deficit for the first time in nearly 20 years.
As affluence has increased, Taiwan's saving rate has fallen from Asian to
western levels, and crime and divorce rates are both rising sharply.
Neither is Taiwan's future as a stable democracy secure. Infighting is
taking place within the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) about proposed presidential
elections in 1996. This, broadly speaking, pits conservative mainlanders
against more liberal Taiwanese party members. The KMT, guaranteed support
from government-owned television and big business, enjoys a monopoly on
power while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has yet to prove it
can act as a credible oppostion.
Meanwhile, China has not withdrawn its threat to use force against Taiwan,
especially if the island were formally to declare independence. Although the
Taiwanese are sure they do not want reunification with a communist China,
they are uncertain how to improve the relationship without radical changes
in China's ideological position.
December elections for the legislative yuan, or paliament, mark the next
test for the democratic reforms instituted by President Lee since 1987. The
old guard of legislators elected in China in 1947-48, who sat in the yuan
unchallenged and unchallenging for more than 40 years, were retired last
year making way for Taiwan's first fully representative parliamentary
elections for 161 seats.
The KMT is assured of victory, and campaigning is set to be less explosive
than in last year's election for the lower profile national assembly, which
adopts consitutional amendments. In those elections the DPP campaigned to
formalise Taiwan's present de facto independence, leading to angry rebukes
from China. But the independence call appeared to worry voters. This time
the DPP will concentrate on attacking ballooning government spending and
forecast tax increases stemming from a USDollars 303bn six-year national
development plan.
The plan is designed to redress a decade of neglect of the island's
transport and energy facilities, and improve its deteriorating environment.
Many of the projects are welcomed, especially those improving traffic jams
in the capital, Taipei. But it has been criticised for being hastily drawn
up and likely to add to inflation, which is heading for 4-5 per cent - high
by Taiwanese standards. Financing the plan pushed the government budget into
deficit last year, the first time in recent history. This year's deficit is
forecast to rise 33 per cent to nearly USDollars 14bn.
Nevertheless, increased government spending will ensure continued economic
growth. This is forecast to rise 7 per cent this year, after 7.3 per cent
last year. Unemployment will remain below 2 per cent, helped by a rapidly
expanding service sector. A resulting labour shortage suggests recent
average wage increases of 10 per cent are set to continue.
Taiwan's economic growth is impressive, especially in the face of recession
in its principal export market, the US. But the economy now needs to
restructure away from low cost manufacturing, its traditional engine of
growth. Since the late 1980s low cost manufacturers have lost
competitiveness due to rising land and labour costs and a 50 per cent
appreciation in the new Taiwan dollar. This has forced many to relocate to
cheaper Asian locations, such as Indonesia, and, especially since relations
have improved, China.
Although economists agree this process was inevitable, the government is
worried it will prevent Taiwan's industry from upgrading. Government grants
and tax credits are being increased to persuade companies to invest in
automation and research. But these programmes have so far had mixed success,
and Taiwan still largely relies on imported Japanese and US technology.
This year has seen another setback as foreign investment has fallen sharply,
dropping 32 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn in the first seven months. The decline
may be temporary, relecting downturn in Japan, and changes in investment
laws. But foreign investment does seem increasingly to be aimed at service,
rather than manufacturing industries, suggesting Taiwan's efforts to upgrade
industry, helped by foreign technology transfer may be frustrated.
After registering almost no growth in 1990, exports have recovered, helped
by a stable new Taiwanese dollar and increasing exports to China. Because
Taiwan maintains a ban on direct links with China, most trade is conducted
through Hong Kong. Exports to newly-built Taiwanese factories in China
helped lift total trade with China 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn in
the first seven months of this year.
Relations with China have improved markedly since Taiwan lifted its ban on
visits to the mainland in 1987. But the two sides are still separated by
huge ideological differences and 40 years of mistrust. Although cultural and
unofficial contacts are rising, further progress towards normalising
relations will be very slow.
Last year Taiwan ended its National Mobilisation for Suppression of the
Communist Rebellion, effectively recognising Beijing as the legitimate
government for the mainland. Taiwan hoped this would lead to formal
recognition by Beijing but China has consistently refused to grant any
legitimacy to Taiwan's government and refuses all offers of official talks
or visits.
Increasing trade links with China have led to calls from Taiwan's
businessmen for bans on the three tongs - direct shipping, air links and
postal services - to be lifted. But this would require the two governments'
mutual recognition of security arrangements and air service agreements. Even
if China agreed to modify its non-recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty,
Taiwan may delay lifting the three bans to squeeze further concessions from
China at a later stage.
Beijing's continued opposition to the extension of diplomatic recognition to
Taiwan by third countries has frustrated the island's quest for
international ties. In August, South Korea, Taiwan's last diplomatic ally in
Asia, withdrew recognition in favour of China. Taiwan now has full
diplomatic relations with 29 countries, of which only South Africa is
internationally important.
But Taiwan has had more success gaining entry to international bodies. As
well as the Gatt application, it last year joined the Asia Pacific Economic
Conference under the politically neutral title of Chinese Taipei.
Growing economic power is also bringing greater informal recognition from
European countries, especially those, such as France, which believe their
companies can win contracts under the six-year plan. Following the US
decision in September to sell up to 150 F-16s to Taiwan, a separate purchase
of up to 60 French Mirage fighters is still expected to go ahead. This would
further improve Taiwan-French ties, and provide the island with a
symbolically important quasi-ally in Europe.
