<F P=106> [Article by Liu Min-tang (0491 2494 1016) in Taipei: "Li </F>
Teng-hui Goes Wild"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The "Analects of Li Teng-hui's 
Wildness" compiled by the New Democratic Party include: 
  Tainan County - Li says "If Huang Hsiu-meng loses the 
election, I will commit seppuku." Note: It appears that if the 
head of state commits suicide, the "presidential elections" will 
have to be held sooner. 
  Chiayi City - Li says "If Chang Wen-ying does not have 
adequate ability, I will kneel down to get the votes." Note: If 
the head of state can kneel down so easily, does that not 
humiliate the nation and diminish its influence? 
  Taoyuan County - Li says "Liu Pang-you is absolutely clean 
and will not engage in land speculation." Note: When Liu 
Pang-you's three court cases were tried, the head of state 
openly stood as guarantor for him. Ai! The chastity of the Queen 
of Justice... 
  Hualien County - Li says "as a representative, Wang 
Ching-feng never sought favors." Note: There are two types of 
seeking favors. One is for private benefit; the other is for 
public benefit. A representative who never seeks favors is a 
lazy bum! 
  Tainan City - Li says "Based on my reputation, please 
support 
Shih Chih-ming." Note: If the head of state's reputation can be 
sold so cheaply, exactly how much is it per kilo? 
  Hsinchu City - Li says "Tung Sheng-nan was educated to enter 
politics and won't mess up." Note: Does Li Teng-hui think that 
other candidates are not educated? Pingtung County - Li says "Su 
Chen-chang does not get along with others and does not 
understand government but Wu Tse-yuan would not finagle a 10 
billion construction check." Note: Eight months ago Li Teng-hui 
openly confirmed the political career achievements of Su and 
other New Democratic Party county chiefs. Now he wantonly 
criticizes them for the sake of the elections. The head of 
state's "nausea" makes one feel "bitter!" He also publicly 
endorsed Wu Tse-yuan's 10 billion check, thus even more clearly 
demonstrating how the central government favors the Kuomintang 
local leaders and impedes the work of opposition party county 
and city leaders. 
  Kaohsiung County - Li says "Yu Chen Yue-ying only works on 
improving Ch'un Chiao." Note: Yu Chen's accomplishments are 
universally acclaimed in Kaohsiung. It is inconceivable that the 
head of state would be making sarcastic remarks about Ch'un 
Chiao. 
  Taipei County - Li says "You Ching had no achievements 
during 
his term, but you can wear out your shoes searching and not find 
another like Ts'ai Sheng-pang." Note: You Ching based his bid 
for re-election on the assessment of ten major accomplishments 
during his term. His political rallies are always packed, which 
shows that the voters approve. If Li Teng-hui cannot see this, 
then his old eyes must be losing their vision. 
  Penghu County - During an inspection tour of county 
governments, Li expels County head Kao Chih-p'eng. Note: He 
goes on stage to do political magic tricks. First he is 
president; then he is chairman. 
  Taichung City - Li persuades Hsu Hsing-hui to withdraw, 
disregarding the fact that Hsu had sworn before "the gods" to be 
"in the election to the finish." Note: If Hsu Hsin-hui is 
reproached by the heavens, who will take responsibility? 
  Taichung County - Li beats his chest and says "If you 
believe 
in me, Li Teng-hui, then vote for Liao Liao-yi." Note: Liao 
Liao-yi was elected four years ago by buying votes and although 
he was caught, only his subordinates were sentenced. During his 
term, he also participated extensively in land speculation and 
the university town incident inspired 15,000 people to 
participate in protest demonstrations. He has also been indicted 
for the abuse of authority and public equipment for private 
purposes during this election. [passage omitted]
