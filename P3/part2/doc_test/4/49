  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Forty-seven years ago, 
hundreds of people were slaughtered in Taiwan during an uprising 
against the Chiang Kai-shek government, and thousands more 
around the island were believed arrested and killed in the 
crackdown that followed. Today, the nation was quietly 
commemorating the tragedy in spite of the hurt deep in the minds 
of many people. 
  In Taipei Monday morning, more than 300 relatives of those 
who lost their lives at the massacre, better known as "2-28 
Incident," attended a memorial concert sponsored by Soochow 
University along with ranking government officials and scholars. 
  Chang Hsiao-tsu, president of the university, said the 
concert was intended "to commemorate the victims regardless of 
their age, sex and birthplace." 
  "The hosting of the concert," Chang said, "is aimed to allow 
us an occasion to review the historical tragedy so as to avoid 
the recurrence of similar incidents." It was the second such 
concert held by the university. 
  The 1947 uprising was sparked after a government official 
beat a woman selling untaxed cigarettes. Angry crowds later 
stormed government offices as native Taiwanese erupted in a fury 
against what they saw as an oppressive Chiang Kai-shek regime. 
  Chiang responded by sending troops from the mainland, which 
the nationalists still ruled, to Taiwan, which had just reverted 
to Chinese control after 50 years of rule by Japan. It is still 
unclear as to how many people were killed during the initial 
uprising and the subsequent period of "white terror." The 
incident had been a taboo topic of conversation until a few 
years ago, but with Taiwan's increasing democratization has 
become a much-debated subject. A report by a special task force 
of the Executive Yuan put the number of victims at around 
18,000-28,000. 
  Chen Wei-chao, president of National Taiwan University, 
likened the incident to an untended gash. "The cut was so deep 
and wide that the wound could hardly be healed, even though 
nearly five decades have elapsed," said Chen, also a noted 
surgeon. 
  The government has apologized for the incident, and is 
building monuments and mapping out relief measures to compensate 
the victims, but "the spiritual wounds are hard to heal," Chen 
said. 
  In the southern city of Kaohsiung, [word indistinct] Wu 
Tun-yi chaired a memorial service in front of a monument to the 
victims. He said he hopes the wounds can be gradually healed and 
thus pave the way for a more harmonious society. 
  Wang [words indistinct] president of the Kaohsiung 
association on the victims of 2-28 Incident, said he was pleased 
[words indistinct] here paying great [word indistinct] and 
concern to the relatives of the victims, but he is still hoping 
the government will [words indistinct] a national holiday. 
  Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui also attended a concert 
held 
to commemorate the 2-28 Incident at Taipei's National Concert 
Hall Monday evening. Li said he hopes through music, the 
historic wounds can be cleansed and then lingering hatred 
dispersed.
