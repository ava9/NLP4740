  [Text] Relations between Ghana and Togo over the last 
couple of years have been anything but cordial and friendly. 
They have been characterized by border clashes, border 
incursions, mutual suspicions, Togolese accusations of 
subversion, Ghanaian denials of such accusations, refugee 
problems, maltreatment of Ghanaians in Togo, and so on and so 
forth. These issues have dominated and poisoned the 
relationship between the two neighboring countries to the extent 
that people on either side of the border have begun to see them 
as normal. But for two countries which share such deep 
historical, ethnic, and economic ties there is hardly anything 
normal about this state of affairs. 
  It is indeed shameful that the great potential that exists 
for subregional cooperation and collaboration for the mutual 
benefit of the peoples of the two countries is being allowed to 
go to waste. To be fair, however, it must be said that the Ghana 
Government over the years has taken one initiative after the 
other with the view to achieving the reversal of the present 
status quo. These initiatives, including the setting up of a 
Joint Ghana-Togo Border Demarcation Commission [and] the 
conclusion of the quadripartite agreements, have not been 
appreciated by the Togolese authorities. Rather, they eventually 
subverted them in one way or the other. Year after year, the 
Togolese authorities continue to blame Ghana for all their 
internal problems and woes. The latest in the seemingly 
unending string of Togolese accusations against Ghana were 
actually accompanied by unacceptable levels of aggression 
against Ghanaians and Ghanaian property. It may never be known 
how many innocent Ghanaian lives were lost through this 
unprovoked aggression by the Togolese security agencies. But, 
certainly, no responsible government can continue to look on 
unconcerned as its national and property are subjected to 
unprovoked aggression. 
  It is in this light that last Friday's [21 January] news 
conference has been welcomed by Ghanaians even though some 
consider that the time for action is long overdue. The Togolese 
authorities need to take the foreign minister's advice seriously 
that any new unprovoked aggression will be met with commensurate 
response. Ghanaians, it appears, are being taken for granted by 
our neighbors simply because we are peaceful and peace-loving 
and we want to concentrate our time and energies on the 
development of our motherland. This should not however be 
misconstrued to mean we lack the capacity for self-defense or 
our government is incapable of protecting its nationals and 
their property. Let the Togolese authorities be advised to 
settle down to constructively resolving their own internal 
conflicts through democratic means rather than looking for 
enemies where none exist.
