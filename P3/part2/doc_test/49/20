  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, today 
held talks with the Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, 
at the Castle, Osu. They discussed Nigeria's border conflict 
with Cameroon, the Liberian peace process, and the devaluation 
of the CFA franc, and the economic and social consequences for 
the West African subregion. 
  At a news conference after the talks, Babagana Kingibe said 
the desire of the Nigerian Government is to seek accommodation 
and reconciliation and to resolve the conflict with Cameroon 
through dialogue. He said as part of efforts to find a peaceful 
solution to the dispute, the two countries have been invited to 
Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday [16 March] by the OAU Conflict 
Resolution Committee. Babagana Kingibe said Nigeria will 
cooperate fully with the committee to see to a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute. On Liberia, he expressed confidence 
that things will go well with the peace process this time 
because indications are that all the factions are eager to see 
peace prevail in the country and will therefore adhere to the 
Cotonou accord. 
  The deputy minister designate for foreign affairs, Dr. 
Mohamed ibn Chambas, said the role of France in the dispute 
between Nigeria and Cameroon is being viewed with concern by 
Ghana. He said the French, by their action, are meddling in the 
affairs of two sister African countries. They should, 
therefore, leave the problems to Africans to solve.
