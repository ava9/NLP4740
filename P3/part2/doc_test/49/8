  [Excerpt] The president, Flight-Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings, 
has appealed to all whose interests are at stake in land 
disputes in parts of the country to exercise restraint. He said 
they must also avoid provocations and confrontations which only 
lead to loss of life and property. These were contained in a 
speech read for him by the presidential adviser on chieftancy 
affairs, Nana Akuoko Sarpong at the grand durbar at Abetifi to 
round off the Afahye [traditional festival] of the people of the 
Kwahu traditional area. 
  Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings assured the people that all such 
land cases will be thoroughly investigated by government to 
enable peace to prevail. The president said Ghanaians have 
centuries-old institutions to settle communal differences. But 
lately, violence threatens to break the country apart. He 
therefore emphasized the need for peace in all communities. He 
said all must have the will to talk and stay at the talking 
table until agreement is reached. President Rawlings advised the 
people of Kwahu to use their rich business experience to promote 
the export trade in the country. [passage omitted]
