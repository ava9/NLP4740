  [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina arrived today for an official visit to Ghana 
during his first tour to five African countries since his 
appointment in April last year. 
  The Caribbean island's foreign minister was welcomed at 
Kotoka International Airport by his Ghanaian counterpart, Obed 
Asamoah, and Juan Carretero, Havana's ambassador in Accra. 
  Interviewed by local media, Robaina said one of the goals of 
the trip is to explain the domestic situation in Cuba and 
changes being implemented in the economic sector. 
  He said his country's government is interested in knowing 
about the situation in Ghana, a country with which it maintains 
a fluid trade which stands out within the context of the 
so-called Black Continent. 
  Referring to the Latin American country's planned foreign 
policy for 1994, the head of Cuban diplomacy said it must be 
different, because the situation so demands. 
  The key is to have the ability to exist in a constantly 
changing world and to ensure that our views are known at the 
international level, he said. 
  The foreign minister said that despite predictions by the 
international media in 1993, his country is living, working, and 
has opted to counter the adverse situation it is facing with 
many efforts, without sacrificing sacred achievements, such as 
in health and education. 
  Referring to this, he said 1993 should go down in history as 
the most difficult year for the revolution, which was born in 
1959, but 1994 is the beginning of an upward trend. 
  During his 48-hour stay in Accra, Robaina will meet with 
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlins; Justice Daniel Annan, 
parliament leader; the foreign minister; and Richard Kwame 
Peprah, energy and mines minister and chairman of the 
Cuban-Ghanaian Mixed Commission. 
  He will also meet with members of various friendship 
associations and the Cuban ambassadors to Cape Verde, 
Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Benin, and Burkina Faso. 
  The foreign minister and his delegation will leave on 
Tuesday 
for Angola, the second phase of his two-week tour, which also 
includes Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.
