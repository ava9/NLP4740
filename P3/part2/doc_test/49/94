  [Text] Accra, 23 Apr (PANA) -- Ghanaian intelligence 
officials have uncovered a coup plot that would have been 
executed in the West African country between 7th-15th April, the 
state-owned [DAILY] GRAPHIC newspaper reported yesterday. In a 
front-page report citing intelligence sources, the GRAPHIC said 
the "attempt to destabilize the country" included threats of 
assassinations of editors of two private newspapers who have 
been critical of President Jerry Rawlings. "Highly placed 
ghanaian intelligence sources have confirmed that they believed 
the reported threats were part of a destabilization plan. The 
attempt had been slated for between 7th and 15th April", the 
newspaper said. 
  The STATESMAN, the newspaper of the opposition center-right 
New Patriotic Party (NPP), said in a story on 17th April that 
its editor, Haruna Attah, the editor of the FREE PRESS, Eben 
Quarcoo, and a former close aide of Rawlings, Major Courage 
Quarshigah, had received death threats. The GRAPHIC said these 
threats were being treated as part of investigations into 
alleged plots to oust the government. 
  The reported threat was either intended to provide a decoy 
or 
a pretext for whatever action had been intended, it quoted 
security officials as saying. 
  "Ghanaian intelligence had become aware of intense efforts 
to 
infiltrate the conflict areas in the north and to use the 
conflict as a cover for an attempt to overthrow the government", 
the GRAPHIC said. 
  The newspaper quoted security documents which stated that 
there were "increased dissident activities designed to take 
advantage of the northern conflict and to link up with 
like-minded forces inside the country". It said attempts to 
oust the government, which ceased following Rawlings' victory at 
the polls in 1992, started again late in 1993. 
  "From January (1994), persistent reports filtered through of 
intense activities along the West African coast by retired 
service personnel and others who remained in exile to renew 
their illegal actions against the government", it said. 
  The GRAPHIC reported that the security sources told it that 
some known dissidents had made attempts to obtain support from 
sources in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. "Contacts had been 
established in Accra with some retired service personnel and 
some politicians. There were meetings in and around Accra and 
Kumasi attended by high- profile politicians", it said. 
  The report did not say whether there have been any arrests.
