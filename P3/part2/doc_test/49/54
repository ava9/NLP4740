  [Text] The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Idrissu, 
today assured Ghanaians of the safety of Ghanaian troops serving 
with the UN force in Rwanda. He was speaking in an interview 
with the GBC [Ghana Broadcasting Corporation] on the changing 
situation in the Rwandan crisis: 
  [Begin recording] [Idrissu] [Words indistinct] generally 
worried about the wounded soldier, but what I would like to tell 
you is that, I mean, that was accidental. It was not a firing 
at our troops which caused this injury. It was purely 
accidental. He was hit by a stray bullet. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Many people would think that 
Ghana should be getting ready to withdraw our contingent from 
Rwanda. This is because other foreign troops, especially 
Belgium, is reported to have withdrawn completely. Why are we 
still in Rwanda? Are there steps to get our troops withdrawn 
and if not, why? 
  [Idrissu] Quite honestly, I don't know the circumstances 
under which the Belgians withdrew, and we are there under UN 
auspices, and I don't think we will be taking a unilateral 
decision to pull out. We have faith in the Organization of the 
UN, and we hope that the interest of our troops would be 
paramount and they would be protected. 
  [Correspondent] What would you say is the exact situation of 
our troops in the city, especially as it is reported to have 
been encircled? 
  [Idrissu] Well, right now our troops are in Kigali. They 
are around the airport area and most of the key places. But let 
me assure you that all our troops, with the exception of this 
one injured soldier, are healthy. They are all in good health. 
They are not under any attack. So we don't have any fears 
about their present situation. 
  [Correspondent] The situation in Kigali (?also looks) like 
the peacekeeping role of the UN: It is not working. It is not 
likely that our troops may end up fighting in self-defense, and 
if that happens, are they well equipped to handle such a 
situation? 
  [Idrissu] Well, that is a little bit difficult for me, but 
we rely on the judgment of the force commander of the UN and the 
secretary general's representative in the area to take good 
decisions so that we are not engulfed in any such situation.
