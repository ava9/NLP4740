  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John 
Rawlings, returned from Johannesburg after attending ceremonies 
marking the swearing into office of Mr. Nelson Mandela as South 
Africa's first black president, and the ushering in of the 
multiracial and democratic government for the country. 
President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana 
Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr. 
Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V. 
Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni 
Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State; 
and service commanders. 
  Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief 
director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho, 
said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the 
rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over 
wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of 
division. He said the most important lesson that came out of 
the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black 
majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so 
that they can move into the new democratic era in unity. 
  Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings 
seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They 
included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore 
of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife 
of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of 
Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the 
situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade. 
  On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President 
Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to 
commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President 
Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to 
improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho 
said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in 
South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their 
efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on 
the continent.
