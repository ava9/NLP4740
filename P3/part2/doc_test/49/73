  [Text] The government has announced its intention to 
station a permanent battalion in the north-eastern part of the 
country. This is to enable the military to be in a better 
position to quickly respond to future conflict situations in the 
area. The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu, announced 
this in Parliament today, during a brief on the inter-ethnic 
conflict in the Northern Region. 
  Alhaji Mahama, who is also the chairman of the National 
Emergency Committee, said it is the view of the committee that 
the stationing of such a battalion will ensure the traditional 
presence of the Army in this conflict-prone area. 
  As a temporary measure, the defense minister said, even 
though the military will hand over to the police in the conflict 
zone, it will continue to maintain a limited presence at places 
it considers as priority areas. These include Salaga, Yendi, 
Krachi, and Saboba districts. 
  The House approved the appointments of Major Emmanuel Tetteh 
as the Eastern Regional minister and Mr. Sam P. Yalley as deputy 
minister of environment, science, and technology.
