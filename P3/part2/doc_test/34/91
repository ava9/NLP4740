Stuart Hamblen, a singing cowboy star in an era when there were but a few of 
them riding the range, died Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen was a recovered alcoholic who abandoned booze but not broadcasting 
after a tent-show conversion by evangelist Billy Graham. He was 80, and had 
lapsed into a coma after surgery Feb. 28 to remove a malignant brain tumor, 
said Armen Markarian, a spokesman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen has arguably been credited with being radio's first singing cowboy. But 
if he wasn't its first, he certainly was its most colorful. 
</P>
<P>
He was as well known for his tall stories as he was his songs ("This Old 
House," "It Is No Secret What God Can Do" and "Remember Me, I'm the One Who 
Loves You.") 
</P>
<P>
Years after he had abandoned the wild life of his earlier years in which he 
once flushed an escaped black panther out of Thousand Oaks with his prized 
hounds, he still loved to tell about such times as when a bucking bronco he 
once was riding in a rodeo fled to a nearby peach orchard "and started to prune 
the trees with my poor, bruised body." 
</P>
<P>
That was a time in which he also was credited with being one of the West's best 
teller of tales since Will Rogers, although a friend noted quietly that "Stuart 
has never been guilty of understatement in his life. He's the man who sold ice 
to the man who sold ice to the Eskimos." 
</P>
<P>
He also was one of those old cowboys who remembered just enough of the days of 
the Old West to miss them. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Methodist minister, Hamblen was born in Kellyville, Tex., on Oct. 
26, 1908. He began his career when he was 18 after winning a talent contest in 
Dallas. With the $50 prize, he headed for Camden, N.J., where he recorded for 
the forerunner of RCA Victor Recording. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Hollywood in 1928 and for the next 22 years was at the top of the 
country-western field, first as "Cowboy Joe," then as a member of the original 
Beverly Hillbillies, radio's first Western singing group, and later as host of 
such programs as "Covered Wagon Jubilee," "King Cowboy and his Woolly West 
Review" and "Stuart Hamblen and His Lucky Stars." 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen was a prolific songwriter, often turning out a tune in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to write music," he said in a 1976 interview with The Times. 
"And for me, it could be anywhere. I can be up in the mountains, by a stream, 
and all of a sudden a tune will come into my head and I'll start writin' lyrics 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'This Old House' that way. I was in the mountains and found this old 
prospector dead in his cabin. I saw curtains, so that meant a woman had been 
there. I saw kids' things lyin' around. And they were all gone now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ain't a gonna leave this house no longer, 
</P>
<P>
 I'm gettin' ready to meet the saints. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Clooney's recording of "This Old House" became a million-seller. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s and 1940s, Hamblen appeared in a number of low budget 
Westerns, usually as the villain, with John Wayne, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Bob 
Steele and other cowboy stars. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper clippings also reflect other "credits," arrests for speeding, 
resisting arrest, ignoring traffic tickets -- even pleading no contest to drunk 
driving in 1965, 13 years after he ran as a Prohibition Party candidate for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
(He lost, of course, to Dwight D. Eisenhower, but later couldn't resist noting 
that he had been defeated by "a mere 25 million votes. But I sure got more 
votes than Jerry Brown" -- when the California governor ran for President in 
1976 and 1980.) 
</P>
<P>
He also loved horse racing and owned one of the leading stables in the West. 
Two of his horses, El Lobo and Reveille won big stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
He had first tried to put all the mischief of his early years behind him when 
he attended a Billy Graham revival in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always been a rough man," Hamblen said years later, "but my big problem 
was not being able to leave the booze alone. My daddy was a Methodist minister 
and I guess I was the original juvenile delinquent. I just loved to fight too, 
and I suppose I did get thrown into jail a few times." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after his conversion, Hamblen retired from radio and films and with 
his wife, Suzy, spent the next 20 years traveling across the country speaking 
before youth organizations and prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Having been convinced by KLAC General Manager Bill Ward that the airwaves 
offered a more sweeping pulpit, he returned to that medium in 1971 with his 
nationally syndicated "Cowboy Church of the Air," an hourlong show of religious 
songs mixed in with stories, always with a message. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I want to make clear is that I'm no preacher," he said. "We tell 
stories instead of sermons. 
</P>
<P>
"And we don't accept any donations even though some people, bless 'em, choose 
to send money." 
</P>
<P>
What he tried to get across, said the old cowboy who was inducted into the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, is that "I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and what a difference Christianity can make in a man's life." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 56 years and three daughters.
