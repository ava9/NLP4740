The first generation to have almost universal access to higher education may 
also be the first generation to give up reading. Unless they are reading about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
If the newspaper business is in big trouble it's because it has failed to 
pamper baby boomers. Newspapers must cater to them and entertain them the way 
"Howdy Doody" did. The alternative press has figured this out. It understands 
that baby boomers are incredibly egocentric. So it has created a literature by 
the boomers, for the boomers, about the boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Look, I've been up to my ears in baby boomers since I was a baby. I'm willing 
to bet that if you are a baby boomer you are reading this simply because it is 
about you. 
</P>
<P>
A group of weekly alternative papers recently put an ad in Advertising Age 
flaunting this generational love-in. There's good news and bad news for 
newspapers, says the ad. The bad news is that newspapers are losing readers and 
"skewing older." The good news is that weekly alternatives deliver "a prime, 
targeted, upscale audience of 8.5 million young professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Put that in your pipe and skew it. 
</P>
<P>
One way these papers are attracting baby boomers is by understanding that the 
boomers are style freaks. The beautiful ads in some of these papers are often 
more attractive than the stories. If you see something in a newspaper that 
looks like a Gauguin but is actually an ad for a futon sale then you are 
reading a paper that is catering to baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers won't grow up. Only those who worshiped at the church of Peter Pan 
themselves actually understand this. (I believed in fairies! I clapped!) 
There's money to be made in the never-grow-old service sectors. Picture Marlon 
Brando as he looks today, on a motorcycle in black leather as he appeared in 
"The Wild Ones." This is where a generation is heading. 
</P>
<P>
You're either on the Jeep or you're not. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly papers that are anti-Establishment appeal to baby boomers who will do 
anything to maintain the image of themselves as young and rebellious. They 
detest the label "middle class" as much as they detest middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers are divided into three classes: those who have to earn a living, 
those who are waiting to inherit wealth and those who already have their 
inherited wealth. The last group cares the most about the environment because 
they already own it. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boomers are always looking for safe working-class neighborhoods and 
working-class hangouts for sociological field trips. If a restaurant reviewer 
describes a place as having "working-class ambience," pretty soon you'll have a 
trendy place filled with people in Levi's Dockers drinking imported beer out of 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers define art in terms of rebelliousness, not aesthetics. They will 
watch "Twin Peaks" even if it makes no sense. They will declare any junk "art" 
if it is attacked as pornography. If I were a situationalist artist, I would 
invent a situation in which some old man called me "dirty." Then I'd sit back 
and let the Village Voice make me famous. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomers carry on their rebellion when they have babies by insisting that 
they are raising their children differently from the way they were raised. 
Boomers all feel they were victimized by their childhood. Someday, we will have 
ads in the back of the weeklies for Adult Children of Adult Children. 
</P>
<P>
But grow older they will, and as they do, baby boomers will become nostalgia 
devotees like generations before. Already, we have seen Woodstock replacing Iwo 
Jima as the symbol of a generation's emotional commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Ye Olde Newspaper could fit into that nostalgia craze, but only if mainstream 
newspapers indulge the indulgent baby boomers. Otherwise, they'll take their 
8.5 million marbles and go watch cable.
