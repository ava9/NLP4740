It's the 20th anniversary of personalized license plates in California, so 
car-care company Eagle One held a contest to find the most creative plate on 
the road. The winner, chosen by a panel of TV comedy writers, was motion 
picture production manager Robert P. Schneider, whose plate, IM2BZ2P, refers to 
the 16-hour days he says he works. 
</P>
<P>
The runners-up -- culled from 600 entries from 36 states -- were OUT50GZ (Out 
50 G's), a reference to the cost of Linda Ressler's Mercedes in Valencia; 
O4A4RE (Oh for a Ferrari) on Lou Mickley's Honda in Bethlehem, Pa.; AUDIDOD 
(Audi Doody) on Joyce Matuszak's Audi in Sandwich, Ill., and BRTQLIT (Be 
Articulate) on speech therapist Rita Larson's car in Burlingame, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider won a CD player for his car and $500 in car-care products. Replicas 
of the plates will go on display at the Improv comedy nightclub in Hollywood.
