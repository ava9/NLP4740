William (Fish Bait) Miller, the affable doorkeeper of the U.S. House of 
Representatives whose stentorian "Mistuh Speakah -- the Prez-dent of the 
Yoo-nited States" echoed across the halls of Congress for nearly 25 years, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who opened doors for such visiting House dignitaries as the future 
queen of England (who he greeted with a "howdy ma'am") and then wrote a book 
that opened doors on the antics of congressmen, was 80 when he died Tuesday at 
his home in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrill Bumgarner, director of Hanes-Lineberry Funeral Home in Greensboro, did 
not provide a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
In his long tenure, Miller introduced six presidents at joint sessions of 
Congress and countless other visiting statesmen to the House, letting each name 
spin forth in an elongated announcement accented by his native Mississippi 
drawl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote 'Fish Bait' 
</P>
<P>
The assembled Congress would then applaud and Miller would sit down at the 
front of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
What he saw and learned of the workings of Capitol Hill led to his book, "Fish 
Bait," which also included accounts of the drinking and sexual exploits of 
several members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's job came to involve more than guarding doors. He supervised 357 
employees and an annual budget of $3.5 million. From his oppulent office he 
oversaw messengers, pages, barbers and janitors. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Bait, who was assigned the sobriquet when he was 15 and still weighed only 
75 pounds, was born William Mosely Miller in Pascagoula, Miss., a small town 
that was so near the Gulf Coast that "if you go any farther south you are going 
to get your feet awfully wet." 
</P>
<P>
And Fish Bait was always two words, he told interviewers. "Capital Fish, 
Capital Bait." 
</P>
<P>
Miller first arrived in Washington in 1933 and he took a job as a clerk in the 
House post office. 
</P>
<P>
He was first named minority doorkeeper in 1947, when the Democrats lost control 
of the House. He had competition for the job in 1949, when the Democrats 
regained majority status, but he wrote personal notes to each member while his 
opponent sent a mimeographed letter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he helped Democratic House members get their choice of offices by 
sanding his fingertips so he could identify by touch the metal disks drawn to 
determine office assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Probably his most famous moment came in 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II, then the 
crown princess of England, and her husband, Prince Philip, visited Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Miller walked up to her, said "howdy ma'am" and then proceeded to escort the 
royal duo around the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"Wave to the boys and girls in the gallery," Miller told the prince. "I will 
not," Philip replied. 
</P>
<P>
Five feet, eight inches and slightly pear shaped, Miller lost his job in 1974 
in a power switch that cost Rep. Wilbur Mills most of his influence and all his 
appointments. Mills had become publicly involved with a stripper. 
</P>
<P>
By then Miller had become a Capitol Hill legend. He prided himself on knowing 
the birthdays of most congressmen, of saying that "everyone's important here," 
of prowling the corridors of Congress in his bare feet, having left his shoes 
in the House barber shop where they were being shined. 
</P>
<P>
After the power shift, the man who once told Rep. Bella Abzug to remove her hat 
in the House (she encouraged him to perform an anatomically impossible act) 
returned to Mississippi, where he co-authored "Fish Bait," in which the lives 
and exploits of many congressmen were touched upon. He later moved to 
Greensboro to be near his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his favorite Democrats were former President Harry S. Truman (who 
laughed away Miller's potentially damaging remarks to the royal couple) and 
longtime House Speaker Sam Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Rayburn's heart was as big as my head and your head put together," he once 
said. "And Truman, I liked him because he said exactly what he meant and you 
always knew exactly where he stood." 
</P>
<P>
He also had fond remembrances of Republican Richard M. Nixon, who once sent him 
a birthday card that "made me feel like sovereignty, which I ain't."
