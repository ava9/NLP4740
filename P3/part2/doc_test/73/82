The space agency is preparing to use the Hubble Space Telescope to observe a 
celestial spectacle: a gargantuan storm on Saturn that is 1 1/2 times wider 
than the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's creating a lot of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the space telescope people heard about it, they wanted to point the 
telescope at it," said Daniel Green of the International Astronomical Union's 
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, a reporting agency for discoveries 
in space. The bureau notified Hubble scientists about the storm.

The oval-shaped white spot on the solar system's second-largest planet is 
growing, and now measures 12,500 miles wide by 3,100 miles long, New Mexico 
State University astronomer Reta Beebe said last week. By comparison, Earth has 
a diameter of about 7,900 miles. 
</P>

Beebe said Saturn's new storm has formed a disturbance that includes two 
smaller white spots. The disturbance stretches 50,000 miles east to west -- 
about one-fifth of the way around the equatorial region of the ringed planet -- 
and 3,100 miles north to south, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Such storms appear on Saturn roughly once every 30 Earth years -- the length of 
a single year on Saturn. They are probably created by a sudden upwelling of 
Saturn's internal heat that carries ammonia gas high into the planet's 
atmosphere, where it freezes into white crystals of ammonia ice, Beebe said.
