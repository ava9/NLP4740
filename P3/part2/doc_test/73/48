The Hubble Space Telescope spent its first full day in orbit Thursday 
tormenting the engineers and scientists on the ground who would be its masters. 
</P>
<P>
As it orbited 381 miles above the Earth, 50 miles in front of the shuttle 
Discovery, the $1.5 billion telescope balked at communicating with ground 
controllers and played the leading role in a series of dramas that had the 
experts gnawing on their fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we've had a lot more problems than we had anticipated," said 
Michael M. Harrington, director of orbital verification at the Goddard Space 
Flight Center here. But he quickly added that he is "confident" that he and his 
fellow engineers will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The most threatening problem began just as Harrington was showing up for work. 
The previous shift had failed in its attempts to establish communications with 
the telescope through its twin high-gain antennas. The telescope also has a 
secondary communications system, but the high-gain antennas will be the primary 
means for transmitting scientific data back from the telescope, and the loss 
would have been catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's team determined that the communications link had failed because 
the telescope probably was not pointing exactly where they thought it was, and 
thus the antennas were not pointing at the sophisticated communications 
satellite that serves as NASA's link to its space vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The orientation of the telescope is determined partly by "fixed star trackers," 
small telescopes on board the Hubble that reveal the locations of various stars 
whose positions are well known. That information tells ground controllers how 
much and which way to move the telescope so that it is pointing in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
After analyzing data from the star trackers, controllers ordered the telescope 
to move and the antennas locked on the communications satellite and the vital 
link was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Then a problem cropped up with the secondary communications system which allows 
the telescope to accept orders from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
That left ground controllers wondering about how they were going to order the 
telescope to do anything at all, but within a few tense minutes that problem 
was resolved too. Engineers determined that it was a human failure on the 
ground, not a hardware failure in orbit, that caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The problems came at the very beginning of what will be a long process -- 
testing and fine tuning the guidance system that will allow astronomers to 
study distant objects for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope has the finest mirror ever produced, but it would be useless 
without a guidance system that will point the telescope at specific targets and 
hold it "locked on" for hours. Controllers are expected to work for months 
getting the guidance system perfected. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the requirement to point very precisely that makes the checkout period 
so long," said Steve Terry, an orbital verification official at Goddard. "This 
is the first baby step." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, satellites use tiny jets to keep them properly oriented, but even the 
smallest jets would foul the neighborhood around the space telescope, thus 
negating the reason for putting it in orbit above the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope uses four large flywheels to move it. As each flywheel spins, the 
telescope tends to rotate in the direction of the spinning. It works the other 
way around just as well. Thus controllers can move the telescope in any 
direction just by controlling the spin of the flywheels. But Thursday, while 
engineers were still getting acquainted with their new toy, one of the 
flywheels stopped. It was later restarted after engineers determined that the 
problem was simply a faulty sensor. 
</P>
<P>
Without at least three of the four flywheels, it would not be possible to point 
the telescope accurately, so the problem caused a lot of consternation here for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
How accurate does the pointing have to be? To within .007 seconds of arc, said 
Edward J. Weiler, program scientist at NASA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's equivalent to if you had a laser beam in Washington and you fired it at 
New York, you would be able to hit a dime," Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
"And more importantly, you would be able to hold that beam on that dime for 24 
hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the telescope will pass another milestone when ground controllers order 
it to open its "aperture door," which serves as a lens cap to prevent sunlight 
from accidentally entering the telescope and burning out some of the 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
If that procedure works properly, Discovery, which has been shadowing the 
telescope ever since it was released Wednesday, will be free to make its 6:49 
a.m. landing Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
If the aperture door should jam, however, the shuttle will pull alongside the 
telescope Saturday and astronauts Kathryn D. Sullivan and Bruce McCandless will 
go outside and try to fix it.
