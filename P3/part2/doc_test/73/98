FLAW IN HUBBLE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronomers, among others, like to talk about parity in discussing physical 
systems; mirror images of stuff or even their properties. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as though the Hubble Telescope is a clear confirmation that the much 
sought after serendipity in scientific investigations obeys parity. I doubt 
that there has been a more clear example of not "finding valuable or agreeable 
things not sought for"; negative serendipity, that is. Or is it 
anti-serendipity? I forget.
