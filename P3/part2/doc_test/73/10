Keck Divorce Case Request Fails: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to 
grant a preliminary order disqualifying a Los Angeles law firm, Trope &amp; 
Trope, from representing Elizabeth Avery Keck in her divorce proceeding against 
Howard B. Keck Sr., whose father founded Superior Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The order was sought in a legal malpractice suit filed by the couple's son, oil 
heir Howard B. Keck Jr., who contended that Trope &amp; Trope, while 
representing his mother, used confidential information it learned while 
representing him for 20 years. The younger Keck fears that his inheritance will 
be diluted if his father loses the divorce case. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case 
No. C759915)
