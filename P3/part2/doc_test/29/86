PATTERNS OF ABUSE BY JOHN H. TAYLOR (WYNWOOD PRESS: $18.95; 383 PP.)

By Dick Lochte, Lochte's most recent novel, Laughing Dog, will be reprinted in 
paperback by Warner Books this fall. His next novel, The Burial Society, will 
be published later this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
"No matter how many friends he may think he has in the press . . . the 
President must recognize that his relationship with the media is inherently 
adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
These cautionary words from a recent issue of TV Guide were penned by no less 
an experienced hand at adversarial press relationships than Richard Nixon. They 
might well have been used as the basis for the debut novel by his chief aide, 
John H. Taylor's, about a White House under siege by the Washington Post. Not 
surprisingly, Taylor has stacked the deck rather heavily against the Fourth 
Estate, but in spite of that (or even, I shudder to suggest, because of it), 
the book is a very entertaining study of the abuse of press -- and political -- 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the very near future, Taylor's America is a little different from the 
one we now know. Jack Kemp is governor of New York. Ben Bradlee has retired to 
teach at the Columbia Journalism School; his desk at the Post has been filled 
by a self-serving Machiavelli named George Stevens. And the country has just 
seen a presidential shift from California Republican Ronald Reagan to Louisiana 
Democrat Eugene Hoskins, a chief executive whose political philosophy seems 
slightly to the right of Reagan's. 
</P>
<P>
Hoskins has a big problem. An ambitious, obnoxious and unconscionable young 
Post reporter plans on breaking the news of a top-secret mission to rescue 
hostages from Lebanon, thereby threatening the success of the venture. What's a 
right-thinking President to do? He orders the FBI to lock up the reporter until 
the hostages are safely home. The raid is successful, but the incarceration 
isn't. The reporter dies in a car crash and a cover-up is attempted. It doesn't 
work, and the Post is in position to bring down another President. 
</P>
<P>
Though its specifics are unique, the situation -- with the press nipping at 
wounded politicians' scuffling heels like bush dogs coming off the eight-week 
low-cholesterol diet -- is more than faintly familiar from both fiction and 
nonfiction. Happily, Taylor presents it with neither pretentiousness nor 
rancor. This is not a political morality tale. Nor is it a mirthless paranoid 
thriller, though it includes some skulduggery in Paris and murder in 
Washington. It is instead a well-crafted yarn in which we are taken on a 
generally intriguing tour through the complex jungles of D.C. politics, with 
rumor, fables and facts convincingly melded. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, we meet the President's security adviser, a nimble-witted man of 
middle age who is the novel's protagonist; his paramour, a beautiful young 
reporter (the only heroic journalist in evidence); the aforementioned evil and 
manipulative Post editor; a rather dim Republican senator with presidential 
ambitions; a trusted member of the National Security Council who leaks the 
scandal to get her hated brother into hot water (his identity is a secret 
Taylor rightly keeps as long as possible); a collection of reporters of varying 
political persuasions who wittily bat the news about on a weekend TV show; and 
an assortment of military men, pols and media mites blessed with the gift of 
gritty gab. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other novelists who deal with national and international politics, 
Taylor is particularly straightforward in telling his story. We can actually 
follow the plot. His characters are credible and their dialogue has an 
authentic tone. And he convinces us that we are on the inside of a world that 
is as chillingly authentic as it is shadowy. 
</P>
<P>
The author's main failings are 1) that the ethics of the presidential act are 
never really addressed and 2) that he indulges in such aggressive media-bashing 
that one begins to feel sorry for even the likes of Geraldo Rivera. Those in 
the news-gathering profession will probably be annoyed by this apparent bias. 
</P>
<P>
But how angry can you be with an author who is able to so stylishly sum up 
recent D.C. history? "Watergate was Shakespeare," he writes, "and the 
Iran-Contra affair was Gilbert and Sullivan, complete with the very model of a 
modern lieutenant colonel. In journalist argot, they were both 'great political 
theater.' At curtain's fall -- as Nixon flew his living, breathing, bruised 
family to their Orange County Elba and Reagan's shaky hand reached out for his 
smiling new Russian friend and his newest prop, a pen for signing treaties -- 
many Washingtonians were strangely wistful as they filed back out into the 
neon-bright real world."
