and his third wife, Patricia, 41, have divorced because of "irreconcilable 
differences," said Peter Sherman, her attorney. Forbes magazine's survey of 
1989's richest Americans lists Kluge, chairman of the conglomerate Metromedia 
firm, as No. 1 with a net worth of $5.2 billion.

* Downsized: Former President Richard Nixon has for-sale signs up on his 
seven-bedroom house in Saddle River, N.J. He will move to a three-bedroom 
townhouse in nearby Park Ridge, spokesman John Taylor said Tuesday, adding the 
Nixons will "spend their energy on activities other than maintaining a large 
house on four acres." Taylor did not know the new home's purchase price or the 
old home's asking price, which the Nixons bought in 1981 for $1.25 million.
