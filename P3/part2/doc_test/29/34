The thing I still love about being on the road, other than 24-hour room 
service, is that you're always learning something new. 
</P>
<P>
For example: When you were growing up, you probably had a drive-in restaurant 
that you and your friends went to. Depending on where you lived, the place 
might have been called Frisch's, it might have been called Bob's Big Boy, it 
might have been called the Peter Pan. Regardless of what it was called, though, 
the routine was the same all over the United States. Kids would pull up in 
their cars on a summer evening, find a parking spot, order some cheap eats, and 
socialize in the warm night air until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
So what have I discovered on this particular trip? Well . . . in Whittier, 
Calif., a town not all that far from Los Angeles, the drive-in restaurant of 
choice during the 1950s was a place called . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's. 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Richard Nixon had strong roots in the city of Whittier, and when he was 
vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower his younger brother, Donald Nixon, 
apparently aware of the value of the family name, opened up Nixon's Drive-In. 
By all accounts, it was like most other American drive-ins, except it was 
called Nixon's. And the kids loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right on Whittier Boulevard," said Marian Saxon Bramlett, Whittier High 
School class of '58. Bramlett, now 49, works in the personnel department of the 
Whittier High School District. "It was quite popular. On the weekends, you'd 
have to get there pretty early in the evening to be sure to get a space for 
your car." 
</P>
<P>
Paula Abbott, also 49, said, "None of us really thought that it was unusual for 
a drive-in to be called Nixon's. The name certainly had no political meaning 
for us, even though we knew that Donald Nixon's brother was vice president of 
the United States. When someone would say 'Let's go to Nixon's,' our only 
thought was of having a good time. Nixon's was a drive-in, not a politician." 
</P>
<P>
According to Marian Bramlett, Donald Nixon had operated a sit-down place called 
Nixon's Family Restaurant before he opened Nixon's Drive-In. "He kept Nixon's 
Family Restaurant open, but that was mostly for our parents," Bramlett said. 
"The drive-in was for high school kids. So there were really two Nixon's 
restaurants in town at the same time. I'm told that Donald Nixon used to be 
present at the family restaurant, but I never saw him at the drive-in. I 
certainly never saw Richard Nixon at the drive-in." 
</P>
<P>
The courting routine at Nixon's Drive-In, she said, never varied. "The boys 
would arrive together in their souped-up cars, and they would park and open 
their hoods," she said. "The girls would arrive together and walk over to where 
the boys were. The girls would look at the boys, and the boys would look at 
their engines." 
</P>
<P>
Although precise historical documentation is vague, Bramlett and Abbott believe 
that it was 1955 or 1956 when Nixon's Drive-In got competition -- right down 
Whittier Boulevard, but on the other side of the street. The competition came 
in the form of a Bob's Big Boy. 
</P>
<P>
"The food was about the same at both places," Bramlett said. "But at Nixon's, 
you went up and got your French fries and Cokes yourself and took them back to 
your car. At Bob's Big Boy, they had carhops on roller skates." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Nixon's closed. "It wasn't that the food was bad or anything, or 
that we liked Bob's Big Boy better," Bramlett said. "I just think that Donald 
Nixon may not have been a very good businessman." Donald Nixon died in 1987 at 
the age of 73. 
</P>
<P>
Bramlett said that she drives by the spot where Nixon's used to stand virtually 
every day. Standing on the location now is -- you couldn't make this up -- a 
used car lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that the name Nixon has a certain connotation all around the world," 
Bramlett said. "And I also know that some people have good feelings toward the 
name, and some people have bad feelings toward the name. 
</P>
<P>
"But for a lot of us the word means a lot more than just the name of a man who 
became President. Nixon's was the place where we had the most fun on the nights 
when we were young. We were young and happy, and we went to Nixon's."
