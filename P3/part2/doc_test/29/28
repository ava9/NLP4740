  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the PRC State Council and concurrently foreign 
minister, on 23 April sent a message of condolences on former 
U.S. President Richard Nixon's death. The text of the message 
follows: 
  I was distressed to learn of Mr. Richard Nixon's passing 
away, and would like to express my heartfelt condolences. 
  While he was alive, Mr. Nixon made major contributions to 
reopening the door of Sino-U.S. relations, and devoted great 
efforts to maintaining and developing Sino-U.S. relations. I am 
deeply convinced that Sino-U.S. relations, for which Mr. Nixon 
showed concern and in which he played a role during his life, 
will surely be improved and strengthened further. 
  I would like to express my cordial solicitude for Mr. 
Nixon's 
family.
