Carmine S. Bellino, the doggedly determined congressional investigator who 
played a major role in the downfall of Teamsters James R. Hoffa and Dave Beck, 
has died of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken former FBI agent and one-time aide to President John F. Kennedy 
was 84 and died Tuesday in Coconut Creek, Fla., where he had retired in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s investigations of Beck and Hoffa by the Senate Select Committee 
on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field, to the Senate 
Watergate Committee where he was a leading investigator, Bellino served a 
single self-avowed purpose: 
</P>
<P>
"To make the figures talk." 
</P>
<P>
He had followed the complicated trails of illicit funds since receiving his 
accounting degree from New York University. He became a special agent for the 
FBI in 1934 and had risen to administrative assistant to J. Edgar Hoover by 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
But the man whom Robert F. Kennedy once called "the best investigator in the 
country" grew restless in Hoover's vast bureaucracy and retired to his private 
accounting firm before Congress called upon him. For the next three decades he 
would serve as a staff aide or consulting investigator to the Joint Committee 
on Atomic Energy, the House Health Education and Labor Committee, the House 
Public Roads Committee, the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, the Senate 
Agriculture Committee and more. 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed a "skimming" operation involving slot machines in West Germany 
played by American servicemen; the smuggling of millions of dollars in 
black-market currency out of Vietnam during the war and discovered that Maj. 
Gen. Bennett E. Meyers, deputy chief of procurement for the Air Force during 
World War II, had owned a war factory. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers went to prison and so did John Maragon, a White House aide in the Truman 
Administration who was convicted of perjury during an investigation of 5% fees 
being assessed businessmen who were awarded government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
During the time he was chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee in 
1973 -- which investigated the break-in at Democratic national headquarters in 
1972 -- Bellino himself was accused of having ordered electronic surveillance 
of Republican offices to help the Democrats in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy 
defeated Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was made by George Bush, then Republican national chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that Bellino was so thorough that he once 
determined the gross income of an Atlantic City hostelry that figured in an 
illicit sex operation by determining from a laundry the number of towels 
delivered there each week. 
</P>
<P>
Between congressional posts he served as an adviser to President Kennedy and 
the Bureau of the Budget. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired by municipalities across the country and, in 1976, the Los Angeles 
Board of Supervisors brought him in to audit the tax rolls in a disagreement 
over the assessment policies of the late County Assessor Philip Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Bellino's first wife died in 1979. He is survived by his second wife, 
Catherine, seven children from his first marriage and 31 grandchildren.
