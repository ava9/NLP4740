FT  25 OCT 93 / Lord Grimond dies of a stroke aged 80
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Grimond, who led the Liberal party for 11 years from 1956, died last
night aged 80. His family said at his Orkney home that he had died in
hospital from a stroke.
Last night Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: 'We have
lost a lion of the Liberal cause. Jo Grimond's death will be mourned by
millions who shared his beliefs and by all who value the strength of our
democracy and integrity in our politics.
'He brought the Liberal cause back from the verge of extinction, introduced
new ideas which have today become commonplace in the agenda of all parties
and inspired a whole new generation of liberal thinkers and activists.'
Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat MP for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale,
and a former Liberal leader, said: 'Jo Grimond brought me into politics and
he was the inspiration of an entire generation of Liberals.
'But his gift was that he reached out beyond the ranks of Liberals. His were
the grand themes of European integration and of Scottish self-government
within it.
'He was a great debunker of pomposity and bureaucracy, a cultivated man who
enjoyed literature and art and had a glorious sense of humour. I do not
believe that the Liberal party would have survived at all but for his
leadership in the late 50s when it was down to five MPs. We all owe him an
immense debt.'
Lord Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, said he was 'very
upset' at the death of his former adversary.
He added: 'Although he was an opponent in politics I always held him in very
considerable regard for his ability and indeed for his charm. I always liked
him very much indeed and admired him immensely.'
Lord Grimond, a barrister, entered parliament in 1950 as MP for Orkney and
Shetland. He held the seat for 33 years and became a life peer in 1983.
