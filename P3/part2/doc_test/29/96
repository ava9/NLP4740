NIXON LIBRARY TO GET INCOME FROM NEW BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation will receive the income 
from former President Nixon's new book, foundation officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The book, as yet untitled and written for Simon &amp; Schuster, will be Nixon's 
eighth and is scheduled for publication next spring. The dollar value of the 
contract was not disclosed. Previous Nixon books -- "Six Crises," "The Real 
War," "No More Vietnam" and last year's "1999: Victory Without War" -- were on 
the New York Times' best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the new contract, all seven of Nixon's previous books will be 
reissued by Simon &amp; Schuster in uniform "Nixon Library and Birthplace" 
editions, foundation Executive Director Hugh Hewitt said. Their release is 
scheduled to coincide with the opening of the facility in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps even more important than the books is President Nixon's leadership 
contribution to the library construction," Hewitt said. "It has made our final 
fund-raising sprint much more achievable." 
</P>
<P>
The new book contains firsthand accounts of Nixon's meetings with Charles de 
Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Mao Zedong and former Presidents Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"The book contains reflections and conclusions based on my entire life from 
private, political, foreign policy and philosophical standpoints," Nixon said. 
"It is the most personal book I have ever written." 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library and birthplace are to be the first facilities of their kind 
built and operated without tax funds, according to foundation President William 
E. Simon. Nixon's contribution from book sales will assist in the $25-million 
fund-raising goal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorba Linda farmhouse where Nixon was born on Jan. 9, 1913, is undergoing 
restoration and will be part of a nine-acre facility under construction.
