New Jersey Fines Trump Plaza: Financially strapped casino king Donald J. Trump 
got some more bad news when his Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino was fined 
$40,000 for violating state gaming regulations. The New Jersey Casino Control 
Commission said between May, 1987, and January, 1990, Financial Director 
Michael Hlavsa and Financial Controller Rodney Ferguson hired six accountants 
who did not have the proper licenses. Acting commission Chairwoman Valerie 
Armstrong said the financial officers falsified paper work that was later 
forwarded to the commission to make it appear the accountants were doing jobs 
that did not require casino licenses.
