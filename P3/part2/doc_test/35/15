Trump Deadline Passes: Donald Trump's Thursday midnight deadline to make a 
$47.3-million interest payment passed with no word on whether he was able to 
work out a deal with bondholders who invested in his Taj Mahal casino. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders' representatives have threatened a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for 
Atlantic City's biggest casino as early as today. At press time, there were no 
signs whether the developer and the holders of $675 million in junk bonds were 
near an agreement to restructure the debt. The Trump Organization was saying 
very little. Telephones at Trump's New York headquarters went unanswered late 
Thursday.
