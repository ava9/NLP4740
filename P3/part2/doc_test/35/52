A SUITABLE BOY
by Vikram Seth
Phoenix House Pounds 20, 1,349 pages
BOOK-reviewers tend to be paid at a rate appropriate to the length of their
reviews rather than that of the book they are reviewing. A few more novels
like this one and we shall need some clause compensating us in the case of
books that make demands 'deemed to be beyond the normal course of duty'.
Never can a variant of that old Hollywood formula 'Boy meets girl. Boy gets
girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl' have been stretched to such inordinate
lengths. Here the storyline is: boy (charmer, fellow-student, Moslem) meets
girl (beautiful, English literature student, Hindu); gets girl in spite of
maternal opposition; loses girl; nearly regains girl but loses girl finally
to Suitable Boy (solid, reliable, all set for successful career in the
shoe-manufacturing business, Hindu, right caste, but lacking charm or
glamour).
Seth is the latest instance of an Indian writer, steeped in his own
indigenous tradition, who has been through the mill of a British and
American education, (Doon in India, then Tonbridge, Oxford, Stanford and
Nanjing University, China). Such a writer tends at the outset to look to
English and other European literatures for models and to say to himself:
'Anything you can do, I can do . . . if not better then at least longer.'
Salman Rushdie, you may recall, took for his model Sterne's Tristram Shandy
with far-reaching results.
The early model for Seth was The Tales of Pushkin. They provided the
inspiration for The Golden Gate - a novel he wrote in verse about the
inhabitants of California's silicon valley. It was published here in 1986 by
Faber. Seth's witty stanzas wove a neatly plotted tale of a broken marriage,
a homosexual affair and a ferociously possessive cat. The notion of writing
such a story in a rigid metrical form must have seemed to be the greatest
commercial folly. Only a publisher with its own Cats to fall back upon would
have been prepared to under-write it. But Seth put himself on the literary
map with this tour de force and it has by now sold a cool 150,000 copies.
The immediate models for A Suitable Boy are 19th century novels like Madame
Bovary and Anna Karenina. Although everything is rooted in the growth of a
love-affair, with the heroine occupying the centre of the stage, her
forbidden passion is viewed in the context of the moral, cultural and
political attitudes of a whole society. The city where she lives is the
centre from which the reader beholds a social structure whose boundaries are
those of the aristocracy at the top, the bourgeoisie in the middle and the
peasantry at the bottom.
Seth's heroine, Lata, comes from a well-to-do Hindu family many of whose
members hold important positions in newly independent India. She is a
student at the university of Brahmpur - an imaginary place somewhat
reminiscent of Patna and Brinkipore. It is few hours railway journey to
Calcutta. The contrast between the life-style of the smart 'permissive'
Bengali society of her brother's wife's family with whom she stays and the
restricted provincial life of her home near the campus where she meets the
handsome unsuitable boy she falls in love with, is done with a precision of
detail that would earn Seth full marks from his French and Russian masters.
It is one of many such contrasts of ambience in the depiction of the four
families whose members are singled out for close scrutiny. They are
surrounded by this novel's hundred or more subsidiary characters, mainly
Indian but also one or two British who have stayed on .
Tolstoy contrasted adulterous Anna with virtuous Kitty, and arrogant Vronsky
with likeable Levin. Seth has several alternative heroines to Lata up his
sleeve and he produces them one after the other as he develops the narrative
along pairs of parallel lines. There is the music-loving courtesan whose
scented drawing-room is so sensuously described; there is Sava, Lata's
sister, a young, happily married woman about to give birth to her first
child; there is cynical, delectable Meenakshi, her sister-in-law,
nonchalantly deceiving her husband, a member of the Shady Ladies' Club;
there is the Moslem wife of the idealistic Urdu teacher whom we hardly see
since her creed prevents it, but whose fate is nonetheless every bit as
poignant as Lata's.
A similar multiplication of themes occurs. Apart from its fictional virtues,
the book may be read as a gloss on the violence in India today; much of it
stems from the period the novel illuminates, the early 1950s when the
problems inherited by the first all-Indian governments from the British were
at their most acute. Then in the same depth there is the world of the
campus, with its own ruthless political manoeuvering and an eccentrically
distrait mathematical genius (lover-boy's papa) thrown in for good measure.
But away from academe and government, Seth seems just as at home in the
world of agriculture and sweated farm labour, the abuses practised by the
zemindars (revenue collectors) on behalf of the great landlords. Yet another
dimension comes in the descriptions of religious fundamentalism in action,
the ceremonies lasting several days and drawing vast, unruly crowds on the
banks of the Ganges. And depicted in most detail of all is the world of
shoe-manufacturing (Seth's father's occupation), with its domination at the
top by emigre foreigners. It is used brilliantly as a metaphor for India's
industrial problems as well as the Suitable Boy's. The SB also has a Hindu
rival - a young poet, beginning to make a big name for himself, clearly a
portrait of the author, but he drops out of the hunt (for no very
satisfactory reason that I could see).
But I could easily fill the whole of this page merely describing the
amazingly rich content of the novel. Yet it remains so readable because the
prose is always direct and incisive. Does it all hold together? Yes, it
does, amazingly enough - rather like a Taj Mahal made out of Lego. Some
parts are detachable. One section has already been published as a
self-contained long short story. The controlled energy of the writing
carries one over the melodramatic cliches of plotting to which Seth resorts
to sustain his narrative. All in all, it is an outstanding achievement for
which he deserves the warmest congratulation.
