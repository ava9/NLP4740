Trump Payment in Doubt: Developer Donald J. Trump raised new doubts about his 
financial stability by telling the American Stock Exchange that it was unclear 
whether he would make an interest payment on Taj Mahal casino bonds next month. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shabazian, an exchange spokesman, said the Trump Organization made the 
statement in response to a question from the exchange, where the bonds are 
traded. Shabazian said Trump didn't say whether the payment would be made. The 
Trump Organization is supposed to pay $47 million in interest on $675 million 
in Taj bonds Nov. 15.
