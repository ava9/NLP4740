THE DONALDS . . . OOPS, MAKE THAT DODGERS, JUST ASKING FOR A FALL 
</P>

<P>
When you live for today and fail to plan for the future, eventually you pay for 
it. Donald Trump's penchant for trophy properties, like the Plaza and Taj 
Mahal, has drained his cash and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' similar quest for veteran players such as Murray, Gibson, Griffin, 
Brooks, etc., has drained the organization of talented youngsters who are now 
blossoming elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Other similarities between Trump and the Dodgers: Both seem quite adept at 
blowing their own horns, both bask in past glories and both seem reluctant to 
change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
They may also find themselves spending a lot of time in new locations: Trump in 
bankruptcy court and the Dodgers in the basement.
