<TEXT>
<P>
El Nino, a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn 
of the century, could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year, 
weather forecasters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
El Nino may bring drought conditions to eastern Australia, where farmers are 
suffering from falling commodity prices and high interest rates, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The effect begins with a warming of water in the Pacific between Australia and 
South America followed by a change in atmospheric pressure and a movement of 
winds that carry rain-bearing clouds away from Australia toward the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
It was named El Nino, Spanish for boy child, by fishermen off Peru who noticed 
an increase in water temperature followed by torrential rain.
