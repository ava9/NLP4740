The three-year drought that has brought parts of southern Orange County close 
to water rationing this summer has also left the county's vast acreage of 
underbrush unusually vulnerable to fire, officials warned Monday. A heavy 
rainfall that occurred earlier in the year increased the growth of underbrush, 
they said, but when the rain stopped, the brush died, adding to an 
already-significant amount of flammable grasses in so-called wild lands. 
</P>
<P>
"With the rain came an increased amount of vegetation," said Capt. Joe Kerr of 
the Orange County Fire Department. "When the rain did not maintain itself, the 
dieback only added to the flammable shrubs already there, making a bad 
situation worse." 
</P>
<P>
Since the drought began, brush fires have increased at an alarming rate, 
according to figures maintained by Kerr's department, which serves a number of 
cities and the unincorporated areas in the county. In 1986, there were 92 
wild-land fires that destroyed more than 156 acres. In 1987, 186 fires burned 
more than 2,116 acres. And in 1988, 396 fires swept over 3,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said that in addition to the increase in flammable shrubs, a recent survey 
of the fuel moisture in the county indicates a higher level of dryness than 
usually found at the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We found the dryness to be what it would have been after the arrival of strong 
Santa Ana winds at the end of the fall season," he said. "Those winds haven't 
arrived yet, and with the dryness at this point, it's definitely something we 
are monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firefighters Fear Worst 
</P>
<P>
Because temperatures have been relatively mild this summer and there have been 
few Santa Ana winds, fire officials have been able to contain the problem. But 
the worst may be yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen some mild signs of the Santa Ana winds, and they will probably come 
again even stronger," Kerr said. "They can frequently come towards the end of 
September or October, which is certainly another critical situation. But to 
counteract that, we also have a long-range forecast that predicts rainfall in 
those months." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has had just 8.51 inches rain this year, in contrast with an 
average of about 13. Last year's rainfall was 10.03, according to the 
WeatherData center in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reduce the amount of brush and wild land destroyed by fire, county 
firefighters are offering several prevention programs aimed at increasing 
public awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to instill into the public that fire safety isn't just for a 
month or a particular season," spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. "We've been very 
fortunate so far." 
</P>

Safety Zone Around Home 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire season usually begins in June, fire officials began taking 
precautions in May because of the unusually dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Weed abatement is one of our programs, where we encourage people to remove 
dead, dry weeds and hanging tree limbs and branches a certain distance from 
their homes," Cha said. "The slightest spark can set off a fire." 
</P>
<P>
She said residents who do not take fire precautions can have fines attached to 
property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, fire officials have posted warning signs in such areas as 
Rancho Santa Margarita and Trabuco Hills, where there is heavy underbrush.
