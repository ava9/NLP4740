Rain, a rare sight the past four years, poured down Monday night on parched 
Orange County, causing havoc on the freeways as motorists tried to remember how 
to drive on on slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
At least 30 "fender-benders" were reported on county freeways late Monday, 
California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The roads are really slick because the rain lifts the oil from the surface," 
said a CHP dispatcher. "There's been a lot of accidents. People aren't used to 
driving in the rain. It's been so long." 
</P>
<P>
Scattered power failures were reported in Garden Grove and Stanton, a Southern 
California Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's downpour was the first measurable precipitation since Aug. 5 and 
the most significant rain in the Southland since May 28. 
</P>
<P>
Although the compact but powerful storm system, which arrived from the Pacific 
Ocean during the afternoon, dampened the Southland, it was not expected to be 
the "drought buster" the county needs, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm should leave the county early today and give way to cooler, clear 
skies and gusty winds by mid-morning, according to Marty McKewon, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
As much as half an inch of rain could fall in some mountain and coastal areas, 
McKewon said. No precipitation figures were available late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real big storm system . . . but it does have a pretty good punch," 
McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The system looks like it's got quite a bit of moisture. But I don't think a 
widespread range, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, is going to get rain. 
Unfortunately, some locations will get very little, if any," McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
By Thanksgiving, the temperatures throughout Orange County should warm up to a 
pleasant 70 degrees, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in the county Monday was a mild 65 degrees in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The foreboding weather Monday, which included gusting winds over the Mojave 
Desert, forced the space shuttle Atlantis to delay landing. The swirling winds 
are not expected to let up today, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, before the downpour, anticipation ran high. People pulled out 
their umbrellas and slickers, brought in their dogs and cats and cast watchful 
glances from office windows before stepping outside. 
</P>
<P>
"All the media and every John Doe is calling in, wanting to know if it is 
really going to rain, what are the chances of rain, how much rain are we going 
to get, when is it going to rain," said meteorologist Jerry McDuffie of the 
National Weather Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't rained in so long, and it's just something people in California do 
out here, period." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Orange County has received only several hundredths of an inch of rain 
for the season, which started July 1. The average precipitation at this point 
of the season is 1.59 inches. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Southern California has been suffering a drought, with 
rainfall levels far below normal. The average amount of precipitation recorded 
by the end of October is 11.03 inches; this year, a mere 6.30 inches has been 
measured in the same period, McDuffie said.
