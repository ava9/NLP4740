has triumphed again. But for how long?

Mr Helmut Kohl's narrow victory in the German elections, with a majority of
just 10 seats for his conservative-liberal coalition, was a personal triumph
for the German chancellor.
In less than nine months, he transformed a lame-duck administration,
trailing several points behind its opponents in the polls, into a winner.
He did it very largely thanks to his own reputation and his own efforts. Yet
his victory may prove to have been more Pyrrhic than real. Many are already
speculating about how long the current coalition can last.
On the one hand, the very narrowness of the victory has done wonders in
concentrating the minds of the coalition partners. The usually interminable
negotiations between Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its
Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and their minority
liberal partners, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), have been completed in
record time.
Trouble might well have been expected from either of the small parties. The
FDP, in particular, in spite of being decimated in the election, with a drop
in support from 11 per cent in 1990 to under 7 per cent, nevertheless holds
the balance of power in the Bundestag. It desperately needs to gain an
independent profile. But Mr Klaus Kinkel, the party leader and foreign
minister, went along with a strategy of papering over the cracks.
The CSU, now the second largest party in the coalition, might have held out
for bigger and better jobs at the expense of the FDP. But Mr Theo Waigel,
the CSU leader and finance minister, also played it cool.
They all agree on the broad outline of government priorities, on the need to
cut back public spending from the present 51 per cent of gross national
product, to reduce the budget deficit within the guidelines of the
Maastricht treaty.
All this must be done while continuing to finance the burden of German
unification, requiring massive public transfers to restructure the east
German economy, to pay for the continuing high unemployment, finance the
local government administration which still lacks any reliable tax base, and
pay for large-scale investment in all forms of infrastructure.
As for foreign policy, it is also broadly agreed, with a strategy of
enlarging the European Union to the east linked with further clear steps to
greater integration in the west.
On the other hand, the difficulties will lie in the detail, in the tactics,
rather than the strategy. Precise details of the promised reforms of
corporate taxation, of social spending cuts, and of measures to combat
rising crime and illegal immigration, could all upset the apple-cart.
Foreign policy, too, may not be as straightforward as it looks, with
differences between the parties on the pace of opening to the east, and on
European integration.
The problems for Mr Kohl certainly look fairly daunting. In the first place,
he heads a tired team, urgently in need of fresh blood, but with little
available to revive it. His new cabinet looks depressingly like the old one.
Mr Kinkel has emerged from the election campaign looking like a loser, and
may indeed be replaced by his party next year, if it can find an
alternative. Mr Waigel has also failed to stamp his authority on his own
party, having failed to become prime minister in Bavaria last year.
Remaining in Bonn is obviously his second choice. Both return to the cabinet
with their former jobs.
The brightest lights in the government are relatively junior.  In the CDU,
Mr Matthias Wissmann, hitherto transport minister and before that briefly
research minister, has shown himself competent and an effective
communicator. In the CSU, Mr Horst Seehofer, as health minister, was also
one of the success stories of the previous administration. The freshest new
face is that of 28-year-old Ms CLaudia Nolte, who has shot straight into the
cabinet as minister for women, youth, families and the elderly, combining
two former ministries. Overall, there will be 17 ministers, two fewer than
before. Chancellor Kohl has compounded his personnel problems by giving
intimations of his own mortality: he let it be known during the election
campaign that he would not stand again in 1998. That seems certain to
unleash a debilitating succession struggle in the not-too-distant future,
unless he goes back on his word.
In his own party, his natural successor, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU
parliamentary leader, has the severe handicap of being wheelchair-bound
following an assassination attempt in 1990. Mr Volker Ruhe, another
erstwhile crown prince, has not enhanced his reputation as defence minister,
and is thoroughly unpopular in his own party. Mr Kohl's instinct for
political survival has ensured that most potential rivals for his position -
like Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, now state premier in Saxony, or Mr Heiner Geissler,
the former party secretary-general - have been banished from the corridors
of power.
The succession struggle may only begin in a couple of years. But the
chancellor faces a more immediate problem: how to rule not only with a
paper-thin majority in the Bundestag, but against a hostile majority in the
Bundesrat, the second house of parliament, representing the 16 federal
states.
The Bundesrat never operates entirely along party-political lines,
representing a complex mix of state governments which range from grand
coalitions between the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD),
through 'rainbow' coalitions of many parties - SPD, Greens and FDP, for
example - to single party rule in a minority of states. The SPD's leading
role in a majority of the governments means that it has the capacity to
block legislation, above all where finance is required. So Mr Kohl faces the
prospect of having to rule in a de facto grand coalition with the SPD in the
Bundesrat, as well as with his FDP and CSU partners in the Bundestag. This
really means that Germany's states will continue to wield considerable power
in Bonn - as when they were able to win substantially increased influence
over European Union decisions in the process of ratifying the Maastricht
treaty. They can trim the ambitions of the federal government, and upset
plans for strict spending control.
Mr Kohl is a past master at the consensus-building required by such a
political stalemate, but it does mean that decision-making becomes
enormously time-consuming and unwieldy.
Perhaps his greatest problem will be the unpredictability of his junior
coalition partner, the FDP. The liberals, members of almost every Bonn
coalition, were punished by voters for their lack of policy profile, and
their lack of personalities.
They only managed to scrape back into the Bundestag thanks to a large number
of second votes - in favour of a party list, rather than individual
candidates - transferred by CDU supporters, who calculated (correctly) that
without the FDP in parliament, the coalition would have no majority at all.
The temptation now will be to seek that profile by distancing themselves
from their coalition partners.
Mr Kinkel is committed to the coalition: he fought the election on that
basis, and fought the doubters in his party. But there are clearly those
within its ranks - including Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics
minister, and possibly Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former leader and
foreign minister, who remains very much the father-figure - who might be
tempted to bring down the coalition in mid-term, with an eye to the next
elections.
One strategy would be to force the CDU and SPD into a grand coalition, as
happened in 1969, leading ultimately to a change in 1972 to an SPD-FDP
coalition under Chancellor Willy Brandt. Another, much less predictable,
would be simply to switch allegiance to the SPD in a rainbow coalition with
the Greens. With the FDP desperate to recover its lost electors, any such
strategy may be possible. Mr Kohl will do his level best to keep them on
board, because he knows that the alternative of a grand coalition with the
SPD has never proved healthy for his party in the past.
It allows the Social Democrats to demonstrate that they can be worthy and
reliable members of a government, to overcome the conservative German
electors' innate mistrust. As for the SPD itself, the party leadership has
adopted a strategy of wait-and-see. The election result was a
disappointment, but in the end, not a disaster. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the
youthful leader, has moved from his provincial base in Mainz, where he was
state premier, to the Bundestag as parliamentary leader, giving himself the
national platform he needs to prepare for a possible change of power. He
knows that the pressure is on Mr Kohl and his coalition rather than on the
opposition.
He has problems on two fronts: he must ensure that his main rival for the
party leadership, the smoother and more articulate Mr Gerhard Schroder,
state premier in Lower Saxony, cannot mount a challenge. As he was closely
involved in the SPD election strategy, he cannot distance himself from blame
for the defeat. The other problem is to oppose the Chancellor, without being
seen to be totally negative: the SPD majority in the Bundesrat must be used
with care. That is the in-built pressure in the German system towards
consensus.
Nothing is entirely predictable about the next four years in German
political life. But the consensus-building system will probablymuddle on,
never producing entirely clear decisions, but still finding acceptable
solutions. It is really more a system of non-government, than strong
government, which may well be one secret of German success.
