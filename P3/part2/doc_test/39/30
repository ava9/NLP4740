FINISH OFF THE COLD WAR: STOP COVERT ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Arthur Macy Cox, Arthur Macy Cox is secretary of the American Committee on 
U.S.-Soviet Relations, a bipartisan, public -policy organization. He was 
formerly a diplomat and a CIA official.

<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush triumphed at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
summit last week because he jettisoned a sterile Cold War ideology that marked 
the first four months of his Administration and adopted new thinking that can 
lead to genuine disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
The President has moved "beyond containment" in response to evidence that 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repudiated Soviet policies of expansionism and is 
moving to demilitarize U.S.-Soviet competition. But partial military 
disarmament will not be enough to end the Cold War. While it has been fueled by 
an arms race, it has also been waged by clandestine paramilitary and political 
operations and espionage. Bush should maintain his initiative by proposing 
negotiations to terminate the clandestine war. 
</P>
<P>
After 45 years of profound distrust on both sides, continuing secret operations 
will be a barrier to stable coexistence. Throughout the Cold War, both 
Washington and Moscow used each other's clandestine operations to measure true 
intentions. No matter how much peaceful rhetoric was contained in the speeches 
of superpower leaders, evidence of covert action and espionage was proof of 
continuing aggression. These operations manifestly increase tension. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent news stories are instructive. Over the weekend of May 20, the 
British government expelled 11 Soviets -- eight diplomats and three journalists 
-- as spies. In a typical tit-for-tat response, the Soviets expelled an equal 
number of British diplomats and journalists from Moscow. Gorbachev's "new 
thinking" has not yet changed the habits of the KGB. This event soured 
British-Soviet relations. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an early supporter 
of Gorbachev's programs, said the continuing espionage revealed "that many 
things remain the same. I'm disappointed . . . they have revealed their true 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
The other concerns John Le Carre, the former British secret agent, who has 
written some of the best Cold War spy novels. His latest book, "The Russia 
House," will be published in the Soviet Union. The book focuses on how 
intelligence services, both East and West, block attempts, on both sides, to 
end the Cold War. Le Carre says that spies will find new ways to keep anyone 
from doing them out of their jobs by launching new espionage plots. All of this 
resonates with the spy ousters in London and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year record of clandestine operations, on both sides, is not impressive. 
In fact, those operations have often caused serious setbacks to the security of 
both superpowers. The Soviets were thrown out of Yugoslavia, Egypt, Ghana and 
Guinea -- in large measure because KGB operations attempting to overthrow the 
indigenous regimes were publicly exposed. With Egypt, the Soviets lost a 
strategic Middle East base when the head of Egyptian intelligence was revealed 
to be a KGB agent planning a coup to replace Anwar Sadat. The United States, 
too, has sponsored numerous failed secret operations with disastrous 
consequences, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the Iran-Contra 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Even the so-called covert successes have, in time, often produced horrendous 
negative repercussions. For example, in the period from 1969 to 1971, the most 
important Soviet foreign-policy negotiation was with Chancellor Willy Brandt of 
West Germany. It resulted in the recognition of East Germany. This agreement 
did more to reduce the risk of war than any diplomacy since the end of World 
War II. Shortly after, however, the West Germans discovered that an East German 
spy, directed by the KGB, had long been employed in Brandt's offices. Brandt 
was compromised and he resigned -- much to the embarrassment of the Soviet 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, when Chinese and Soviet forces engaged in border clashes, the Soviets 
demanded that the Chinese negotiate. They refused. So the KGB launched a covert 
operation, spreading rumors that the Soviets were about to launch a preemptive 
strike to eliminate Chinese nuclear capability. The Chinese were intimidated, 
and agreed to talk, but also began "Ping-Pong" diplomacy. In 1971, Henry A. 
Kissinger made his secret trip to Beijing and soon President Richard M. Nixon 
arrived to sign the agreement re-establishing relations between the United 
States and China. Thus, a successful Soviet covert operation paved the way to 
U.S.-Chinese rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
A covert operation claimed as one of CIA's greatest successes was the overthrow 
of President Mohammed Mossadeq of Iran and restoration of the shah in 1953. 
Mossadeq had been popular; the shah was not. His power came from secret police, 
the military and U.S. assistance. The ensuing revolution brought with it 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's religious fundamentalism. This unfortunate turn 
of events for the United States was rooted in a so-called successful CIA 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of the Cold War, covert operations were marginal at best; 
today, they have become an anachronism. Gorbachev and his associates are 
determined to dismantle Stalinism. They have rejected the goal of worldwide 
communist states run from Moscow. They want to disarm by more than 50% and they 
want to demilitarize competition with the West. They urge a ban on direct or 
indirect military intervention in Third World disputes, including the use of 
covert paramilitary forces. Thus, Gorbachev's policies are removing the 
rationale for clandestine warfare. When it becomes clear that both sides have 
given up the goal of winning the Cold War, it will be apparent that new 
clandestine operations are counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The process may have begun. Earlier this year, Jack Matlock, U.S. ambassador to 
the Soviet Union, was invited to an unprecedented private meeting with KGB 
Chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov. A recent unofficial joint study prepared by 
U.S. and Soviet experts dealt with measures to end the Cold War. The Soviet 
delegation noted that essential trust between the powers will not be possible 
until espionage and covert operations have ended. The Soviets observed that as 
long as there was a danger of war, every method of obtaining reliable 
information was used -- but they noted that an important means to replace 
espionage will be on-site inspection. In the past, the Soviet Union opposed 
on-site inspection, fearing U.S. espionage. They have reversed that position by 
accepting comprehensive provisions for verification. 
</P>
<P>
After pressing the Soviet Union to accept on-site inspection for more than 30 
years, some U.S. leaders are now expressing hesitancy. CIA Director William H. 
Webster recently observed that the comprehensive verification procedures 
proposed by the Soviet Union "could be difficult if not dangerous." Of course 
they will be difficult, but if the Soviet Union is willing to open its defense 
industry to U.S. inspection, it would be unconscionable for the United States 
not to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
Espionage may be the second-oldest profession, but it is also a hostile act. 
Furthermore, it is no longer necessary. A combination of disarmament agreements 
verified by on-site inspection and technological intelligence will provide 
better security than at any time during the Cold War. Through the precision 
cameras of space reconnaissance, the United States has photographed the entire 
Soviet Union in minute detail. This information, when combined with electronic 
interception, radar, code-breaking and computers, provides excellent 
intelligence about Soviet military capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is time to launch the negotiations to end the clandestine war. High 
priorities should be given to removing intelligence personnel from embassy 
staffs and U.N. delegations. Spy masters, operating under diplomatic cover, 
have been a major source of distrust and an impediment to diplomacy. The 
phasing-out of clandestine operations is difficult but essential, in order to 
proceed simultaneously with political and disarmament negotiations.
