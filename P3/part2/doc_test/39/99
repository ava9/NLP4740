DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FOUND STABBED IN POLICE PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 44-year-old man was critically injured Thursday morning when he apparently 
stabbed himself shortly after leaving a Los Angeles police station in 
Northridge where he had spent the night in the lobby, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tarzana man was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills after 
he was found at 6:50 a.m. in the parking lot behind the Devonshire Division 
station at Etiwanda Avenue and Devonshire Street, Detective Michael Brandt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the man was found on the ground next to his car by a police officer 
who had driven into the parking lot. The injured man had a knife or some other 
sharp instrument pushed through his throat, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the incident was being investigated as a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The man walked into the lobby of the police station at 1 a.m. and asked the 
front desk officer if he could stay there until morning, when he had an 
appointment at a nearby psychiatrist's office. The desk officer allowed him to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer gave him a newspaper and he sat in the lobby and read it," Brandt 
said. "He seemed to be OK. There was no indication at the time that anything 
was wrong, that he was upset or suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
The man left the station at 6:30 a.m. and was found 20 minutes later.
