<F P=106> [Report by Bela Anda: "Brandt's Widow Breaks Silence"] </F>
  [Text] Was Karl Wienand, the powerful Bundestag group 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] between 1976 and 
1974, a KGB spy? Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt (47), Willy Brandt's 
widow, told BILD: "In the second half of March 1992, Valentin 
Falin, the former Soviet ambassador to Bonn, visited Brandt in 
Bonn." 
  During this meeting, Falin told Willy Brandt that Wienand 
was 
a KGB spy, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt stated. The Federal 
Intelligence Service was then informed. 
  Wienand emphatically rejected all accusations yesterday. 
  In the meantime, official Bonn has been alarmed by the 
suspicions of espionage that also affect former SPD Bundestag 
group chairman Wehner, who died in 1990. 
  Waigel, the head of the Christian Democratic Union, called 
on 
the SPD in Munich "to clarify the matter." SPD leader Scharping 
did not see much new in the accusations against Wehner. 
  BILD asked former SPD leader Vogel: "Did Brandt tell you 
anything about Wienand's activities as an agent?" 
  Vogel replied: "For reasons of principle, I do not want to 
disclose details of talks that were held when Willy Brandt knew 
he would die soon. I consider this respect for human dignity. 
Thus, no conclusions can be drawn in any direction."
