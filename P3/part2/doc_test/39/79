REMEMBERING MY GOOD FRIENDS: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY
by George Weidenfeld
HarperCollins
Pounds 20, 483 pages
Lord Weidenfeld, the publisher, has written an autobiography called
Remembering My Good Friends of whom he seems to have so many that the book
can be read as an exercise in name-dropping. It is perhaps fortunate that he
does not drink alcohol; otherwise he might have treated a list of French
wines in much the same gushing way.
It might be said of him - indeed Weidenfeld suggests it several times in the
course of these memoirs - that he was the great innovative publisher of the
post-1945 period. More critical readers might recall, however, that the list
of authors is more impressive than the books produced or the evidence of
them having been much edited.
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson is not alone in this, but the firm was the pioneer of
bulk memoirs, often too hastily written, too long, and insufficiently
checked. That led in turn to partial serialisation, which frequently gives a
wholly misleading impression of the book. The temptation to write them and
publish them has not diminished with time and Weidenfeld has himself
succumbed.
It should be an interesting story. Weidenfeld was a well-educated refugee
from Austria who made his way up in England first through the wartime
service of the BBC, then through publishing. It was an imperial world he
left behind, and at least an aristocratic world to which he looked forward.
Weidenfeld writes that his family had taught him that Vienna was the centre
of the universe, so much so that nobody bothered to teach him English.
In Britain he saw his challenge as being how to turn his condition of being
'with the English but not of the English into an advantage'. The old
background served him well. The chapter 'English Life: the Learning Process'
is devoted almost entirely to a study of the English upper classes:
aristocrats mingling with writers and the odd politician.
In a later chapter, 'Manhattan Mosaic', there is a similar approach to life
in New York: so-and-so, the younger son of a publishing family 'was adopted
and rumoured to be the illegitimate child of a member of the British royal
family.' The taste for the well-born extends even to Israel where Weidenfeld
dwells on the charms of the old Zionist aristocracy. In London he delighted
in being introduced to what he calls the 'British haute Juiverie'.
Israel forms the most serious parts of the book. Weidenfeld has no qualms
(nor should he) about the support he has given the Zionist cause over the
years. And yet there must be a question of balance, especially in a country
that is neither Jewish nor Arab and also a permanent member of the UN
Security Council. Here Weidenfeld writes in slogans, dismissing the British
Foreign Office - which he says that otherwise he admires and should be given
more money for entertainment - as having sold out to the Arabs from the
start, and accusing George Brown of becoming an 'Arabist' after helping to
push through UN Resolution 242 on the Middle East.
As even Weidenfeld admits, it was that Resolution which led to subsequent
dialogue. A little more humility towards the Arabs and occasional criticism
of Israeli intransigence might be in order.
These matters are subjective, but some readers might find errors in taste.
For example, the wife of an English MP whom Weidenfeld hoped to marry, but
who went off with somebody else, is described simply as 'an anglicized
blonde of Austrian-Jewish origin'. Readers might not take kindly either to
sentences like 'Shimi Lovat was known as the handsomest man in Britain'.
They might have some sympathy with Evelyn Waugh, who thought that Weidenfeld
and his set were pretentious and pushy.
There are also some errors of fact. The aspiring French diplomat and future
foreign minister who gave Weidenfeld helpful advice in Vienna was Jean
Sauvagnargues, not a 'Monsieur Savarnargue' as Weidenfeld calls him. The
name of the German central bank before the war was the Reichsbank, not the
Reichbank. The first name of Chancellor Brandt was Willy, not Willi.
Those may seem quibbles, though one would have thought that a seasoned
publisher would have had someone check the proofs. They are as nothing
compared to the story of Hugh Dalton and the economics writer, Nicholas
Davenport. 'Had Dalton been made chancellor of the exchequer, as he nearly
was,' Weidenfeld claims, 'Nicholas might well have become governor of the
Bank of England.' That seems unlikely, especially when one remembers that
Dalton actually was chancellor of the exchequer from 1945-1947, the very
years in question.
