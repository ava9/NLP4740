Israel and the PLO have overcome deep suspicions to forge the Cairo accords
on security. The signing in Cairo on Wednesday night broke months of
deadlock over implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank area of Jericho.
Employing painstaking compromise, complicated formulae and postponement of
some sensitive issues, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres,
Israeli foreign minister, reached a deal which will inject momentum into the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The Cairo accords pave the way for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to meet Mr
Arafat within four weeks to sign a comprehensive protocol leading to the
delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho. Completion of Israeli
military redeployment will not be possible by the April 13 deadline.
To reach agreement on security issues, Mr Arafat had to give up demands for
absolute PLO control over borders and roads, viewed as important symbols of
sovereignty for a Palestinian state. Israel had to concede the Palestinian
need for dignity without jeopardising security requirements.
Israel keeps exclusive control over external security. The most important
issues resolved under the accords are arrangements for the Gaza-Egypt and
Jericho-Jordan border crossing; security details for the Jewish settlements
in Gaza and for roads linking the settlements with Israel, and broad outline
of the size and composition of the Jericho area.
The most important details of a final protocol yet to be agreed are
relations between the two economies; the operational limits of a Palestinian
police force and transfer of administrative power from Israeli to
Palestinian hands. All these issues must be finalised before Mr Rabin and Mr
Arafat can sign the comprehensive protocol.
Separate agreements on the modalities of holding Palestinian elections and
redeployment of Israeli troops in the rest of the West Bank will be
negotiated in Washington. The Cairo accords cleared away the most difficult
issues of a protocol on Palestinian self-rule:
Border arrangements: Israel retains responsibility for external security. It
will rely heavily on modern surveillance devices rather than physical
searches. Each border crossing will have one terminal with two wings, the
Palestinian one to serve Palestinians and visitors to Gaza-Jericho, with a
Palestinian flag and Palestinian policemen at its entrance. The Israeli wing
will serve Israelis and foreigners. The Palestinians and the Israelis will
have a closed area for searching luggage;
Inspection: The Israelis may open luggage in the presence of the owner and a
Palestinian policeman. Persons entering the Palestinian wing will pass
through a magnetic gate in the presence of an Israeli and Palestinian
policeman. A Palestinian may be physically searched by a Palestinian
policeman in the presence of an Israeli policeman.
Israel will check the identity documents of all Palestinians crossing the
Palestinian wing but will do so 'in an invisible manner' for Gaza-Jericho
residents. In the event of suspicion, both sides may question a Palestinian.
A Palestinian may be apprehended crossing through the terminal by either
side, but must be dealt with by a Palestinian policeman. Both sides have the
right to veto entry to any person not a Gaza-Jericho resident; Israel will
control security in the Palestinian-controlled areas between the Gaza-Egypt
and Jericho-Jordan border posts, in close co-ordination with a Palestinian
deputy. Palestinian policemen present will be armed with handguns;
The area of Jericho: Israel and the PLO have initialled a mapped area of
Jericho of 55.5 sq kms but left the final decision to Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat
when they meet to sign the protocol.
Israel guarantees safe passage to Palestinians to three areas outside the
Jericho area: the religious site of Nebbi Moussa, the pilgrimage site of
al-Maghtas, and the northern shores of the Dead Sea, where Palestinians will
be allowed to set up private projects and joint tourism ventures.
Palestinians will have sole control over roads in the Jericho area, with
joint patrols, under Palestinian authority, on the main roads used by
Palestinians and Israelis.
Gaza security: Israel retains absolute authority over the Gush Katif and
Erez settlement areas and Israeli military installation along the Egyptian
border. In a second zone Israel will control security, in co-operation with
Palestinians in security matters, including joint patrols. Israel retains
absolute control over security for three roads linking the settlements with
Israel.
