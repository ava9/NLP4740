  [Text] Cairo, April 29 (AFP)--Israeli and PLO negotiators 
have reached agreement in principle on the release of all 
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel who commit themselves to 
renouncing violence, a senior PLO official disclosed Thursday. 
  The two sides agreed that in addition to 5,000 Palestinians 
whose release had already been approved, all remaining prisoners 
would be eligible for a pardon if they pledged "in writing" to 
abandon violence and to adhere to the policies of the PLO, Nabil 
Sha'th said. 
  The offer would apply to all Palestinian prisoners 
regardless 
of their political affiliation, according to Sha'th, who is the 
Palestine Liberation Organization's chief negotiator in talks 
here with Israel. 
  The negotiations are aimed at implementing limited 
Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank 
town of Jericho in accordance with a Declaration of Principles 
signed by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September. 
  After months of difficult and delicate talks, PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are to 
sign an accord here on May 4 to launch Palestinian autonomy, 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak announced Thursday. 
  Sha'th said Israeli-PLO contacts would continue after next 
Wednesday's signing ceremony to determine a timetable for the 
prisoner releases. He said Palestinians in the autonomous areas 
would be issued a passport by Palestinian authorities that would 
be valid for three years and would entitle them to travel to any 
country accepting the document. 
  On the question of jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho, which 
had plagued the Cairo talks earlier this month, Sha'th reported 
that the two sides had agreed that Palestinian officials would 
exert authority "in all domains, with the exception of Israeli 
citizens, Jewish settlements and external security." 
  He said the principal outstanding issue was the scope of the 
security zones to be established around the settlements on the 
Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want to reduce the dimensions of 
the zones to a minimum, according to Sha'th, who added that 
their proposed boundaries were detailed in maps appended to an 
agreement here on February 9. The maps have not been made 
public. Other sources close to the talks said the PLO and 
Israel still had to agree on the size of the autonomous Jericho 
area and the presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby 
Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan. 
  In Paris Thursday Israeli and Palestinian officials also 
reached an accord on future economic relations between Israel 
and the autonomous areas. In a statement released after five 
months of arduous talks, the Israeli delegation said "all the 
obstacles have been overcome and differences settled." "The 
heads of the delegations think it is possible to reach a general 
accord on Friday which will form the basis of economic relations 
between Israeli and Palestinian authorities," the statement 
said. Details of a final economic agreement were to be worked 
on overnight ahead of a 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) signing ceremony 
Friday at the French foreign ministry. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0759 on 29 April in a 
Cairo-datelined item by Marius Schattner adds the following: 
"The two remaining points to be sorted out by Rabin and 'Arafat 
would be the size of the autonomous Jericho area and the 
presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby Bridge between 
the West Bank and Jordan, sources close to the talks said. But 
chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Thursday the principal 
outstanding issue was the dimension of the security zones to be 
established around Jewish settlements on the Gaza Strip."]
