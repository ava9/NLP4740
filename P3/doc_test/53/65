<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Chief of Security and </F>
Police Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our Forces Will Enter Gaza and 
Jericho Not Later Than 20 May"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Palestinian chief of 
security and police has confirmed that the Palestinian police 
forces will enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho by 20 May at the 
latest. He said that the entry will be completed within two 
weeks after the signing of the final agreement on the 
implementation of autonomy. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Major General Mudar 
Yusuf (Abu-Yusuf) revealed that the forces will be transported 
to al-'Arish airport in Sinai by military transport planes. 
  He denied recent rumors that Israel will hand over to the 
PLO 
five important police posts in the occupied Gaza Strip next 
Tuesday. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "These reports are unfounded." He 
added that in the first stage, the Palestinian police will enter 
Gaza and Jericho at the same time but the main effort will be 
concentrated on Gaza, which is densely populated, to provide 
security and stability there. He stressed that preparations 
have been made in all areas where Palestinian police and 
security forces are present and that they are awaiting orders to 
move. 
  Abu-Yusuf said that, in the first phase, some 6,000 
policemen 
will arrive in Gaza-Jericho, 4,500 of them going to Gaza and 
1,500 going to Jericho, and these forces will enter as units in 
their present formations. Some of these formations may later be 
changed depending on circumstances on the ground and need. He 
added that the PLO recently received special military uniforms 
for the Palestinian police from Norway, and the first 
consignment of U.S. aid, consisting of police vehicles, has 
already arrived. 
  In reply to a question about the structure of the police 
forces and whether they mainly consist of Fatah elements, Maj. 
Gen. Yusuf emphasized that the forces which will be responsible 
for security and stability in the Gaza Strip and Jericho "are 
not factional forces. They are national forces belonging to all 
the Palestinian people." He confirmed that "the Palestine 
Liberation Army [PLA], which includes elements from all the 
factions as well as elements not affiliated with any factions, 
has now become a security and police force." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf revealed that "a large number [of people] 
from the factions opposed to the Oslo agreement have sent us 
applications to join these forces." He added that in the coming 
phase, the Palestinian police forces will not operate on a 
factional basis but on the basis of the Palestinian authority 
which will consist of various sectors of the Palestinian people 
regardless of their political affiliations. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf ruled out the possibility of any major 
problems when the Palestinian police forces arrive. He also 
ruled out the possibility of friction between them and Hamas 
"because the brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stated their 
opposition to Palestinian infighting, and we will make every 
effort to promote understanding and agreement with them." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf urged all sectors and factions of the 
Palestinian people "to extend a helping hand to the Palestinian 
police and security forces for the sake of building our future 
authority, easing our people's suffering, and providing security 
and stability for them." 
  On the spread of arms possession in the city of Gaza and 
whether that will be a security problem for the Palestinian 
police forces, he said: "Arms do not scare us."
