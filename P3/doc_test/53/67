  [Excerpts] Political sources in Jerusalem have revealed 
that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will begin withdrawing from 
the Gaza Strip in the second half of April even if by then there 
is no signed agreement with the Palestinians, provided that 
there is momentum of progress in the negotiations. Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said yesterday that Israel is considering 
the option of starting the transfer of self-authority powers 
over to the Palestinians in Gaza even before ending the 
negotiations and signing the agreement. 
  Senior political sources have recently hinted that this 
option is being seriously considered particularly in view of the 
unrest in the territories expected to take place in the coming 
days of "twilight" when Israel will still be in charge of the 
territories while the locals expect to assume self-government 
authorities. 
  It is obvious that the move will not be made on 13 April, 
which marks Memorial Day for the IDF fallen. The last week of 
April is currently being mentioned. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian policemen will enter Gaza as soon as the middle 
of next week, in coordination with the IDF forces there. This 
is one of the issues Israeli and PLO representatives agreed on 
in Cairo. Initially, the delegations convened to discuss 
security arrangements in Hebron in view of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre, but the killing of the six senior PLO 
members in Gaza made it necessary to discuss a change in 
security concepts in the Gaza Strip as well. 
  For that reason, Major General Yom-Tov Sami', former 
commander of the IDF in the Gaza Strip, arrived in Cairo 
yesterday. He was party to the decision to formulate new joint 
working procedures in the strip. It has been decided that the 
PLO delegation will arrive in Gaza next week for a first-hand 
examination of the deployment of the forces. Obviously, the 
Palestinian police will be subject to IDF instructions. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is worth mentioning that the members of the delegation 
for 
the discussion on the Gaza and Jericho agreement have arrived in 
Cairo. This team does not include the delegates who discuss 
economic issues.
