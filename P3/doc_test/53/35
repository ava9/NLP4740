  [Text] Cairo, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The last round of the 
PLO-Israeli peace talks resumed here today to put the finishing 
touches on the general agreement of the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule deal. 
  The Palestinian side is presided by Major General 
'Abd-al-Razek al-Yehya, for the chief PLO negotiator Nabil 
Shaath is in Tunisia now, and the Israeli side is headed by 
Major General Ammon Shahak, the Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Khaled al-Qudra, a member of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation, said in a press release that the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides are about to finish the phraseology of the general 
agreement. 
  Some sources close to the talks said that the viewpoints of 
the two sides were brought closer and that agreement on the 
standing disputable issues are expected to be phrased out in 
paragraphs of the general agreement during this round. 
  As for the entry of the Palestinian police force into the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israelis consider accessing of 25 
elements of the Palestinian police vanguards on the day of 
initialling the agreement. A week later 1,000 to 1,500 
Palestinian policemen will be permitted entry. 
  The Palestinian side deems as necessary the deployment of 
all 
the Palestinian police force, not only 25 of them, during the 
first week after signing the agreement following the withdrawal 
of the Israeli Army, slated for the second day after initialling 
the agreement. 
  The sources said that 'Arafat and Rabin are due to discuss 
during their imminent meeting, slated for Tuesday [3 May] 
evening, two issues: the size of Jericho area and the 
Palestinian police presence at border crossings. 
  This round of talks is scheduled to last for three days and 
end on Tuesday evening, the night before signing the final 
agreement on Wednesday. 
  President Husni Mubarak of Egypt, the Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and the Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres held a conference 
on April 28 to probe ways of removing the standing obstacles 
before initialling the final PLO-Israeli agreement on 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho deal. 
  President Mubarak said after the conference that the 
Palestinian and the Israeli sides agreed on holding a meeting 
between the Palestinian President 'Arafat and the Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin on May 3 and signing the final agreement the 
following day.
