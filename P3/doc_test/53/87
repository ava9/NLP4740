  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The agreement signed by the 
PLO and Israel here today on implementing Palestinian self-rule 
includes a general accord and four annexes. 
  The annexes are on security, economy, legal jurisdiction and 
transfer of civil power. The annex on economy, that is part of 
the self-rule agreement, was already signed by the PLO and 
Israel at the end of last month in Paris, where negotiations 
thereon were held. 
  The main points of the agreement including the 
following: 

  -  Israel and the PLO, the representative of the 
Palestinian people, reaffirm their determination to live in 
peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity and security while 
recognizing their mutual legitimate and political rights. 
  -  The 
two sides reaffirm their desire to achieve a just, lasting and 
comprehensive peace settlement through the agreed political 
process and reaffirm their adherence to the mutual 
recognition. 
  -  The two sides reaffirm their understanding that the 
interim self government arrangements in the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area are an integral part of the whole peace process and 
that the negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and 
338. 
  -  Israel shall implement an accelerated and scheduled 
withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip and 
from the Jericho area beginning immediately with signing of this 
agreement and to be completed within three weeks from this 
date. 
  -  Israel will be responsible for external security and for 
internal security in areas of Jewish settlements. 
  -  The 
Palestinian authority shall establish a strong police force in 
order to guarantee public order and internal security for the 
Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. 
  -  Israel and the Palestinian 
authority shall seek to foster mutual understanding and 
tolerance and abstain from incitement, including hostile 
propaganda against each other. 
  -  Both sides shall take all 
measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crimes 
and hostilities directed against each other. 
  -  The parties agree 
to a temporary international or foreign presence in the 
territory, including international observers and instructors. 
  -  If 
the Palestinian authority is unable to prevent attacks against 
Israeli settlements or Israelis so that their security is 
threatened, Israel may take all measures necessary to respond to 
such events including the introduction of additional military 
forces.
