FT  29 APR 92 / Appointments: Opportunity of 'secondary space'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the Chicago-based architects which also sustains
a significant interior design business, has hired Sara Galbraith as its new
head of interior design in London.
Galbraith, an American who studied architecture at Berkeley, has spent the
past seven years in London with Pfister Chadwick. Charles Pfister, whose
design business was merged with an English firm on his death a few years
ago, had once been a partner at SOM, so Galbraith - who had earlier worked
for another ex-SOM partner - says the style at her new firm is familiar.
Being a trained architect, which many of her predecessors in design at SOM
were not, is a decided advantage, she claims. 'You have to know how
buildings work - interior design is not just about picking fabrics and
colours.'
She says London offers marvellous opportunities at the moment, partly
because of the upgrading of 'secondary space', in other words refurbishing
existing offices vacated for the plethora of recently completed buildings.
'Interior design has remained an important part of our business despite the
collapse of the property market,' adds SOM director Robert Turner. One of
SOM's main claims to fame in London is as architects of Canary Wharf; the
company says its involvement is 'now virtually complete', leaving it 'not
overly exposed' to Olympia &amp; York and its current troubles.
Galbraith's biggest current project is fitting out the new premises for the
merged Manufacturers Hanover/Chemical Bank in Canary Wharf.
At Pfister Chadwick she had been working for Arthur Andersen which moves
into the building in Kingsway being vacated by Chemical.
