  [Text] Kyrgyz agriculture is in need of urgent assistance, 
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov told parliament on 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  To quote Dzhumagulov, the government has drafted proposals 
for reducing agricultural enterprises' profit tax from 35% to 
15%. It is also planning to purchase agricultural produce at 
market prices. 
  It will also establish a monopoly on the production and sale 
of alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and bread, all of which will 
require changes in the current legislation. 
  Dzhumagulov also noted that in order to increase the budget, 
the ministries and departments' personnel would be reduced by 
20%. This will save the state 190 Mn soms (1 som equals 160 
rubles).
