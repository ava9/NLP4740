BERLIN] BERLIN] ITS CULTURE, ITS TIMES by Michael Farr Kyle Cathie Pounds
18.99, 216 pages
REVOLUTION could never grip Berlin, Lenin predicted, because Germans would
only storm a railway station after first queueing for platform tickets.
Nevertheless, as this engaging book shows, Berlin has had one of the most
tumultuous lives of any European city in modern times. Today, it remains a
barometer for European politics and culture.
Unlike Rome or London, it was a never a natural capital. A medieval city
fought over by robber barons from the Brandenburg marshes, it was thought a
provincial upstart by lovers of Munich, Dresden and Frankfurt even in the
19th century. Michael Farr's achievement here is to explore how its
civilising went hand in hand with the military growth which proved its
downfall. So the work of the great architects Knobelsdorff and Schinkel, who
determined the tone of the city from the 18th century with buildings like
the opera house on Unter den Linden, the Altes museum and Potsdam's Sans
Souci Palace, is seen against the backcloth of the warlike escapades of the
Hohenzollern emperors.
Farr is inspired on the contradictory character of this clan and its city.
In the 17th century, every fifth inhabitant was a soldier, yet Berlin's
tradition as most tolerant and cosmopolitan of German cities was already
established, and in 1700, after an influx of Protestant refugees, one fifth
of the people were French. Tiny, fat Elector Frederick William was a liberal
but a bully who kicked women in the street and chased men with a cane. He
collected giant soldiers for whom he swapped the city's artistic treasures
with other monarchs. His favourites were a 7ft Irishman and a Norwegian
smith; all were too precious to risk in war.
His son, Frederick the Great, used his soldiers but always took a flute on
his campaigns and composed sonatas between battles. For all his Prussian
nationalism, he spoke only French and under him Berlin acquired the elegance
which Frederick envied in Versailles. The love affair with France continued;
during the Franco-Prussian war William I suspended his French chef, but
reinstated him after sampling the menus of his German successor.
The war ended in 1871 with Berlin capital of a united Germany. By 1900 it
had become a mecca for artists and intellectuals as never before. Farr is a
gifted raconteur but not a cultural commentator, and his anecdotal style
fails here. But the hey-day of German expressionism and of the 1920s
explosion of cabaret and naughtiness - Berlin had in perverted sex what
Paris had in straight sex, according to one high liver - makes a naturally
compelling story.
There is the same imbalance between the sharp historical analysis of the
Nazi and post-war years, and the sketchy cultural criticism. Redeemed
however by delightful period photographs, cartoons and engravings, no Berlin
lover would want to miss this book.
