  [Text] On Saturday [25 June], Uzbekistan's President Islam 
Karimov told his ministers and government executives that the 
Republic would work for the convertibility of its new currency 
unit -- som, respect for it at the international marketplace and 
its high buying potential. The som is to replace the som-coupon 
on the domestic market on 1 July. The som-coupon was introduced 
in November 1993. 
  Karimov called for the priority of exports and increased 
production of competitive goods. 
  He was worried about the growth of prices for many items on 
the domestic market and demanded tighter control of commercial 
stores which, he said, bought production of state-managed 
facilities to sell it at inadequate prices to the population. 
That, in Karimov's view, could lead to the devaluation of the 
new currency unit.
