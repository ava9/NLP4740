CITY BEGINS CRACKDOWN ON HOLIDAY TRAFFIC JAMS

In an effort to ease traffic congestion caused by holiday shoppers, the city of 
Los Angeles on Friday deployed a helicopter, 18 tow trucks and dozens of police 
and traffic control officers to begin a crackdown on errant drivers and 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and the city's Department of Transportation targeted 47 
downtown intersections and nearly two dozen trouble spots in the San Fernando 
Valley, West Los Angeles and Hollywood. It is the second straight year the city 
has used the special traffic control plan to try to ease the holiday crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, police are expected to issue hundreds of tickets to 
jaywalkers and to drivers who violate the city's "anti-gridlock" ordinance, 
which makes it illegal to be caught in an intersection when the traffic signal 
turns red. And they got started on Friday with what officials said was a higher 
than normal number of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Police said jaywalking tickets sometimes end with a warning, rather than a 
fine. The fines for "gridlock" violations begin at $50. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation stationed 75 traffic control officers at key 
intersections during rush hour to keep traffic flowing. Officials said they 
will "vigorously enforce" peak hour no-stopping restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The special enforcement officers have been deployed from elsewhere in the 
police and transportation departments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the enforcement measures, traffic was moving very slowly in some parts 
of the city Friday afternoon and some downtown areas were "totally gridlocked," 
said Sgt. Jack Sommers of the Central Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicated that a higher-than-usual number of citations had 
been issued to drivers who violated the anti-gridlock ordinance and pedestrians 
who crossed streets in the middle of the block, Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday traffic plan, in its second year, will remain in effect through 
late Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we saw that by targeting some of the most heavily used intersections 
in the city, we can greatly reduce traffic tie-ups throughout the city," Mayor 
Tom Bradley said. "I urge all drivers to closely follow posted parking 
restrictions and speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
"For a shopper who is trying to rush home from work to a store, or for those 
trying to get home after a long day of holiday planning, our traffic-reduction 
actions are the best gift in town," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic control officers have been directed to pay special attention to 
potential traffic problems on streets and access routes surrounding major 
shopping malls, Bradley said. In addition to using a helicopter to spot 
congestion, the Department of Transportation will use its automated 
surveillance control system to monitor traffic conditions. The system uses 
electronic sensors in the Central Business District to relay information about 
traffic volume to a central office, where operators can adjust traffic signals 
to ease flow. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be lots of people towed and lots of people ticketed if they don't 
pay attention to the signs," said Bill Bicker, Bradley's transportation 
coordinator.
