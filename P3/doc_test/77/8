Businessman Steve Sommer didn't like feeling guilty about possible damage to 
the environment, so he started substituting popcorn for plastic foam packing in 
the boxes he uses to ship foods. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of company from other entrepreneurs in his area. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn, said Sommer -- the same food people munch in the movies -- "is 
naturally biodegradable, so you may feed it to the birds or use it as mulch in 
your garden," adding that it is probably too stale for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Sommer figures also on a tidy fallout for his Alexander Fruit &amp; Trading Co. 
He thinks that packaging-popcorn sales might rival his existing $500,000-a-year 
gourmet wine and food company. Prospective customers are excited by the idea, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are important questions about the unique use for the exploded 
kernels of hard corn. It has to possess all the right cushioning properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just started using it and we haven't had any complaints from customers 
yet," said Janet Churchill, packaging boss for Montessori Services in Santa 
Rosa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The welcome mat for popcorn-for-plastic also was offered by Joan Graham, 
co-owner of a Sonoma crafts gallery, Good Day Sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
She said she started looking for a substitute for plastic packing when some 
customers mentioned that plastic is ecologically unsound and reflected badly on 
her business. 
</P>
<P>
Buyer John Clark, whose company distributes plastic foam packing, said his 
company, Santa Rosa Paper, is interested in popcorn but is awaiting a general 
ruling from United Parcel Service on whether it can be used in any shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the butter-flavored, $2.50-a-pint stuff served in movie houses, Sommer 
charges about $15 for a 14-cubic-foot bag of oil-free popped corn. That's $4 
less than the cost of the same volume of plastic foam kernels. Sommer estimated 
a 30% profit. 
</P>
<P>
Sommer said he is working with a chemist to discover a way to hold popcorn 
together in large shapes such as those used to pack stereo components and other 
fragile devices.
