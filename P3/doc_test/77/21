The Padres completed their coaching staff Friday by hiring Bruce Kimm, formerly 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, as their third-base coach. He replaces fired bullpen 
coach Denny Sommers. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers has received an offer to remain in the organization as an advance 
scout, but he has not made a decision. Sommers is the 30th front-office 
employee or coach who has been fired since Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Kimm, 39, a former major league catcher, was an extra coach on Jim Leyland's 
staff the past two seasons. He kept scouting charts during the games while 
sitting in the stands as the Pirates' major league coordinator of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch met Kimm when he was in the Cincinnati Red 
organization as a minor league manager and major league coach. Riddoch 
interviewed Kimm Thursday in Denver and offered him the job Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just ecstatic about the staff we've put together," Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre coaching staff for the 1991 season consists of Mike Roarke, pitching 
coach; Merv Rettenmund, hitting coach; Jim Snyder, bench coach; Rob Picciolo, 
first base coach, and Kimm. BOB NIGHTENGALE
