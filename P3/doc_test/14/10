NASA officials announced Tuesday that they will attempt to launch the space 
shuttle Discovery, carrying a sun-probing satellite, on Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 4:35 a.m. PDT with five astronauts who 
will send the European satellite on a five-year journey to study the sun's 
polar regions. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first spacecraft to orbit the solar poles. 
</P>
<P>
"This date is a little success-oriented and is dependent on not encountering 
any unusual problems," shuttle director Robert Crippen said. "But I think the 
shuttle team has a good chance of making the 6th." 
</P>
<P>
NASA's last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery carried the flawed 
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Soon afterward, the rest of the fleet, 
Columbia and Atlantis, were crippled by hydrogen leaks. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials repeatedly have said 
they are confident that Discovery's fuel lines are leak-free because of the 
shuttle's flight performance in April and the minimal amount of work performed 
in its engine compartment since then. 
</P>
<P>
NASA faces an Oct. 23 launch deadline for Discovery and the plutonium-powered 
sun probe, named for the legendary Greek adventurer Ulysses. If Discovery does 
not lift off by then, the mission will have to wait until the planets are 
properly aligned again in late 1991.
