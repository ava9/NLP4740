FT  11 DEC 93 / Travel: Golfers with the urge to drive by night

We were on the lam in south-west Ireland and we were loving every minute of
it. Me and my friend Jock knew we would be caught by fading daylight
eventually. The question was whether we could delay the moment long enough
to eke out a few more holes of golf.
Our intention was to play as many as we could before dinner. It had been a
sudden idea, as the best ones often are, cooked up in a moment in late
afternoon. No sooner had we thought of it than we had jumped into my car and
set off, wheels spinning, for Tralee golf club 30 miles away. There were few
barriers to our sudden serendipitous idea. At that time of night, there were
would not be many others around to hold us up.
I knew Tralee, the first course designed in Europe by Arnold Palmer, from
several earlier visits. Jock, on the other hand, had never been there. He
was anxious to see as many of its outstanding holes as he could: the long
2nd, the demanding 3rd, the glorious 8th which lies so well along the sweep
of the bay, the short 13th across the pit, the devilish 15th.
Perhaps the 16th - which, from the back tees, I believe to be one of the
most difficult and heroic short holes in the world - might be too far; but
we would move as quickly as we could and hope to get them all in.
We began at a gallop and, after taking a deep breath, walked all the way to
the back tee of the 3rd, high above the sea. To James Joyce writing in
Ulysses, it had been 'the snotgreen sea, the scrotum-tightening sea.' Now,
however, it snoozed softly below us, benign and silvery. The green, built on
rocks, jutted out in the distance. Beneath it was the cave used in Ryan's
Daughter. Behind us, deserted and inviting, was the wide, long beach used in
the same film.
My first ball pinged off the rocks; another soared away to the left. It was
220 yards just to reach the green from this tee. What on earth made me think
I could hit the ball that far with an iron, even on a still night such as
this?
As the daylight began to fade I caught a glimpse of Jock. His face,
burnished by the wind and sun, had a look of sublime contentment. We were at
one with our surroundings and, just as important, with our own golf.
The setting sun spurred us to play still faster. The ebbing tide moved
slowly down the estuary leaving thickening fingers of mud behind. It looked
tired. We certainly were. It had, after all, been a long day, one that had
begun 14 hours earlier. We had not eaten since lunch and had hardly eaten
then. I had forgotten how hungry I was until we dashed from the 8th green to
the 9th tee to play our last hole.
In the gathering gloom, we each whacked a drive towards the beckoning light
of the clubhouse. Then we half-walked, half-ran until we found the balls. We
whacked them again and again. By now, it was so dark we could not make out
the flag on the green. Somehow we halved the hole, five whacks and several
putts each.
In the clubhouse, the hands of the clock stood at 9.55. The only place still
serving dinner was the Oyster Bar in Spa, six miles towards Tralee. The
barman telephoned for us. 'They will hold a table for you but you must get
there by 10.30,' he said.
Dinner was as much a surprise as anything that had happened to us all
evening: delicious soda bread and fresh salmon, perhaps caught a mile or so
from where we were sitting.
Afterwards, there was a tap on my right elbow. I looked up to see a stout
lady with a friendly face. Soon, we were deep in conversation. She sat at a
long table with what looked to be six or seven relatives. At the head was a
small boy in a blazer, no more than 12. 'My father died a year ago today,'
explained the lady. 'We had a mass this afternoon and now we're celebrating.
He had a good life. He was 90 when he died. In his later years, he often
said to me: 'If you look after me well when I am still alive, then you can
dance on my grave when I'm gone'.'
At midnight, the singing ended and the restaurant emptied quickly. We drove
home slowly in the velvet-soft darkness.
Jock looked out of the window. I concentrated on driving. My feet had
stopped aching and I felt the intense pleasure of a man who had exercised
well. It had been a rare old day, one that lingers in the mind for years.
