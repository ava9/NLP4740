A major solar flare on the sun Thursday hurled a surge of radiation toward the 
Earth that may disrupt communications and electrical power transmission over 
the next two days, government scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Cohen, a geophysical forecaster at the Space Environment Services Center 
run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., 
said he was sending alerts to electrical utilities in Canada and in the 
northern United States to expect possible power surges.

Powerful solar flares can also affect satellites and spacecraft, but officials 
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said they have evaluated 
the burst of energy and determined that astronauts on board the orbiting space 
shuttle Atlantis are not in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
"In the orbit we're in, at 160 mile altitude, it is no threat at all," said 
Ronald D. Dittemore, a flight director at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
A NASA spokesman said engineers were checking for any effect on Galileo, the 
probe released from Atlantis six hours after the space shuttle was launched 
Wednesday. Galileo on Thursday afternoon was more than 200,000 miles from Earth 
on its six-year journey to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the GOES satellite first detected the solar flare at 5:30 a.m. PDT 
and that the X-rays from the flare surged higher than instruments on the 
satellite could measure. The flare was estimated at an X-13, a unit that 
measures X-ray flux. The GOES measures only up to X-12.
