THE PAST has always come to us neatly packaged. Give history enough time and
it will reduce itself, as all schoolboys know, to a grab-bag of dates,
political milestones and rhyming mnemonics ('Willy, Willy, Harry, Steve').
The remarkable thing about cinema history is that, unlike real history, it
has been neat and simple: at least until now. 99 out of 100 films were made
to a certain length and shown at that length. They had no life beyond the
cinema, so there was no call for longer TV/video versions aimed at the
mini-series market or shorter TV/video versions aimed at turning epics into
teledramas.
In addition, the studio era kept the director's ego on a leash, deterring
him from crying 'Foul' if his film left the cutting-room minus his favourite
scenes.
Today all is different. Multiplying delivery systems and declarations of war
by hard-done directors make the modern feature film the world's most
frighteningly elastic work of art.
When a film is not actually born in two distinct versions - as recently in
Rivette's 4-hour La Belle Noiseuse twin-packed with a 2-hour 'Divertimento'
 -it can have a delayed rebirth as that increasingly voguish phenomenon, the
'director's version'. Witness A Star Is Born (Cukor), Lawrence Of Arabia
(Lean), Betty Blue (Beineix) and, soon to reach us, James Cameron's revised
Aliens and Ridley Scott's revised Blade Runner.
Scouring the cutting-room floor, auteurs collect the celluloid that they
once had to excise at a producer's whim and stick it back in. Sometimes too,
a director changes his own mind. Video allows him to push out a second
version of his film without blaming anyone else for the first. The world is
treated to, say, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind: The
Special Edition.
Meanwhile, there are movies or movie-sagas expanded for TV serialisation
(The Godfather), made-for-TV films that live a ghostly second life on the
large screen (Broadway Bound) and films that cannot make up their minds at
all whether they are features or teledramas or mini-series (Altman's Vincent
And Theo). Even that notable modern mould-breaker Twin Peaks began life as a
TV series pilot cum mini-feature cum video.
No one has worked out what all this portends culturally, least of all the
directors. German film-maker Wim Wenders denies that his 2 1/2 -hour sci-fi
fable Until The End Of The World is a contractually enforced compromise
version, but he admits to having a preferred five-hour version up his sleeve
for later release.
Further back in time, Michael Cimino's ill-fated Heaven's Gate fought for
survival in three different versions, ranging from the director's cherished
4 1/2 -hour cut to a 90-minute TV quickie called The Johnson County War.
Bygone film-makers such as DW Griffith, Abel Gance and Erich Von Stroheim
all faced the curse of the scissors from censors or studios. But they,
unlike their descendants, could seldom combat the finality of the release
version.
Today, TV and video allow a director a second or third bite at the cherry of
artistic perfection. Result: a world at once saner and madder. The awareness
of expanded options liberates the director. But it also allows him to
bewilder audiences by treating his film as an almost 'work in progress'.
This phrase has become a mantra of modern cinema. When two famous films were
submitted to the Cannes Film Festival in different years as
works-in-progress and won the Golden Palm - Apocalypse Now and The Mission -
festival-goers rightly protested that they were being treated as sneak
preview audiences. Either the film was ready to the director's satisfaction
or it was not. If not, it should wait for another festival.
But then the sneak preview itself has assumed a special role in the age of
the flexi-film. Is a movie ready when the director says so? Or when the
studio says so? Or when a guinea-pig audience says so after filling in its
preview cards and demanding that, say, Glenn Close be horribly slaughtered
in Fatal Attraction or that the ending of The Bonfire Of The Vanities be
radically re-cut (see Julie Salomon's enthralling production chronicle The
Devil's Candy)?
Films are flexible today because so many paymasters call so many different
tunes. Cinema has become the modern equivalent to oral storytelling. In the
old days, the diverse responses of Tom, Dickon or Harry influenced the
teller's tale so that it changed from one telling to the next. The
storyteller with a high opinion of his art might protest, but the fluid
nature of the audience patterned the fluidity of the work.
Some cinephiles today would claim that that fluidity has always existed in
film: that the finite nature even of past works of cinema is illusory.
Scholars and restorers such as Britain's Kevin Brownlow (Napoleon) and
America's Robert Harris (Lawrence Of Arabia) earn a living from regarding
old movies too as being in a state of perpetual evolution. But even these
men tend to have a guiding light to move towards: that inspirational concept
of 'the director's intention'.
We are fast entering an age, though, when this concept, too, is exposed as
unsound. It supposes not only that the director had an intention - debatable
in the hurly-burly of most film-making - but that the director is the
highest reference point and authority. Is he?
One could argue that the true author of a successful commercial film is the
studio that first packaged the ingredients, or the star who lovingly nursed
the project as his next career move, or the screenwriter who put pen to
paper, or even the novelist whose best-seller made the film a going concern
from the start.
Cinema gets us into these confusions because it is a corporate art like
cathedral-building, not a single-signature art like novel-writing or
composing. In many ways, the proliferating confusions of the flexi-film do
us a service by pointing out a truth long overdue: that, since movies emerge
from a turmoil of creative minds, it is fair to reflect that in a turmoil of
release versions and delivery systems.
Equally, if film-making is increasingly shaped by the imagined or
market-researched demands of the viewers who will pay for it, then new
viewing contexts are justified in making their own new demands. If the
screen's ravening appetite and ramifying digestive systems demand that a
successful movie doubles as a mini-series or a pop promo or a sitcom, who is
the director or anyone else to say nay?
In years to come the 'definitive' version of a film could become as elusive
or controversial as those rarer instances of protean identity in other arts:
from Verdi's Don Carlos to Joyce's Ulysses. But unlike them, in the
perversely polymorphous context of movie authorship, there is no
artist-as-God-the-father looking down and advising from the heavens.
A world where 'democratic' has become the most approved and talismanic word
in the language has got the democratic art it silently called for but is
struggling, not so silently, to understand it.
