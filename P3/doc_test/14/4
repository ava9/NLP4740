LEAKING FUEL AGAIN SCRUBS SHUTTLE COLUMBIA LAUNCH

For the fourth time in four attempts since May, NASA engineers Monday evening 
detected a leak of potentially explosive hydrogen while fueling a space 
shuttle, forcing them to scrub the launch of the shuttle Columbia with the 
Astro observatory for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time the mission has been aborted because of a hydrogen leak 
discovered only hours before the scheduled launch time. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference shortly after the scrubbed launch, space shuttle director 
Robert Crippen said: "The next vehicle up will be Ulysses" -- the shuttle 
Discovery carrying the Ulysses probe that will be sent into a polar orbit 
around the sun. It is now scheduled for an Oct. 5 launch. 
</P>
<P>
After the Columbia launch was scrubbed at 3:35 p.m. PDT, seven hours before the 
scheduled liftoff, NASA engineers continued loading hydrogen fuel aboard the 
shuttle in hopes that trouble-shooting might allow them to identify an obvious 
source of the leak. By late evening, however, it was clear that that prayer was 
not going to be answered, and Crippen decided to scrub the launch so that more 
extensive studies could be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen also said the agency was considering performing a fueling test on 
Discovery to ensure that it does not have a leak that would imperil the 
high-priority Ulysses mission. Discovery must be launched by Oct. 28 so that 
Ulysses can perform a slingshot maneuver around Jupiter to enter its polar 
orbit around the sun. If it is not launched by that date, NASA must wait 
another 13 months before the planets are once again in the proper alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Performing a tanking test would add at least five days to pre-launch 
preparations for Discovery even if no leak were found. That would eat into the 
agency's 18-day window for the launch. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said, however, that he believes the leak is unique to Columbia and that 
"there is no reason I know of to suspect a leak in Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there would be no danger in attempting to launch discovery 
without performing a fueling test first. "The only risk . . . is that it will 
be unsuccessful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has twice thought it had the hydrogen leak in Columbia corrected. After 
the first scrubbed launch in May, technicians found a large leak in a valve, 
called a 17-inch disconnect, that connects the external fuel tank to the 
shuttle orbiter. A similar leak was subsequently found on Atlantis, which was 
scheduled to carry a Department of Defense spy satellite into orbit in July. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the leak was traced to microscopic glass beads that contaminated 
the 17-inch valve, preventing gaskets from sealing properly. That valve did not 
leak Monday evening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After another launch attempt was scrubbed 1 1/2 weeks ago because of another 
hydrogen leak, engineers suspected a leak in a recirculating pump that forces 
liquid hydrogen through the three shuttle engines to cool them before launch. 
The recirculating pump was changed, but technicians could find no leak in it 
when it was tested. 
</P>
<P>
During the testing associated with the pump changeover, however, engineers 
found a crushed seal in a valve that normally permits hydrogen to enter engine 
No. 3. Earlier Monday, before the launch attempt, Crippen said that technicians 
had determined that the crushed seal could account for the volume of leakage 
that was observed last time. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were obviously distressed and just as obviously mystified when 
the leak reappeared Monday. In their attempt to isolate the leak, they were 
pumping liquid hydrogen through the engines and opening and closing various 
valves in order to narrow down the area that must be searched.
