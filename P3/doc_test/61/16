The Detroit Pistons head into Game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals 
against the Chicago Bulls today at the Palace of Auburn Hills with far more 
big-game experience. But the Bulls have Michael Jordan, which can neutralize a 
lot of factors. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, as Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said of the Bulls: "They're fairly playoff 
hardened. I don't know if we have an advantage on that point." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has been in similar circumstances two years in a row. Last season, the 
Pistons won in six games. This time, the Bulls can finish a comeback from an 
0-2 deficit with one more victory. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is lay our guts on the floor and see what happens," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Beating the Pistons in Chicago Friday proved the Bulls' fortitude, but Chicago 
hasn't won here all season -- a stretch of five games, three in the playoffs. 
Today, they may be without starting guard John Paxson, who took treatment but 
did not practice Saturday after re-injuring his right ankle in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Craig Hodges should be of some comfort to the Bulls. Hodges' 19 
points helped the Bull reserves outscore their Detroit counterparts for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
Only once in their 24-year history have the Bulls been this close to the title 
round. In 1975, they held a 3-2 advantage over the Golden State Warriors, only 
to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, more than one Bull was heard to say today will be for a 
franchise and a city, not just a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's going to be a lot of speeches made," Jordan said. "Certainly, 
as a leader I'll have to throw my two cents in to let them know that (in) the 
years I've been in Chicago, we've progressed each and every year. We've taken 
it a step further, and this is an opportunity to take it another step further. 
We may never get this opportunity again." 
</P>
<P>
And the Pistons will have history to contend with, too. Trying to join 
Minneapolis/Los Angeles and Boston as the only franchises to win back-to-back 
titles, Detroit is 0-3 in previous seventh games. The most recent attempt came 
against the Lakers for the 1988 championship. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, only four teams have come back from 2-0 down to win a seven-game series: 
Boston against the Lakers in 1969, the Lakers against San Francisco in 1969, 
Baltimore against New York in 1971 and Portland against Philadelphia in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
The championship round will open Tuesday night. If Detroit wins today, the 
Pistons will have home-court advantage. If the Bulls win, the series will begin 
at Portland and go to Chicago for Games 3, 4 and 5 in the 2-3-2 scheduling 
format. . . . After losing Friday night, the Pistons arrived at Midway Airport 
and were told that the nose of their private jet had been cracked when a fuel 
truck backed into it. . . . Michael Jordan has shot 48.7% and averaged 35 
points in the three games at Chicago Stadium while shooting 39.2% and averaging 
22.8 points at Auburn Hills. . . . The Bulls are shooting only 41.5%.
