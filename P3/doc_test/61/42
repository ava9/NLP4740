<P>
Charles Barkley is having the kind of season most valuable players have. 
</P>
<P>
The forward for the Philadelphia 76ers has been leading the NBA in scoring most 
of the season and has been near the top in shooting percentage and among the 
leaders in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
He has been instrumental in the 76ers getting off to a better start than they 
did last season. Although the Detroit Pistons double and triple-teamed him 
Saturday night at Philadelphia, Barkley scored 22 points and had 12 rebounds in 
a 106-99 victory that gave the 76ers an 18-8 record. Last season, they won only 
14 of their first 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
After losing seven of eight, the Pistons had won two in a row at home. But 
while they were ganging up on Barkley, they left guards Rickey Green and Hersey 
Hawkins alone. Green had a season-high 25 points, while Hawkins scored all of 
his 21 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took a 72-70 lead on a jumper by Mark Aguirre with almost 11 minutes 
remaining. But Hawkins converted consecutive three-point plays to give the 
76ers a lead they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half I was trying to make things happen," Hawkins said. "In the 
second half things came around for me and we took charge." 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas led the Pistons (16-10) with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been having our problems on the road," he said. "In the fourth quarter 
instead of stopping them we were sending them to the line." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 114, San Antonio 98 -- After losing Friday night at Dallas, the Bucks 
came out ready to play at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Spurs were a bit weary from an overtime battle against 
the Suns at Phoenix. They missed 12 of their first 14 shots and fell behind by 
14 points. 
</P>
<P>
The energy it took to pull even by halftime took its toll and the Spurs 
couldn't keep up in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sikma, who made six three-point baskets, led the Bucks with 29 points and 
played David Robinson nearly on even terms. Robinson had 25 points and eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Sikma's three-pointers came during a 16-7 run with which the Bucks 
opened the last quarter to clinch their 18th victory in 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 128, Indiana 118 -- Although the Bulls played a tough game Friday night 
against the Lakers, they came out strong at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
They scored 44 points in the first quarter and opened a 20-point lead. This 
allowed them to give Michael Jordan, who played 44 minutes in the victory over 
the Lakers, a good rest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they almost gave Jordan, who scored 29 points in 34 minutes, too much 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, paced by Chuck Person and Vern Fleming, came charging back in the 
second half. Three quick baskets to open the fourth quarter cut the lead to 
100-98. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan came back and teamed with John Paxson to give the Bulls a 
comfortable final margin. Paxson finished with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 109, Cleveland 89 -- Bernard King rarely has two poor games in a 
row. After scoring only 16 points and missing 15 of 23 shots Friday night, he 
figured to be effective at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He was. On 20 for 30 from the field and six for six from the free-throw line, 
the NBA scoring leader had 46 points to lead the Bullets to their third victory 
in a row and fourth in the last five. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are 2-9 since losing Mark Price, their point guard, with a 
season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
King had 28 points in the first half and the Bullets were able to keep the 
intensity going. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 122, Phoenix 102 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 24 points and 19 rebounds and 
Sleepy Floyd came off the bench to have a big night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, making 10 of 16 shots, had 24 points and nine assists and did a solid 
job defensing the Suns' playmaker, Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who appeared to be tired after playing 42 minutes Friday night, was 
two for 11 and had only four points. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 104, Orlando 96 -- Karl Malone had 15 of his 34 points in the last quarter 
at Orlando and keyed a late surge to beat the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic, which lost four road games recently after leading in the final 
minute, pulled even, 89-89, with four minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Malone put the Jazz in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
New York 106, New Jersey 93 -- Kiki Vandeweghe missed a driving layup at the 
buzzer Friday night to cost the Knicks a tie, but he made up for it in this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe scored six points in a 13-2 spurt midway through the fourth quarter 
that broke open a tight game. When Charles Oakley ended the rally with a 
three-point play, the Knicks led, 97-82, with 4:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 119, Denver 110 -- Already deprived of their leading scorer, Orlando 
Woolridge, for at least the next two months, the Nuggets were struck by injury 
again at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
They were leading, 89-78, at Denver, with 10 minutes left, but lost both Todd 
Lichti and Chris Jackson with ankle injuries. The Mavericks outscored the 
Nuggets, 41-21, the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 121, Sacramento 93 -- Eddie Johnson scored 25 points at Seattle and the 
SuperSonics routed the Kings for the second time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 115, Minnesota 102 -- The Warriors' Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway and 
Mitch Richmond had 36 of the Warriors' 38 points when they increased a 
three-point lead to 91-77 at Oakland. DAN HAFNER
