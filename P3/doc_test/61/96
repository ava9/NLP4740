MIKE PENNER: MITCHELL'S DEFENSE IN DEMAND

Matt Beeuwsaert is sweeping backboards in Australia. Tom Lewis is looking into 
Europe. Mike Fielder switched to football long ago. And Chris Jackson is 
probably tired of hearing his name on television while some guard from LSU 
keeps whipping no-look passes on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
The results are nearly in on The Greatest Prep Basketball Team in Orange County 
History and there is an upset in our midst. Today, the first Mater Dei dynasty 
stands to send its first graduate into the NBA -- and he didn't play one minute 
for Notre Dame or USC and he didn't set one scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever called Mike Mitchell prolific when he played at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
But today, someone will call him a Denver Nugget or a Portland Trailblazer or 
perhaps a Chicago Bull. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 54 collegians on the board for the 1990 NBA draft, Mitchell, a 
fifth-year senior from Colorado State, is projected to land in the middle of 
the pack, probably in the vicinity of the 30th pick. A little higher and he's 
the first Colorado State first-rounder. A little lower and he's still the 
inaugural NBA draftee of the Mater Dei monster that terrorized Southern Section 
opponents during the 1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Gary McKnight, the Mater Dei coach, would like to say he knew it all along. But 
he can't. 
</P>
<P>
"Beeuwsaert, obviously, was our best player," McKnight says. Obviously. 
Beeuwsaert was the big shooting guard who played the fundamentals as if John 
Wooden were a blood relative and perfected a bank shot that landed him a full 
scholarship with Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Lewis, the county's all-time leading scorer, whose string of 
50-point efforts took him all the way to USC's starting lineup as a freshman. 
And then there was Fielder, the muscular power forward, and Jackson, the steady 
point guard. Together, they were four good reasons why Mater Dei won its first 
Southern Section championship in 1983 and went 28-2 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the headlines and the screens and the picks, however, was Mitchell. He 
was the Monarchs' designated grunt, the guy assigned to taking a charge here, 
an elbow there and the opponent's top scorer out of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Some games, Mitchell wouldn't score a point. They were among his best. One of 
them helped earn Mitchell a scholarship to Fresno State, his first of two stops 
under Coach Boyd Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing in the Anaheim Convention Center," McKnight recalls, "and Boyd 
comes all the way down to scout him. Afterward, all I'm thinking about is, 'Oh 
great, Boyd's in the stands and he doesn't even score.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in a way, he had. Points don't impress Grant; if there's a way to win a 
basketball game, 1-0, Grant's working on it. Grant has a Marine's approach to 
basketball -- he's looking for a few good men who can run and cut off the 
baseline -- and he had just watched Mitchell hound his man for four relentless 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Grant thought Mitchell was the best player on the court. 
</P>
<P>
So once Mitchell completed his eligibility in 1985 -- he was a year younger 
than Beeuwsaert, Fielder and Jackson -- he followed Grant up the coast. That 
was one trademark of Mater Dei's 1983-84 starting lineup: All five received 
Division I basketball scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
One other similarity: All five transferred from the schools that originally 
signed them. 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert went from Notre Dame to Cal before hitching up with a pro league in 
Australia. Lewis went from USC to Pepperdine and now is weighing several offers 
from European teams. Fielder went from Marist College to the Saddleback College 
football program and Jackson played basketball at UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusionment was something each of them shared in college. Mitchell finally 
left Fresno State after his junior season -- two seasons after Grant's 
departure -- because he and new Coach Ron Adams demanded too much of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell wanted Adams to be Boyd Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Adams wanted Mitchell to be Magic Johnson, or at least the Big West equivalent, 
a do-everything big guard who could score enough points and win enough games to 
keep the heat of the Red Wave booster club away from Adams' neck. When Mitchell 
made the conference all-freshman team, expectations were raised. 
</P>
<P>
When Fresno finished 9-20 and 9-19 the next two seasons, Mitchell's 
relationship with Adams was finished as well. Again, Grant provided 
deliverance. Having just taken over the program at Colorado State, Grant 
offered Mitchell one final season together. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell accepted, redshirted in 1989 and returned the favor in 1990. He 
averaged 19.6 points a game, shot 56% from the field, led the Rams to a 21-9 
record and was named Western Athletic Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd have stayed at Fresno State, I'd have never been this close to the 
pros," Mitchell says, "because we weren't in a winning situation there. . . . 
At Fresno, pro ball was the furthest thing from my mind. There, I was just 
trying to get through the seasons." 
</P>
<P>
With Mitchell, defense is still the ticket. At the postseason all-star camps in 
Orlando, Fla., and Chicago, scouts watched Mitchell match up against the likes 
of UCLA's Trevor Wilson, Cal State Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos, Mississippi's 
Gerald Glass and Florida State's Irving Thomas. Mitchell's stock rose each time 
he shut one of them down. 
</P>
<P>
But NBA draftees also need to shoot the ball and Mitchell, once a 40% marksman 
at Mater Dei, proved he could handle that too. In his final game in Orlando, 
Mitchell scored 32 points against Thomas and Glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Orlando helped me considerably," Mitchell says. "I guess I didn't waste my 
time." 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, Mitchell has met with scouts from Denver, Portland, Chicago, 
Phoenix and Golden State. The interest hasn't ceased to amaze him. "The scouts 
say they see me as a (small) forward, maybe a No. 2 guard if I keep working on 
my outside shooting," Mitchell says. "But just to think that I might be one of 
the 54 players picked this year. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Who says it's not what you know but who you know? Mitchell knew Grant, but he 
also knew defense never goes out of style. Unlike some of his Mater Dei 
teammates, Mitchell had all the angles covered.
