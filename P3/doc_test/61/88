The Bulls, seeking to give disadvantaged kids an alternative to drugs and 
gangs, are donating $1 million to the Chicago Park District to renovate more 
than 100 aging basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
"We view this as an investment in the youth of the city of Chicago," team 
Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Monday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Park District officials said they know of no other professional sports team in 
the nation to sponsor such a program for a municipal agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the Chicago Bulls for doing something that is totally 
unprecedented," said William Bartholomay, the district's president. "This 
professional sports organization is putting something back into the system." 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for new surfaces, backstops, rims and nets, and to make 
other repairs at more than 100 courts -- about half of them outdoors -- over 
the next five years, said Jesse Madison, executive vice president of the Park 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago's inner-city youth deserve an alternative to drugs and gangs," 
Reinsdorf said. "It is our hope that this contribution will go a long way 
toward providing that alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Madison said that the district would have eventually done the repairs but that 
budget constraints would have delayed the work for at least 10 years. The 
donation from the NBA team will allow renovations to begin in April.
