Now that the Miami Heat is used to playing against stars, Kevin Edwards said 
it's easier to win against them. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat proved Edwards' point Saturday night at Miami with a landmark victory 
for the second-year franchise, 88-84 over the NBA champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of rookies last year and we were kind of star-struck by other 
teams," Edwards said. "This year they're just basketball players. You see a 
superstar just about every night, so you can't think about that while you're 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
Miami overcame an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter, and Edwards scored 
nine of the Heat's final 14 points, 
</P>
<P>
Edwards hit two free throws to give Miami an 86-84 lead with 40 seconds left. 
After Isiah Thomas missed two driving shots and James Edwards missed two free 
throws for Detroit, the Heat's Grant Long clinched the victory with two free 
throws with less than one second left. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons return home after a 2-3 road trip. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and Rony Seikaly scored 21 points each to lead the Heat, whose first 
home victory of the season came six weeks earlier than last season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led the Pistons with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 104, Boston 101 -- Mark Price returned from a sprained foot and 
scored 19 points, including three three-pointers, as the Cavaliers won their 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
Price was one of three starters missing from the Cavaliers' first four game. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ehlo also scored 19 points and had three three-pointers at Richfield, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Showing few ill effects from the sprained right foot, Price scored 10 
first-half points as Cleveland overcame an early 11-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Parish led the Celtics with 31 points.

<P>
Atlanta 148, Orlando 109 -- Moses Malone scored 28 points and led eight players 
in double figures as the Hawks won their first game of the season in 
record-setting fashion. Atlanta's 148 points were the most ever for the Hawks 
at The Omni in Atlanta. The team's overall scoring record is 155 points, 
against San Diego in 1970 and New York in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks got their first victory after three consecutive losses as Orlando 
made only three of its first 19 shots. Atlanta held a 42-18 lead at the end of 
the first quarter.

third quarter and finished with 11 rebounds, leading the Spurs at San Antonio.

After the Spurs led, 60-57, at the half, Robinson helped extend the margin to 
94-80 after three quarters. The center, in his first season after spending two 
years in the Navy, dazzled the crowd of 15,198 when he scored nine of the last 
10 points for the Spurs in the third quarter.

<P>
Terry Cummings added 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs. Lafayette Lever 
led the Nuggets with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Walter Davis scored 21 
points.

Houston 100, Utah 92 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 24 points, 21 rebounds and a 
career-high 12 blocked shots to lead the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Houston took its first lead since the second quarter when Olajuwon made two 
free throws with 4:01 left. A free throw by Karl Malone tied the score, 86-86, 
with 2:40 left before a basket by Buck Johnson and two free throws by Otis 
Thorpe gave Houston a 90-86 lead.

Philadelphia 104, Milwaukee 96 -- The 76ers, coming off a loss to the expansion
