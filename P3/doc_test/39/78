reconcile conflicting views of its history

August in Japan is the month for remembering. This morning, at 8.15 in the
Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, the nation's leaders will gather across
the river from the monument marking the spot where the A-bomb exploded, to
commemorate the precise moment 49 years ago when the 'black rain' fell.
There will be solemn speeches restating Japan's renunciation of war for
ever.
Nine days later, 500 miles away in central Tokyo, there will be a rather
different ceremony. At the Yasukuni shrine in the heart of the capital, on
the 49th anniversary of the Japanese surrender, another group of dignitaries
will pray before the Shinto deities of the nation's war dead.
But the devotees at Yasukuni will be stirring a political controversy. For
the shrine is not simply Japan's Cenotaph, or Arlington Cemetery. It is the
resting place of the souls of all those who died defending the mother
country - ordinary soldiers, but also kamikaze pilots, officers who oversaw
the construction of the Burma railroad, and Class A war criminals executed
by the Allies.
At first sight, the two ceremonies seem very different. Hiroshima is an
official event, supported by socialists, liberals, conservatives. They will
be attended by pipes of peace and the mood will be reflective. At Yasukuni,
rightwing politicians, including half the current cabinet, and war veterans
will be watched by shaven-headed youths in military regalia. Buses sporting
the Imperial Rising Sun flag will fill the air with noxious black smoke and
broadcast rightwing propaganda.
In fact, though, the two are related. Both represent the selectivity of
Japan's historical memory. Hiroshima presents Japan as the victim of the
'worst atrocity of the century', blotting out its causes; Yasukuni
commemorates the heroism of the men who died, blotting out the evil deeds of
many enshrined there. Neither acknowledges Japan's guilt.
This selective amnesia has been in evidence since the war. Japan has never
felt nor expressed the contrition of Germany. No Japanese prime minister has
ever fallen to his knees in remorse as German Chancellor Willy Brandt did in
the Warsaw ghetto in 1970. For years, this amnesia, though condemned by the
rest of the world, was largely indulged by the west. While the cold war
continued, Japan's role as the one friendly unarmed nation in the hostile
east seemed almost to expiate the historical offence.
But in the post-cold war world, Japan is edging towards a global role. In
the past year, the prospect of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council
has moved within sight. The Socialist party of Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama has, in the last month, ended its opposition to Japan having any
military capability. Japanese troops have been involved in UN peacekeeping
efforts in Cambodia. Most importantly, Japan increasingly sees itself as
providing leadership in Asia.
This last trend is forcing a gradual change in Japan's official version of
history. For many Asian countries - the principal victims of Japan's war -
Japan cannot assume a regional political role until that change is complete.
As Mr Haruki Wada, professor of history at Tokyo University, puts it: 'Japan
will never have normal relations with its Asian neighbours as long as it
continues to try to hide its past.'
A test of Japan's capacity for self analysis will come next year when the
country marks the 50th anniversaries of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the
surrender.
But a step towards reappraising its history has already been made. Elections
last year swept away 40 years of Liberal Democratic party rule and appeared
to herald the first significant change in Japan's official attitude to its
history. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the leading architect of political reform, said at
the time: 'We cannot deny the part aggression has played in our history in
Asia.'
But Japan's leaders have failed to follow up words with actions. For
example, 'comfort women', the thousands of Korean and other women forced to
provide sex for Japanese soldiers, continue to press without success for
compensation.
Many Japanese see no need for Japan to feel remorse. They argue that their
fight was honourable, scarred by no more than the usual brutality of war.
Some go further. In a newspaper article in April, Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's
justice minister who is himself a 70-year-old war veteran, described
accounts of the 1937 Nanking massacre where Japanese soldiers murdered tens,
perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Chinese civilians as a 'hoax'.
After a few days' embarrassed silence from the government, Mr Nagano was
forced to resign. But he maintains his views represent those of most
Japanese. He does not see the war in terms of aggression. 'Japan fought to
liberate Asia. In some ways, it could be said we did liberate Asia - look
what happened to India and Burma after the war,' he says.
He is on far less controversial ground when he explains the problem for
Japan in dealing with its past. Unlike Germany, he says, Japan has not been
able to cut itself off from events of 50 years ago. The postwar constitution
reflected the Allies' desire to maintain continuity in Japan to avoid
complete disintegration. So the emperor was left in place.
This continuity has led, most crucially, to weaknesses in the education
system. For decades, Japanese school-books glossed over much of Japan's war
record.
But in the last few months, small victories have been won on the path to
openness. Last year, the supreme court ruled that government attempts to
censor history textbooks were illegal - a decision against which the
education ministry has not appealed. This summer, a school history
curriculum came into effect in high schools which, for the first time,
describes Japan's war as one of aggression.
The scale of the task of re-educating the Japanese is illustrated by one of
Japan's best-selling computer games, Decision of the Commanders, which
re-enacts Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour and the invasion of Asia. The
players assume the positions of imperial commanders, and use forced labour
to fortify their positions. The software caused a furore when it was
launched in 1989, but has sold more than 100,000 copies. Its author,
24-year-old Mr Ryohei Tanaka, says: 'The game was produced from the
perspective of the aggressors, and the Japanese are enjoying it.'
