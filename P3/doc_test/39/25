THE CRUMPLED figure of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher has haunted the corridors
of world diplomacy for so long that his face, like the Cheshire cat's, will
take some considerable time to disappear.
Under Chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, Mr Genscher honed his
skills to emerge as the unsurpassed master of coalition wheeler-dealing. His
passion for power play was never put to better advantage than during the
helter-skelter international negotiations leading to German reunification in
1990.
The foreign minister built his penchant for jet-travel diplomacy into a
personal trademark. His globe-trotting revealed much about his restlessness,
but little about the man himself.
Extending the Ostpolitik of Chancellor Willy Brandt, Mr Genscher continued
with aplomb this policy of developing links with west Germany's eastern
neighbours. Five years ago, he became the first senior western politician
publicly to back Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's reform measures in the Soviet Union.
Without the bonds of sympathy to Moscow, Mr Kohl and Mr Genscher would never
have pulled off German unification quite so quickly.
Despite - and because of - his success, he could never throw off altogether
a reputation for putting tactics before principles. Mr Brandt, who resigned
as chancellor in 1974, as well as Mr Schmidt, whose downfall in 1982 was due
to his foreign minister's decision to back Mr Kohl, both had extensive
experience of Mr Genscher's talents for manoeuvre.
He believed deeply in his mission to help restore the post-war credibility
of German foreign policy. Ever thin-skinned, he was deeply hurt to be told
that, because of his role in toppling Mr Schmidt, he was not trusted by Mrs
Margaret Thatcher.
Reunification was his finest hour. Mr Genscher was born in a village outside
Halle in eastern Germany and made annual Christmas pilgrimages to his
homeland during the years of division. However, like Mr Kohl, he believed he
would never live to see the two parts of the fatherland reunited.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr Genscher realised, with typical
alertness, that the opportunity for unity might be short-lived. His resolve
to take it was single-minded.
An emotional high-point came in early autumn, 1989. He stood on the balcony
of the West German embassy in Prague to announce the liberation of hordes of
east German refugees who had been camping in the grounds, hoping to escape
to the west.
After the catharsis of unity, an exhausted Mr Genscher seemed to lose his
touch. He failed to recognise the international mood during the approach to
the Gulf war last year. At times, it seemed the foreign minister was trying
to elevate Germany's absenteeism from the multinational anti-Iraq task force
to a higher form of morality.
Mr Genscher also clung for longer than others in the west to the belief that
Mr Gorbachev would remain in charge of an intact Soviet Union. In view of
the hope and the D-Marks invested by the Germans in the Soviet leader, this
was forgivable, but it did not improve the reputation of a man famed for
deciphering the shifting runes of international politics.
Mr Genscher is a complicated personality, though not quite as complicated as
his favoured long strings of high-sounding subordinate clauses can sometimes
make him seem. There is a stern touch to him. He adores wise-cracking and
carnival festivities, particularly when he is the centre of attention, but
instructs his speech-writers never to put jokes into his public addresses.
He once expressed indignation when Mr Douglas Hurd, then Britain's home
secretary, made a whimsical remark about modernisation of nuclear missiles
in a speech at Dusseldorf. He bears grudges, and remembers favours. He
recently indicated to Mr Hurd, now foreign secretary, that, since Germany
had helped Britain at the Maastricht summit, the UK should be more
supportive of Bonn's controversial line over recognising Croatia.
By becoming foreign minister of a united Germany, he realised his life's
ambition. Since he has made the foreign ministry his personal fiefdom by
having placed favoured officials in all the key posts, he can be sure that
Genscherism will live on, at least for a few more years.
Asked what he would do with more spare time, Mr Genscher once answered that
he would re-order the books in his library at home in the hills near Bonn.
Perhaps he will write one, too - probably about Genscherism.
