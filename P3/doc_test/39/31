HIDDEN INSIDE a parked car, the Swedish agent aimed his camera and its
telephoto lens at the distinguished-looking East German strolling with his
pretty companion in central Stockholm. The day was July 1 1978. The man was
Markus Wolf, legendary head of communist East Germany's Central Agency for
Intelligence (HVA) and the model for novelist John le Carre's Soviet
spymaster, Karla.
Until that day, the only photographs of Wolf available to the intelligence
services of the western world dated from 1959; Wolf was known as 'The Man
With No Face.' For him, it was the beginning of the end.
Next Wednesday, Wolf will go on trial in Dusseldorf charged with treason
against the Federal Republic of Germany. He is alleged to have bribed a
string of senior West German intelligence officials who became his 'moles.'
But the trial has aroused enormous controversy; some are calling it a
travesty of justice.
For one thing, Wolf was not a citizen of the Federal Republic. For another,
and perhaps more significantly, he has not been charged with offences for
which many of his one-time antagonists hold him to be partly responsible as
deputy head of the Ministry of State Security - the infamous Stasi secret
police.
Wolf's visit to Stockholm in mid-1978, under the alias of Dr Kurt Werner,
combined business with pleasure. The tall, dashing 56-year-old with a taste
for beautiful women, tailored suits and other luxuries - and regarded by his
peers in east and west as the cold war's most cunning and successful
intelligence operator - was there to meet one of his top West German agents,
an MP named Dr Friedrich Cremer.
Wolf was accompanied by Christa, the second of his three wives, on her first
visit to the west. They shopped for Swedish furniture, and Wolf broadened
his young wife's horizons by taking her to a porno club. But already he had
aroused the suspicions of a Swedish immigration official and
counter-intelligence was alerted.
As well as photographing Wolf, it took pictures of his meeting with Cremer;
these later helped to convict the politician of espionage, for which he was
given 2 1/2 years in prison. West German officials gnashed their teeth on
learning of Wolf's visit to Stockholm, but he had not violated Swedish laws
and was able to return to the east. However, the damage to his cover had
been done.
Wolf was a study in contradictions. Long an ardent Stalinist and calculating
exploiter of human weaknesses - including the notorious sex traps used by
eastern spymasters - his personal warmth and care for his nearly 4,000 staff
gained him their unstinting loyalty. Cremer was deeply impressed at their
meeting by the spy chief's openness, keen intelligence - he could talk about
literature or music with equal ease  - and his anxiety for the MP's
well-being.
Wolf's family background and the searing experiences of his youth help to
explain the contradictions of his character. His father, Friedrich, a
communist, was a noted playwright and physician during the Weimar era who
treated his poor patients for nothing. Although he abandoned his Jewish
faith as a German army doctor during the first world war he - and, later,
Markus - would suppress or revive their Jewish origin whenever it appeared
opportune.
Expelled from Hitler's Germany, the Wolfs were given refuge in the Soviet
Union. Markus was 11 when he shed his German past and became Mischa Wolf, a
zealous member of the Young Pioneers who adulated Stalin despite the purges
of the late 1930s which led to the imprisonment of many neighbours and
friends in Moscow. His own girlfriend, Margit, was one of the victims.
Like his father, and millions of other communists, Wolf learned to suppress
whatever doubts he had about Soviet socialism by telling himself that the
state had to be ruthless internally in its mortal struggle with Nazi
Germany. Much later, after the post-war Polish and Hungarian uprisings and
the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he and many fellow communists
realised that the Stalinist system was the undoing of socialism. But, again,
they rationalised away their doubts by arguing that to question the faith
would be to play into the hands of the west.
At the age of 16, Wolf became a Soviet citizen. At 19, he joined the
communist party and was assigned to the spartan Comintern school where young
German exiles like himself were trained to occupy key posts in Germany after
the defeat of Hitler. It was there that Wolf met his first wife, Emmi
Stenzel, daughter of a communist deputy to the Reichstag who was murdered by
the Nazis. Although her mother was arrested by Stalin's secret police in
1937, she was convinced that the purges were not the work of the Soviet
leader but of his scheming aides.
Emmi was remembered by Comintern students for her habit of denouncing their
errant political views to the school administration, which forced them to
engage in self-criticism. She has mellowed since, but bridles at the charge
of having been an informer.
'It's untrue,' she says now in her high-rise flat overlooking east Berlin.
'We had group discussions about behaviour, studies, help. But we never had
interrogations, only discussions.' Even though Wolf divorced her in 1977 to
marry Christa, he continued to look after her interests and Emmi still says
only good things about him, although she notes: 'He never helped around the
house.'
Wolf and Emmi were flown to Berlin in May 1945; there, he became chief
commentator of Berlin Radio and remarked bitterly about the arrogant Germans
he met who refused to acknowledge the Nazi crimes committed in their name.
The party next assigned him to a senior posting at the new GDR embassy in
Moscow, requiring him again to become a German citizen.
Shortly afterwards, and much to his surprise, he was ordered to join the
newly-founded Institute of Economic Research - a cover name for East
Germany's fledgling espionage service, which he would head from 1953 until
he retired in 1987. His greatest coups were to obtain construction plans for
several US missile sites, and technical plans for the missiles, during the
1970s and 1980s, plus Nato's contingency plans for a Soviet-led attack.
He refused to use amateur spies or students (as the US Central Intelligence
Agency did at that time) because he thought the risk that they would be
caught and imprisoned was too high. If one of his own spies was caught, it
was known throughout the service that he would press vigorously to barter
their release. And he treated them like princes when they returned. Yet he
would use his agents to prey ruthlessly on lonely women - mainly secretaries
 -in key positions in Bonn and Brussels.
There were around 600 East German agents operating in the west. It was
Wolf's idea to latch some of them - nicknamed 'Romeo agents' - on to these
women employed by the Bonn government and Nato. When a woman was enmeshed,
perhaps by the promise of marriage, she would be drawn into Wolf's network.
In the case of Dagmar Kahlig-Scheffler, a secretary in former chancellor
Helmut Schmidt's East Germany's 'spy with no face' office, the HVA arranged
for her 'operative fictional marriage' to agent Herbert Schroter at which
HVA officers played the roles of best man and registrar.
Perhaps the most important of these was Dr Gabriele Gast, who fell in love
during her student days with a Romeo agent calling himself Karl-Heinz
Schmidt. Gast became a willing accomplice and worked her way up to become
deputy head of the Soviet section of the BND Federal Intelligence Service in
Munich. She spied for the GDR for more than 20 years, refusing payment for
her services because of her political conviction.
On meeting Wolf for the first time - at a house party he hosted on an island
in the Adriatic, off the Yugoslav coast - she was captivated by his charm
and intelligence. Later, she visited him several more times in East Berlin.
She was arrested only a few days before German unification and sentenced to
six years and nine months in prison. Schmidt was released after
interrogation.
Another of Wolf's spies was Gunter Guillaume who, with his wife, was
infiltrated into the refugee stream fleeing from east to west in 1956.
Seventeen years later, he had become an aide to West German chancellor Willy
Brandt.
He passed top Nato secrets to East Berlin and his arrest provoked Brandt's
resignation - an event Wolf later professed, not entirely convincingly, to
regret deeply.
Not all of Wolf's top spies in the west were as ideologically motivated as
Gast or Guillaume. Klaus Kuron was a frustrated senior official in West
Germany's BfV counter-espionage agency when, in 1981, he offered his
services to Wolf for cash.
Over 10 years, he was paid nearly DM700,000. After collecting his last
payment late in 1990, he surrendered to the authorities and was given a
12-year prison term for treason.
Wolf admitted later that much of the information gathered by his agents was
ignored by the ruling Politburo or, in the case of high-tech secrets, was of
little use to East Germany's creaking planned economy. He also claims he
became disillusioned politically with the communist system. So why did he
stay?
'We all had critical opinions - ministers, general directors and the
intelligentsia - but it came out only in our personal conversations,' he
told me in the luxurious flat in east Berlin which he shares with third wife
Andrea. He has been on bail awaiting trial since October 1991.
'Increasingly, I doubted the sense of my work. But what use would it have
been for me to protest? The dogmatists would only have become more
repressive.'
He was the first communist intelligence chief to step down voluntarily.
Realising that the orthodox East German regime could not survive much
longer, former Stasi Major General Markus Wolf altered course, backing
Mikhail Gorbachev enthusiastically and condemning Stalinism in a
best-selling book.
No one was more surprised than he to find himself mentioned as a possible
future reformist leader of the GDR. But any hopes in that direction were
dashed on November 4 1989 when he addressed a rally of more than 1m East
Germans.
Wolf's remarks, criticising the way that Stasi officers who acted in 'good
faith' had been made the 'whipping boys of the nation,' met with a storm of
whistles and cat-calls. The master strategist had miscalculated badly the
mood of his fellow east Germans.
Wolf denies flatly that he played any role in the Stasi's repressive
apparatus, the tentacles of which - helped by the organisation's 85,000
officers and 300,000 informers - stretched into every nook and corner, with
files on nearly 2m people.
'I bear no responsibility,' he told me. 'It was an advantage for me that
Mielke did his work and that my apparat had nothing directly to do with
his.' Wolf claims that the section he ran, dealing with foreign
intelligence, had nothing to do with the larger part of the Stasi engaged in
internal suppression and counter-espionage.
Wolf's trial will be concerned more with the Stasi's activities outside the
former GDR than with its activities as a hated secret police service, and
has generated few calls among east Germans for retribution. Indeed, most
easterners have long since forgotten how Erich Honecker, the former party
leader now in Chile, praised Wolf on his 60th birthday in 1983 for his
'decisive role in the development and strengthening of the ministry of state
security.'
Yet Wolf has been 'demonised' by the popular German press and several of his
aggrieved former opponents. Despite that, Herbert Hellenbroich, the head of
both West Germany's BfV counter-espionage agency and the BND intelligence
service in the 1970s, speaks for a considerable body of opinion when he
argues that convicting Wolf would be unconstitutional as he was ordered to
conduct espionage by an East German government recognised by Bonn.
Wolf's lawyers are expected to take precisely this line. They will insist,
also, that trying him violates the principle of equality under the federal
constitution: so long as West Germany's spymasters remain free, they will
argue, prosecuting Wolf is illegal.
This was exactly the position taken in 1991 by Berlin's high court at the
trial of Wolf's successor, Werner Grossmann; it called for a final ruling by
the Constitutional Court, which has not yet been delivered. But if it
upholds the Berlin court, then the federal attorney-general's case against
'Major General Markus Wolf ret' could, effectively, be destroyed.
As he awaits judgment, Wolf says he is convinced that his work as
intelligence chief helped to 'preserve peace' in Europe. His reasoning,
explained no doubt over many a candle-lit dinner table to his agents, is
that the more that each side knew about the other in the cold war, the less
they were likely to fight.
Who knows: perhaps he was right. 'I was a successful general,' he says, his
eyes narrowing. 'But what is the good of winning battles when the war is
lost?'
