The first democratic all-German Parliament in 57 years convened in the historic 
Reichstag building Thursday, and its senior legislator, Willy Brandt, called on 
the united nation to shoulder greater global responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the new Bundestag, the policy-making lower house, the 
77-year-old former chancellor said that modernizing the former East Germany 
will be a huge task but must not detract from growing German duties around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany would heap guilt on itself if out of its own concerns it forgot world 
concerns: hunger, migration of the poor, environmental destruction," said 
Brandt, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing East-West detente in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know the tasks in our country are not minor," he said of Bonn's costly 
commitment to turn eastern Germany into a mirror of affluent western Germany. 
"But we cannot fail to show solidarity with the wretched of this earth." 
</P>
<P>
Elected democratic representatives from all Germany last sat together in 
Berlin's Reichstag, the historic seat of German legislatures, in December, 
1932. Adolf Hitler's Nazis took control the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers will return to the seat of government in Bonn for future 
meetings. They eventually will decide whether to move permanently to Berlin, 
the unified nation's symbolic capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 662 deputies elected in Germany's general elections Dec. 2 included 150 
representing the former East Germany, which dissolved into Bonn's Federal 
Republic on Oct. 3.
