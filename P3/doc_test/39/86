<F P=106> [Paul Cambon article: "What Future for the Paris-Bonn </F>
Axis?"] 
  [Text] What are the prospects for the Paris-Bonn axis 
following the European elections? The Franco-German desire for 
harmonization remains intact, but the differences in approach 
persist with a view to the major date of the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference aimed at drawing up the initial 
assessment of the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  Are the very different results of the European elections in 
France and Germany likely to influence the strength of the close 
cooperation between Paris and Bonn? The question is 
interesting, but remains purely speculative. In any event Bonn 
is merely observing that the votes received by the parties 
supporting the European Union [EU] as stipulated by the 
Maastricht Treaty added up to a generally higher score (a veil 
is being drawn over the abstention rate) than that recorded by 
the "yes" camp in the September 1992 referendum. 
  However, German diplomatic circles note, the emergence of 
the 
De Villiers [head of anti-Maastricht list] phenomenon is being 
closely watched. Not so much with regard to its possible impact 
on EU policy, but especially with regard to its influence in the 
political game within the existing French Government majority. 
"It is easy to imagine the deputy for Vendee trying to 
influence a particular right-wing candidate in the presidential 
elections to give his major European options a more critical 
bent," a Bonn diplomat said. 
  We will have to wait and see whether this hypothesis can be 
verified. Franco-German relations, as they have been designed 
and have developed since the signing of the Elysee Treaty in 
January 1963, are a factor that cannot be ignored: The 
Paris-Bonn axis is a reality. Nobody on either side of the 
Rhine dares to cast doubt on it, because it has asserted itself 
and seems more vital than ever to meet the huge new challenges 
which have been facing Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
the emancipation of the East European countries, and the 
collapse of Communism in Moscow. 
  Despite occasional vicissitudes and frictions in relations 
between the French president and the German chancellor (which 
was the case between Georges Pompidou and Willy Brandt), the 
past has shown that the Franco-German accord on promoting 
European construction has generally worked well. Even if it has 
often been the subject of criticism which is at times fierce. 
"The French and Germans can sometimes achieve the impossible. 
And often they do not please anybody," one of Helmut Kohl's 
close aides commented half ironically and half bitterly, and he 
added: "Our cooperation is certainly not perfect. It is still 
exemplary." At the Elysee [presidential office], in Francois 
Mitterrand's entourage, the same tone is taken, stressing that 
"the convergence in Franco-German approaches is neither natural 
nor spontaneous." Clearly, any agreement between Paris and Bonn 
is the fruit of long and sometimes difficult negotiations, and a 
vital compromise. 
  From 1 July the Germans and French will have successive 
six-month terms as EU president. Even before the 12 June 
election, speculation was rife both in Paris and Bonn about 
achieving the greatest possible harmonization of the two 
presidencies. Some idealists or at all events extreme optimists 
talked of the possibility of a "joint presidency." The idea did 
not gain ground and it seems that each has returned to 
symbolically less spectacular but probably more effective ideas. 
However, there is one certainty: Many nuances and many 
differences remain between France and Germany on the major 
issues awaiting the EU, not in the immediate future but at all 
events by 1996, the year of the Intergovernmental Conference 
responsible for making the initial assessment and assessing the 
prospects for the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  These differences relate both to the nature of the European 
institutional reforms (although each recognizes the need for 
them), and the future of European construction, more 
particularly, its aims and its expansion plans toward East 
Europe which, of course, nobody disputes but which nobody at 
present sees very clearly. 
  Helmut Kohl is a highly convinced and unreserved supporter 
of 
European construction. For almost ideological reasons. As a 
Rhinelander, close to France, he experienced the sufferings of 
war as a child. As a German, having long suffered the division 
of his country, he could not conceive of Germany's new-found 
unity other than in the framework of the kind of free Europe 
desired and launched by Konrad Adenauer and General de Gaulle. 
Helmut Kohl is a fervent integrationist. His European 
convictions are also based on a fully egalitarian democratic 
concept. This remark applies to his concept of strengthening 
the powers of the European state institutions, namely the 
Brussels Commission and the Strasbourg Parliament. Paris' 
desire for integration is not in doubt, but, according to its 
present state of thinking, it wants to see the powers of the 
Council of Ministers strengthened and expanded. However, in the 
upper echelons of the French state, it is impossible to detect 
any very ardent enthusiasm for conferring a key role on the 
European deputies. 
  There is still some division between France and Germany on 
the currently rather abstract link being made between expansion 
and deepening. The French take a Cartesian attitude and more 
readily place the emphasis on the second element, whereas the 
Germans do not see any fundamental contradictions. Quite the 
reverse. 
  The fact remains that, over the past 12 months, the subject 
of EU expansion, not only to the Central and East European 
countries but also to Romania and Bulgaria and to the three 
Baltic countries and Slovenia, has taken on a scale which some 
people in France had clumsily underestimated. But even if the 
integration of these various countries which have come in from 
the cold is a matter of years, Germany, given its geographical 
position, anxious not to be the last country in the East to be a 
member of a military organization (NATO), very rapidly saw the 
risks of a "gray area" grouping several countries between West 
Europe and a Russia threatened with political and economic 
instability. This same concern is shared in Warsaw, Budapest, 
and Prague. To the extent that, over the last few months of 
last year, Poland and Hungary requested integration into NATO. 
They have done so in vain so far, but the future remains open. 
And these same countries have also officially applied for EU 
membership. 
  The facts are there, pressing. "France and Germany must 
consider a planned and coordinated action," the Quai d'Orsay 
[French Foreign Ministry] readily says. But for what Europe and 
for what expansion which, it is feared, may be synonymous with 
dilution? Such a serious question deserves a vast debate. A 
variable-geometry Europe or an all-European free trade area? 
Chancellor Kohl seems hostile to the second option. However, 
it is not certain that he is a warm supporter of the first. 
  However, French diplomacy seems to be "working" more and 
more 
on the basis of this variable-geometry Europe, a formula which 
is not new and which, at least in the monetary sphere, had 
supporters in Germany. At the time there was talk of a 
"concentric Europe." However, it is important not to confuse 
things. The challenges facing the EU are of several kinds: the 
common foreign and security policy, economic convergence, and 
monetary union. 
  Although it is clear, but not easy, that an expanded Europe 
must find the vital common denominator in the foreign policy and 
security spheres, it is equally obvious that the huge gulf which 
now separates the European Twelve or Sixteen from the fairly 
long-term candidates for membership is not about to be bridged. 
An illustration of this is that the per capita GDP among the 
Twelve is currently $18,600 per year. It is only $3,000 for the 
Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) 
and $1,000 for Romania. And, according to expert forecasts, it 
will take these countries a good 20 years to achieve 75 percent 
of the EU's GDP. Provided that throughout this period the growth 
differential for these East European countries is 4 percent 
higher than the economic expansion recorded within the EU. 
  Expansion also implies a doubling of the Twelve's budgetary 
contribution. A country like Spain would become a net 
contributor. How can it be ensured that, faced with the scale of 
such a financial commitment, immediate national interests do not 
rapidly resurface? In Germany, for instance, during the election 
campaign for the European elections, a good number of people 
spoke out, especially among Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, 
demanding a review of the German budget contribution. The 
argument put forward is that Germany, the EU's leading net 
contributor, saw its annual per capita GDP fall from first to 
sixth place among the Twelve under the effect of reunification. 
"The thread of voluntarism must be taken up again," according 
to one of Francois Mitterrand's close aides, who also describes 
the "Maastricht Treaty as a forge for very tough metals." The 
Maastricht Treaty would therefore become "a formidable tool" for 
an ambitious plan. This is the conviction cherished by the 
French president and the German chancellor, who are its 
initiators. Once the parliamentary elections in Germany and the 
presidential elections in France are over, the future will say 
whether the Franco-German European faith is still as complete. 
We can hazard a bet: We do not expect it to be altered too 
much by the weight of reality and perhaps also the urgency to 
find a solution.
