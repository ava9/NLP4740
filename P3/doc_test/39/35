A ROW between western bankers has blocked finance for desperately needed
equipment to help Russia arrest its rapid decline in oil production.
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has a plan to finance
purchases of oil and gas equipment through credits from western commercial
banks and the US Exim bank.
Oil output has plunged from 570m tonnes in 1987 to about 395m this year and
an estimated 340m-350m in 1993.
However, the entire project has been held up by objections from the World
Bank.
The Russians aim to pay back the credits with revenue from the extra
production which the new equipment will bring.
However, under the World Bank's 'negative pledge' rule, it will not permit
other lenders to be treated more favourably than it in the repayment of
credits - and sees a pledge of future oil output to the EBRD, when no such
pledge has been made to it, as more favourable treatment. The World Bank is
providing more than Dollars 1bn of credits for various projects.
Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was said last night to be planning
a trip to Italy, after the Russian authorities lifted a travel ban to enable
him to go to Germany for the funeral of former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
Russia's constitutional court imposed the ban to try to force Mr Gorbachev
to appear at hearings to decide the fate of the Communist party.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Mr Gorbachev's passport was only valid for
travel to Germany.
