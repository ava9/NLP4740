<TEXT>
Germany yesterday charged communist spymaster Mr Markus Wolf with spying and
treason for running at least 12 agents against Bonn during the cold war,
including one who brought down former Chancellor Willy Brandt, Reuter
reports.
Germany's constitutional court has yet to rule whether Bonn can try Mr Wolf,
who headed East Germany's spy network from 1953 to 1986, since he acted
within the laws of a sovereign state.
