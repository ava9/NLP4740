Riot police beat protesters with clubs Thursday and formed human cordons to 
drive 2,000 people from Wenceslas Square, where activists demanding more human 
rights have rallied five straight days. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10 were dragged 
away by police during a melee that broke out after authorities shouted through 
loudspeakers that the rally was unauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most violent clash between protesters and police since the 
gatherings began Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms in the 
Communist-ruled nation, but those slogans changed to "Gestapo! Gestapo!" when 
the baton-wielding wave of riot police swept through, lashing out 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
Officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protesters out of the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor's Television Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vdenek Horcik appealed for the "provocations" to stop. Speaking on 
national television, Horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young people off 
the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd assembled shortly after 5 p.m., when many Prague residents were on 
their way home after work. They shouted "Free Havel!" and "Let them go!" 
referring to human rights activist Vaclav Havel and 14 others jailed for taking 
part in earlier protests. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of officers poured into the half-mile-long square from side streets 
when the protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd and pushing them along 
the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to help force away the 
demonstrators. Water cannon were brought onto the square but not used. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations began Sunday when about 5,000 people gathered at Wenceslas 
Square for a memorial to Jan Palach, who burned himself to death 20 years ago 
to protest the presence of Soviet troops after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's Name Invoked 
</P>
<P>
Troops and tanks sent in by the Kremlin in August, 1968, crushed the Prague 
Spring reforms, which now are likened to the social and economic changes 
championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some protesters yelled "Gorbachev sees this!" when police moved in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, a member of the 
Charter 77 human rights group, was denied permission to visit West Germany for 
the 75th birthday of his friend, former Chancellor Willy Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
Hajek, who was allowed to visit Austria last month, said Prague authorities 
deemed it against state interests for him to travel abroad.
