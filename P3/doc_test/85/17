  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 (AFP) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto said Thursday [26 May] her country had put 
forward counter-proposals to a US plan for non-intrusive 
inspections of Pakistan's nuclear installations. The 
counter-proposal was passed on to Washington by President Farooq 
Ahmed Leghari, who is in the United States on a private visit, 
she said at a press conference following her return from a 
three-day visit to Nepal. 
  "We are using this occasion to have informal talks" with US 
leaders and explain Pakistan's position following US Under 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's trip to Islamabad in April, 
she added. Bhutto did not elaborate on the contents of the 
counter-proposals. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said last week that 
Washington had proposed a "non-intrusive" inspection of 
Pakistan's nuclear plants to verify that Islamabad was not 
producing nuclear weapons. He added that Pakistan was prepared 
to consider non-physical verification of its programme. The US 
proposals followed Talbott's talks on the nuclear issue with 
Pakistani leaders, when the two sides agreed to pursue a policy 
of "quiet diplomacy" to improve bilateral relations. 
  President Leghari, who in United States to attend his son's 
graduation, held talks with US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and met Vice President Al Gore, while officials of 
the two countries Thursday began two days of talks in Washington. 
  Pakistan's controversial nuclear programme has caused strain 
between Washington and Islamabad, with the United States in 1990 
cut off more than 500 million dollars worth of military and 
economic assistance to Pakistan. Washington also stopped 
delivery of 38 F-16 jets, following reports that Pakistan was 
pursuing a weapons-oriented nuclear programme, a charge which 
Islamabad has denied. 
  In April Washington asked Islamabad to agree to a 
"verifiable 
cap" on production of missile materials in exchange for a 
one-time waiver of the embargo imposed against it under the 1990 
Pressler Amendment. Although the proposal was discussed during 
Talbott's visit, no immediate agreement was reported. 
  Bhutto said she wanted to see an improvement in relations 
between the two nations, adding that she wanted to visit the 
United States later this year. Pakistan shared with the US its 
concern over nuclear non-proliferation, she said, but added that 
she saw the Pressler Amendment as a "veto" in the hands of 
Pakistan's traditional rival, India. She said India applied 
this veto "on every single proposal made by Pakistan for 
regional non-proliferation." 
  Islamabad wants a "non-discriminatory" application of the 
legislation, forced India, which exploded a nuclear device 20 
years ago, to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. "If 
Pakistan and the US are to proceed on a common goal of non- 
proliferation in the region, then it is important that the 
Indian veto through Pressler be removed or waived," she stressed.
