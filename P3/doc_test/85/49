  [Text] Foreign Minister of Pakistan Asif Ahmad Ali has 
charged the United States with supplying outdated weapons to the 
UN peacekeeping force in Somalia. Together with his country's 
Defense Minister, Asif Ahmad Ali visited Somalia to inspect the 
Pakistani contingent of the UN force. Now our commentary by 
Vassan Georgiyev: 
  The United States and the other Western countries want to 
withdraw their troops from Somalia by the end of this month. 
The UN force remaining in Somalia will consist of troops of 
Afro-Asian countries only. The Pakistani contingent will be the 
largest, more than 5,000 people. As the Pakistani foreign 
minister says, the United Nations troops remaining in Somalia 
would be left with outdated weapons, the Cobra helicopters, 
which have served their time, old models of tanks, and other 
military equipment. Asif Ahmad Ali also called attention to the 
shortage of drugs and dressings. The Pakistani foreign minister 
described as racist such an approach to the United Nations 
peacekeepers staying in Somalia. He accused the United States 
of contempt of the lives and health of servicemen from Pakistan 
and other states of Asia and Africa.The racism charges were 
immediately rejected by the United States Defense Department and 
Washington agreed to consider the issue of replacing outdated 
weapons. 
  At this point one may consider the matter settled. Yet one 
might consider at the same time whether out-of-date weapons were 
the only source of the Pakistani foreign minister's irritation. 
Until recently, as it received large amounts of weapons from 
the United States, Islamabad could hardly afford to criticize 
the Pentagon publicly. Yet the United States embargo on arms 
shipments to Pakistan following its attempts to create a nuclear 
bomb of its own, has changed Islamabad's policy toward 
Washington. It should not be ruled out that as he criticizes 
Washington for leaving outdated military equipment for the 
Pakistani contingent in Somalia, the foreign minister of 
Pakistan wants to remind Washington of the problem of his 
country's army in general; it is no secret that it is still 
equipped largely with American weapons but these weapons were 
manufactured in the '70s. Islamabad wants the United States to 
resume military aid to Pakistan, including the F-16 fighter 
bombers and other latest weapons. It appears that the foreign 
minister of Pakistan took advantage of the participation of the 
country's contingent in the United Nations peacekeeping forces 
to remind Washington of the needs of the Pakistani Army once 
again.
