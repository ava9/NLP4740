<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pakistan-U.S. Talks -- Hope for Positive </F>
Progress''] 
  [Text] Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, 
has concluded his talks with Pakistani authorities in Islamabad. 
It was generally felt that the entire attention at the talks 
would be directed to the nuclear problem in the subcontinent and 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan. However, as Talbott 
himself said, the talks were wide-ranging and encompassed not 
only specific South Asian issues but other global and regional 
issues of interest to Pakistan and the United States, too. 
Although these talks, as the press reports indicate, have not 
been conclusive and will be continued, but a big benefit 
obtained from them is that they enabled Pakistan and the United 
States to understand each other's viewpoints. 
  Pakistan repeated its proclaimed stand that it staunchly 
supports nuclear nonproliferation. However, the objective can 
be achieved only when the two major countries of South Asia both 
agree to accept identical restrictions and no country is given 
any discriminatory or preferential treatment. At his news 
conference, Talbott clarified that the United States would like 
to accomplish the objective of ending the weapons of mass 
destruction by pursuing fair means, and there is no question of 
any attempt to push Pakistan to the corner and to put any 
pressure on it unilaterally. He also held extensive talks on 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and said that the supply 
of planes is part of the proposals presented to Pakistan as a 
package. 
  The United States also made a proposal to Pakistan for 
convening a multinational conference to discuss the nuclear 
nonproliferation issue, which would include nine countries. 
Pakistan has agreed to the proposal. Talbott repeated the 
demand for an inspection of Pakistan's nuclear installations. 
Pakistan responded with alternative proposals that were not 
disclosed. The two sides have agreed that future talks will be 
held quietly without much publicity so they can deliberate on 
concrete proposals while keeping them free from political 
pressures. 
  It is satisfying to note that the government of Pakistan 
expressed its resolve to adhere to its stand on basic issues and 
refused to compromise on them. The overall attitude of the U.S. 
mission was also satisfying, and it did not demand that Pakistan 
abandon its nuclear program right away. It is only after three 
years that Pakistan and the United States have held such 
high-level extensive talks that have helped the two sides 
understand each other's viewpoint better. Now that it has been 
decided to adopt the path of quiet diplomacy, it is appropriate 
to hope that it will yield results and that the United States, 
keeping with its claim, will be able to adopt an equitable 
strategy toward the countries of South Asia. 
  Pakistan is ready to accept any reasonable proposal on 
nuclear nonproliferation. The U.S. authorities might have 
realized this fact very well during their recent talks. We hope 
that the Clinton administration will have a greater realistic 
approach to all issues after it receives the report on Talbott's 
mission and will make a decision to supply F-16 planes to 
Pakistan without making any unacceptable demand. It will not be 
incongruous to hope that the Islamabad talks will result in the 
revival of better and effective relations between Pakistan and 
the United States. Talbott's remarks that the United States 
still attaches the same importance to Pakistan as it did before 
the end of the Cold War is encouraging. If this claim is 
correct, then there is no justification for suspending the 
military assistance to Pakistan. 
  Pakistan's stand on the nuclear issue is very rational and 
legitimate. In no case can it be used as a plea for suspending 
military assistance to Pakistan. Similarly, the refusal to 
supply the F-16 planes is a totally unjustifiable action, 
because under a business deal Pakistan has paid for them and the 
U.S. Government is obligated to supply the planes. Talbott 
announced that no extraordinary importance would be given to 
India among the countries of South Asia. We hope the U.S. 
Government posture will fully conform to this claim.
