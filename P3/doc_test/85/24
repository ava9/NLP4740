<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Campaign Against the Pressler </F>
Amendment"] 
  [Text] A meeting held at the Prime Minister House the other 
day reviewed all important aspects of Pakistan-U.S. relations. 
It was attended by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto; Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali; Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. 
Khan; and Dr. Maliha Lodhi, Pakistani ambassador to the United 
States. The Pakistani ambassador gave details of her meetings 
with President Clinton and other U.S. authorities and said that 
she has been apprising the U.S. circles of Pakistan's position 
on the Pressler Amendment and expressed the hope that the warmth 
in relations between the two countries will be visible again. 
Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto expressed the confidence that 
Pakistan will be able to convince the United States that the 
Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law and that it failed to 
serve the purpose of nuclear nonproliferation in the region. 
  The Pressler Amendment is applicable only to Pakistan. 
Consequently, the United States has suspended economic and 
military aid to Pakistan, thereby creating a very difficult 
situation for this country. Pakistan very courageously endured 
the situation and made it clear to the United States that as far 
as nuclear nonproliferation is concerned, Pakistan has never 
disagreed with it. However, it set only one condition: that 
India should sign the treaty first. 
  Pakistan presented a number of proposals on keeping South 
Asia a nuclear-free zone, but India has consistently rejected 
these proposals. The United States has started to realize that 
Pakistan is interested not in manufacturing the nuclear weapon 
but in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This is why the 
Pakistani leadership is expressing the confidence that the 
United Stats will be convinced that the Pressler Amendment is a 
discriminatory law. 
  A report says that Senator Larry Pressler has stressed that 
before making any changes in the Pressler Amendment, it should 
be ensured that President Clinton verifys that Pakistan does not 
possess a nuclear weapon. Larry Pressler argues that if the 
United States shows leniency in its attitude toward nuclear 
nonproliferation, then the countries that have acquired nuclear 
capability, including North Korea, will be encouraged to carry 
out a nuclear explosion. Larry Pressler's opinion cannot be 
taken as the last word. The U.S. Administration should keep the 
facts in view and avoid creating difficulties for a friendly 
country only on the basis of speculations.
