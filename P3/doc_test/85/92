  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has sent a 
letter to the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton. The letter 
relates to the efforts being made by Pakistan to prevent human 
rights violations in the occupied Kashmir by presenting a 
resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting being held 
in Geneva. This was stated by Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Shaharyar Khan in Washington yesterday evening. He said that he 
has personally delivered the letter to senior State Department 
officials. Shaharyar Khan said that he also held talks on 
matters of mutual interest to Pakistan and the United States 
during his meetings with U.S. officials. 
  Answering a question, the foreign secretary said that it has 
been unanimously decided in Islamabad to present a resolution on 
human rights violations in Kashmir during the current session of 
the commission. He said that the situation this time is 
different from the time when Pakistan, on the suggestion of some 
friends and Islamic countries, had agreed to defer a similar 
resolution. They wanted to allow an opportunity for talks so as 
to peacefully resolve the dispute. He said that the situation 
in the Indian-occupied Kashmir remains unchanged and there has 
been no respite in Indian oppressive activities. The foreign 
secretary expressed dissatisfaction over the outcome of the 
recent Pakistan-India talks. He said that contrary to what 
Pakistan expected, Indian atrocities in Kashmir recently 
increased, which clearly indicates how sincere India is about 
holding talks with Pakistan. 
  In reply to another question, Shaharyar Khan said that it 
has 
always been Pakistan's conviction that the Kashmir issue should 
be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the people of 
Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign secretary has now gone to Bonn 
on the next leg of his trip to secure support for the Pakistani 
stand on Kashmir.
