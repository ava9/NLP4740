  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
the Kashmir problem is a stumbling block in the way of durable 
peace and stability in the region. The president was talking to 
the chairman of All Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group of 
Britain, Lord (Eric Evory) in Islamabad today. The president 
said that the only way to resolve the problem is to give the 
people of Kashmir their inalienable right of self-determination. 
Referring to the gross violations of human rights in the 
occupied Kashmir, the president said that Pakistan would 
continue to utilize all diplomatic channels to awaken the world 
conscience against continuing repression in the occupied valley. 
Lord (Evory) told the president that the UN ability to help in 
the resolution of the problem has been stymied by the Indian 
reluctance to cooperate. 
  Lord (Evory) also called on Senate Chairman Mr. Wasim Sajjad 
in Islamabad today. The Senate chairman drew the attention to 
the fact that since the Kashmir issue has its roots in the time 
of British India, it is special responsibility of the Great 
Britain to influence the world opinion for peaceful solution of 
the issue. Expressing his deep concern over the situation, Lord 
(Evory) said that the magnitude of atrocities being committed by 
the Indian forces has no match in the past.
