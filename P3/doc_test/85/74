  [Excerpts] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said Pakistan is fully conscious of its geographical and 
geostrategic sensitivities and the role it has to play in the 
newly emerging world order. Addressing PMA [Pakistan Military 
Academy] long course passing-out parade in Kakul today, the 
president said we strongly believe in the principle of peaceful 
coexistence and noninterference in the affairs of others. He 
said we have no aggressive designs against anyone and wish to 
live in peace and harmony with all, especially our neighbors. 
The president said, however, we have to maintain high level of 
preparedness to thwart any evil designs that imperil or 
jeopardize Pakistan's integrity. The parade was held in open in 
spite of continuing rain. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the parade, the president lauded the professional 
capabilities of Pakistan armed forces. 
  [Begin Leghari recording] Let me assure you that the 
Government of Pakistan is fully conscious of our security needs 
and is doing its best to keep the armed forces of the country 
fully prepared to effectively defend the motherland and thwart 
any foreign aggression. Despite the many constraints, 
particularly economic, we shall equip our armed forces with the 
latest technologically advanced weapon systems and knowledge of 
related fields to qualitatively improve their condition so that 
the adverse effect of numerical inferiority can be offset. I am 
confident that our forces will be in a position to face the 
consequences of fast-changing geopolitical and geostrategic 
situation that Pakistan finds itself in. In fact our armed 
forces have already proved their effectiveness, both inside as 
well as outside the country, as part of different UN missions. 
We rightly feel proud of them. [end recording] 
  Cadets from some friendly countries, such as Bahrain, 
Jordan, 
Sri Lanka, and Maldives also got training in the current long 
course.
