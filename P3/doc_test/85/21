  [Text] The President of Pakistan Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan 
Leghari and King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia through a 
joint appeal have tried to invoke fear of God in the hearts of 
Afghan leaders who are locked in a senseless war against each 
other. Both the leaders have reminded Afghan leaders that the 
Islamabad accord was authenticated and reaffirmed in the 
precincts of holy Haram Sharif in the holy month of Ramadan and 
as such they should fear Allah for what they are doing to their 
own people. As a first step towards peace, both leaders have 
asked the Afghans to effect an immediate and unconditional 
ceasefire and then a allow the ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization] and its secretary-general, as defined in the 
Makkah accord, to secure and monitor a permanent ceasefire 
leading to a comprehensive peace and stability in Afghanistan. 
The two leaders also discussed other issues and condemned 
atrocities being perpetrated in Kashmir and Bosnia. 
  The cry that in modern warfare no one is the winner does not 
seem to have reached Afghanistan where rival factions are still 
locked in bloody rocket-lobbing competition against each other 
-- former allies. One disturbing part of this warfare is that it 
is being repeated with religious punctuality. The Afghans who 
fought against the former Soviet Union in the name of religion 
are now hell bent upon damaging their religious credentials. The 
ground realities of Afghanistan do not leave much space for any 
optimistic hope. Today's Afghanistan resembles Lebanon with 
different forces controlling different parts of the country and 
no one ready to tolerate the other. Lacking democratic 
traditions, any difference of opinion among them quickly 
disintegrates into a bloody battle due to free availability of 
arms. The Afghans don't even accept the Loya Jirga because it 
would be a nominated one. They see the UN as a stooge of the 
United States. The ICO is being kept at bay by periodic battles. 
The only solution under the circumstances is continued dialogue 
among themselves in a congenial atmosphere. They have to shed 
their narrow, selfish motives and sectarian or ideological 
emotions. The Afghan leaders have to show special tolerance and 
stop feeding their followers on war-propaganda so that some 
common ground is found in a vertically polarised society. It is 
high time the Afghans realised the mistake they are committing 
by indulging in internecine warfare. Friendly countries are 
there to help them sort out their differences so that peace 
returns to their country. Let them heed the sincere call made by 
President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz 
and stop spilling each other's blood.
