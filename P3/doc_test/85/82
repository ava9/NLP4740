  [Text] The National Assembly was informed today that the 
government has again raised with the French Government the issue 
of the supply of the nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, in a written reply to a 
question, described as false the rumors that the United States 
has sought Pakistan's permission for establishing military 
bases. He said there is no question whatsoever of any 
commitment from Pakistan's side to the United States to set up 
military bases here. 
  In reply to a question by Mian Abdul Waheed, the foreign 
minister said spares of the defense equipment, including the 
F-16's, are being purchased from the United States on commercial 
basis due to the Pressler Amendment.
