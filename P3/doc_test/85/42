<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Incomprehensible Claim"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. policy on South Asia continues to change 
constantly. Until recently, the U.S. Government had held a very 
strong position against Pakistan on the nuclear nonproliferation 
issue. Consequently, not only did U.S. economic and military 
aid to Pakistan remain suspended for the last four years, the 
delivery of planes for which Pakistan already paid $658 million 
appeared to be impossible. For some time, there had been little 
change in the U.S. stand. The United States then started 
describing Kashmir as a disputed territory and exerted some 
pressure on India on its nuclear program. An impression was 
created that the United States was exerting the same kind of 
pressure on both India and Pakistan, and identical pressure was 
also being exerted on both of them on the missile program, too. 
  However, President Clinton has now sent a report to the U.S. 
Congress in which a bizarre claim has been made that Pakistan 
has been blackmailing India by saying that if the Kashmir issue 
is not resolved, then not only will a war break out between the 
two countries, it will be a nuclear war. In his report, 
President Clinton has said that the impression created by 
Pakistan that a durable peace cannot be established in South 
Asia and that the region will face danger until the Kashmir 
issue is resolved is also incorrect. Though President Clinton 
has expressed an unrealistic and incomprehensible opinion in his 
report, it is gratifying that 12 members of the U.S. Congress, 
in a letter to President Clinton, have demanded that the Indian 
prime minister, who is beginning a visit to the United States, 
on 14 May be asked to stop human rights violations in Kashmir 
and apprised that if India wants technical and economic 
assistance from the United States, then the former should also 
pursue the ethical principles that are very dear to the United 
States. The letter added that India has been holding the 12.5 
million people of occupied Kashmir under its domination against 
their will and is trying to subjugate them with the help of 
500,000 troops. The letter also asked the U.S. President to 
play his role in securing a peaceful and durable solution to the 
Kashmir dispute. We believe that the United States wields 
considerable influence and is capable of playing an effective 
role. If the United States plays a role in resolving this 
dispute, then not only will it be contributing to paving the way 
for a just world order, it will also be making several 
generations of Kashmiris, Pakistanis, and Indians grateful to 
the United States. 
  Apart from the aforesaid letter from the U.S. legislators, 
grave concern was expressed by a number of Democratic and 
Republican Congressmen over the Kashmir situation at a function 
marking the release of a latest book on Kashmir by the eminent 
U.S. writer, Professor William Baker. They also expressed 
amazement over the United States and other developed nation for 
their remaining silent spectators to the human rights violations 
in Kashmir. With tearful eyes, Professor William Baker told the 
gathering that he had no words to describe the awful scenes of 
atrocities he witnessed during his visit to Kashmir. The views 
expressed by prominent U.S. legislators and scholars indicate 
that informed, influential, and powerful circles of the United 
States are well aware of the situation in Kashmir. 
  Under such circumstances, President Clinton's allegation 
against Pakistan that it is blackmailing India on the Kashmir 
question and creating a wrong impression in the world that a 
durable peace cannot be achieved in South Asia unless the 
Kashmir issue is resolved reflects the incomprehensible logic of 
the U.S. President. The head of the world's most powerful 
country should not be so unfamiliar with the issues of an 
important region and the nature of dangers it faces. It has 
been America's age-old weakness and desire to drag India as 
close to itself as possible. In the past, a sort of 
justification was that the United States wanted to keep India 
away from the Soviet Union, but no such compulsion exists now. 
Therefore, the United States should keep in view the objective 
realities while dealing with India. 
  On the eve of Narasimha Rao's visit, the Indian Government 
has announced that its missile manufacture and testing will 
continue according to schedule, and the entire program will be 
completed by July. It is amazing is that despite such a 
categorical announcement by India, the U.S. President is 
alleging that Pakistan is raising the specter of a nuclear war. 
It is imperative that the Government of Pakistan immediately 
obtain the latest report of President Clinton and apprise the 
U.S. Government of Pakistan's reaction after studying it. 
President Leghari is scheduled to visit the United States, and 
he will hold talks with U.S. authorities despite it being a 
private visit. These talks will yield results only when 
Pakistan's viewpoint is clearly explained to the U.S. side. The 
Government of Pakistan should convey its reaction in 
categorical terms to Washington on the U.S. President's latest 
report.
