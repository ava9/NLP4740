  [Text] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, returned 
to Islamabad this evening after a four-day visit to Saudi 
Arabia. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto received the 
president at the airport. Mr. Asif Ali Zardari and principal 
adviser to the Punjab chief minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat 
were also present. During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the 
president performed umrah [minor pilgrimage] and held talks with 
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on a wide range of issues. 
  In an airport statement before his departure from al-Madina 
al-Munawarrah, President Farooq Leghari said that during the 
talks with King Fahd the most important issues which came under 
discussion were recent developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir, 
situation in Afghanistan, and the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. 
He said he apprised King Fahd about the latest developments in 
South Asia and Pakistan's efforts to contain the explosive 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the face of brutal repression 
in the valley. 
  He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted 
the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's level in 
good faith and hopes that India would engage in a meaningful 
dialogue for resolving Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance 
with the UN Security Council resolutions and the Simla 
Agreement. However, he added, for further dialogue it is 
essential for India to create the right conditions and to desist 
from the policy of repression in the Indian-held Jammu and 
Kashmir. He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's 
level in good faith and hoped that India would engage in a 
meaningful dialogue for resolving Kashmir issue in accordance 
with UN Security Council resolutions. [sentence as heard] 
  The president said it is a matter of great satisfaction to 
us 
that King Fahd showed understanding and support for Pakistan's 
point of view on Kashmir, which is based on international 
obligations devolving on both India and Pakistan.
