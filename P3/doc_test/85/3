  [Text] The president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
expressed the hope that relations between the United States and 
Pakistan will further strengthen in the coming days. He was 
addressing an investiture ceremony in Rochester where an 
honorary degree of Doctor of Law was conferred on him by the 
University of Rochester. The president said shared ideals and 
values and unshakable commitment to democracy will bind the 
people of Pakistan and the United States into a special union. 
The president said we represent a Muslim democracy and we are 
the world's first product of cultural and intellectual 
pluralism. We are proud and respectful of all the elements that 
shaped our being. Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said nothing is 
more important than Islam which has sustained and nourished us. 
He said Pakistan and the United States have many commonalities 
and are pluralistic societies. He said that the degree awarded 
to him will be a symbol of friendship and democratic brotherhood 
between the two countries.
