TRADE wind routes were the international highways of the last century,
crowded with traffic. Suddenly, they are thick with sails again, and busier
than at any time since the lost days of the clippers. The navigators are
yachtsmen, competing in an extraordinary range of circumnavigations.
Jules Verne is the inspiration for one of the most gripping events. A trophy
bearing the novelist's name is being offered by the French government for
any yacht able to sail around the world in under 80 days. Robin
Knox-Johnston and Peter Blake, winner of the last Whitbread race at the helm
of the giant ketch Steinlager, are joint skippers of the 85 ft catamaran
Enza carrying a crew of five and now 24 days into their attempt.
Earlier this week they logged one 24-hour run of 477 miles, an
extraordinarily high average speed of 19.9 knots. 'We were hitting 29-30
knots in surges, with the leeward hull frequently hidden by avalanches of
green water,' Knox-Johnston reported in a late-night satellite call from the
Southern Ocean, south of the Cape of Good Hope. 'It was the most fabulous
but hair-raising sailing any of us have done. It was also a personal record
in terms of speed for everyone on board.'
The record for non-stop circumnavigation is 109 days, set by solo French
sailor Titouan Lamazou in 1989. Lamazou is not ignoring the flurry of
attempts upon the Jules Verne trophy. Last week, his new yacht was launched
in Venice. At 143 ft, the TAGHeuer is the longest racing mono-hull ever
built. It displaces 55 tonnes and is big enough to qualify for European
Community ship-building grants. It even has a plimsoll line painted on its
hull.
Lamazou believes catamarans are not the vessels for high speeds in the
Southern Ocean. One of the other yachts competing to break the 80-day
barrier, the 89 ft trimaran Charal skippered by Olivier de Kersauson, is
limping to Cape Town after hitting a 'growler' (ice broken off a major
'berg) at high speed.
'Charal's accident confirms the met (meterological) predictions that the ice
is well north this year,' said Blake from Enza. 'We'll be keeping a
particularly close watch from now on, although your reaction time travelling
at the speeds we are is minimal in these big multi-hulls.
'Nobody has done this before, so it is important that we are reasonably
cautious. We'll push the boat along pretty fast, but I don't want to be in
conditions like the Whitbread race where there's thick fog in among the
icebergs, in a yacht averaging 20 knots in big seas.'
Convinced that life in the narrow hulls of a catamaran would be unbearable
for an extended period at high speed, Blake ordered designer Nigel Irens to
create a carbon-fibre 'command module' to be mounted between the two hulls.
Conditions proved him right.
'I'm speaking from the central pod where it is relatively dry,' said Blake.
'Outside, it's like living on a half-tide rock. There's so much water about
 -continual solid stuff everywhere, particularly at speed where it comes off
both hulls, off the central net, and even from behind. It thumps, bumps,
crashes and washes ropes all over the place but we're enjoying the sailing.'
So, too, are the 140 crew members racing towards Blake in the 10 yachts of
the British Steel Challenge. They left Hobart exactly two weeks ago and are
heading for Cape Town. The bottle screws which had faked on the previous leg
had been replaced by oversized items of twice the strength. Group 4
Securitas is leading but only 30 miles separate the front five, with Nuclear
Electric still the overall leader.
So far, they have experienced far worse weather than they did off Cape Horn,
and this could well turn out to be the toughest leg of the 27,000-mile race.
Nevertheless, when organiser Chay Blyth proposed a change to the route to
take the fleet further north into the Indian Ocean - warmer and with smaller
waves - the crews called for a referendum. Eighty-seven per cent wanted to
stick to the original route passing close to the Kerguelen Islands.
'It's nail-biting down here,' said Peter Phillips, skipper of Rhone Poulenc.
'Being three miles ahead of another yacht is considered a considerable
'cushion' at the front end of the fleet. It must be the closest
long-distance ocean racing ever. It's like being in dinghies, but here we
are at the bottom of the world.'
In spite of the huge seas, injuries have been confined to the odd broken
collarbone and rib. Times have been tougher among the fleet of largely
French yachts taking part in the Vendee Globe solo round-the-world race.
Several competitors have drowned, including British helmsman Nigel Burgess
and American sailor Mike Plant, and others pulled out through injury.
One was Bertrand de Broc, skipper of Groupe LG. He was hit in the face by
the boom after a crash gybe deep in the Southern Ocean. He bit through his
tongue, leaving the tip dangling by a thread. But de Broc was so far from
help that he had to save his own life.
From 10,000 miles away in France, doctors telexed de Broc instructions that
he must stitch the tongue himself to avoid infection and possible death from
blood poisoning. Using a mirror and local anaesthetic, de Broc managed to
insert three stitches as his yacht bucked along at over 10 knots.
The operation succeeded - but it shows that, however hi-tech the 'command
modules' and whatever the speed of the boats, in long-distance ocean racing
one rule always applies: 'no guts, no glory.'
