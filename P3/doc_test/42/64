Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began in the US, and last month skied in
France, Austria, India, Japan and the and north America. Now in Austria,
they will soon be on the way to South America . . .
The enormous globe of the moon hung over the top of Lift 23 at Mammoth
Mountain in California's High Sierras. Simultaneously, the rays of the
rising sun suddenly cleared the top of Broadway. It was 5.27am and the start
of a tense day for the FT's Round-The-World Ski Expedition.
Before the rush hour started, Lucy and I would be the only passengers
cruising over the snow-capped peaks in an executive jet heading for an
already hazy Los Angeles and from there to Europe and the Alps. Two
logistical conundrums had jeopardised our plans to travel from California to
an Austrian glacier in our attempt to ski every day of 1994.
We had relied on the normal morning flight to travel the 300 miles from
Mammoth - one of less than a handful of north American ski resorts where
lifts were still operating at this time of year - to Los Angeles. What we
had failed to bargain for was that during late May this flight was out of
service. We seemed to be marooned in the middle of the Sierra wilderness.
The nature of our second crisis only dawned on the day before we were to
leave for Europe to mark time in the glaciers until the first snows in the
Andes: even if we managed to find a way of leaving Mammoth, our overnight
flight to Frankfurt, which arrived around noon, was going to leave us too
far from our intended destination at Hintertux in Austria to be able to ski
that day.
Our first problem was solved in spectacular style when Randy McCoy, son of
Mammoth's owner, Dave McCoy, agreed to fly us to Los Angeles in the resort's
new Dollars 3m Citation jet. He found room not only for all our skis, but
also our bag of dirty laundry.
After McCoy had come to the rescue in his glistening new jet to fly us out
of Mammoth, American Airlines, who have already flown us once round the
world, agreed to fly us first class to Munich, where we would arrive two
hours earlier than Frankfurt and be nearer the mountains.
The odds against our skiing in California and Austria on consecutive days
had suddenly shortened. And thus it was that we found ourselves being
ferried by Steve Brown's Snowcat to the top of Lift 1 at dawn, long before
Mammoth's lifts opened, to ski Broadway just the once. It was a rude but
spectacular awakening to the day. We then jetted to LA to try to stay on
course for our 146th day's skiing.
We had spent a jet-lagged but idyllic week at Mammoth, combining some much
needed rest with some equally important ski mileage. Even with only four of
its normal winter quota of 30 lifts open, Mammoth still has a formidable
amount of skiing available in spring.
Trying to find large - preferably interconnected - snow patches to ski on
when it is not winter anywhere in the world is not easy, as our poor ski
record this month confirms. We had become expert at finding such snow in
India, and - as one local put it: 'Here in Mammoth we have some pretty big
snow patches]'
With more than a dozen trails open, Mammoth was bliss after our hunt for
snow in Asia. And, even though most lifts were closed, you could still hike
into tougher runs such as Wipe Out and Dave's Run.
In May, the resort's lifts close at 2pm. Skiers can spend the afternoon
marvelling at local attractions such as the monoliths and waterfalls of
Yosemite, and perhaps America's best-preserved and most poignant ghost town,
Bodie, 'a mining town frozen in time'. We were even able to play nine holes
of golf.
Around 24 hours after leaving Mammoth, Lucy and I were revelling in fresh
powder on the Stubai, an Austrian glacier at Neustift. It seems an age since
were last in Europe, but it is a mere 23 days and 26,820 miles. After our
hectic and car-less schedule in India and Japan, it is a relief to be mobile
again.
Trying to ski either side of an inter-continental flight is always tricky.
What should have been a straightforward run from the top of Argentiere's
Grands Montets before we left for Geneva and our flight to Delhi at the
beginning of May became tense when high winds sprung up suddenly, almost
trapping us helplessly on top of the mountain only hours before our
aircraft's departure.
We had been warned that it was raining at the top of the cable-car but,
unexpectedly, we encountered savage conditions. By the time we reached the
summit, 60 mile-an-hour winds plus thick fog had made the long black run
back to the mid-station at La Croix de Lognan - more than 4,000 ft of
extremely exposed and mogulled terrain - a frightening prospect to ski in a
hurry or even to ski at all. Feeling just a little like Captain Oates, I
clambered down the metal staircase to the slopes way below, but I knew in my
heart that the descent on skis was too dangerous.
There was now a real risk that the cable car would stop running and leave us
stranded until the wind dropped. But the gusts were just within operational
limits. We chose a more benign run for our one descent before leaving, but
it was a close thing.
Now we are back in Europe, the next few days in Austria and Switzerland are
going to be very precious. They will represent the only real taste of summer
we will have in 1994. In mid-June we shall be plunged back into winter when
we arrive in Santiago in an attempt to ski every single resort in Chile and
Argentina. But here in Austria, it is snowing again. Perhaps there will be
some winter sunshine in south America.
