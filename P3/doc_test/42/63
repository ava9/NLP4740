AS OUR JEEP shuddered around the twists and turns of Tobago's churned-up
roads, a small earthquake struck. Tectonic plates collided, lights went out,
and buildings shook in the capital, Scarborough. In a remote seismological
centre, the Richter scale needle edged its way towards 4.5. The passengers
of our jeep, however, remained blissfully unaware of this momentous event.
Tobago's roads are so rutted and our vehicle was in so advanced a state of
stuttering and clattering that the mere convulsions of the Earth's crust
were not likely to affect us one way or the other. Tobagonian roads ought
not to be this bad. Only a few miles away, on the twin island of Trinidad,
is one of the world's largest sources of asphalt. Pitch Lake, the planet's
only natural wonder resembling a parking lot, supplies asphalt to smooth the
path of motorists in New York and Paris. Paradise to a hassled New Yorker
may be two weeks in Tobago's beach-fringed serenity. But to a Tobagonian
driver, heaven is a straight road in Brooklyn with no potholes. Not that
bumpy roads should worry the would-be tourist. This is all part of Tobago's
character and serves to confirm its reputation as one of the Caribbean's
least commercially developed islands. Unlike most destinations in the
region, Tobago has not changed much over the past 50 years. Beaches really
are deserted and the tourist still finds himself regarded as an interesting
novelty rather than a walking dispenser of hard currency. Sheltered
economically by oil-rich Trinidad, Tobago has not wooed international
tourists with the same gusto as its more financially fragile neighbours.
With a population of a mere 40,000, it maintains the rural atmosphere of a
bygone, gentler era. The first item of news I heard on local radio was that
a watch with a black leather strap had been found in Scarborough; anyone
claiming it was invited to contact the radio station. This, I concluded, was
an island living in a different age. The fact that Tobagonian advertisements
still promote Guinness as being good for you only served to confirm my
impression.
Although tiny - 26 miles by nine - Tobago is topographically so rugged, so
choked in virgin forest and so sparsely populated that it appears much
larger. Driving around the island it is easy to feel, as one plunges past
verdant hillsides - so green and fecund they resemble mounds of freshly
tossed salad - that one is exploring a country of far greater dimensions.
Tobago has more in common ecologically with the South American mainland
(just seven miles from Trinidad) than with most other Caribbean islands.
Trinidad broke off the Venezuelan landmass thousands of years ago, and
Tobago in turn snapped off its larger neighbour like a fragment of tooth,
before drifting to the north-east.
The islands consequently boast an extraordinary array of bird and plant
life; for instance, there are 17 varieties of hummingbird, the smallest of
which - the tufted coquette - is outsized by some types of Trinidadian bees.
Such is the proximity of the twin-island state with Venezuela,that the
islands' national bird, the scarlet ibis, divides its time between the two.
A tourist official told me that the fighter-plane-shaped birds, as vibrant
as neon lights, leave Trinidad's Caroni swamp in dignified silence (that
being the British heritage) and flock back from Venezuela late at night in a
Latin-like state of raucous revelry.
Tobago itself resembles much of central Africa, its hillsides a matted green
web of palms and trees, lianas and creaking bamboo. The air is heavy with
ooze and sap; all around one hears bleating goats, chirruping birds and
cicadas making such a din they sound like the clattering of a shopping cart
over cobblestones.
Tobago, unlike Trinidad, is almost entirely rural, the majority of its
largely black population garnering some income from fishing or agriculture.
The capital, Scarborough - population 4,000 - is more of a market than a
town; the only event I saw carrying the least hint of frayed urban tempers
was two men arguing over the price of fish.
In one day we managed, at fairly leisurely pace, to circumnavigate the
island, with the exception of one section of road which a Rastafarian
goatherd assured us was too precarious even for our four-wheeled vehicle.
The names of Tobago's hamlets, districts and towns - Auchensklock, Bacolet,
Glamorgan, Mesopotamia, Prince's Bay and Trois Rivieres - conjure up the
island's turbulent history which saw it change hands among colonial powers
no fewer than 31 times in 100 years. Even the Latvians held sway for one
brief period.
Our circuit took us through scores of villages, usually small clusters of
stilted wooden houses strewn higgledy-piggledy on the steep hillsides. Most
boasted a general store, opening hours 'anytime'. Many had a blackboard
nailed by the door with chalk scrawls advertising specials such as oxtail,
shark steaks, cow heel and goat meat. One bore the curious announcement:
'Meat for dogs. Rice for dogs.'
Many hamlets were so small that their stores doubled as watering holes and
gossip shops. 'First and Last Cafe and Bar in Castara,' one banner warned.
Tobago, evidently, was not the place for comparative shopping.
We were tempted into many a local rum shop, most of them dark dens of
alcoholism entered through grimy bead curtains. Their proprietors, evidently
keen to instil an air of respectability, had often tacked up notices
entreating the clientele: 'Discuss don't Cuss.' One had a neatly handwritten
sign on the door of the lavatory beseeching customers: 'Please Don't Soil Me
with Filt.'
We ended up at the eastern end of the island, in Charlotteville, a tiny
horseshoe fishing bay whose forested hills rolled into the sea of cat's-eye
green. While we were there a wooden fishing boat - the No Problem - drifted
to the sandy beach, an event marked by the doleful sound of a conch horn.
As the kingfish were unloaded, weighed and gutted on a stone slab, streams
of people emerged from the surrounding hills to make their purchases. The
sea lapped onto the narrow sandy beach, and a couple of grey pelicans eyed
the scraps of fish with nonchalance.
The tranquility of Tobago, typified by Charlotteville, may not last long.
The runway at Crown Point airport has recently been extended to allow jumbo
jets to land. Tourists from America and Europe will now be able to fly
directly to Tobago without the inconvenience of having to change aircraft in
Trinidad. There are plans to build more hotels on the island, with several
big international chains having shown interest.
The government expresses its determination to pursue an environmentally
sensitive form of tourism, by which it means it hopes to attract
high-spending tourists in relatively low volume.
However, once Tobago has established its place on the globetrotter's
itinerary, it may be hard to control numbers. Next time the ground
reverberates in Scarborough, it may not be an earthquake - just another
jumbo jet rumbling overhead.
David Pilling flew c/o BWIA International (London reservations:
071-839-9333) which operates non-stop flights to Tobago once a week from
Heathrow (Apex fares from Pounds 689 return).
Accommodation was arranged by the Mount Irvine Hotel and Golf Club, Tobago.
