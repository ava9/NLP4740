Hundreds of Soviet citizens helped 11-year-old Tony Aliengena unfurl his 
1,000-foot-long friendship scroll in the heart of Red Square today, some of 
them abandoning their places in line to see Lenin's Tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, of San Juan Capistrano, later met with an aide to Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev inside the Kremlin to deliver the document, which was signed by 
250,000 American schoolchildren and is designed to further world peace. 
</P>
<P>
When his 47-day around-the-world trip is completed, Tony will present President 
Bush a friendship scroll signed by Soviet youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, accompanied by his father, began the global flight in his blue-and-white 
Cessna Centurion on June 5. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around 
the world in short hops averaging three hours each and, if completed 
successfully, would make him the youngest person to fly around the world.
