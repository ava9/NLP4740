Gary Aliengena, father of boy aviator Tony Aliengena, faces a four-month 
suspension of his pilot's license as the result of a crash that occurred while 
he was at the controls during his son's round-the-world flight last year, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration proposed the suspension in January after 
investigating events that preceded the July 1989 crash in Alaska, FAA 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Brekke said she did not know the specific findings against Aliengena, but an 
FAA investigator said shortly after the crash that the San Juan Capistrano man 
had mistaken a 300-foot taxiway for a 2,700-foot runway and tried to take off 
from it. The investigator also said that Aliengena had loaded the Cessna 210 
Centurion with two more passengers than its six-person limit. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA will now hold informal discussions in Los Angeles with Aliengena, who 
has appealed the proposed suspension. After discussions with Aliengena, the FAA 
will make a final decision, spokesman Paul Steucke said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA could have proposed a suspension of anywhere between 30 days and a 
year, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena can make a final appeal to a National Transportation Safety judge. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena described the FAA investigation as "standard operating procedure." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time any airplane taxies off a runway, there is an FAA investigation. 
It's kind of like an IRS audit," Aliengena said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
However, Aliengena would not comment on the proposed suspension. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Aliengena blamed the layout of the gravel runway and taxiway 
for the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on the last leg of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena's seven-week, 
22,000-mile Friendship Flight. 
</P>
<P>
The eight people on board, including the rest of the Aliengena family and 
observers, had just completed a three-day fishing trip in the small Alaskan 
village of Golovin, a remote town on the western coast of the state. Gary 
Aliengena took control of the plane at Golovin to give his son a rest and had 
planned to head for Nome, which is 90 miles west. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Cessna crashed after a gust of wind lifted the plane off the 
taxiway, which the elder Aliengena was allegedly using as a runway.
