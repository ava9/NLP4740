Accompanying Tony Aliengena on his historic flight around the world will be an 
entourage of 17 people, including his family and journalists from the United 
States and Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Five passengers will be seated in Tony's single-engine Cessna Centurion. The 
other members of the entourage will ride in two chase planes.

<P>
IN TONY'S CESSNA 
</P>
<P>
His father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a certified pilot who owns the plane. 
Aliengena, a real estate investor and truck transportation broker, taught Tony 
to fly and will be riding in the co-pilot's seat for the duration of the 
flight. Aliengena is an avid hunter and fisherman who frequently flies his 
family to its mountaintop retreat in southern Utah. He also helps coach Tony's 
Little League baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Susan Aliengena, 39, a homemaker, has been in charge of such details as 
obtaining Soviet visas for all of the Americans going on the trip. She is 
active in civic affairs in the family's hometown of San Juan Capistrano, where 
she has served as co-chairman of the local PTA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

His 9-year-old sister, Alaina, who attends third grade at Prentice Day School 
in Newport Beach. Alaina helped put together a 1,000-foot "friendship" scroll 
that is to be presented to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.

Saturday to meet the Aliengena family and is to accompany them for the duration 
of the trip.

<P>
Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is going along as an 
official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S. sanctioning body 
for all world and national aviation records. Hagen, a longtime private pilot, 
will be on hand to verify whether Tony remains in sole control of the aircraft 
throughout the 17,500-mile flight.

luggage, will be:

be piloting it for all but one week of the journey. During the third week of 
the trip, when the entourage enters the Soviet Union, Allyn has plans to fly 
commercially back to the United States and attend his daughter's wedding in 
Boston. He will relinquish control of the aircraft during that time to Garry 
Zinger, a private pilot from Visalia. Allyn will rejoin the trip in Moscow.

Guy Murrel, 28, a public relations consultant from Costa Mesa who has been 
serving as coordinator of Friendship Flight '89, the project under which Tony 
is flying around the world. During the flight, Murrel will be coordinating 
press conferences and public events involving the entourage. He will fly part 
of the time in the chase plane and part of the time in a commercial jet to 
prepare advance work.

Two Soviet journalists. Maxin Chikin, of the newspaper Pravda, and Alexei 
Grinevich, of a Soviet magazine, who will be filing dispatches along the way to 
the Soviet Union, where there is already intense public curiosity about a boy 
who would try to fly a plane around the world. The two journalists were due to 
arrive in Orange County on Saturday.
