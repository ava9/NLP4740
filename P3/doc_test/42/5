Joked Robin Knox-Johnston: 'Weather forecasts are a very perishable
commodity.'
Those people anxiously scanning the horizon during the Easter holiday might
well agree. Unlike most holidaymakers, Knox-Johnston had his fingers crossed
for a south-westerly gale. He was speaking by radio from the deck of ENZA
New Zealand, while it was still 1,000 miles away from Brest and the record
for a circumnavigation under sail.
Knox-Johnston was predicting that she would clip four days off the existing
79-day record, and the voyage was completed yesterday in 74 days, 22 hours
and 17 minutes. Bruno Peyron, the French multi-hull star, set the 79-day
record a year ago.
ENZA is the biggest, most powerful catamaran afloat. To achieve such a
remarkable voyage her eight-man crew, led by Knox-Johnston and co-skipper
Peter Blake, have sailed her round Capes Horn and Good Hope at average
speeds close to those of a cross-channel car ferry.
'We're perky but all pretty tired,' reported Blake, skipper of the winning
Steinlager II in the Whitbread race of 1989-90.
'Even the youngest and strongest are puffing and panting when they handle
sails. It's the lack of aerobic fitness.' Our longest walk is 20ft to the
loo.'
Blake spent nearly two weeks confined to his bunk after a serious back
injury in the first month of the trip. Convalescing in such surroundings
makes one think warmly of crumbling inner-city out-patient departments.
'I fell 8ft on to the edge of the chart table,' explained Blake, a broad man
weighing around 200lbs. 'The boat came off the front of a big sea at an
angle of 45 degrees and instantly went from 28 knots to stationary. I was
just coming out of the hatch and just fell backwards.'
He broke a couple of ribs and several muscles tore away from the pelvis.
Initially kidney damage was suspected and medics consulted by high frequency
radio were talking about a helicopter evacuation via Tasmania. 'Fortunately,
Peter's a big strong lad,' said Knox-Johnston, with the sympathy of
Bluebeard.
On the outward leg of the journey ENZA had some of the most exciting sailing
one can imagine. In the first 16 days after leaving Brest she averaged 403
miles a day meaning, in practice, well over 20 knots for much of the time.
Crew-member David Alan-Williams, a naval architect who designed the radical
trimaran Steinlager I for Blake in the mid-1980s, gives the landlubber a
telling analogy for helming ENZA at high speed during darkness.
'Drive down the nearest motorway at night, when it is raining hard, with the
car at maximum speed,' he advised. 'Turn off the headlights and turn sharp
left across the nearest ploughed field.'
He was not able to think of a way to recreate the effect of a lookout in the
bows, calling out drift-ice. Collisions are a sensitive subject aboard ENZA.
A year ago the catamaran's first record attempt was abandoned after it hit a
submerged object. In early 1993 most observers still doubted whether the
Jules Verne Trophy was achievable. To sail around the world non-stop in 80
days or less seemed unimaginable.
The reality is now clear. But the sailors still need luck. At Cape Horn, the
fair weather for ENZA ran out. She was hove-to in the middle of a severe
storm for nearly two days. Blake described it as the worst sea-state he had
seen in 500,000 miles and 20 years of ocean-racing.
'In the Drake Passage off Tierra del Fuego we had 60ft seas on the beam and
all we could do was sit there and roll. It's not too good for
record-breaking,' he observed.
For Knox-Johnston, 55, the circumnavigation has brought back a few memories
and provided a sharp comparison. In 1969, as a 30-year-old merchant navy
officer, he won the solo Round the World race in his wooden ketch Suhaili.
She was built in Bombay by gentle Indian shipwrights using adzes. ENZA came
out of an aircraft factory, constructed largely of carbon-fibre.
'To put the speeds into some sort of perspective, 25 years ago I averaged
four knots around the world,' said Knox-Johnston. 'ENZA has been averaging
more than four times that.'
On just the sixth day after leaving Brest on the Atlantic coast of France,
ENZA logged an extraordinary 520.9 miles in a 24-hour run while reaching off
Sierra Leone. It is claimed as a world record, but has yet to be ratified.
The question everyone is asking is just how fast can a sailing boat circle
the globe? When the Trophee Jules Verne (for breaking 80 days) was first
proposed in France it was ridiculed as unattainable.
'I think 70 days is quite feasible but you'd need a lot of luck with the
weather,' said the naturally-cautious Blake.
Meanwhile, in France, the initial record-breaker Bruno Peyron is working on
design and sponsorship for a 125ft, schooner-rigged catamaran capable of 45
knots. Sixty days around the world is the target in his sights.
