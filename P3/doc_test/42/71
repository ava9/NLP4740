</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After landing in this Soviet Far East outpost, an ocean away from home, 
11-year-old Tony Aliengena did not even have to look out his cockpit to see who 
was awaiting his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, there they were: scores of smiling young children clad in the 
trademark orange neckerchiefs symbolizing membership in the Young Pioneers, the 
Communist Party youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Since entering the Soviet Union June 23, the San Juan Capistrano aviator and 
his entourage have been met every step of the way by the Young Pioneers. 
Leningrad, one of the first stops on Tony's itinerary, featured a tour of a 
so-called Pioneer Palace where children go to study and make handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Tony was shuttled to the headquarters of Pioneer Pravda, a youth 
newspaper that circulates to about 11 million Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rallies at Each Stop 
</P>
<P>
And, in all but one of his nine stops since Moscow, Tony's hosts have whisked 
him out to one of the local Pioneer camps where children spend the summer. 
Sunday night in the eastern Siberian capital of Yakutsk, Tony and his family 
were given center-stage seats in the local Pioneer Palace for a children's 
production that included a play and a group of Bulgarian dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneer children have been rallied out at each stop by local 
representatives of Komsomol, the youth arm of the Communist Party Central 
Committee. Komsomol has been in charge of all Soviet travel arrangements for 
Tony and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony has never seemed to tire of all the adulation by his 
Russian-speaking peers, the adults in his entourage have gotten to the point 
where they grimace at the mere mention of going to another Pioneer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it, no more Pioneer camps," Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, groaned 
after touring a hot, mosquito-infested camp in the woods outside Yakutsk. "We 
can't fly 10 hours a day and then do this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Break From Camps 
</P>
<P>
Aleksie Grinevich, a Moscow journalist accompanying Tony on his trip, 
subsequently promised the Aliengena family a break from the Pioneer camp at 
Monday's stop in Okhotsk. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Pioneer camps in some ways are like Boy Scout and Girl Scout camps 
in America. Children go there for a few weeks each summer and spend their days 
making new friends and engaging in such activities as soccer, gymnastics, 
photography and puppet theater. But there is a crucial difference between the 
American and Soviet camps: at the Pioneer camps, children are subjected to 
Communist revolutionary propaganda at nearly every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Statues and busts of Vladimir Lenin, the country's revolutionary hero, adorn 
courtyards and entrances of camp dormitories. Huge murals of fighting soldiers 
provide the backdrop for slogans like this one found at a camp outside 
Kemerovo: "Pioneers! Be ready for the struggle of the ideas of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
At a children's award ceremony outside Kemerovo, young Pioneers -- smartly 
dressed in white dress shirts, blue pants, skirts and pink and green caps -- 
marched to sounds of a bugle and drums. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are brainwashed in these camps," one Soviet resident said outside 
a camp in the closed city of Kuibyshev, where camp officials speaking through 
loud speakers issued militaristic commands. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a remnant of the Stalin era," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Incentive 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the camps is voluntary, but there is strong incentive for the 
children to participate. The camps, being almost wholely subsidized by the 
state, charge only a pittance to provide care for children during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Pioneers group was founded in 1923 following the country's four-year 
civil war to help relieve working parents of the responsibility of tending to 
their children during the summer, said Luydmila Nepomayashaya, director of the 
camp outside Yakutsk. Almost all women in the country, she noted, have 
full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the Pioneers is open to children ages 7 to 14. After that age, 
they are eligible to become members of Komsomol, which also sponsors some 
summer camps. 
</P>
<P>
Although summer camp is the highlight of the year for Pioneers, the group 
offers year-round activities for children at the Pioneer Palaces, which are set 
up in most Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
At the palaces, which are open to non-Pioneer children as well, youngsters are 
encouraged to go every day after school to study and make dolls and other 
handiwork, said Faina Ardejeva, director of the Pioneer Palace in Yakutsk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Place to Keep Busy 
</P>
<P>
Since Soviet children attend school only half a day, Ardejeva said, the Pioneer 
Palace provides a place for them to keep busy. 
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine if a child were at home the whole winter," she said. "It is a bad 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The children seem to love the camp. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what she liked about the camp outside Yakutsk, Karina Gorbunova, 12, 
smiled widely and said, "Everything. The trees, the birds, the people. It is 
all beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rigor of having to go to a different camp almost every night, Tony 
did not complain. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having flowers, pens and other gifts heaped upon him by the children, 
the camps held another attraction for Tony: the girls. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has become so mesmerized by the sight of so many girls fawning over him 
for autographs, that he judges each camp by the number of girls that most 
attracted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Omsk I liked. There were three girls I liked there," he said. "Kemerovo, there 
was one girl I liked there. At Kuibyshev I also liked a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Through he tired of the camps, Tony's father allowed that they were an integral 
part of Tony's around-the-world-trip, which is based on a friendship theme 
between children of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The camps," he said, "are where the children are."
