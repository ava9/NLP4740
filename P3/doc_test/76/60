Want to know the secret of eternal life? It is whisky, according to James
Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd: 'If a body could find oot the exac' proper
proportion and quantity that ought to be drunk every day, and keep to that,
I verily trow that he might leeve forever, withoot dying at a', and that
doctors and kirkyairds would go oot o' fashion.'
After my first distillery visit on the newly-opened 'Whisky Trail' I was
little wiser about the process. The guide's Aberdonian dialect was
incomprehensible even to a lowland Scot. That was 10 years ago. Today things
are different. Distilleries on the Whisky Trail have multilingual guides and
audio-visual presentations in seven languages, including Japanese. All you
have to get your tongue round is a dram of Highland hospitality: uisge
beatha, Gaelic for the 'water of life'.
There are about 200 distilleries in Scotland - six on the island of Islay
alone - and the greatest concentration is on Speyside, the Grampian region
between Aberdeen and Inverness. The Whisky Trail is a route of about 70
miles, linking eight prominent ones.
Tomintoul, the highest village in the Highlands, is at the southern end of
the circuit. Here the peaty burns which spring from the Cromdale and Ladder
hills supply one of the three ingredients of malt whisky. The others are
yeast and malted barley.
That so many distilleries now have visitor centres is the result of the only
real change in the production process in 150 years: few distilleries still
malt their own barley on site. It makes better economics to buy it in from
specialists, so the empty maltings are put to use as whisky museums, shops
and visitor centres.
A distillery visit will acquaint you with the folklore and peculiar
terminology of whisky. The malted barley is steeped in hot water in a mash
tun and the liquid, known as 'wort', is piped into washbacks where it is
fermented into 'wash'. This is distilled twice; of the second distillate,
only the middle portion is kept: the 'feints' and 'foreshots' are discarded.
Whisky off the still is colourless. Caramel is sometimes added to blended
whisky, but the honey colour of single malts comes from long maturation in
oak casks. Sherry casks are preferred. During this time - eight, 10, 12, 15
or more years - at least a quarter of the spirit is lost by evaporation: the
'angel's share'.
There are things, however, the Scots rarely mention: that tartan and
bagpipes originated outside Scotland, and that the father of the Scotch
whisky industry was an Irishman. In 1831 Aeneas Coffey invented a still
which made continuous distilling possible, enabling whisky to be produced in
bulk.
Whisky is a big employer and a big export earner. At one end is an elaborate
worldwide marketing machine. At the other: skilled trades which, but for
whisky, would have died out. Specialist companies in Glasgow and the
Lowlands make and repair casks (coopering) while coppersmiths maintain the
stills.
'Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown on its seven stills.' From
Dufftown, home to Glenfiddich, we travel clockwise to Tamnavulin (the 'mill
on the hill') and to The Glenlivet, which in 1824 became the first licensed
distillery in the Highlands.
Following the River Avon north we meet the River Spey and the distilleries
of Glenfarclas, Tamdhu and Cardhu. North again is the town of Rothes, home
to Glen Grant, and a few miles east is Strathisla in Keith. Strathisla is
the heart of the famous Chivas Regal.
Also worth visiting is Dallas Dhu near Forres. This distillery was a
casualty of the 1970s recession and was taken over by Historic Scotland as a
museum.
Elsewhere in Scotland, both Dalwhinnie and Blair Atholl are easily
accessible from the A9 Perth-Inverness road, and from Pitlochry it is two
miles to Moulin, where a little whitewashed huddle of cottages called
Edradour forms the smallest distillery in the country, producing a mere 600
gallons a week.
While travelling this north-east corner of Caledonia you might take in the
castle country of Aberdeenshire, and drive the 'Royal Route' from Braemar to
Aberdeen. It follows the Dee, second only to the Spey as a notable salmon
river.
Braemar is not a town to linger in, unless you are a fan of tartan tat. Its
only merit is the cottage where Robert Louis Stevenson stayed in 1881 and
wrote most of Treasure Island. There is a gravestone in the churchyard
inscribed 'John Silver'. Aboyne and Ballater are more dignified: solid
conservative towns.
Short detours off the main A93 bring you to some remarkable turreted
castles. Craigievar is perhaps the best known. Now in the care of the
National Trust for Scotland, this fortified tower house, complete with
plasterwork ceilings and secret passage, is said to have inspired Walt
Disney's drawings for the castle in Sleeping Beauty.
Crathes, just outside Banchory, is another fine castle set in famous formal
gardens. But the main-crop tourists make for Balmoral, an architectural fake
built by Prince Albert around 1850. Queen Victoria had a lifelong love
affair with Deeside. Signposts featuring that well-known silhouette now link
her favourite places on the Victorian Trail.
Victoria was known to be fond of a dram or two. You can follow her footsteps
today to the Royal Lochnagar Distillery. Victoria lived a full life and died
aged 82. Perhaps the Ettrick Shepherd was right.
Maps of the Whisky, Castle and Victorian Trails are available from the
Tourist Information Centre, 45 Station Road, Banchory AB3 3XX, tel.
033-022-066. August is the distillers' holiday month. Visitor centres are
open but you might not see the whole operation in action.
