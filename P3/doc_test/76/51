FT  03 FEB 93 / Queen says Sun broke copyright

THE QUEEN'S solicitors have written to The Sun newspaper threatening legal
action for alleged breach of copyright when the paper published the text of
her 1992 Christmas message two days before it was broadcast.
Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, The Sun's editor, confirmed last night that he had
received a letter from solicitors Farrer &amp; Co giving him seven days to
respond to a demand for damages and costs or face a High Court action.
The letter said printing the text of the Queen's speech on its front page on
December 23 was a 'clear infringement of Her Majesty's copyright'.
The Sun said: 'We shall be vigorously defending the action'.
Buckingham Palace said last night it was not prepared to comment on the
matter at this stage.
Mr Richard Price, a partner of City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett who
specialises in intellectual property law, said the Queen had copyright in
anything that she had written subject to her licensing its publication.
'The question is did The Sun obtain the speech lawfully? If they did they
would effectively be licensed to use it and the Queen would have no case,'
Price said. 'If, however, they obtained it unlawfully or they breached the
terms of the licence by, for example, breaking the embargo then the Queen
would have a solid case for breach of copyright.'
The damages sought by the Queen are not specified in the letter from Farrer
&amp; Co, but the final amount is expected to be in six figures.
One lawyer said last night that the dispute will depend on whether The Sun
published the speech early in order to obtain a commercial advantage over
its rivals.
This is the latest episode in a long-running battle between the palace and
The Sun. The last time the Queen instructed her lawyers to take action
against the newspaper was also over a breach of copyright.
In 1988 the paper paid Pounds 100,000-plus costs in an out-of-court
settlement after it printed a private photograph of members of the royal
family.
The year before, The Sun paid an estimated Pounds 20,000 to charities after
the Queen extracted an apology for the publication of a private letter from
the Duke of Edinburgh to the head of the Royal Marines.
No action has been taken over stories about the marriage of the Prince and
Princess of Wales or over publication of transcripts of alleged phone
conversations between members of the royal family.
