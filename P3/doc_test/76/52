FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Buckingham Palace statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It is announced that, with regret, the Prince and Princess of Wales have
decided to separate.
'Their royal highnesses have no plans to divorce and their constitutional
positions are unaffected. This decision has been reached amicably, and they
will both continue to participate fully in the upbringing of their children.
'Their royal highnesses will continue to carry out full and separate
programmes of public engagements and will, from time to time, attend family
occasions and national events together.
'The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, though saddened, understand and
sympathise with the difficulties that have led to this decision.
'Her majesty and his royal highness particularly hope that the intrusions
into the privacy of the prince and princess may now cease.
'They believe that a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if
their royal highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for
their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their
public duties.'
