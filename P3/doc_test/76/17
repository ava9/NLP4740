AGREEING the Queen's tax bill has not been easy, the Treasury and Buckingham
Palace admitted yesterday.
Two decisions had to be made when setting the amount that the Queen will
have to pay - how much of her wealth would be liable to tax, and which taxes
would be levied on them.
The Queen will only pay tax on her personal income - the palace has gone to
some lengths to separate this fund from income received in her capacity as
sovereign.
For example, the royal art collection will from April 1 be owned by a
charity to be called the Royal Collection Trust.
All income from the civil list, set by parliament and paid by the Treasury,
and all grant-in-aid for the royal palaces, paid annually to the Royal
Household by the Department of National Heritage, will not be liable to tax.
This division is regarded as fair by Mr Richard Lees-Pulley, partner at
accountants Ernst &amp; Young. 'After all, employees get deductions for money
expended for business purposes.'
Another source of income, apart from the Queen's personal wealth, is the
privy purse, which derives most of its revenue from the Duchy of Lancaster.
Its surplus in the year to September 1992 was Pounds 3.6m. Its main purpose
is to meet official expenditure not covered by the civil list, but part of
it is used for private expenditure.
Finally, there is the Queen's personal portfolio of investments. The palace
refused to give any indication of its value, beyond saying that an estimate
of Pounds 100m was 'grossly overstated'.
Income and capital gains tax will be paid in the normal way, subject to a
deduction to cover the official expenditure made by the privy purse. In both
cases this is likely to mean payments at the top rate of 40 per cent.
'I'm surprised that the Queen has put herself into the position of many of
our wealthy clients,' said John Andrews of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'She has
thrown herself into the main tax net.'
However, others argue that since much of the Queen's wealth does not produce
income, the amount she will pay may not be substantial, particularly if she
avoids realising capital gains.
There are many ways in which she could reduce the amount of income on which
she would be taxed. Lees-Pulley suggests going into partnership with Prince
Philip to run her farms and borrowing a large amount to inject into the
partnership. Interest on the loan would be deductible against general
income.
The Queen presumably has no pension and she could make take the
tax-efficient step of making pension contributions, subject to an earnings
cap.
She will also be able to use the unique inheritance tax exemption given to
her as sovereign, in a significant concession made by the Treasury.
This allows her to leave an unlimted amount to her successor - including the
private palaces and entire investment portfolio.
But the Queen and all the royal family are liable to council tax and VAT in
the usual way.
One accountant from a large City firm said the inheritance tax concession
was not startling. Under current rules, business and agricultural property
are effectively exempt from inheritance tax. If being sovereign is regarded
as a business, the inheritance tax exception is similar to the current
rules.
This particular inheritance tax rule however applies only to sovereigns.
Thus, if the Prince of Wales were to die without ascending to the throne,
his estate would be liable to full inheritance tax. If he does become king,
he will be able to make bequests to the next sovereign free of inheritance
tax.
The reasoning behind this concession shows the difficulty in separating the
monarch's official and private lives.
According to a report by the royal trustees, the inheritance tax concession
was allowed because, 'the monarchy as an institution needs sufficient
private resources to enable it to continue to perform its traditional role
in national life, and to have a degree of financial independence from the
government of the day.'
Antony Thorncroft writes: the Royal Collection Trust, which is to be set up
to conserve and exhibit the Queens's pictures, will take possession of the
finest family art collection in the world. It contains 7,000 oil paintings,
30,000 drawings and watercolours, and 1,000 miniatures.
Most of the great names among the Old Masters are in the collection, which
was mainly assembled by King George III, King George IV and Queen Victoria.
The Queen has been generous with loans from the collection, and part of it
is always on view at the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace.
                             *      *      *
THE Queen's income tax return will almost certainly be scrutinised by Inland
Revenue officials housed in a drab post-war building in south Wales, Andrew
Jack writes.
Until last week, when it was acknowledged in a Commons written answer, the
Revenue had refused to admit the existence of the Public Departments
building at Tyglas Road in Llanishen, a suburb of Cardiff.
About a dozen so-called Public Departments are based in different parts of
the complex, which deal with the taxes of civil servants, members of the
armed forces and other public employees.
A VIP unit in Public Department 1 deals with the tax affairs of politicians,
members of the security services and other prominent officials, including
members of the royal family who pay tax. Revenue officials and members of
the Royal Household refused to give details about how much tax the Queen and
the Prince of Wales might pay, arguing that they will be entitled to the
same privacy as other taxpayers.
But the memorandum of understanding for royal taxation released yesterday
shows that they will be subject to interest on any late payments of tax - as
well as refunds if they overpay.
Final details of what financial information the Queen sends to the Revenue
have yet to be determined.
The compilation of the figures will be conducted by the finance and property
services division of the Royal Household. This is headed by Mr Michael Peat,
a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, who was made auditor of the privy purse in
1990, a post held by his family for four generations.
