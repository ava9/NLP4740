IVY LEAGUE APPLICANTS TAPER OFF

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The long-expected "baby bust" and spiraling tuitions are causing a drop in the 
number of applications at some Ivy League colleges and other top-flight private 
schools this year, although most public institutions such as the University of 
California continue to see increases. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University, for example, reports a drop of about 6% in applications 
after a similar decline the year before. At Harvard University, applications 
are down between 5% and 10%, the first decline in 20 years. Dartmouth College 
has seen a decline of about 20%, after a big jump last year and then some 
adverse publicity about political trouble on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly a smaller pool of 18-year-olds, and it's a surprise that we 
weren't down prior to this," Marcia Connolly, Harvard's associate director of 
admissions, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly contributing to the decline is the practice of charging application 
fees that range as high as $50, causing some students to apply to fewer 
colleges, admissions officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, expectations may be coming back to earth. In recent years, 
counselors say, high school seniors have been pressured by parents and society 
to apply to prestigious colleges even if there was little chance of acceptance. 
This year's numbers suggest that is changing. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the decline in applications, admissions officers caution, very 
selective colleges still will accept fewer than one in three applicants and 
sometimes fewer than one in seven. 
</P>
<P>
For the UC system, applications are up slightly this year, to 49,134 from 
48,335 last year. The relatively low cost of a UC education is probably a 
factor in the increase. Not including room and board, fees for in-state UC 
students next year will average $1,577, compared to $13,000 or more at many 
well-known independent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the number of 18-year-olds has been declining since 1980 and will 
continue to drop for a few more years. About 2.76 million students graduated 
from high school last year, and the total is expected to bottom out at 2.44 
million in 1992. Then the so-called Echo Generation comes of age -- the 
children of people born during the post-World War II Baby Boom. That is why UC 
is planning to build as many as three new campuses by the end of the century.
