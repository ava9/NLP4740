FT  13 MAY 91 / Fabian call for overhaul of regulation

THE SYSTEM for regulating utilities should be radically overhauled, with
commissions introduced to hold open hearings on the utilities' plans,
according to a Fabian Society paper published today.
The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory
commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity
industries.
At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give
evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current
regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer.
The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that
commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas
and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing
competition there.
He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics
of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as
telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for
competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate.
Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more
expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be
usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail,
which are becoming more commercial.
