The National Endowment for the Humanities on Wednesday granted $15 million to 
preserve old and rare books, newspapers and other resources that are in danger 
of decaying. 
</P>
<P>
The grants, ranging from $2,800 to $2.5 million, have been awarded to 25 
institutions in 14 states, including the New England Ivy League schools 
Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The money will help libraries to preserve on microfilm books as well as 
photographs, monographs and videotapes used in scholarly research that would 
otherwise disintegrate from acid residues and be lost to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard will receive $1.8 million, which it will use to microfilm more than 
27,000 volumes on American and Italian history it began collecting when the 
library opened in the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The university also will use the funds to microfilm its volumes on pre-Soviet 
Russian law, much of which is no longer available in the Soviet Union, said 
Sidney Verba, director of the university library. 
</P>
<P>
"Our books about pre-Soviet Russian law are consulted by people from all over 
the world, including Russia," he said. "We have many visiting scholars from 
Eastern Europe because these books are either not available or not accessible 
in their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., will receive $409,000, which it plans to 
use to microfilm some 650,000 pages of state newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Yale, in New Haven, Conn., was selected to receive $215,000 for the 
preservation of some 4,000 volumes from its European history collection. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment Chairman Lynne Cheney said the grants are the largest ever allocated 
for preservation projects and will help save some 167,300 volumes nationwide.
