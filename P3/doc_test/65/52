Students at Antelope Valley College now have the opportunity to walk some real 
halls of ivy, thanks to a new program that includes a semester of study in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley is the 11th community college to join the ranks of the Southern 
California Foothills Consortium, which sends faculty and students abroad to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other foreign study programs, the consortium sends its own faculty 
abroad to teach the students. 
</P>
<P>
"These are American community college students attending American community 
college courses taught by American community college professors in London," 
said Rae Yoshida, vice president of academic affairs, who represents the 
college on the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium contracts for academic and support services that include 
classroom facilities, meals, housing, counseling and special cultural and 
social events. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, students are given memberships in the University of London and 
the Imperial College's student union. 
</P>
<P>
To be considered for the program, students must have completed 12 units of 
college with a 2.5 grade-point average by the time they begin the London 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Once in London, they are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 units, including 
three units of British life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
The $4,000 cost of the program includes tuition, air fare, accommodations, 
meals and trips. Consortium officials said financial aid is available. 
</P>
<P>
Other colleges that belong to the consortium include Citrus College, College of 
the Canyons, Pasadena City College and Victor Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1992 the consortium plans to offer a semester in Guadalajara, 
with an emphasis on language. Then, there are plans to add Florence, Italy, and 
Madrid as destinations, Yoshida said. STEVE DELANEY
