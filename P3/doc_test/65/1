Students, teachers and administrators say it over and over again. They write 
it, they shout it: 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth College is not the Dartmouth Review. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Dartmouth College has been portrayed as a battlefield of racism, 
sexism and political intrigue, all reflected in the activities of the 
obstreperous, right-wing Review. 
</P>
<P>
The Review has dominated national news coverage of Dartmouth, but faculty 
members and a broad sampling of students said in interviews that they believe 
the school has been shown in a false light. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience has been that there is no one here that is overtly prejudiced, 
that is overtly racist, that is overtly sexist," said junior Mindy Waterhouse, 
a founder of a campus women's group and an intern at a college-run 
clearinghouse on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Review -- a student-run publication not affiliated with the Ivy League 
college -- is nothing if not overt. 
</P>
<P>
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986, Review staff members used sledgehammers 
to tear down shanties that apartheid protesters had erected on the campus 
green. In August, music Prof. William Cole, who is black, resigned, citing the 
strain of years of being attacked in the Review. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity has taken its toll on the school. Alfred Quirk, admissions and 
financial aid dean, said that black enrollment slipped a bit this year, to 5% 
from 6% of the incoming class of 1,067. He blames the Review contretemps. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a quote from Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" was inserted in the 
masthead of the edition of the Review that was circulated on the Jewish holy 
day Yom Kippur. The Review claims that it was sabotage, and has Hanover police 
investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the source of the insert, it was a campus call to arms. Administrators 
and students denounced the Review, and 2,500 people turned out for a protest 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I was heartened beyond words at the warm, loving response of Dartmouth 
students," said senior Allen Drexel, chairman of the Dartmouth Area Gay and 
Lesbian Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Dartmouth students who have gone silent for a long time with 
regard to the Review's attacks on vulnerable social groups were able to 
collectively absolve themselves of past neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Apathy or fear of disrupting the status quo -- not pervasive bigotry -- is to 
blame for the atmosphere in which the Review has flourished, Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Dartmouth students, rather than being conservative in any partisan 
sense . . . are conservative in the sense of reluctance to rock the boat," 
Drexel said. "In a system that seems to work for them, why even think about 
changing things?" 
</P>
<P>
The Review also flourishes because prominent conservatives such as columnist 
Pat Buchanan and former Treasury Secretary William Simon support it. Simon has 
written that college administrators are persecuting the paper and its staff. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Dartmouth alumni also contribute funds to the Review. Some see it 
as a hedge against liberal influences that forced the rewording of the alma 
mater, "Men of Dartmouth," and abandonment of the school mascot, an American 
Indian. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perception of tradition today is different from what tradition was in the 
past," said student Brian Pierce. "Now we have women on campus, now we have 
native Americans who are against having the symbol because it's offensive to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Tradition should be kept if it enhances the Dartmouth experience now, but if 
it detracts from it, there's no point in clinging to tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth's defenders do not deny that there is prejudice on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Dartmouth is a frightening place to be gay to the same extent 
that the country is a frightening place," Drexel said. "The institution isn't 
perfect. I think everybody will freely admit that." 
</P>
<P>
Trecia Canty, a senior and president of the Afro-American Society, said she has 
at times felt "distinctly uncomfortable" as a black student. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Review's attacks on Cole during her freshman year made the whole 
black community feel under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I perceived it (as moving from) his credibility and qualifications 
as a professor being questioned to all the qualifications of all 
African-Americans, faculty and students alike, being questioned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Canty said, however, that she regards the occasional "insensitive comment" made 
in her presence as "more the result of ignorance . . . than actual intent to be 
hurtful." 
</P>
<P>
Other blacks, such as William Cook, an English professor, credit Dartmouth with 
fighting intolerance, especially under college President James O. Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
Cook attributed Dartmouth's problems at least partly to its location in a small 
town on the borders of two predominantly white states, Vermont and New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens on this campus with respect to race is more important because 
there is no larger black community," he said. "That's why we're getting all the 
attention. The same things happen on other campuses." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate question for women, minority and gay students and faculty members 
is whether they would recommend Dartmouth to others like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely would," Cook said. "We need that critical mass of people to 
constitute a community." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said that while he is glad he came to Dartmouth, it was difficult.
