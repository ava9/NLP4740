Michael Strickland hit nine of 12 three-point shots as Texas Christian upset 
eighth-ranked Arkansas, 81-79, Wednesday night in a Southwest Conference game 
at Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland tied the SWC three-point record set by Texas' Travis Mays last year 
against Rice. All 27 of his points came on three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a couple of shots early, and that kept my confidence level up," 
Strickland said. "I wanted to keep my head up because I hadn't been shooting 
well lately." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' Lee Mayberry had five three-point shots in the second half and scored 
24 points for the Hogs, but it wasn't enough to overcome a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas dropped to 20-4 in losing its second consecutive SWC game after 11 
victories. TCU is 13-10 and 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks lost Saturday, 82-77, to Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Duke 84, East Carolina 51 -- Freshman Billy McCaffrey, starting in place 
of injured Phil Henderson, scored 21 points to lead the Blue Devils at Durham, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (21-4) beat East Carolina (12-15) for the 18th consecutive time. The 
Pirates of the Colonial Athletic Assn. have never beaten an Atlantic Coast 
Conference team, losing 45 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Oklahoma 85, Kansas State 69 -- Skeeter Henry and Smokey McCovery scored 
16 points apiece to lead the Sooners in a Big Eight Conference game at Norman, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 42nd consecutive home victory for Oklahoma (18-3, 6-2). Steve Henson 
scored 21 points to lead Kansas State (14-13, 4-5). 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Illinois 88, Northwestern 75 -- Kendall Gill scored 25 points at 
Champaign, Ill., as the Illini handed the Wildcats their 35th consecutive Big 
Ten road defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini (18-5, 8-5) were in control most of the game, but had to hold off a 
Wildcat rally in the final minutes. Northwestern (8-14, 1-11) pulled within 
74-67 on a three-point shot by Rex Walters with 3:40 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But a basket and free throw by Ervin Small and two free throws by Stephen Bardo 
put Illinois ahead, 79-67, with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 St. John's 90, Seton Hall 81 -- Boo Harvey hit a three-point shot at the 
buzzer to force overtime and then scored 13 of his career-high 40 points in the 
extra session to lead the Redmen in a Big East Conference game at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for the Redmen (20-6, 8-4) after a 
three-game losing streak and gave Coach Lou Carnesecca his 17th season of at 
least 20 victories in 22 years at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
The win also moved the Redmen into a tie with Syracuse for third place in the 
conference. Seton Hall (10-12, 3-8) lost its fifth consecutive game, its 
longest streak since dropping eight in a row during the 1985-86 season. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 81, North Carolina 80 -- John Crotty scored 21 of his 27 points from 
three-point range to lead the Cavaliers in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Crotty made seven of 13 three-point shot attempts as Virginia (15-7, 4-6) 
defeated North Carolina for only the fourth time in 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (17-9, 6-4) had a chance to win, but Scott Williams was long on 
a 15-foot jump shot as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 75, Florida 55 -- Derrick Dennison scored 22 points, hitting nine of 10 
shots, as the Tigers handed the Gators their 10th consecutive loss in a 
Southeastern Conference game at Auburn, Ala.

veteran starters have left the Gators (6-15, 2-11). 
</P>

two minutes and scored a season-high 22 points to lead the Fighting Irish at
