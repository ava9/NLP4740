Notre Dame's Raghib (Rocket) Ismail is "very, very doubtful" for Saturday 
night's game against USC at the Coliseum, Irish Coach Lou Holtz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A deep thigh bruise kept Ismail out of the second half of Notre Dame's 24-21 
loss to Penn State last Saturday at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail injured his right thigh two months ago against Michigan State, 
aggravated the injury a week later against Purdue and didn't play the next week 
in a 36-31 loss to Stanford at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, (the doctors) said he was definitely out of (this week's) game," 
Holtz said. "Rocket refuses to hear that. I'd say the chances of him playing in 
the game are very, very doubtful, but I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell 
you that I have saved a spot on the airplane in the event that something 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Even if he plays, Holtz said, Ismail will not return kicks. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's 28-24 loss to Notre Dame at South Bend, USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich passed for 333 yards, setting school records with 33 completions and 
55 attempts. Last Saturday, in a 45-42 victory over UCLA at the Rose Bowl, 
Marinovich threw a game-winning 23-yard touchdown pass to Johnnie Morton. 
</P>
<P>
So, who will start Saturday against Notre Dame? As they have every week for the 
past month, Marinovich and senior Shane Foley will compete for the job in 
practice, Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to change it now," Smith said. JERRY CROWE
