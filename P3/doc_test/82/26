<P>
Successive victories over Oklahoma and Arkansas have persuaded voters that 
Texas belongs among the Top 25. Two successive losses also convinced them that 
Air Force does not. 
</P>
<P>
After a weekend of upsets, those are among the most dramatic changes in the 
Associated Press college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, who shocked Oklahoma two weeks ago, did the same to then-No. 7 
Arkansas on Saturday by a 24-20 score to move into the ranked teams for the 
first time this season at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson was the other new face in the Top 25 this week, moving back in after a 
week's absence at No. 22 following a 30-10 whipping of previously undefeated 
No. 12 North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air Force lost for the second straight week, 27-9 to Texas 
Christian, to drop to 6-2 for the season and out of the Top 25. The Falcons, 
No. 19 last week, had won their first six games before losing to Notre Dame 
41-27 and to TCU. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, No. 25 last week, also dropped out although the Sooners beat Iowa 
State 43-40. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of other shake-ups in the Top 25 although Nos. 1 through 5, 
led by Notre Dame, remained intact in the weekly voting by the nation's 
sportswriters and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, who have held the top spot since winning the Kickoff 
Classic in August, won their seventh game of the season and 19th in a row 
overall with a 28-24 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish garnered 56 of the 60 first-place votes and 1,496 points overall. 
Miami, idle last week, held the No. 2 spot with 1,424 points, including three 
first-place votes. Colorado, a 49-17 winner over Kansas, was again No. 3 with 
1,379 points, including one vote for first. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, which beat Oklahoma State 48-23, remained fourth, followed again by 
No. 5 Michigan, a 26-12 winner over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the Top 10 includes No. 6 Alabama, No. 7 Pitt, No. 8 Illinois, 
No. 9 Florida State and No. 10 USC. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama moved up four spots with a 47-30 victory over previously unbeaten 
Tennessee, which was No. 6 last week. Pitt moved up one spot after an idle 
weekend, and Illinois jumped five places after a 14-10 victory over Michigan 
State. Florida State moved up five after taking a 22-14 decision over Auburn, 
No. 11 last week. And USC dropped one spot after its loss to Notre Dame at 
South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Top 25 includes No. 11 Tennessee, No. 12 Houston, No. 13 
Arkansas, No. 14 Penn State, No. 15 West Virginia, No. 16 Auburn, No. 17 
Arizona, No. 18 Brigham Young, No. 19 Florida, No. 20 North Carolina State, No. 
21 Texas A &amp; M, No. 22 Clemson, No. 23 Washington State, No. 24 Texas and 
No. 25 South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's 11-25 lineup included Auburn, North Carolina State, Illinois, 
Florida State, Washington State, Houston, Penn State, West Virginia, Air Force, 
Florida, Brigham Young, Arizona, Texas A&amp;M, South Carolina and Oklahoma.
