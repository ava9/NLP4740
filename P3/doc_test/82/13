A Notre Dame senior and former football player has gone to court to fight his 
dismissal from the university after a woman alleged he attempted to rape her, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel M. Quinn, 21, of Encinitas, Calif., has sued Notre Dame for breach of 
contract. He filed a second suit Tuesday against the woman, a student at Saint 
Mary's College in South Bend, alleging slander. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph Circuit Court Judge Terry A. Crone denied Quinn's request Friday for 
a preliminary injunction to block his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick C. Doran, the university's assistant director for residence halls, 
ordered Quinn to leave his dormitory room and the campus by 5 p.m. last Friday, 
court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn was recruited by former coach Gerry Faust and was a reserve outside 
linebacker during the 1985 and 1986 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame sports information director John Heisler said Quinn was suspended 
from the university last spring for an undisclosed reason and was not permitted 
to return last fall. Quinn was permitted to re-enroll in January but was not on 
athletic scholarship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit against the female student, Quinn alleged the woman made untrue, 
slanderous claims when she told officials he attempted to have sex against her 
will and that he beat her and confined her, court documents show. No criminal 
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit against Notre Dame, Quinn alleged breach of contract in that the 
university failed to allow him to complete his degree after signing him to an 
athletic scholarship. He asks the court to order Notre Dame to permit him to 
return and finish school.
