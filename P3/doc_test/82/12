</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the weekend you reluctantly turned down the invitation from the Mount 
Everest Triathlon to stay at home and compete in your own audio-visual 
ultra-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to remote control, a bionic thumb and, of course, extremely limited 
amounts of liquid refreshment, you watched all or part of 12 football games 
over a 60-hour holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But seeing was not always believing. Were Dave Krieg and the Seattle Seahawks 
NFL or Yankee Conference? Should Troy Aikman be inducted into the NFL's Hall of 
Fame this summer, or be made to play an exhibition game first? 
</P>
<P>
If you lined up every serviceman who waved his arms for semaphore's sake in the 
last 50 years and multiplied by 10, would it equal half the arm-waving of the 
Miami Hurricanes? Hey, would you guys prefer to be called the Windmills? 
</P>
<P>
And what about Walshgate? Both Walshes have really good jobs, yet both are 
rumored to be staying and leaving at the same time and both keep issuing 
non-denial denials. 
</P>
<P>
Are they the same person, the product of a brilliant makeup artist? Why not a 
switcheroo? If Steve Walsh coached the San Francisco 49ers and Bill Walsh 
quarterbacked Miami, who'd win? Or care? 
</P>
<P>
Have you seen Bill Walsh? Has he always been freeze-dried? Or does it just look 
that way on TV because he was standing in fog at Soldier Field? 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't? That's next Sunday? Sorry, folks. You run a 60-hour, 12-game 
football marathon, you get a little confused. 
</P>
<P>
But on this, the fourth day of the New Year, things are becoming clear. The NFL 
season isn't quite over, but the college football season seems to be, now that 
Notre Dame has turned down Miami's invitation for an unofficiated, 
come-as-you-are rematch on an abandoned oil rig in the Straits of Hormuz. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Jimmy "Pile It On" Johnson thinks his team got gypped out of the 
No. 1 ranking because it had an apparent touchdown nullified and later 
attempted (and missed) a two-point conversion in its 31-30 loss to Notre Dame 
last October in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
That's just as well. Despite reports that the Miami program is attempting to 
erase its image as class-cutting, trash-talking, street-fighting men who live 
as if above the law, how can you take seriously any school whose students' main 
goal is a suntan? 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, on the other hand, is a No. 1 the world can respect. Unlike 
virtually every other big-time football power, Notre Dame has intentionally 
avoided steps that would further separate its players from the student body. 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame, there is no jock dorm. Football players live in regular dorms 
with the other students. Even share rooms with non-jock students. I'll never 
forget going to South Bend nearly 10 years ago to interview Notre Dame tailback 
and Heisman hopeful Vagas Ferguson and feeling somewhat strange as his friends 
on his hall, itty-bitty and average-sized Notre Dame students, stopped by to 
say hi. 
</P>
<P>
At most other schools, you go to interview a football player, you're surrounded 
only by other meat hooks. Not at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirting, the rampant practice of holding a player (usually a freshman) out 
of competition for a year, is also done at most football factories. Often, 
there's nothing physically wrong with the player, other than that there's 
somebody better playing ahead of him at his position. He's redshirted so his 
body can further mature and grow while he awaits his chance. Of West Virginia's 
five starting interior offensive linemen in the Fiesta Bowl -- average size 
6-foot-3, 271 pounds -- all were redshirted, fifth-year seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Not at Notre Dame. At Notre Dame, a player is redshirted and becomes a 
five-year campus man only if he can't play that season because of serious 
injury. Otherwise, he is expected to play, to study and to graduate. Since 
1965, only seven Notre Dame football players have failed to graduate, a 98.7 
percent rate. That's admirable by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jane Fonda or Morton Downey Jr., Notre Dame is not something many people 
feel neutral about. As the most famous Catholic school in the country, its 
wonderful fight song standard fare for every marching band, its gridiron heroes 
immortalized on the silver screen (by future presidents, no less), Notre Dame 
will always suffer backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say if Notre Dame doesn't cheat, or cheats less than other big-time 
football programs, it's only because its national name is so glorious, its 
allure so magical, that it doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a poor schnook such as Gerry Faust running the program into the 
ground, Notre Dame got great recruits. But then, so do UCLA, USC, Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, Michigan, Auburn and Alabama. For every kid who wants to play at 
Notre Dame, there's a kid who wants to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're going to beat Notre Dame -- the Irish lose few top players to 
graduation this year and figure to be even better next season -- you better get 
lots of kids. That's what makes college basketball inherently more interesting 
than college football -- so many more teams have a chance to be in the top 20, 
if not No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Over the holidays, Alaska-Anchorage beat mighty Michigan in basketball. That 
could never happen in football -- even if Alaska-Anchorage had a team. 
</P>
<P>
In college basketball, you can land two or three blue-chip recruits and have a 
great team. In college football, you have to land 20 or 30, which is why it's 
so much harder to turn a college football program from also-ran to all-star. 
</P>
<P>
If three bright blue-chip basketball players chose Harvard, Harvard could go to 
the Final Four. That could never happen in today's big-time college football. 
</P>
<P>
But what has happened is Notre Dame, with its great name, and a great coach in 
Lou Holtz, is No. 1 for the first time in 11 years. And to the extent that 
people use No. 1 as a guiding light, Notre Dame is not a bad one to have.
