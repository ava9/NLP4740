CHINA'S satellite launch and tracking control agency today fires itself into
a new business orbit: selling ice-cream.
While keeping one commercial eye on outer space, the agency has for some
time been tracking the advance of western consumer lifestyles into China. It
has already diversified into such down-to-earth activities as running hotels
and restaurants.
Now it has formed a joint venture with Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and
retailing group, to treat the Chinese to the delights of Baskin-Robbins ice
cream.
The world's biggest ice cream chain today opens for business in Beijing
where Allied-Lyons is investing Dollars 1m in four stores. Mr Tony Hales,
Allied's chief executive, will perform the opening ceremony according to
Chinese custom.
Baskin-Robbins - recently voted 'America's Favorite Sweets Chain' for the
10th time - does not plan to commemorate the event by adding another exotic
flavour to its roster of 650 recipes, though Neil Armstrong's moon landing
in 1969 was celebrated with Lunar Cheesecake.
China is the 48th country in which Baskin-Robbins has landed since then  -
and the Chinese will have to be content, for the time being at least, with
the usual daily menu of 31 flavours to be found in any of the 3,600 shops
worldwide.
These include the 'sinfully rich' Kahlua 'n Cream, Jamoca Almond Fudge, and
Daiquiri Ice. It would not be surprising, however, if Beijing's customers
were also given a taste of Red Bean ice-cream that has been so successful in
Korea, or the Green Tea flavour that has gone down so well in Japan.
Allied's market research has shown that the usual aversion of the Chinese to
milk and other dairy products does not extend to ice cream. The group also
expects to benefit from the laws which restrict Chinese families to one
child. 'It tends to make parents very indulgent.'
If the stores succeed - and Allied is investing a lot of effort in staff
training to establish a service culture - the group plans to build an ice
cream factory in Beijing, capable of producing 2m gallons a year.
