CRITICISM OF PUBLISHER BY KAHN IS CRITICIZED BY BOOK PUBLISHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was astonished that the Los Angeles Times published and syndicated, without 
any attempt to obtain verification from me, an article as distorted as the one 
written by Roger Kahn about his experience writing Pete Rose's biography. At 
the very least, I'd like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
I am not the greedy monster Roger Kahn portrays me as being. Roger and Pete 
Rose had until spring, 1987, to finish the book (on Rose), but when Roger's son 
died and he asked me for additional time, I most definitely agreed to give it 
to him. Roger and I agreed on a delay of several months; I did NOT respond by 
starting a lawsuit as Roger indicates. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Roger still hadn't finished the Pete Rose book by the end of 1987 
(far past the new deadline), my company did begin to balk. After all, Roger and 
Pete had made a commitment to give us this book, and they had accepted $225,000 
for it. It did not seem unreasonable to expect them to honor the commitment, 
but it turned out that we had to hire lawyers to get the point across. Roger 
said he settled the suit at a "great loss." Well, he fails to mention that we 
agreed to accept repayment of far less than the amount Roger and Pete had 
received from us, so who suffered a greater loss? 
</P>
<P>
Roger curiously complains that the press was misled, but I think if anyone was 
misled, it was Warner (Books, Inc.) in expecting to receive a finished book 
from Roger for the money it paid. Roger says, "The book for Warner never 
worked. Books that begin with naked hype never do." Roger forgets to mention 
that the sole reason it didn't work was that he wrote only a small portion of 
the biography -- barely past Pete's high school days. Roger admits that when 
"the publisher was gone," he sat down with Pete to complete the book. By then, 
he found another publisher willing to gamble that he and Pete would finish the 
book.
