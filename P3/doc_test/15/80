<P>
Baseball's top salary reached another record Wednesday when Roger Clemens, a 
two-time Cy Young Award winner, avoided arbitration and agreed to a three-year, 
$7.5-million contract with the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens will get a $300,000 signing bonus, $2.2 million this season, $2.5 
million in 1990 and $2.5 million in 1991. In addition, he can earn $350,000 per 
year in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The average annual salary of $2.5 million is the largest in baseball history, 
though Clemens will receive only the sixth-highest salary for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But more records may be broken today. Orel Hershiser, the National League Cy 
Young winner and the most valuable player of the playoffs and World Series, is 
scheduled for an arbitration hearing in Los Angeles with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is asking for $2.425 million, which would be the highest salary for 
this year and an arbitration record if he wins. The Dodgers are offering $2 
million in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the players won all three arbitration decisions issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger right-hander Tim Leary was awarded $670,000 by arbitrator Anthony 
Sinicropi rather than the $575,000 offered by the team. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati left-hander Danny Jackson was awarded $1.15 million by Thomas 
Roberts, rather than the $865,000 offered by the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
And New York Mets outfielder Len Dykstra was awarded $575,000 by Frederick Reel 
rather than the $455,000 offered by the club. 
</P>
<P>
Players have won five of the eight cases decided. Texas Rangers outfielder Pete 
Incaviglia and Red pitcher Tom Browning had their cases heard Wednesday. In 
addition to Hershiser, Cincinnati outfielder Eric Davis and San Diego Padres 
right-hander Walt Terrell are to go before arbitrators today. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens said he was happy to avoid arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like going to arbitration because I've heard a lot of negative 
things coming out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens had asked for $2.36 million in arbitration, and Boston had offered $1.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Including a prorated share of the signing bonus, Clemens will get $2.6 million 
each in 1990 and 1991, the highest baseball salary ever. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his salary, Clemens would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the 
Cy Young Award and $50,000 for finishing second. He would get $100,000 for 
winning the American League most valuable player and $50,000 for finishing 
second or third. He would get $50,000 if he is MVP of the AL playoffs and 
$100,000 if he is MVP of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"While it may represent the highest salary per year ever earned in baseball, 
that's not going to last too long in my opinion," said Randy Hendricks, one of 
Clemens' agents. "I believe that salaries are going to continue going up." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly's $2.5 million in 1990 with the New York Yankees was the previous 
high in yearly salary. Eddie Murray of the Dodgers will get $2.8 million in 
1991, but $500,000 is deferred without interest, lowering its present-day value 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
At four years, 142 days of major league service, Clemens reached $2 million 
faster than any other player in history, beating Minnesota's Kirby Puckett by 
five days. Clemens is 78-34 in his major league career and won Cy Young Awards 
after going 24-4 in 1986 and 20-9 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the Red Sox, the key was getting a three-year deal. Clemens would have 
become eligible for free agency after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to commit him to this ballclub for three years and hopefully many 
more," Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said. "He's a major part of our 
ballclub. Equally important, it proves that Roger wants to stay. It's a long 
contract and a big one, so it took some time. We're buying out a year of free 
agency and two years of arbitration. Based on what Gooden got and Hershiser is 
looking for, we felt this was in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden signed a three-year, $6.7-million deal with the Mets last week. 
Hershiser is asking for $8.3 million over three years from the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens' contract was agreed to more amicably than his last one. In 1987, 
Clemens held out and agreed to a two-year deal only after the intervention of 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm just looking to bigger and better things," Clemens said. "I've tried 
to perform at the top level of all the pitchers in the league. I always knew if 
I did the job, everything off the field would take care of itself." 
</P>
