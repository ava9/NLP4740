<P>
Former Orange developer Kent B. Rogers was sentenced Monday to eight years in 
prison and ordered to pay $70.7 million in restitution for his role in a 
massive mortgage-loan scam that has cost Bank of America about $118 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the restitution equals the largest ever levied in a 
bank-fraud case, which was imposed in August against David A. Feldman of Palos 
Verdes, co-defendant of Rogers and the major figure in the complex scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran M. Tevrizian further ordered that a receiver be put 
in charge of Rogers' assets to ensure the restitution, which is to be paid to 
San Francisco-based Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers pleaded guilty earlier this year to two counts of mail fraud for helping 
to sell more than $144 million in mortgage loans to 20 banks and savings and 
loan, almost all of which went into default despite assurances that they were 
completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the indictment of three men including Rogers last May, the U.S. 
attorney's office said the scheme -- whose principal outlet was National 
Mortgage Equity Corp. of Palos Verdes -- was "one of the largest single frauds 
ever perpetrated on our nation's banks and saving and loan associations." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that defendants conspired to coax lending institutions 
throughout the East and Midwest to buy into large pools of mortgages on Sun 
Belt property. They offered the institutions high-interest-bearing mortgages 
and assurances from underwriters that the borrowers could pay their debts. But 
the companies making those representations were linked through the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers and the others were accused of using inflated appraisals, insider 
dealing and worthless guarantees to draw the institutions to invest in 
California real estate during 1982-1984. More than 97% of the mortgages 
defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of America was forced to reimburse institutions who lost money because 
it served as an escrow company and trustee for the bad mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who was indicted with Feldman and George C. Ash of Alta Loma in May, 
1989, controlled several companies involved in the scheme, including two Orange 
companies, WestPac and Nevada Western Pacific Financial. Rogers allegedly 
obtained millions of dollars in loans for providing a variety of fraudulent 
services, including furnishing inflated appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Leslie A. Swain claimed Monday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles that Rogers had pocketed more than $44 million in loan proceeds, 
something his attorney vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Where he spent that money we haven't been able to trace," Swain said. "Mr. 
Rogers is an incorrigible con man." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 51, was previously convicted on bankruptcy fraud charges in another 
case, and Swain said he had even falsified records pertaining to the time he 
spent doing community service, a condition of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is a history of Mr. Rogers thumbing his nose at the justice 
system," said Swain. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, a former Huntington Beach resident now living in Riverside, appealed to 
Tevrizian for leniency. He said he was mostly guilty of poor judgment and 
should have removed himself from doing business with his two co-defendants, 
Feldman and Ash. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian sentenced Feldman last August to 15 years in jail and ordered him to 
pay $70.7 million in restitution. Ash was sentenced to two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry that I didn't disengage from that crowd earlier," Rogers said. "I'm 
not real sure I understood the depth of what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Norman D. James challenged federal claims that Rogers pocketed 
tens of millions of dollars in the scheme, saying his client made less than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone assumes it went in gold bars over to the Marshall Islands and that is 
not true," said James. "Very little profit was made by Rogers, if any." 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian ordered the restitution after an appeal from Bank of America, which 
asked the court to award damages under the federal Victim and Witness 
Protection Act of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
James unsuccessfully appealed for a delay in deciding restitution, citing a 
number of civil suits against Rogers that also seek penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they (Bank of America) need this court to act as a collection 
agent," said James. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was ordered to report to Dec. 19 to begin his prison term. He will be 
eligible for parole in about three years.
