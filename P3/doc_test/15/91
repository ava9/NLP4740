FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Board unlikely to approve CDollars
2.8bn takeover bid - Maclean Hunter/Rogers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and broadcast group,
will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at
least CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.1bn) from Rogers Communications of
Toronto.
Rogers, which is Canada's biggest cable TV distributor, ended two weeks of
speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share, plus a portion of
the proceeds from the sale of MH's US cable TV franchises, if they realise
more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses. Rogers has already bought an 8.3
per cent stake in MH on the open market.
Mr Robert Furse, Maclean Hunter's chief financial officer, said the
company's advisers met over the weekend to consider the Rogers bid and other
meetings would be necessary to formulate a response.
MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval. Expectations that the
Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in
MH's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38. The alternatives being
explored by MH include alliances with other companies, a recapitalisation
and the sale of its cable TV business.
Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the
bid. MH's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless
it is permitted by the board.
Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers' entrepreneurial founder and chief executive, insisted
that the bid would not be raised. 'If we were not successful, someone would
have to come in with an ego, and overpay.' Rogers has arranged financing of
CDollars 2.7bn.
Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group
powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators, as well as the
domestic telephone industry. 'If we're all small and timid in this country,
we'll be overwhelmed,' he said.
