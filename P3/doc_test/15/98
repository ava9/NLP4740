The race for leadership in the turbulent telecommunications industry reached
Canada yesterday with a bid by Rogers Communications, the country's biggest
cable TV operator, for Maclean Hunter, whose diverse communications
interests include a large range of North American cable franchises.
Rogers has yet to disclose details of its offer. Although Mr Ted Rogers,
founder and chief executive, yesterday described the proposal as 'a
strategic merger,' MH said it had received an approach for a 'possible
takeover'.
Rogers has already bought an 8.3 per cent stake in MH, a company which had a
market value of CDollars 2.85bn before the bid was announced. Mr Rogers said
the board would meet on February 4, and would make a statement afterwards.
MH reacted cautiously to Rogers' overtures, saying that it would consider a
specific proposal 'in light of its other strategic alternatives and with a
view to the best interests of MH and its shareholders'.
One analyst said that many MH institutional shareholders might be tempted to
accept an offer if it was pitched substantially above MH's pre-bid share
price of CDollars 13.75. The shares have barely moved in the past two years,
but the analyst estimated that the company was worth over CDollars 20 a
share for a cash-cum-shares bid.
Rogers faces numerous hurdles. The two companies are a study in contrasts.
Rogers, which is closely identified with Mr Rogers, is an aggressive,
highly-leveraged group with leading-edge technology. It has suffered losses
for the past five years, reaching CDollars 124m in the first nine months of
1993.
Besides its 14 cable-TV systems, Rogers controls a national cellular phone
network, and is a part owner of Unitel, the long-distance phone company
which was instrumental two years ago in breaking a monopoly held by local
phone companies.
MH, with a history spanning 107 years, is widely-held and conservatively
managed, with little debt and a steady dividend. For many years, the
backbone of its business was trade publications, newspapers, and local radio
and TV stations. However, its cable-TV franchises in the US and Canada last
year contributed almost 90 per cent of operating earnings, totalling
CDollars 194m.
