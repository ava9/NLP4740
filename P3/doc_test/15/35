It was as unpretentious as it gets at $150 a pop at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were a few ball gowns that cost as much as condos. And yes, a 
couple of floor-length furs swooshed around the auction tables, competing for 
light with this or that outsize gem. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly the crowd at the Interval House's 10th annual auction ball was toned 
down, relaxed, festive. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as a family," said Mary Walton, executive 
director of Interval House, a crisis shelter for victims of domestic violence, 
serving women and children from Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, that extended family numbered 420 people. Guests arrived 
early for a champagne reception and silent-auction bidding. On display near the 
check-in desks were architectural renderings of a proposed new facility for the 
shelter -- an expansion project begun with some of the benefit's proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Armstrong, chairman of the capital campaign drive, estimated the total cost 
of construction at $2 million. "We're just getting started (with the drive) 
tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also hovering near the drawings was Michael Woodley, an architect with Kaufman 
&amp; Broad, the firm that donated the shelter plans and has worked extensively 
with Interval House to upgrade its facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We really like this group, and obviously this is a very worthy cause," said 
Woodley as Walton linked arms with him and smiled. "This is just another stage 
of involvement for us." 
</P>
<P>
That very worthy cause was up about $200,000 after the ball, according to 
Cynthia Courtney, event co-chairwoman, along with Walton, Carol Anne Williams 
and Isa Smashey Rogers. Courtney said about $150,000 of the proceeds will be 
used for operating costs, with the remaining $50,000 going to the building 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Interval House has temporarily housed about 3,000 women and children since it 
was founded in 1980. When the new facility is completed, the shelter will have 
56 beds, according to Adele Faulkner Quinn, a board member and facilities 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn and others mentioned several prestigious awards the shelter received in 
the last year as confirmation of their work -- and a boon to fund raising. 
Among the honors Interval House received as it rounded the corner on its first 
decade: a Department of Justice award for outstanding volunteer legal aid 
programs, a governor's award for outstanding work with victims of crime and a 
Disneyland community service award. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels really good to get those kinds of awards because it says that (we're) 
a solid, legitimate group . . . doing a job that needs to be done," Walton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, dinner was followed by testimonials from women who 
have "graduated" from Interval House, a live auction, then dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The event was dubbed "Le Bal du Bicentenaire" and touted as an "official French 
Bicentennial celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were the consul general of France, Gerard Coste, and his wife, 
Naomi; former California governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and actors Beverly 
Garland and John Schuck. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending: Harlene and Michael Goodrich, Charlene Robinson, Patsy Lopez 
and David Neill, and Tak and Karen Toda (she in a 70-year-old kimono).
