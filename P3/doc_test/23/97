  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] 
released a letter on May 18 exposing the nuclear clamour of the 
U.S. imperialists and its followers, according to the 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. 
  The letter consists of "1. Escalation of `Nuclear Issue'", " 
2. Fabrication of `Nuclear Suspicion'" and "3. Recipe for 
Solution to Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula." 
  Noting that "the nuclear issue" of the North of Korea is an 
offspring of the premediated and systematic anti-DPRK nuclear 
clamor raised by the United States to stifle the North, the 
letter says such criminal moves have been escalated through the 
stages of the rumor about "nuclear development sign," the rumor 
about "nuclear development" and the rumor about "possession of 
nuclear weapons." 
  The rumor about "nuclear development sign" invented by the 
United States boils down to the allegation that "a large-scale 
research complex surrounded by anti-aircraft guns was found in 
Yongbyon, which is classified as nuclear facilities designed to 
manufacture nuclear bombs," "a 30 mw reactor is in operation, 
which seems to be for military use as there is no power cable 
there," "a newly-built long building is guessed to be 
reprocessing facility" and "the new puddles on the shores of the 
River Kuryong are surmised to be traces of high explosion test." 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, told a press conference in Beijing that the 
nuclear inspection proved the nuclear facilities of the North 
are used for peaceful purpose and that they "have found no 
reliable evidence of nuclear arms development" in the North. 
  Failing to deceive the world people with the rumor about 
"nuclear development sign," the United States summoned IAEA 
inspectors to Washington to frame another plot, the rumor about 
"nuclear arms development." It spread the rumor that it "found 
out that North Korea reprocessed nuclear fuel in [words 
indistinct] and early 1992" and instigated IAEA officials to 
suddenly insist on "inconsistencies in principle" between the 
DPRK's initial report and the result of the IAEA's measurement 
in the quantity of plutonium extracted from fuel rods. 
  With the rumors about "nuclear development sign" and 
"nuclear 
arms development" ineffective, the United States resumed the 
once suspended Team Spirit nuclear war exercises and egged the 
IAEA on to try to force the North to accept "special inspection" 
of its military sites. Then, it began spreading another false 
report that the North "has produced nuclear weapons and hid 
them." In an attempt to justify the false report, the United 
States, availing itself of the name of Russia's KGB and the 
British intelligence agency, alleged that the North 
"manufactured small nuclear bombs and concealed them in a silo." 
  The United States is now trying to justify the rumor about 
"the North's possession of nuclear weapons" spread by itself. 
  The letter says the U.S. and South Korean rulers have left 
no 
stone unturned in their efforts to accuse the North of "nuclear 
arms development." 
  "The nuclear suspicion" against the North was fabricated and 
spread by the U.S. intelligence authorities. It started in July 
1989 when a false information that "the North's nuclear arms 
development facilities were snapped" by a U.S. paper THE 
WASHINGTON POST. In a bid to give objectivity and credibility 
to it, the U.S. intelligence authorities opened to the public in 
September 1989 a photograph allegedly taken by the French 
orbiting observatory spot. 
  Nuclear experts, however, said the picture taken by the 
intelligence satellite lacks clearness for distinguishing the 
shapes, holding that the capability of the satellite was 
exaggerated. 
  Director of the U.S. CIA James Woolsey is now alleging "the 
North not only has enough plutonium for manufacturing a nuclear 
bomb but also will have plutonium enough to produce an A-bomb at 
intervals of four or six weeks by next year when it has a 25 mw 
reactor far bigger than the existing one." 
  Informations concocted by intelligence services are 
reproduced on an enlarged scale by government mouthpieces. 
  As regards the North's "nuclear issue," government 
mouthpieces of South Korea and the West described the 5 mw 
experimental conversion reactor in the North as "a 30 mw 
reactor" (South Korean CHOSON ILBO and HANKUK ILBO), the two 
commercial reactors now under construction as "completed 
reactors for the production of plutonium" (TONG-A ILBO) and the 
radiochemical laboratory under construction as " reprocessing 
facility in operation" (the U.S. ABC and Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN.)

  When the result of the first nuclear inspection proving that 
the North's nuclear facilities were peaceful ones was published 
at a meeting of the board of governors of the IAEA in June 1992, 
the South Korean ambassador in charge of atomic energy 
cooperation told reporters "the suspicion was proved." Then, 
nearly all the venal papers of South Korea and no small number 
of foreign media flashed the false news that "the North's 
nuclear facilities have been proved to be for the production of 
nuclear weapons and to be reprocessing facilities." 
  THE WASHINGTON POST carried a groundless report that North 
Korea was "moving the reprocessing facilities in Yongbyon with 
trucks," while TONG-A ILBO said North Korea was "operating 
uranium-enriching facilities." 
  Today the Heritage Foundation of the United States, the 
technical information centre of Tokai University of Japan, the 
Defense Development Institute of South Korea and other 
unprincipled institutes and pretended scholars are inventing 
various presumptions to spread "nuclear suspicion," branding all 
the peaceful nuclear facilities of the North as military ones. 
  They are now spreading various rumors -- the graphite 
reactor 
is for the production of nuclear bombs because it can turn out 
more plutonium than other reactors. 
  While circulating such rumors, the U.S. authorities have 
appeared on the stage to make "the North's nuclear issue" a 
serious, pending political issue. 
  The U.S. authorities formed a high-level policy mediation 
team, a permanent organization for consulting and adjusting the 
positions of departments in the administration to deal with "the 
nuclear issue of the North" on the governmental level by closely 
combining diplomacy with military. 
  Meanwhile, the United States uses the South Korean and 
Japanese authorities as its lackeys in politicizing "the nuclear 
issue of the North." It summoned No Tae-u to Washington in July 
and September 1991 and ordered him to deal with "the nuclear 
issue" as a pending issue in inter-Korean relations. The South 
Korea-U.S. summit talks in Seoul in July 1993 and in Washington 
in November 1993 Clinton decided with Kim Yong-sam, to further 
strengthen "close cooperation and cooperation system between 
South Korea and the United States." 
  The United States dispatched secret envoys to Tokyo in March 
and May, 1991, to urge Japan to take a joint action with South 
Korea and the United States in the negotiations for diplomatic 
relations with the North and restrain from economic assistance 
until the North received nuclear inspection. At the summit 
between Bill Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa in February last, 
they came to an agreement that resolute measures including 
sanctions are necessary unless the North accepts nuclear 
inspection." 
  Under the manipulation of the United States, the South 
Korean 
and Japanese authorities have acted a shock brigade in the 
nuclear clamour. 
  The United States has enlarged "the nuclear issue of the 
North" as an international issue by mobilizing its allies with 
the "cooperation system" of the U.S., Japan and South Korea as 
the axis and international organizations under its influence. 
  After bringing "the nuclear issue of the North" to the 
United 
Nations by abusing the IAEA, it had an unreasonable "resolution" 
demanding nuclear inspection of the North adopted at the 48th UN 
General Assembly session in November last year. And it invented 
"a presidential statement" of the UN Security Council on March 
31, 1994, demanding the "completion of inspections." It 
intensified pressure upon Pyongyang, setting a deadline and 
threatening many- sided "sanctions" against it. 
  "The nuclear issue" fabricated by Washington is "a means of 
stifling socialism of the North by collective sanctions as the 
"strategy of peaceful transition" is impossible to destroy it" 
and "nuclear inspection" is "preliminaries for detecting the 
North's military facilities to disarm, incapacitate and open it 
under the pax-Americana order." 
  The United States must not try to use the fictitious 
"nuclear 
issue of the North" for destroying the North's socialism, 
selling arms to South Korea and maintaining its troops and 
nuclear weapons in South Korea but choose package solution for 
resolving the Korean nuclear problem and normalizing ties with 
the DPRK as it announced to the world in the DPRK-USA joint 
statement.
