  [Text] Washington, May 19 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are continuing their activities 
at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel 
rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the 
area, it was reported Thursday [19 May]. 
  Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to 
separate 
the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later 
inspection have not been confirmed, sources said. 
  The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the 
inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added. 
  The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North 
Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other 
way, they said. 
  "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the 
reactor 
are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks," 
one source said. 
  Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is 
difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they 
said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States 
and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude. 
  Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the 
reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security 
Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.
