  [Text] Vienna, May 14 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) will send a five-member inspection team to 
North Korea on Sunday [15 May] to conduct a weeklong inspection 
of a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon starting Tuesday, an 
IAEA spokesman said Saturday. 
  The IAEA needs the additional inspection now that North 
Korea 
has started preparatory works for exchanging spent fuel rods at 
its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers 
north of Pyongyang, the IAEA spokesman said. 
  North Korea notified the IAEA of the start of preparatory 
works in its letter on Friday, he said. 
  If North Korea commits a serious violation of the nuclear 
safeguards agreement, such as peeling seals off the fuel rod 
container, the team may suspend inspections, the spokesman said. 
  IAEA sources said the international nuclear watchdog could 
determine if North Korea has exchanged fuel rods by monitoring 
records from cameras and counters installed at the nuclear 
reactor. 
  The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of allegations that 
North Korea is pushing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
  In February, the United States and North Korea agreed to 
resume high-level talks on condition that Pyongyang allows full 
inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites. 
  But North Korea in March denied IAEA inspectors' access to 
the laboratory in Yongbyon, considered crucial in verifying 
whether fissionable radioactive material had been diverted to 
make nuclear bombs. 
  On March 1, the United Nations Security Council adopted a 
presidential statement calling on North Korea to allow full 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  This time the IAEA inspectors will conduct necessary checks 
at the nuclear facility, including radiation measurement, the 
spokesman said. 
  The IAEA has repeatedly insisted that if North Korea goes 
ahead with the fuel rod exchange at the nuclear reactor without 
the supervision of IAEA inspectors, it would constitute a 
violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY said in a dispatch from 
Seoul that North Korea told the IAEA it is regrettable that 
Pyongyang had to start changing fuel rods without IAEA 
inspections. 
  North Korea, however, made clear that there is room for 
negotiations, saying that there are a lot of opportunities as 
North Korea has just recently begun replacing the fuel rods, 
according to the YONHAP report. 
  The U.S. has also said that it would suspend a third round 
of high-level negotiations with North Korea if it changes the 
fuel rods without U.N. inspectors present. 
  North Korea said Thursday that the replacement of the 
uranium 
fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986 
and is almost exhausted, is a very urgent matter that cannot be 
deferred indefinitely. 
  The IAEA maintains that the sampling and analysis of the 
fuel 
rods would provide information on the North Korean nuclear 
program and any past activities in retrieving plutonium from 
spent nuclear fuel.
