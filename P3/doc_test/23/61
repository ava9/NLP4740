  [Text] New York, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on 
Tuesday [24 May] agreed with U.S. plans to go ahead with a third 
round of high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva in early 
June. 
  The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be 
more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed 
the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special 
envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met 
Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. 
  Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go 
along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and 
decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended 
last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the 
stalemate. 
  In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement 
on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future. 
  Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as 
the 
three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North 
Korea in the future, the sources said. 
  The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be 
forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if 
North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental 
nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang 
without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel 
rods. 
  Takeuchi told reporters that the three exchanged views on 
the North Korean matter, describing the current situation as 
"knotty," but added that if the talks can be held, "I look 
forward to progress" on the issue. 
  Takeuchi said that he had received no information that North 
Korea has halted its withdrawal of the spent fuel rods from the 
Yongbyon reactor as demanded by the IAEA last week. 
  Hearing that North Korea started removing the rods last 
week, 
the U.N. nuclear watchdog demanded a temporary halt to the 
operations in order to determine if any radioactive material had 
been diverted to military purposes. 
  A refusal to halt the operations could prove to be an 
obstruction to the staging of the talks, and according to 
diplomatic sources, Gallucci said that it would be a problem if 
North Korea proceeded with the fuel rod removal.
