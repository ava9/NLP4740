  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu agreed 
Monday [4 April] that China must play a larger role in 
encouraging North Korea to remove suspicions about its nuclear 
program. Hosokawa told Han that China's role will be crucial in 
tackling growing threats arising from Pyongyang's alleged 
nuclear weapons development program, a Foreign Ministry official 
said. 
  The premier also spoke of the need to seek cooperation from 
Beijing in persuading Pyongyang to allay international concern 
that it is developing nuclear weapons capability at its 
facilities in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the capital, the 
official said. China is North Korea's last major ally. 
  During the 35-minute meeting, Han remarked that China 
appears 
ready to play a more active role than before, the official said. 
  Han told Hosokawa that in addition to close contact among 
Japan, the United States and South Korea, the roles of China, 
Russia and other members in the UN Security Council will be 
important in helping resolve the issue. On Sunday, Han agreed 
with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that China has a 
vital role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  They also confirmed their intention to monitor how Pyongyang 
responds to the UN Security Council's call for it to accept full 
inspections of its suspected nuclear sites. 
  The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a 
statement urging North Korea to allow the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete checks of its nuclear 
facilities. The IAEA had reported that it was not allowed to 
carry out certain measures at a North Korean radiochemical 
laboratory. 
  After emerging from the session with Hosokawa, Han declined 
to reveal exactly what he discussed with the premier on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear program. "I cannot make a simple 
statement now," he said. 
  Han will return home later Monday at the end of a 
three-country trip to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Before flying to Tokyo, he visited China and the U.S. to seek 
cooperation on the issue.
