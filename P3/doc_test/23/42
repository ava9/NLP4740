<H5>  Anything Can Be Hidden in </H5>
Catacombs 
  In the summer of 1990 Eduard Shevardnadze, who was foreign 
minister at the time, conducted exhaustive talks with the North 
Koreans, trying to explain to them the necessity of Moscow's 
imminent diplomatic recognition of Seoul. His Pyongyang 
counterpart, Kim Yong-nam, was under orders from Kim Il-song to 
employ every means to block Moscow's move, a move which 
undermined the leader's [vozhd] concept of the existence of a 
"sole legitimate state" on the Korean peninsula -- the DPRK. 
Having exhausted the range of diplomatic devices, Kim Yong-nam 
produced what was intended to be the trump card: Pyongyang 
"will consider itself free of all commitments not to create 
nuclear weapons" if Gorbachev starts cooperating with the "South 
Korean puppets." 
  Shevardnadze countered the blackmail bid in his 
characteristic emotional and trenchant manner. He attached no 
significance to the threat. Meanwhile Moscow did not believe in 
the seriousness of reports that American spy satellites had 
detected installations in North Korea for reprocessing nuclear 
fuel waste into plutonium. 
  The Russian intelligence service continues to deny today 
that 
Pyongyang has installations for manufacturing nuclear weapons. 
Our experts think that the North Koreans are banking on 
producing highly accurate intermediate- and long-range missiles. 
They can be equipped with chemical, bacteriological, or 
conventional warheads. These systems are sufficient, in our 
experts' opinion, for the purpose of "nuclear deterrence." 
There are nine nuclear electric power stations operating in 
South Korea, and a missile strike on them would be equivalent in 
its effect to a nuclear raid. 
  Our military specialists are struck by the naivete of the 
Americans in trusting the information supplied by their 
satellites: The North Koreans would never build a secret 
installation in the open. The North Koreans conceal all their 
strategic plants either underground or deep inside mountains, 
and these facilities are like whole cities on many levels. The 
North Koreans have built up a wealth of experience in this 
sphere since the war in the fifties. 
  There is nothing surprising in the fact that our and the 
American intelligence services differ in their assessments, 
although it may be that this is not a case where the truth will 
emerge out of controversy. CIA Director James Woolsey obviously 
has strong grounds for stating that there is proof that the DPRK 
has at least two nuclear weapons. According to the U.S. 
intelligence department chief, Pyongyang will be producing 10 to 
12 nuclear weapons per year in the future. 
<H5>  Cat-and-Mouse Games </H5>
  Pyongyang signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons in 1985. Just seven years later the North 
Koreans permitted inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] to carry out monitoring procedures. 
  IAEA representatives arrived in Yongbyon and made the North 
Koreans acknowledge that they had produced 98 grams of plutonium 
"for research purposes" from reactor waste in 1990, but 
investigation then established that this was not produced at the 
time indicated by the North Koreans. The inspectors threw up 
their hands in despair: How could they believe the statements 
that the North Koreans had no interest in plutonium -- it was 
deception. What they were doing in Yongbyon all the time there 
was no verification taking place could only be guessed at. 
  Another critical situation arose quite recently. It served 
as grounds for the IAEA to ask the UN Security Council to 
examine the possibility of introducing sanctions agaianst the 
DPRK. 
  A while ago the IAEA received information that in 1989 the 
Yongbyon reactor had been shut down in unscheduled fashion for 
100 days. The inspectors suspected something untoward: The 
shutdown of the reactor could have been used to remove some of 
the fuel rods and extract 10 to 16 kg of plutonium from them. 
The CIA immediately calculated that North Korea would be able 
to make four or five nuclear bombs with this plutonium. 
Patience was exhausted. An indignant Secretary of State 
Christopher demanded firm and resolute measures. Kim Il-song 
should not escape sanctions. 
<H5>  What Is In the Leader's Mind? </H5>
  A trade blockade is futile without the agreement of China, 
which supplies the DPRK with 70 percent of its oil and 60 
percent of its food. Beijing opposes sanctions against its 
ally. Logic suggests that in the event of a vote in the 
Security Council China would use its veto and block sanctions. 
Kim Il-song calculates that this is indeed what would happen 
and thus rests assured. Meanwhile he is making threatening 
gestures, stating that the DPRK will respond to a trade war by a 
real war. 
  What, then, is to be done about Kim Il-song? The first 
option is to introduce sanctions in one way or another and, if 
China refuses to go along with this, to do so sidestepping the 
Security Council, risking a conflict on the peninsula provoked 
by the North Koreans, with consequences which are difficult to 
guess. The second option is to resign ourselves to Kim 
Il-song's concealing plutonium for military purposes from the 
IAEA. 
  This latter scenario is absolutely unacceptable. Not just 
because it allows (even if only theoretically) the emergence of 
a new nuclear power -- the very idea of it fills you with dread. 
The most dangerous thing -- Washington, Moscow, Seoul, and 
Beijing are agreed on this -- will be the undermining of the 
international arrangements governing nonproliferation. And that 
will be a real nightmare. 
  But the first option is frightening by virtue of its 
unpredictability. 
  Observers come to the discomforting conclusion that there 
will be no sensible solution to the Korean nuclear problem at 
all as long as the present regime, which is concerned about its 
own survival and the upcoming transfer of power from Kim Il-song 
to his son, Kim Chong-il, exists in Pyongyang. Even if 
Washington does give diplomatic recognition to Pyongyang -- this 
is precisely what Kim Il-song is seeking, offering to freeze 
nuclear developments in exchange -- North Korea will find 
another way of keeping some other kind of "infernal secret" for 
new bargaining or blackmail purposes.
