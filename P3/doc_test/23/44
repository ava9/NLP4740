  [Text] Washington, April 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea 
reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at 
Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) has no right to inspect them. 
  "About the two military sites, there was no inspection 
allowed. It's not within the authority of the IAEA to inspect 
military sites," said Maj. Gen. Kim Yong-chol of the North 
Korean People's Army in an interview with America's Cable News 
Network (CNN). 
  In a dispatch from Pyongyang, CNN identified Gen. Kim simply 
as a senior military official. The taped interview was aired in 
the United States Monday night. 
  CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican 
president who was visiting Pyongyang, presumably for North 
Korean President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday last Friday. 
  Gen. Kim reiterated the North Korean position when CNN's 
Beijing correspondent, Mike Chinoy, asked why the Stalinist 
state refuses to let the IAEA inspect its facilities at the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex if it has no intention, capability or 
desire to develop nuclear weapons. 
  "Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt 
with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament 
between the two sides," Kim said. "The authority the IAEA was 
given is to inspect peaceful nuclear facilities." 
  Asked if North Korea cooperates militarily with countries 
like Iran, Syria or Libya, Kim said, "that is a question which 
is directly related to the distortions and the bad rumors about 
our country which are all fabricated, made up, by the West." 
  North Korea, as an independent state, has a right to 
maintain 
multilateral relations including military cooperation with other 
countries. 
  "There is no limited scope in the cooperation," Kim said. 
"If 
it suits our interests, we do it. If it doesn't, we don't do 
it."
