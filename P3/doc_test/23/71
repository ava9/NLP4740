<F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Is the `Special Inspection' Issue?"] </F>
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue was caused by the 
demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for 
special inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two unreported 
facilities [sisol] in Yongbyon, North Korea. Without the two 
facilities, the quarrel for the past year over North Korea's 
nuclear development would not have occurred. Now when a 
conclusion of U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear 
issue is reportedly near-at-hand, the special inspection issue 
has been placed outside the argument. 
  Is the nuclear issue really solved if special inspections 
are 
not addressed? The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can 
be held, but cannot be considered progress in guaranteeing North 
Korean nuclear transparency. 
  Nuclear inspections by the IAEA begin with specific 
inspections [tukchong sachal]. A specific inspection means 
confirming a list of nuclear materials reported by a signatory 
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by comparing it 
with an on-the-spot inspection. When the IAEA fulfills a 
specific inspection of a NPT signatory, the signatory has to 
inform the IAEA of the design of its facilities engaged in 
preservation and research of nuclear materials. After receiving 
such information, the IAEA installs monitoring video tape 
recorders to inspect the facilities. We call this ordinary 
inspections [tongsang sachal]. 
  Inspections of only reported facilities are not sufficient 
nuclear inspections. The inspection of unreported, suspicious 
facilities can help in guaranteeing each country's nuclear 
transparency. This is a special inspection. After inspecting a 
nuclear waste specimen of North Korea in the course of its 
specific and ordinary inspections of the country, the IAEA 
suspected that high-density plutonium had been extracted without 
being reported. This is why the IAEA wants to see the North 
Korean facilities. 
  The United States said that it had given up the special 
inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities because it 
wanted to maintain the continuation of at least ordinary 
inspections. It also said that it may find a resolution of 
special inspections during the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
talks. 
  Judging from the North Korean attitude shown up to the 
present time, I cannot help but point out that there is no 
likelihood of the success of the U.S. approach. North Korea 
agreed to allow ordinary inspections of its seven reported 
facilities and to hold South-North working-level contacts for an 
exchange of envoys in return for the resumption of high-level 
talks with the United States and suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise. This is nothing but a one-sided concession made by 
the United States because it will enable North Korea to assume a 
highhanded attitude in South-North working-level contacts 
without allowing practical nuclear inspections and to hold 
negotiations with the United States on various pending issues -- 
such as the establishment of diplomatic relations, the issue 
concerning light-water reactors, and the issue of signing a 
peace treaty -- after the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. 
  The United States cannot exercise overall nuclear control 
over North Korea by this approach. It is nothing more than 
overlooking the nuclear development of unreliable countries. It 
will obviously strike a serious blow to the plan for the 
limitless extension of the term of the NPT, which is supposed to 
expire in 1995. The United States will have difficulties in 
leading the new world order of the post-cold war era if it loses 
the confidence of Asian countries, which are sensitive to the 
nuclear issue.
