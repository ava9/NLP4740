  [Text] According to a Chinese source on 21 January, North 
Korea has been secretly extracting a considerable amount of 
plutonium while it held nuclear negotiations with the United 
States, and that it is highly possible that North Korea has 
already produced a small nuclear bomb and is hiding it in an 
underground warehouse. This source well-versed in North Korean 
affairs said: "I recently heard from a senior North Korean 
official that North Korea is hiding nuclear weapons in an 
underground warehouse in the mountains near Pyongyang and that 
any thorough inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities [haek 
sisol] by the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency will fail to locate them."
