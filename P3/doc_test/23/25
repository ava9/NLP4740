  [Text] Vienna, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has extended 
visas for the two inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) who remained at the nuclear complex in Yongbyon, 
IAEA sources said Monday. 
  The sources interpreted the visa extension shortly ahead of 
an expected meeting between U.S. and North Korean diplomats 
Tuesday as a conciliatory gesture from Pyongyang to set the tone 
for the talks. 
  The inspectors' visas, which would have expired at the end 
of 
this month, were extended for two weeks, they said. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song promised former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter during unofficial talks in Pyongyang last 
week he would allow the two officials to stay. 
  Commenting on Carter's trip, U.S. President Bill Clinton saw 
"hopeful signs" earlier Monday for an end to the standoff over 
North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  Speaking in a live TV interview, Clinton said the U.S. will 
resume high-level talks with North Korea provided Pyongyang 
keeps its promise to freeze its controversial nuclear program. 
  Upon return from Pyongyang Carter declared Sunday that "I 
personally believe the crisis is over" and that Kim "wants to be 
sure" the crisis on the Korean peninsula is over. 
  North Korea in may started to remove the fuel rods in its 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang, without the required agency supervision. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog pulled out its team in late May 
after negotiations with Pyongyang broke down over the 
inspectors' demand to be able to select, segregate and secure 
some 300 fuel rods for measurement needed to verify whether 
nuclear material had been diverted in the past. 
  In response to a request by the U.N. Security Council, the 
agency, however, retained two inspectors to report on the 
removal activities. 
  They have since been observing the fuel removal and were 
allowed to continue checks of surveillance cameras at Yongbyon 
facilities. 
  According to their report, reactor workers have meanwhile 
discharged all spent nuclear fuel rods, but have not yet started 
to load the reactor core with new ones.
