  [Text] Vienna/Seoul/Pyongyang -- In the future, North 
Korea wants to discuss its nuclear program only with the United 
States and no longer with the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency]. This was confirmed on the sidelines of the meeting of 
the Board of Governors of the IAEA in Vienna today by the head 
of the North Korean delegation, Embassy Counselor Yun Ho-chin. 
The communist-ruled country is being accused of building atomic 
bombs. However, Pyongyang has not permitted the IAEA to carry 
out comprehensive inspections in its nuclear center at Yongbyon. 
Thus, the United States, South Korea, and Japan are considering 
supporting UN sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang has 
reacted with the announcement that sanctions would be considered 
a declaration of war. 
  South Korea's head of state, Kim Yong-sam, who sees a threat 
to world peace, called a meeting of the country's National 
Security Council, which will convene in Seoul on Wednesday [8 
June]. In view of possible sanctions, the body wants to explain 
the attitude of the United States, of Russia, China, and the UN 
Security Council on the nuclear issue. It has so far become 
clear that Moscow and Beijing would reject sanctions. As the 
South Korean state news agency YONHAP reported today, Kim 
described North Korea's nuclear program as a threat to world 
peace. He called on the neighboring communist state to give up 
its "ruthless development program for nuclear weapons." 
  Prior to the meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, 
the director general of the North Korean Atomic Agency, Pak 
Yong-nam, stressed in a letter to IAEA head Hans Blix that his 
country no longer feels bound by the conditions stipulated by 
the IAEA if the IAEA should continue to exert pressure on North 
Korea. "We really doubt whether the nuclear issue can be solved 
through further talks with the IAEA," the letter reads. "We no 
longer want to settle the problems within the framework of the 
nonproliferation treaty, but in the third bilateral round of 
talks with the United States," Pak Yong-nam added. The diplomat 
stated that it would be better to resolve the technical problems 
first and then the political problems. 
  In the letter that is available to DPA, Pak Yong-nam wrote 
that, contrary to earlier statements by Blix, it is naturally 
possible to find out whether North Korea has removed the 
plutonium required for the production of nuclear weapons when it 
exchanged the fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor at 
Yongbyon. He also reaffirmed North Korea's view that it wants 
to maintain a special position within the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, after it announced its resignation 
about one year ago and later suspended this move. 
  If the IAEA should refer the North Korean nuclear issue to 
the UN Security Council, "we no longer feel bound by the IAEA 
and cannot but initiate the next step of our peaceful nuclear 
activities," Pak concluded his letter. The crisis that broke 
out one year ago exacerbated recently as a result of North 
Korea's unauthorized disposal of fuel rods from its reactor. 
Thus, the IAEA cannot ascertain whether plutonium was removed 
for the construction of atomic bombs during the disposal.
