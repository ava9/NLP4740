  [Text] Beijing, May 24 KYODO -- Two inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing on 
Tuesday [24 May] for Pyongyang where they will join three other 
inspectors monitoring the ongoing refueling of a North Korean 
nuclear reactor. 
  Delegation leader Perricos Demetrius said that technical 
discussions with North Korean officials are expected to last two 
to four days and that all five IAEA inspectors hope to be coming 
out together. 
  The three-member IAEA team arrived in Pyongyang last week 
and 
immediately reported that refueling of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon 
experimental nuclear reactor had begun. 
  It is widely believed that discussions will center on 
allowing the IAEA to inspect and measure fuel rods in order to 
ascertain whether or not any fuel has been diverted to a 
suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  The arrival of the two IAEA inspectors coincides with 
renewed 
talks at the United Nations in New York concerning the 15-month 
nuclear impasse between the U.S. and North Korea.
