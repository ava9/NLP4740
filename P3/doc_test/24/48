The curveball was giving Patrick Henry High School catcher Mike Coleman fits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just had a lot of trouble hitting left-handers' curveballs," Coleman said 
after Wednesday's 15-3 victory over Monte Vista, which put the Patriots into 
the AAA Division semifinals of the 39th Mike Morrow/Lions tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's problem is now in the past tense. He pulled two home runs over the 
right-field fence against two left-handers Wednesday at Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
And both times, he picked on a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's first home run came in the second on a 1-0 pitch. It was the second 
consecutive curve Jason Beckstrand had tried to sneak by him. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognized the spin on the second pitch," Coleman said. "I didn't think he'd 
throw me another curve." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman waited on it and drove the ball high onto the bank beyond the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Coleman hit a two-run homer off Jack Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was guessing curveball all the way there," Coleman said. "And once I 
recognized the spin, I just waited on it and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Coleman didn't need to finish the sentence. The ball ended up near where the 
first one had landed, some 25 feet up the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry also got home runs from Brian Simmons in the second and Shannon 
Webb, to the opposite field, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this team could hit," Coach Bob Imlay said. "I knew we could swing the 
bat, but I thought my pitching would be a lot better. We're throwing a lot of 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry pitchers issued seven walk. Two of Monte Vista's runs were scored 
by runners who reached base on walks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots' pitching has been good enough to get them into today's 10:30 
a.m. semifinal game against San Dieguito, which will match hot hitting against 
a well-rested pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs will go with Erik Luna, who is 3-0 and has not pitched since 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a good test for us," said Imlay, whose team had lost five in a row 
coming into the tournament. JOHN GEIS In other Lions tournament AAA Division

Escarcega had a nine-game hitting streak on the line and was zero for three

was also the winning pitcher. University City 9, Hoover 8 -- The Centurions

four with a bases-empty home run for University City (2-8). Hoover dropped to 
5-5-1. Fallbrook 15, Serra 6 -- Nino Storniolo's grand slam in the seventh
