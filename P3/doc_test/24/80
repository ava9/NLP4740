A quarterfinal finish is not good enough for Thousand Oaks High. That's why, 
when it's time to handle the burden, it's difficult for the Lancers to put it 
in any better hands than its defense. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, is a Thousand Oaks unit that when given an inch takes several 
yards. Mostly backward and usually with extreme prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been a major part of our success all year," Thousand Oaks 
Coach Bob Richards said after the Lancers defeated Leuzinger, 18-13, Friday 
night at Leuzinger to advance to the semifinals of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs. "It came down to white-knuckle time. We had a goal. Our 
defense, the mantle was put on them. And I can't think of a better place to put 
it." 
</P>
<P>
After fullback Chris Foster scored the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard dive 
with 2:25 left, the Thousand Oaks defense held the Olympians. Leuzinger 
(8-3-1), which tied for second in the Bay League but advanced to the playoffs 
as the league's third-place team, got one first down after taking the ball at 
its 47, but cornerback Jim Magallanes intercepted a pass inside the 15-yard 
line on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (11-0-1), the division's top-seeded team, plays Muir, a 28-0 
winner Friday over San Marcos, next week with a berth in the championship game 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there was Leuzinger, a banged-up but spirited team that 
extended Thousand Oaks until the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians had taken a 13-6 lead into the fourth quarter. Foster's first 
touchdown -- another one-yarder -- brought the Lancers to within one point at 
the start of fourth quarter, but the extra-point attempt was wide right. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lancers regained possession, they were forced to punt from their 35 
with 6:33 remaining. Jason Ybarra's punt deflected off the hands of Leuzinger 
return man Donal Byrd and the loose ball was recovered by Thousand Oaks' Greg 
Buchanan on the 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sprinting the whole way down," Buchanan said, "and when he dropped it, I 
just jumped on it." 
</P>
<P>
Easy enough. The ensuing score, however, was not to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-yard mini-drive took nine plays, including a 20-yard dash by Steve 
Rudisill on third and 17 at the 24. Finally, on fourth and one -- and after two 
previous tries from the one -- Foster banged into the end zone over right 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man," Foster said when asked to recall his second touchdown and 13th of the 
season. "They had the whole defense on the line and it was a dog fight. I think 
everybody knew that was the game-decider right there. I just put my head down 
and gave it all the leg drive." 
</P>
<P>
For Leuzinger quarterback Zac Odom, who led the Olympians back from a 6-3 
halftime deficit, it seemed an especially bitter defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out and did the best we can," he said. "It wasn't good enough on this 
night. At the end of the game, they wanted it more." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' only score of the first half came on a 44-yard pass from Scott 
Peterson to running back Mike Lindsay. Odom, who also plays defensive back, 
seemed ready to intercept the pass, but Lindsay wrestled the ball away in the 
right flat. He turned upfield, picked up a crushing block by Magallanes, and 
sprinted into the end zone. With 2:21 left in the first quarter, the Lancers 
led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra's point-after attempt was blocked by Charlie Gonzalez, who also had two 
sacks of Peterson in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians took possession of the ensuing kickoff at their own 26-yard line 
and in 12 plays moved into kicker Angel Andrade's range. His 31-yard field goal 
with 7:47 left in the half trimmed Thousand Oaks' lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers twice intercepted Odom passes in the first half -- one by David 
Watts, his second of the season, and another by Rudisill, his third. Save the 
field-goal drive, Thousand Oaks contained Leuzinger's ground game as well, 
limiting the Olympians to 42 rushing yards and 92 total. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks moved the ball well, but was unable to capitalize early. Lindsay 
rushed 12 times for 85 yards in the first half and Foster mustered 22 in five 
and finished with 24 in eight. Lindsay finished with 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks appeared lackluster at times. It was penalized only once in the 
first half for five yards and converted only two of five third-down 
opportunities into first downs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being outplayed in the first half, Leuzinger dominated the first part 
of the second. Courtney Overton returned the half's opening kickoff 95 yards 
for a touchdown that gave the Olympians their first lead, 10-6, and Andrade 
added a 35-yard field goal with 3:41 remaining in the third quarter for a 13-6 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The morale, Rudisill said, "wasn't too good. We didn't come out here to play 
football." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, however, the defense was there again. And the offense was just 
good enough.
