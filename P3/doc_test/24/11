The top boys' and girls' senior basketball players in San Diego County will 
make their final local appearances in high school games tonight at Serra High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
County girls will play a team of city players at 5:30, and Division 2-A boys' 
all-stars will play a 3-A team at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
The games, which traditionally have been played in June, have been moved closer 
to the end of the basketball season to generate more interest. Admission is $4 
for adults, $3 for students. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A boys defeated the 3-A team, 116-101, last year. It was the first 2-A 
victory since the format was changed from city playing county in 1986. The 
county girls easily defeated the city, 72-56. 
</P>
<P>
This season's boys' game features a couple of interesting matchups. Torrey 
Pines forward Courtie Miller, two-time San Diego Section player of the year, 
and teammate Kevin Flanagan (a center) will play for the 3-A team, and swingman 
Joe Temple and center Aaron Wilhite of Lincoln are expected to play for 2-A. 
Torrey Pines was ranked No. 1 in the county and Lincoln No. 2, but the teams 
never met during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Also eligible are All-County players Robby Robinson of Madison and Will Tate of 
Southwest for the 3-A team and Ray McDavid of Clairemont for the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pederson of Kearny and Dennis Kane of San Diego will coach the 2-A boys, 
and David Ybarra of Sweetwater and John Farrell of Torrey Pines will coach 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
The county girls include four All-County players, led by center Chris Enger of 
Vista. Others include Dana Christofferson of Vista, San Marcos guard Susie 
O'Brien (the county's leading scorer with a 29.9-point average) and Mesega 
Johnson, a forward from Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The city team will be led by Point Loma guard Monica Filer, section player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The county girls are coached by Vista's Joe DeMaria and Bob Kellison of San 
Marcos, the city by Lori Schwalbach of La Jolla and Mira Mesa's Gary Blevins.
