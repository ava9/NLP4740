Sweetwater High players do not particularly care that their tallest player, 
Carlos Campbell, is 6-feet-4. They are seemingly unbothered that the next 
tallest is two inches shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater feels it can win it all. Not just the Hilltop Invitational, in which 
it will play for the championship at 5:15 p.m. today against Kearny. The Red 
Devils think they can win the San Diego Section Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Mira Mesa (1-3) would be hard pressed to argue. No. 5 Sweetwater (4-0) 
defeated the Marauders, 87-68, Friday evening at Hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good chance," Sweetwater's Joe McDowell said. "But we don't 
want to get big-headed. It's still too early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Early in Friday's game, Sweetwater looked unstoppable. The Red Devils raced to 
an 23-8 lead after just five minutes and was in front, 27-14, after one 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa slowly got its inside game working -- namely Marc Ziegler, who had 21 
points and 10 rebounds -- to pull within 54-49 late in the third quarter, but 
Sweetwater went on a 14-2 run to re-assume command. An 8-0 run gave Sweetwater 
its biggest lead, 78-59, with 3:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played our strategy like we always play," McDowell said. "We got a 
little sloppy, but then we cleaned that up." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell (6-2) had 26 points and 11 rebounds, despite sitting out the final 
8:44 of the first half after falling on his right wrist. He said he first 
injured it in a physical education class earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilbert (6-2) added 22 points and six rebounds, including four 
three-pointers. Campbell had 11 points and six rebounds despite injuring his 
lower back in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Off the bench, Sweetwater's Juan Martinez (5-9) had 11 points, including making 
five of five free throws. Melvin Rushing (6-0) made eight of eight free throws, 
all in the fourth quarter, for eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys coming off the bench was the main factor," Sweetwater Coach David 
Ybarra said. "They really stood out today." 
</P>
<P>
Said Campbell, "We've got a real balanced team. We don't depend on just one or 
two guys." 
</P>
<P>
Other than 6-4 Ziegler, Mira Mesa had only one other player in double-figure 
scoring -- Kal Chatham with 11. 
</P>
<P>
And what of that size disadvantage? Sweetwater outrebounded Mira Mesa, 36-32.
