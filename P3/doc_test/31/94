<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Harmodio Arias, deputy commerce and industries 
minister, has referred to the banana situation, saying that 
economic interests and not Latin American unity seem to prevail 
on this issue and that Costa Rica had not reciprocated Panama's 
actions in the banana business. Colombia's and Costa Rica's 
decision to negotiate, on their own, a banana agreement with the 
European Union negatively affects Latin American unity and 
directly harms Panama, Harmodio Arias has said. 
  [Begin Arias recording] I believe this shows there is no 
Latin American unity. With Costa Rica, we have respected our 
promise to vote for Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
[at the OAS elections], but they have broken our unity on the 
banana issue. [end recording] 
  Arias said Colombia and Costa Rica want to get the best part 
of the banana business with Europe without caring about the rest 
of the region, and this cannot be. 
  [Begin recording] [Arias] We cannot accept a quota for each 
country; this goes against everything that deals with free 
trade. It is not possible for several European gentlemen to be 
the ones to decide Panama only has the right to export 19 
percent of bananas consumed by the European Economic Community. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What does this 19 percent represent 
regarding our interests, farms, and workers? How much will this 
hurt us? 
  [Arias] Crumbs. We are left with crumbs. Panama exports 70 
percent of its banana production to Europe; thus, we have been 
left with only crumbs. [end recording] 
  Arias was emphatic when he said the other banana-producing 
countries will not allow unilateral agreements with the European 
Union and will negotiate as a block to obtain added economic 
advantages.
