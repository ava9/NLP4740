  [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms 
what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac 
Oso Chavarria's assistant Edgar Fernandez Lazcano has been 
clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA 
agents. The news agency report states: 
  The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the 
Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit 
through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that 
former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked with a drug 
trafficker. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the 
DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having 
informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on Sunday [3 
April], again reported in Costa Rica that last week--during a 
long testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos 
Herrada--he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian 
President Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso 
Chavarria. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from 
Bolivia 
by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation 
Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement 
operation. Following some consultations, the Bolivian 
prosecutor and Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal 
asked for permission to question him in conjunction with Costa 
Rican officials.
