  [Text] San Jose, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- President Rafael Angel 
Calderon said today Costa Rica will continue its struggle to get 
better conditions in European markets for all banana producing 
nations. Calderon regretted that Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala, 
and Honduras did not attend the 13 January banana producers' 
meeting in Costa Rica "to help find a joint position" against 
the commercial restrictions of the European Union (EU). 
  Last December the EU offered to increase the Latin American 
producers' annual banana import quota by 10 percent. The quotas 
were set last July at 2 million tons with a high tariff on the 
surplus. The EU also proposed to distribute 70 percent of its 
import licenses among these nations by establishing fixed quotas 
for each country. Through this mechanism Europe seeks the 
withdrawal of charges filed by the area's producers before a 
GATT panel. 
  Costa Rica summoned the banana producers to a meeting but 
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama did not attend because 
they consider that any regional proposal should follow the GATT 
decision on the dispute. 
  Calderon told NOTIMEX: "Costa Rica will continue its 
struggle to get better conditions in the European market to 
benefit not only the Latin American nations but also the 
Caribbean producers." The president said that Colombia, Costa 
Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela will seek median formulas to 
guarantee a satisfactory solution for everyone. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Alberto Rojas said the problem was 
serious because "a GATT panel resolution did not obligate Europe 
and its enforcement could take years, with irreparable damage to 
the producers."
