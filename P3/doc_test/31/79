  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
29 March. 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales has reported that 
Costa 
Rica's net international reserves totalled $964 million in 
January 1994, while in December 1993 these reserves reached $945 
million. Corrales added that in January the Central Bank 
obtained important amounts of foreign currency through the sale 
of $50 million in bonds issued by the Costa Rican Electricity 
Institute. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 12 March 94 p 11A) 
  Deputy Finance Minister Jose Rafael Brenes has reported that 
Costa Rica's internal public debt increased from 182 billion 
colones in 1992 to 242.7 billion colones in 1993. Brenes 
explained that the debt rose because the government had to make 
heavy payments to clear up its debts with state banks and with 
the Social Security Fund, as well as heavy payments on its 
foreign debt. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 13 March 94 p 
12A) 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas has reported that the 
Mexican companies resident in Costa Rica generate 8 percent of 
the gross domestic product of this Central American country, 
equivalent to approximately $523 million per year. This figure 
will probably grow to nearly 10 percent, some $50 million, once 
the bilateral free trade enters into effect in January 1995. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0905 GMT 16 March 94) 
  The Exports and Investments Promotion Center (Cenpro) has 
reported that Costa Rican exports of edible roots have increased 
at an annual rate of 26 percent from 1990 to 1993. Cenpro 
reported these exports amounted to $30 million in 1993. (San 
Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 13A)
