<F P=106> [Report by ``special correspondent'' Kang You-feng in San </F>
Jose from the "Hookup" program] 
  [Text] At a joint news conference held by Republic of China 
[ROC] President Li and Costa Rican President-elect Figueres, 
President Li said he has a dream of transferring state power to 
another person in a peaceful manner during his lifetime. He 
said this would be his happiest wish. Meanwhile, President Li 
also called on Communist China to establish the system of the 
peaceful transfer of state power based on the concept that 
sovereign authority rests with the people. 
  Especially to express high respect and courtesy, Costa Rican 
President-elect Figueres held a joint news conference attended 
by the heads of state of both ROC and Costa Rica. Owing to the 
fact that the transfer of state power from the old president to 
the new president in Costa Rica will take place soon, reporters 
from various countries who are going to cover the presidential 
inauguration ceremony all seized the opportunity to attend the 
news conference. The site of the news conference was crowded 
with people. 
  When a reporter asked President Li about his views on the 
democratic politics in Costa Rica and the enlightenment of Costa 
Rica's democratic experience, President Li pointed out that in 
recent years, Costa Rica has been a very democratic country 
because all systems of the country are based on the concept that 
sovereign authority rests with the people. In particular, the 
transfer of state power from the old president to the new 
president is being carried out peacefully. People will not feel 
uneasy because of the transfer of state power. 
  At that time, when President Li noticed that there were 
XINHUA reporters present, he switched the conversation to 
another subject and pointed out: The biggest problem in 
mainland China is how to find a successor. We can understand, 
after examining democratic politics in several countries, that 
we must establish a system to ensure a long period of political 
stability. Establishing a good system is the basic way to 
ensure a long period of political stability. President Li said: 
  [Begin Li recording] The sovereign authority rests with the 
people. This sentence is not new. In fact, however, it is also 
a new concept. Are representatives of mainland China here, too? 
Think about it! The biggest problem in mainland China is how to 
transfer state power to a successor. Please see that only 
people elected by the people can represent the will of the 
people. Our current goal is to improve democratic construction, 
which is precisely to establish such a system. [words 
indistinct] [end recording] 
  At this point, President Li emotionally said he has a dream, 
which is not to transfer state power after his death. If 
possible, he will transfer state power peacefully to another 
person during his lifetime. He said that this is his happiest 
wish. 
  [Begin Li recording] I have a dream. That is, if there is 
such an opportunity, I shall transfer state power to another 
person. This will be my happiest wish. In China, our ROC, no 
president has ever transferred power to another person during 
his lifetime. I hope that our society [words indistinct] will 
not have such problem. This is why I said that sovereign 
authority rests with the people. Meanwhile, our constitional 
reform is precisely for this purpose. Only in this way can the 
state achieve stability. To develop the country, we must have a 
stable foundation. [end recording] 
  After President Li spoke about sovereign authority resting 
with the people under democratic politics and the establishment 
of a political system to ensure a long period of political 
stability, reporters from the Xinhua News Agency also expressed 
their views to ROC reporters that President Li's remarks are 
quite right and that China needs a scientific system and must 
not continue the past way of a certain person designating a 
successor. Su Chih-cheng, head of the secretariat of our 
presidential office, who accompanied President Li on his visit, 
also told the XINHUA reporters that President Li's remarks all 
were words from the bottom of his heart and he expressed his 
hope that they could reflect and report fully President Li's 
remarks.
