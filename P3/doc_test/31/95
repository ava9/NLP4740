<P>
Pity Honduras. After sinking millions of foreign aid dollars into a dam, 
Central America's poorest country finds itself rich in electricity but unable 
to sell all the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, the region's most prosperous nation, is the logical customer. But 
between buyer and seller sits Nicaragua, with a power grid frayed by neglect 
and guerrilla sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, much of the electricity Honduras exports simply gets lost 
somewhere over Nicaragua. The Hondurans can charge only for what reaches Costa 
Rica. Nicaragua is too broke to fix its lines or pay for power itself. 
</P>
<P>
This waste of energy is a symptom of the physical and economic disintegration 
of Central America during the last decade of civil strife. It is the kind of 
problem the region's new leaders are eager to solve now that most of the 
fighting is over. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six summit meetings since the so-called Esquipulas peace 
accord of August, 1987, the five Central American presidents who gather here 
Saturday and Sunday will focus mainly on economics. Having ended the Contra war 
in Nicaragua and coaxed the combatants in El Salvador and Guatemala to start 
talking peace, they will ask how they can help each other grow out of the 
poverty that fed those guerrilla conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
The time is ripe. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica have 
installed elected civilian presidents in the last 12 months. These leaders 
share a conservative, technocratic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
As an ideological battleground, Central America got billions of superpower 
dollars during the 1980s, only to suffer what a U.N. report calls "an 
unprecedented social and economic crisis." Regional per capita income is down 
20% from 1978, the report says, and two of every five people live in "extreme 
poverty." Two million are refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The hope of the 1960s, the Central American Common Market, barely functions. 
Trade among the five countries has declined from $1.1 billion in 1981 to $600 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Regional agencies spawned by the Common Market have proposed an ambitious 
agenda for the five presidents. It calls for reviving the market, moving toward 
a single monetary system and setting up a joint "mechanism" to coordinate 
development projects and seek outside aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Central Americans ought to aspire to the total integration of this region as 
an economic unit if we really want to move ahead," said Guatemalan President 
Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, the only one of the five Esquipulas signatories still 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
A more united Central America -- the isthmus was a single federation, ruled 
from Guatemala, until 1838 -- is "something of a holy grail" for the region's 
statesmen, a foreign economist noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
But the rhetoric masks the same contradictions that derailed the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
The market's trade barriers with the outside allowed El Salvador and Nicaragua 
to develop nascent industries and export manufactured goods within the region. 
Restoring such uniform protection could help them revive those industries, 
largely idled by war. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing such an inward-looking Common Market are Costa Rica and Honduras. They 
lost the early race to industrialize, became burdened by huge trade deficits 
and went their own way. 
</P>
<P>
Honduras abandoned the Common Market and got by on heavy doses of U.S. military 
and economic aid. Borrowing heavily from commercial banks, Costa Rica developed 
export markets outside Central America to become the region's only 1980s 
success story. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Rica's economic record is not as envied as its democracy -- the model 
held up by its ex-president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, for the regional peace accord 
that he drafted. The cost of Costa Rica's painful belt-tightening to overcome a 
mid-1980s debt crisis probably exceeds what the more fragile neighboring 
democracies can pay. 
</P>
<P>
With Arias out of office, no one has stepped forward to lead the region. 
</P>
<P>
"In the peace process, everyone had a sense that by agreeing to the Arias 
rules, they would all benefit," said Albert Fishlow of the University of 
California at Berkeley. "On the economic side, you're talking about trade-offs 
between countries in terms of relative benefits from a new system. There is no 
acknowledged broker."
