<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar by </F>
Reporter Roberto Reyes Pineda at Toncintin Airport on 11 April; 
from the "This Very Day" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Paz] The Honduran Government is very pleased with 
the working visit by the president [title as heard] of Costa 
Rica, by President Figueres. There is no doubt that we have 
made progress on the road to integration, on the road to 
rapprochement with the Central American peoples. 
  [Reyes] Is the position Costa Rica has maintained in the 
past 
few years going to change with the arrival of Jose Maria 
Figueres? 
  [Paz] Yes, we believe that the National Liberation Party's 
leading of the Costa Rican Government, will ease the Central 
American integration process. It will ease the rapprochement 
Costa Rica should undertake with the rest of the Central America. 
  [Reyes] Was an agreement reached with President-elect 
Figueres? 
  [Paz] No joint communique was signed, given that he will not 
take office until 8 May. Nevertheless, the doors have been 
opened for a dialogue, the channels of communication have been 
opened between both governments. 
  [Reyes] Is there anything specific with regard to trade 
relations, the increase that could take place in this sector? 
  [Paz] Basically we talked about the impact the signing of 
NAFTA has had and its repercussions on Central America; what 
position should we Central Americans take on this free trade 
agreement which is a challenge to our nations. We also talked 
about structuring a common strategy to face problems such as the 
marketing of coffee, the price of bananas, and so forth. 
  [Reyes] Was Mr. Figueres asked about Costa Rica's experience 
as a member of GATT, given that Honduras is on the verge of 
becoming a member? 
  [Paz] If I recall correctly, at the Latin American level 
there are just two nations that are not members of the GATT, 
that is Panama and another South American nation. These, 
however, will join in the coming months. Costa Rica does have a 
long history and vast successful experience in the integration 
of the Costa Rican economy in the new international business 
structure. 
  [Reyes] How are the good relations between Honduras and 
Costa 
Rica seen in the coming years? 
  [Paz] I can say we have very good relations, and we expect 
to 
develop and enhance them even further.
