Photo, Approaching Neptune -- The planet Neptune was still 192 million miles 
away when the Voyager 2 spacecraft shot this photo on Jan. 23. Voyager, a 
veteran of three other planetary visitations, will be the first spacecraft to 
reach the eighth planet when it arrives Aug. 25. The sawtooth edge around the 
right side are irregularities caused by the computer processing used to create 
the image, but otherwise the photo is a clear representation of the distant 
planet, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the project 
for NASA.
