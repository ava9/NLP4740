  [Abstract] The passive spacecraft (PSC) Etalon-1 and 
Etalon-2 were launched into a high circular orbit in 1989 for 
geodetic and geophysical research. Immediately after the launch 
Glavkosmos began measurements of the laser ranges to the PSC. 
The observation network consisted of Ternopol and Yevpatoriya in 
the west and Maydanak, in the high mountains, in the east. 
Observations were made only at nighttime in the entire part of 
the visible arc each 30 minutes. During 1989-1990 ten foreign 
stations were incorporated into the network (all but one in the 
northern hemisphere). In the preliminary processing stage 
corrections were introduced into the measurements to take 
atmospheric refraction into account without the humidity 
component and reduction to the center of mass. The accuracy of 
laser measurements of range by Glavkosmos instruments is 25 cm, 
but by foreign stations it is a few centimeters. The principal 
perturbations for the Etalon orbits were gravitational 
attraction of the Earth, Moon, Sun, planets and radiation 
pressure. But accuracy requirements dictated allowance for the 
influence of solar system planets, higher order geopotential 
harmonics and solar radiation in the shaded sectors of the orbit 
and radiation reflected from the Earth. Table 1 gives the 
results of processing of PSC observations. The consistent 
parameters of the constructed model of motion made it possible 
to decrease the errors in predicting the parameters of motion of 
the Etalon PSC by a factor of 1 1/2-2. This model affords a 
possibility for evaluating different effects such as the 
influence of solar radiation pressure in shaded sectors of the 
orbit with allowance for refraction and absorption by the 
Earth's atmosphere and the influence of radiation reflected from 
the Earth, taking into account the seasonal-latitudinal change 
in albedo and other small perturbations.
