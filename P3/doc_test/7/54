A small commercial rocket carrying six experiments soared into space for a 
brief suborbital flight Wednesday in a successful mission for a fledgling 
private space company. 
</P>
<P>
Starfire 1, owned by Space Services Inc. of America, a Houston firm run by 
developer David Hannah Jr. and former astronaut Donald (Deke) Slayton, 
thundered into clear blue skies from this desolate Army rocket facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The launch was picture perfect," said Don Montoya, a spokesman at the missile 
range. "It went off . . . exactly when it was supposed to go." 
</P>
<P>
The flight of Starfire 1 marked the first commercial launch involving a 
privately financed payload, officials said. The $1.1-million flight was paid 
for by the Consortium for Materials Development in Space at the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
The payload parachuted back to White Sands, landing about 60 miles from the 
launch pad. It remained intact during the fall back to Earth and was retrieved 
for analysis by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Starfire 1 was designed to provide more than seven minutes of weightlessness 
for the six on-board experiments. The experiments were devoted to materials 
processing, including one using a small furnace to learn more about how alloys 
are formed in weightlessness and another focused on studying how liquids mix in 
the absence of gravity.
