<P>
The emphasis on Star Wars may be diminished as a result of the federal 
government's defense budget cuts, but the battle for space is still being 
fought in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It's not defense contractors doing battle, it's a number of nonprofit arts 
organizations that are competing for a valuable commodity in this town -- real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than six groups are vying for space at two locations. 
</P>
<P>
In Balboa Park, the Museum of Photographic Arts and the Mingei International 
Museum of World Folk Art are competing for the Casa de Balboa space now 
occupied by the Hall of Champions, which is almost certainly moving to the 
Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the Great American Bank Plaza being built across from the downtown 
Amtrak station, space that has been dedicated for arts use is being pursued by 
four organizations: the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, the Visual Arts 
Foundation, the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and the Bowery Theater. The space 
was at one time considered by both the Children's Museum and MOPA. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Museum pulled out of the Great American complex to pursue space 
in Balboa Park's House of Charm, which it has since been granted by the City 
Council. And MOPA pulled out because an agreement for the museum's needs could 
not be reached with the developers. 
</P>
<P>
MOPA would like the Hall of Champions space next to the museum's current home 
for an expansion, but there's a catch: the Hall of Champions space has 
unofficially been dedicated to the Mingei, which has outgrown its quarters in 
University Towne Centre and had unsuccessfully sought space in the House of 
Charm. 
</P>
<P>
Got that straight? 
</P>
<P>
While that drama unfolds, the competition for the coveted Great American space 
is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
Starboard Development Corp. and Great American are considering four proposals 
for their dedicated space. Because it is a Centre City Development Corp. 
project, the developers must set aside 1% of their construction budget for art. 
</P>
<P>
Allocating exhibit or performance space is a departure from the more common 
practice of purchasing three-dimensional art in a new development. 
</P>
<P>
But the Starboard developers chose to avoid buying art, knowing full well the 
controversies that often arise in choosing and placing such work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just chosen to do more of a living art exhibit, as opposed to sculpture 
or a statue," said Starboard spokesman Gary Stougaard. "We've got about 40,000 
feet of retail space, and the art component would take about 10,000 of that." 
</P>
<P>
Stougaard estimated the contribution to the art space would total at least $1.1 
million. In addition to the Great American building, the complex will include a 
Guest Quarters Suite Hotel. Between the two structures, spanning C Street, is a 
pavilion that will serve as a trolley station with surrounding retail space. 
The dedicated art space is on the second floor of the pavilion and the entire 
complex is scheduled for completion at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art has a dual interest in the site: as a 
temporary home while its La Jolla facility is closed in early 1991 for an 
expansion expected to take 14 months and, following the expansion, as an 
adjunct downtown space, since the museum recently lost the lease on its former 
downtown gallery on G Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, we'd need 5,000 square feet for exhibitions and 5,000 of 
administrative space," said the museum's director, Hugh Davies. "Long term, we 
want to maintain a downtown presence. My fondest hope is that we would be a 
strong enough presence to maintain a 5,000-square-foot space after we return to 
La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
Davies is especially interested in the space because his first choice for a 
temporary home -- the B Street Pier space renovated for the ill-fated Georgian 
icon exhibit at the Soviet arts festival -- is apparently off limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We offered to pay as much as $2,000 a month (for the pier space)," Davies 
said. "If there was a problem, we thought at least that would give us a leg 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and members of the San Diego Unified Port District, 
which financed the pier space renovation to the tune of $700,000, had agreed 
that it would be used by various organizations after the festival. But former 
Port District Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer, who Davies thought was his strongest 
ally, said there was a problem with Davies' request for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can lend it out for a long-term use," said Wolfsheimer, 
before his resignation last month from the commission. "We didn't build it to 
have someone exclusively use it for a long-term period. I think there will be 
other city and countywide events that will need it." 
</P>
<P>
Davies said that, in the long run, maybe the pier isn't ideal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things we do may be too controversial," he said, a reference to the Port 
District's rocky history with commissioning public art projects. 
</P>
<P>
Another clue to the pier's unavailability came when the mayor returned recently 
from a trip to the Soviet Union and announced that she had reached tentative 
agreement with the director of the Armory Museum for three Soviet exhibitions 
at the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three organizations are vying with the La Jolla Museum for the Great 
American space. 
</P>
<P>
The Bowery Theatre, which is housed in a 76-seat house in the Kingston Hotel 
(believed to be the smallest Equity theater in the country), is looking for a 
larger space. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a verbal agreement to manage the Kingston space for the next three 
years, but this does not represent a permanent home by any means," said the 
theater's managing director, Mickey Mullany. "We're definitely still pursuing 
permanent space." 
</P>
<P>
The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theatre and Science Center is interested in the site 
as an adjunct to its museum in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of our own master planning, it represents an opportunity to do 
something that we had not planned until the year 2000," said Jeffrey Kirsch, 
executive director of the space center. "Our focus would be to have a high-tech 
motion picture theater for relatively small audiences -- about 150-200 people 
-- and space for state-of-the-art exhibits. Whoever is involved has a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the running is the Visual Arts Foundation, which wants to operate a 
cinematheque -- a theater dedicated to showcasing motion pictures other than 
first-run features, in a museum setting. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a complex for a cinema center that would house two to three 
auditoriums, a cafe, gift shop and poster gallery," said foundation Executive 
Director Andy Friedenberg, who also operates the for-profit Cinema Society. 
(Both of Friedenberg's enterprises offer their programs at the La Jolla 
museum.) "We would put on film programs ranging from children's series, 
festivals, tributes, faculty and student films, and classics." 
</P>
<P>
However, the foundation and the space theater may both face some of the same 
roadblocks MOPA encountered. The photo museum wanted to start a film program to 
complement its photographic mission, but the space wasn't big enough, according 
to MOPA Executive Director Arthur Ollman. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need can't really be accommodated well in that space," Ollman said. 
"We needed a 350-400 seat theater, suitable height clearances and a facility 
that was available day and night. Unfortunately, through all of our best 
efforts on both sides, it wasn't able to come about. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have the Hall of Champions space, if and when they decide to move 
out. But it's already been promised to the Mingei. But, if (the Mingei) found 
something they liked better, it would solve all our problems." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hall of Champions board member Ron Fowler, there's a "very high 
probability" they will move. Architectural and engineering studies have been 
done, and the funds for their proposed move and expansion are in place. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Mingei, it first balked at the 18,000-square-foot Hall of Champions 
space when it lost out on the House of Charm, where it had hoped to have most 
of the available 48,000 square feet. But now, Mingei Executive Director Martha 
Longenecker seems willing to accept the smaller space, leaving the photo museum 
in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned for another adventure of "Lost in Space."
