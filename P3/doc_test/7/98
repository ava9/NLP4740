<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush signed an executive order today re-establishing the National 
Space Council headed by Vice President Dan Quayle to oversee America's future 
in space and pledged to "continue on the path we blazed in earlier decades." 
</P>
<P>
The council will develop a long-range strategy for space exploration and 
"foster close cooperation" between civil, military and commercial space efforts 
-- including the space station Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, we take your charge with a great deal of seriousness," Quayle 
said at a signing ceremony in his office. 
</P>
<P>
The space panel was first created by President John F. Kennedy in the early 
days of space travel and disbanded in 1973 by President Richard M. Nixon as 
popular and political support waned after the Apollo moon landings.
