Waits for U.S. Decision on Space Station"] 
  [Text] Berlin. A number of well-known companies will be 
absent this year from the forthcoming ILA '94 International 
Aviation and Space Show, which will be held at the Schoenefeld 
Airfield in Berlin from 28 May through 5 June. After the 
withdrawal of German Aerospace, it will indeed be a small show. 
Other German and international exhibitors either do not want to 
enter the show or have now withdrawn. Only the space industry 
will be present in Berlin in the measure it had originally 
planned. For that reason, the space exhibits will have the most 
appeal for the 250,000 exhibit visitors expected. 
  The main attraction for ILA guests interested in satellites 
and rocket projects will certainly be Hall C, where the European 
Space Agency (ESA) and the German Space Agency (DARA) will 
exhibit their most important and successful applications--and 
research satellites as well as the most successful booster 
rockets in the world--the Arianes. 
  The fascination of space is brought closer to the visitors 
in 
an extravagant "holorama" show. Through the new technique of 
"virtual reality" simulations, the visitors will be able to 
experience a space trip to Mars and Jupiter. Talks, conferences, 
and discussions by and with space experts will be held daily in 
the forum of Hall C. 
  The decision as to whether Ulf Merbold or the Spaniard Pedro 
Duque is to be orbited by a Soyuz rocket and spend 30 days in 
the Mir space station this fall will also be announced in 
Berlin. Jean-Marie Luton, director general of ESA, will make the 
announcement on 30 May. 
  This year's manned space mission and a second ESA/Russian 
flight scheduled for 1995, for which Thomas Reiter and a second 
German astronaut are already in training and which is planned to 
last 130 days, are preparatory for the large international space 
station that is to be put into Earth orbit early in the 21st 
century by the Americans, Russians, Europeans, Japanese, and 
Canadians. 
  Unfortunately, that ambitious project, which will cost many 
billions of dollars, is not yet certain. The Congress of the 
United States is to vote on it in June, and the "Freedom" or 
"Alpha" station may or may not become a reality. The 
justification for this project has shifted from the purely 
technical/scientific gains to be had to the political benefits 
this major multinational project would have for future relations 
between peoples and states. 
  The decision of the Americans vis a vis the space station is 
awaited with considerable anxiety in Europe because decisions 
related to it have had to be altered and postponed many times 
already. It is still expected that ESA, under the overall 
control of Germany, will develop a laboratory module for 
weightlessness studies; the module will be docked permanently 
with the space station. 
  Should the United States actually withdraw from the project, 
Europe could perhaps link the station module up to the Russian 
Mir-2 complex, which is scheduled to be put in Earth orbit in 
the late 1990s. In general, however, all European decisions as 
to their manned space projects are currently on hold, and will 
remain so until a final decision is taken on the large space 
station. 
  Probably the research ministers of the participating ESA 
states will not meet in Paris until late 1995 to discuss their 
further actions. The same situation also holds with respect to 
the decision on a European astronaut transport vehicle, by means 
of which technicians and researchers will be able to fly from 
Earth to and from space stations. After finally dropping the 
Hermes vehicle, which had become too heavy and too expensive, 
plans are now being developed for a less expensive, conventional 
astronaut capsule capable of transporting the four crew members 
and a ton of cargo to and from orbit. 
  Exhibited at ILA '94 will be the first designs and models of 
this capsule, which will be launched by the new European 
Ariane-5 rocket, which is near readiness. Certainly, Germany's 
commitment to manned space projects will be an issue in the many 
conferences and presentations. After numerous controversies, the 
public debate about that issue has notably subsided for the time 
being, at least until final decisions and money appropriations 
for the Columbus and astronaut capsule have to be made. 
  Studies now underway concerning these manned space projects 
are--for the time being at least--being supported by Germany in 
the ESA budget to the tune of 100 million German marks [DM] per 
year. That amount represents only about 6 percent of the total 
space budget contained in the overall budget of the Federal 
Ministry of Research. 
  Meanwhile, countless managers, politicians, scientists, and 
technicians involved in the space industry in both West and East 
Europe are taking advantage of the ILA in Berlin, especially for 
intensive talks about, for example, how cooperation with Russia 
might be strengthened. Precisely in this matter, our country can 
provide an enormous amount of technical potential and know-how 
in any future cooperative ventures. This new East-West mediator 
role played by the German aviation and space fair can--with 
time--become increasingly more important, thereby ensuring that 
ILA will continue functioning in that role in the coming years.
