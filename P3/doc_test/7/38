Former Maj. Gen. John Bruce Medaris, the military director of the nation's 
unmanned space program who after a seemingly miraculous recovery from cancer 
devoted his remaining years to the Episcopal priesthood, has died of the 
disease, it was learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris was 88 when he died Wednesday at his summer home in Highlands, N.C., 
after a long struggle against bone and lung cancer. The announcement was made 
by friends in Florida and reported by United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
He had commanded the Army's early space program, the Army Ballistic Missile 
Agency, when it orbited America's first satellite on Jan. 31, 1958. The program 
was soon turned over to the civilian control of the new National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Pat Patterson of Maitland, Fla., a friend of Medaris' for 47 years, said 
the former general had picked the nation's first team of space scientists, both 
military and civilian, "and I have never seen a team surpass that one." 
</P>
<P>
The historic team that built those first missiles was headed by German 
scientist Wernher Von Braun, father of the Saturn V rocket that was to send 
Americans to the moon and a pioneer in the development of Germany's wartime V-2 
rocket. Kurt H. Debus, the Kennedy Space Center's first director, was another 
team member. 
</P>
<P>
The expatriated German scientists that included Von Braun had been sent after 
the war to Ft. Bliss, Tex., and later transferred to the small north Alabama 
cotton town of Huntsville where Medaris became their commander. 
</P>
<P>
There was little sense of urgency about the nation's embryonic space program 
until the Korean War broke out in 1950. Then seven years later, on Oct. 4, 
1957, the Soviet Union launched the 184-pound Sputnik I, the world's first 
orbiting satellite. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Medaris' team tried to respond by sending a three-pound satellite 
into orbit, but the Vanguard rocket which was to have propelled it rose two 
feet off its Cape Canaveral launch pad and exploded into a giant fireball. 
</P>
<P>
America finally got into space Jan. 31 when a Jupiter C booster hurled the 
31-pound Explorer I into orbit. The satellite discovered the Van Allen 
Radiation Belt. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris was born in Milford, Ohio, and at 16 lied about his age to get into the 
Marines. After a couple of years, he resigned and tried his hand at business, 
where he made but then lost a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris entered the Army as a second lieutenant and came through 300 days of 
World War II combat unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
An ordnance expert, he served as chief of the first Army contingent to 
Argentina from 1949 to 1952, and in 1955 was named commander of the Ballistic 
Missile Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He became known as an aggressive, often arrogant commander who would roll over 
anyone in his way. He even carried a swagger stick for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1964, four years after retiring from the service, he was stricken with 
bone cancer and told he had only 18 months to live. Eighteen months later he 
was not only still alive, but the cancer somehow had gone into remission. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought had sometimes crossed my mind that perhaps a power, or whatever it 
was, was keeping me intact because there was some important job that I was 
destined to do," he said in a 1970 interview. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Los Angeles Times in a 1982 interview from Cape Canaveral, where he 
had gone as an honored guest to watch the launch of the space shuttle Columbia, 
that he decided to repay the debt by service to his church. 
</P>
<P>
He said he originally intended to become only an Episcopal deacon but "soon I 
found myself irresistibly forced into (other) situations." He thus became the 
Very Rev. John B. Medaris, rector of Anglican churches in Maitland and Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the International Aerospace Hall of Fame made Medaris a 
fellow, its highest award. The Army awarded him the first Medaris Award to Army 
Space Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the cancer resurfaced in 1970 but again went into remission, 
returning only recently. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had become a man of God, he did not lose the aggressiveness that 
had marked his military days and remained particularly critical of the 
decisions made many years earlier that separated military and civilian space 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the greatest mistakes we ever made."
