<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old girl who was once the nation's youngest liver transplant recipient 
was released from the hospital Thursday after being treated for internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Fiske was the youngest transplant recipient in the country in 1982 when 
she got a new liver following a nationwide appeal by her father. Earlier this 
month doctors removed her enlarged spleen. She was hospitalized again a few 
days later for internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said her condition had stabilized but that she would remain in the area 
in case the bleeding resumed.
