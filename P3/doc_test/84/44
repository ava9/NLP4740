After almost a week of silence, the White House seemed to dismiss as 
hypothetical Thursday a remarkable statement by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III that offered support to the Soviet Union if it sent troops into 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"Baker was responding to a hypothetical situation that became more and more 
hypothetical thereafter," a White House spokesman said. "He (Baker) was not 
making a planned statement of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's comment, made on a television interview program last weekend, caused 
some embarrassment in the State Department and sent a ripple of amazement 
through the foreign policy community, where such high-level endorsement for a 
Soviet military intervention was seen as unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one Administration official indicated that Baker's statement was 
made off the cuff without consulting his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The White House continued to decline to say directly whether President Bush 
agreed with the position. However, a presidential aide said, "I'm not sure that 
if asked today, he (Baker) would answer the question the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was replying to a question on the "Meet the Press" program on the NBC 
television network about the bloody fighting between the Romanian army, which 
supported the new reform government, and security forces loyal to deposed 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"We would support efforts to assist the Popular Front for National Salvation 
there in Romania. . . . So, I think that we would be inclined, probably, to 
follow the lead -- follow the example -- of France, who, today, has said that 
if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of the opposition, 
that it would support that action." 
</P>
<P>
Asked directly if he would support Soviet intervention against the Ceausescu 
forces, Baker replied, "That would be my view, yes." 
</P>
<P>
The remark was soon eclipsed by the Romania army's defeat of the security 
forces and the arrest and execution of Ceausescu. Also, the Romanians had said 
that they wanted no Soviet military help and the Soviets said that they had no 
intention of intervening. But the words may well come back to haunt the United 
States one day if the Soviet Union turns into a less stabilizing force in 
Eastern Europe than Baker now apparently considers it. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, Baker's remarks seemed an extension of a similar statement he 
made several weeks earlier regarding unrest in the Soviet Union. He had 
indicated sympathy in case Moscow used force in some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The United States would be understanding, he said, if the Soviets imposed 
martial law to prevent hostile ethnic groups, such as Armenians and 
Azerbaijanis, from killing each other. On the other hand, "we would have great 
trouble," he said, if peaceful demonstrators were crushed by Red Army tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former senior official in the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration who is now at the Brookings Institution think-tank, said that 
"Baker seems obsessed with stability and with the idea that only the Soviets 
can keep order in Eastern Europe. This is the second time he seemed to invite 
the Soviets to use force, and I find his statements uncalled for, unnecessary 
and unwise." 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenfeldt, who himself once was accused of seeing too much good in the order 
enforced by the Soviets in Eastern Europe, said that "we shouldn't give the 
Soviets a blank check," as Baker appeared to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Their reputation for intervention is bad, whatever their present behavior, so 
let's not assume they are the policemen for that part of the world. Let's not 
cling to that anachronism," he said.
