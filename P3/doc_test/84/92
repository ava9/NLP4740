WHITTIER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled in the Whittier Hills sits a ridge-top plateau of pristine, prime real 
estate with a view of the Pacific on a clear day. The city of Whittier first 
sought to make this the home of a Nixon library more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
And again seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And four more years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the champagne toasting the dedication of the $21-million library 
flows in Yorba Linda, Nixon's birthplace and now-chosen resting place for the 
former President's selected archives. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terribly shocked," former Whittier Mayor Victor Lopez said recently of 
Nixon's decision to locate his private library elsewhere. "It would have been a 
boost to Whittier, Whittier College and the whole thing. We were terribly 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Chandler, another of the city's former mayors, added: "We always figured 
that Whittier was his home." 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to understand Whittier's claim to the 37th President. Although 
Richard M. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, it was in Whittier that he spent his 
high school and college years. He met his wife in Whittier and practiced law 
here. And Whittier Republicans helped him start his political career, a 
successful bid to unseat Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis in a congressional 
district that encompassed the city and nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon entered Whittier as a child; he left it as a figure in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a complete inside track historically," Chandler said, "with 
Whittier representing most of his life. It wasn't to be." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's first effort to claim the library began shortly after Nixon's 1968 
presidential triumph over Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. Whittier College 
helped to lead the bid for the library, which enjoyed strong community support. 
</P>
<P>
"His presidency was important at the time to the college," said Joseph 
Dmohowski, special collections librarian at Whittier College. "It attracted a 
lot of students to the college." 
</P>
<P>
The city presented the then-President with a handsome, oversize, leather-bound 
and cloth-lined tome titled "The Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library, 
Whittier, California." It contained pictorial highlights of Whittier and 
Nixon's career, intimately connecting the two on thick cardboard pages. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great honor to see your presidential library standing on that 
Whittier hilltop, purchased with hopes just as high," wrote then-Mayor Keith 
Miller and Frederick Binder, who was Whittier College's president. 
</P>
<P>
Local Nixon friends and supporters also commissioned "The Nixon Trail: A Site 
Feasibility Study for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library." 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by a prestigious architectural firm, the study contained a picture of 
a three-dimensional rendering of the library, which was envisioned sitting on a 
ridge among 120 acres of Whittier hillside -- above where the city's landfill 
is now located. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed complex consisted of two sets of concentric circles terraced down 
the hillside. There were also artists' conceptions of the library interior. The 
central gallery would feature NASA rockets and space capsules, which at the 
time is what the artists guessed would be remembered about the Nixon 
Administration. Indeed, the library study was submitted shortly after the first 
moon landing in December, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study's authors proposed a historical trail winding through 
Whittier that included stops at the site of the favorite son's old law firm 
(Wingert, Bewley &amp; Nixon), three schools he attended, four former Nixon 
residences, the site of his father's store, the Quaker church and the location 
of his wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, everything was on course. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Whittier residents remained sympathetic to Nixon, the impetus for 
the library literally dissolved as the scandal forced Nixon's resignation in 
August 1974. Choosing a location for his archives became a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no discussion of the library for a long time after he left office," 
said Bruce Martin, executive manager of the Whittier Chamber of Commerce. "The 
trials were still going on. I think everything went on hold." 
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for Watergate, (the library) would have been here," said Clint 
Harris, a lifelong Nixon friend and Whittier resident who used to scrimmage 
head to head with the future President on the Whittier College football team. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier, though, was a finalist for the site, along with Yorba Linda and San 
Clemente, which was the location of Nixon's Western White House. This time, 
Whittier's offer had shrunk to 20 acres, but it included the same spectacular 
ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez remembered attending a dinner party at the home of local Nixon boosters 
Ed and Ruth Shannon. Nixon's representatives were there, along with most of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gorgeous evening," Lopez said. "The hills we were overlooking, that 
was the Nixon site. We talked financing and so forth. We were willing to put in 
the road, sewage, water and to give them the land. It was all positive. They 
liked the site, the view and the town. 
</P>
<P>
"When they left that evening, they said, 'It looks pretty good to us.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the very next day's paper, Lopez said, he learned that San Clemente had been 
selected. In her personal files, Ruth Shannon said, she has a letter from Nixon 
describing his vacillation and agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'If I followed my heart, it would go to Whittier.' He felt it should 
be at San Clemente because of his years at the White House," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, however, an unexpected problem had thwarted the San Clemente plans, 
and the search for a library site was on again. Whittier officials began their 
third and final bid for it. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city wooed Nixon representatives by pitching a tent and a 
display at the proposed site, Chandler said. But for the most part, the 
lobbying went on behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
It helped that Yorba Linda already had preserved Nixon's birthplace as a 
historic site and could offer an adjacent land parcel for the library. 
</P>
<P>
So Yorba Linda, a sleepy Orange County suburb, is looking forward to an 
estimated 350,000 library visitors a year and the tourist dollars they will 
leave behind. Whittier, a city still trying to rebuild from the October 1987 
earthquake, will sorely miss the income and the prestige, city officials said.
