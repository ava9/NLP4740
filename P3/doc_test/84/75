<F P=106> [Editorial: "MFN Trading Status and Sino-U.S. Ties"] </F>
  [Text] Reports say that U.S. State Department is studying 
and drafting various options on extending China's most favored 
nation [MFN] trading status, to be presented to Clinton for him 
to choose. The United States does not have much time or options 
to resolve this question. The best way is to extend China's MFN 
status unconditionally. This will benefit the two powers as 
well as the stability and prosperity of the world at large. 
  When meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
the day before yesterday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said 
that Sino- U.S. relations are not just limited to the two sides, 
they are closely linked to the international situation. China 
and the United States should maintain good relations for the 
sake of world peace and stability. As two big powers which can 
influence the world, China and the United States shoulder great 
responsibility for the future of the world and the destiny of 
mankind. We should do something for people of the world. Jiang 
Zemin looked at Sino-U.S. relations from the macroscopic 
viewpoint of the developing situation of the world as a whole. 
This should give U.S. policymakers much food for thought. 
  Following the end of the Cold War, some people in Western 
political circles thought that the Soviet Union had 
disintegrated and that it was no longer necessary to attach 
importance to ties with China. They even thought that the 1989 
Beijing disturbance could be used to force China to take the 
same road of the Soviet Union. Facts have totally shattered 
these people's dreams. China was not and will never be a card 
to be played by any country. China has its own weight. As a 
big country with the largest population and quickest economic 
growth in the world, China's stability and development will 
nurture the development of the Asia-Pacific region and also 
maintain peace in the region. Peace and stability are 
inseparable major issues which the world is now facing. China 
has made tremendous efforts and contributions to the solution of 
these two issues. The IMF, World Bank, and UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization and Population Organization, as well as 
industrial and commercial tycoons from the developed nations and 
the transnational corporations, have all affirmed China's 
achievements and are optimistic about China. 
  The United States is the largest developed nation and the 
only superpower in the world. Nixon's visit to China 23 years 
ago opened up a new chapter in Sino-U.S. relations. Thanks to 
the reform and opening up introduced by China, Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade ties have developed rapidly and the two 
countries have become important trading partners. Economic and 
trade ties have become increasingly important in bilateral 
relations. This conforms with the trend of contemporary 
international relations whereby economic interests constitute 
the main factor. The increasingly close economic and trade ties 
between the most populous country and the most developed nation 
in the world will naturally be conducive to world peace and 
stability. The ideal option should be cooperation and 
construction rather than confrontation and war. A relatively 
open market is one of the characteristics of the U.S. economy, 
which has benefited the United States tremendously. The flow of 
cheap and good products from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to the 
U.S. market is welcomed by U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, large 
numbers of U.S. industrial and agricultural products have also 
entered China along with the country's modernization program. 
Many large U.S. companies have discovered that China is the 
irreplaceable and last big market which can offer them enormous 
opportunities. 
  Under such circumstances, if the Clinton administration 
insist on taking the question of human rights, which has nothing 
to do with economy and trade, or even the question of Tibet, as 
bargaining chips and link these issues with the MFN status, this 
will never be accepted by the Chinese Government and people. It 
is true that China's economy will be affected without MFN status 
but the United States will also suffer great losses. More 
importantly, it will produce an impact on the situation in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. If the United 
States chooses the option of confrontation with China, its 
interests affected will not be limited to the field of economy 
and trade. The United States tried to hinder and block New 
China for a long time during the Cold War and this did not 
benefit it in the slightest. It was President Nixon who changed 
U.S. policy toward China and this is a lesson to remember. 
  The number of people from various U.S. circles supporting 
unconditional extension of China's MFN status is increasing, far 
exceeding those who are against. Since taking office, Clinton 
has not made any achievements in domestic affairs or diplomacy. 
If China's MFN status is revoked, the grave consequences will 
not help him running for another term of the presidency, still 
less the U.S. manufacturers and consumers. The United States 
should unconditionally extend China's MFN status. We believe 
that the United States, in consideration of the long-term 
interests and proceeding from the overall situation, will make a 
rational choice.
