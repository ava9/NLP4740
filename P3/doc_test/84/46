This book calls for the United States to normalize diplomatic relations with 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, immediately and without preconditions. In 
his dedication, the author reveals what he considers the principal benefit to 
be derived from this action: "To the hundreds of American Prisoners of War, 
still held against their will, who will be freed only when there is a new 
relationship between Washington and Hanoi." The U.S. policy of economic and 
diplomatic isolation of Vietnam since 1975, he contends, has thrust Hanoi into 
the arms of Moscow and increased the Soviet presence in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
This flawed U.S. policy of hostility to Hanoi has been imposed, the author 
asserts, by a clandestine group of second-level officials within the Executive 
Branch with links to the CIA. This cabal, whose adherents shared a common 
experience during the Vietnam War, still is angry that the United States lost 
the War in Congress and on the American streets, the author believes, and is 
punishing Hanoi with harsh measures of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
The author, John Leboutillier, is a right-wing former Congressman from New York 
who served one term in Congress, from 1981 to 1983. For the past six years he 
has been president of a group called Account for POW/MIAs Inc., which proclaims 
itself "dedicated to bringing home living American POWs still held in 
Indochina." 
</P>
<P>
While Leboutillier's call for normalization with Hanoi is not without merit, 
his fundamental assumption is doubtful and his political analysis twisted. He 
provides no evidence that American prisoners are alive in Indochina. No sources 
are cited for his assertions -- the book is devoid of footnotes. Professionals 
within the U.S. government who have been responsible for investigating the 
POW/MIA issue since the Communist takeover of Indochina in 1975 point out that 
there is minimal possibility that any American POWs are alive in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Administration's position from 1976 to 1981, following careful 
investigation of all leads about POW/MIAs, was encapsulated in the official 
statement: "There is no credible evidence to indicate that any Americans are 
currently held against their will in Indochina." A Select Committee of the 
House of Representatives on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, after a 15-month 
investigation which began in September of 1975, concluded that "no Americans 
are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result 
of the war in Indochina." However, many specialists on the MIA/POW issue in 
both Congress and the executive branch believe that Hanoi may possess 
information and possibly the remains of American POW/MIAs which it has not yet 
provided to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Even former President Nixon, who provides an introduction to this book, 
expresses doubt about the author's contention, noting, "I do not share the 
author's optimism that Americans are still alive in Indochina." Nixon does make 
the argument that Hanoi must account for all of the MIAs before the United 
States normalizes relations. But on this score also, Nixon disagrees on "timing 
and tactics" with Leboutillier, who insists that the United States should 
establish diplomatic relations with Hanoi without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the weight of evidence that no American POW/MIAs remain alive in 
Indochina, a suspicion to the contrary continues to haunt segments of the 
American public, the armed services and the Congress. It is understandable that 
families who have lost a husband or son in Indochina would cling to the hope 
that he is still alive. The issue has been kept active by a small but well 
organized pressure group, the National League of Families of American Prisoners 
and Missing in Southeast Asia. Popular films like "Rambo" and TV features about 
MIAs have sustained the belief of some that Americans are being held captive in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, reflecting President Reagan's strong personal 
interest in the MIA question, altered the approach of the Carter Administration 
with the following announcement: "Although we have thus far been unable to 
prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information 
available to us precludes ruling out that possibility." The Bush Administration 
appears to be continuing the approach of its predecessor. Thus, in the absence 
of reliable guidance from authoritative government sources that the chances are 
minimal that American prisoners remain alive in Indochina, political 
pronouncements like those found in this book will continue to cloud the issue 
of U.S. relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
There are sound reasons of U.S. national interest to give serious consideration 
to normalization of diplomatic relations with Hanoi. Cyrus Vance, President 
Carter's Secretary of State, pursued negotiations for normalization of 
relations with Hanoi, but these efforts gave way to U.S. normalization 
negotiations with Beijing, spearheaded by former National Security Adviser 
Zbigniew Brzezinski, which took priority. 
</P>
<P>
When negotiations with Vietnam resumed and almost had reached fruition, they 
were postponed indefinitely when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December of 1978. 
The United States subsequently put forth the condition that Vietnam must 
withdraw its troops from Cambodia before normalization could proceed. Now that 
Vietnam has apparently withdrawn its troops (a development not treated in this 
book, since it went to press before the Vietnamese withdrawal), there is reason 
for reconsideration of normalization. 
</P>
<P>
Certain bilateral issues of concern to the United States, such as the 
emigration of Amerasians, the treatment of political prisoners, the orderly 
departure of refugees, and visas to Vietnam for Vietnamese refugees living in 
America, as well as securing information about POW/MIAs, could be handled 
directly with Hanoi. The United States might open channels through which Hanoi 
could reduce its dependence upon the Soviet Union, if gradually, and increase 
Vietnam's potential for peaceful cooperation with its Southeast Asian neighbors 
and the West, a goal which the new Vietnamese leadership has publicly embraced. 
</P>
<P>
However, as long as China remains hostile to Vietnam, Hanoi should be expected 
to retain a close relationship with the Soviet Union that will serve as a 
counterweight to the threat from China. Nevertheless, terminating the isolation 
of Hanoi and drawing it into the rapidly developing world of Southeast Asia 
could reduce tensions, help with the solution of the refugee problem, and 
increase the potential for stability in the region.
