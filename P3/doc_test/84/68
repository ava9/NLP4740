  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa denied Tuesday [10 May] that Japan and the United 
States concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. 
can redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture 
in case of emergency as was claimed in a soon-to-be published 
book. "Such a secret agreement does not exist as the government 
has been saying," Kakizawa told a press conference. 
  According to a book to be published Thursday, Japan and the 
U.S. concluded the secret deal during summit talks between then 
Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon in 
November 1969. 
  The author of the book is Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor 
of international politics at Kyoto Industrial University, who, 
as Sato's special envoy, negotiated the reversion of Okinawa to 
Japanese control with Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security 
affairs adviser. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai also denied the 
existence of the 1969 secret nuclear pact. 
  Kumagai, the chief government spokesman, said at a news 
conference that Japan has long banned the introduction of 
nuclear weapons into the country.
