  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- In a message of 
condolence addressed to Richard Nixon's family, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today lamented the former 
U.S. President's death. Salinas expressed his condolences to 
Nixon's daughters Patricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower, the 
president's office reported in a press communique. 
  Nixon, 81, died in a New York hospital on Friday night. On 
Monday, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, which kept him in a 
coma until his death. He had to step down in 1974 as the result 
of the Watergate scandal. Nixon's funeral will take place at 
Yorba Linda, his birthplace in California, next Wednesday.
