<F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Schwarz: "Whitewater and Watergate"] </F>
  [Text] The acoustic similarity of the terms is tempting: 
Watergate and Whitewater, both stand for scandal and for 
cover-up. The Republicans may be particularly tempted by that, 
because Richard Nixon fell over the cover-up of the break-in 
into the Democrats' headquarters two decades ago. The fact that 
now a Democratic President is displaying extreme clumsiness as 
he tries to get through the investigations against him is just 
what his opponents want. 
  The comparison is lacking in one respect: The Watergate 
break-in took place, and Nixon was not proved to have 
participated in it but to have lied. Whether the Clintons' 
Whitewater deal is to be challenged in the first place is still 
open, and the Clintons have not yet been proved to be lying. 
Compared with Watergate, the Whitewater affair will probably 
remain only a little brook. 
  Nevertheless: Richard Nixon did not fall because the 
Republicans wanted to hurt their enemy but because the president 
led the investigators by the nose and hurt the people -- in 
their trust. The Clintons have come that far already: Holding 
back incriminating files about the affair and ordering the 
investigators to report constantly on their findings, this gives 
the affair -- if there is not more hidden behind it -- a bad 
taste. 
  There is one thing that Whitewater has shown as a basic 
tenet: The team around the President is as weak as its boss. 
Very close associates and advisers are chosen either by Bill 
Clinton as a result of friendship or by the First Lady. The 
fact that Clinton's only emerging (and still disputed) success 
-- the health reform -- has been accomplished by her is as 
characteristic as the fact that it is her role in the Whitewater 
case that is the incriminating one and not his. In addition, 
there are no real strategists in the White House, who could 
provide a bit of direction to the President's presentation. 
Clinton prefers to do all that himself by eagerly praising his 
wife (since she also defended him when he was accused of 
womanizing). 
  This shows that there is indeed a difference between 
Watergate and Whitewater: Even in a mess Nixon still had style.
