ON THAT SUBJECT: One guy you won't see lining up for Eagles tickets is pop 
satirist Mojo Nixon, whose new album, "Otis," contains a raffish blast at his 
least favorite ex-Eagle. Titled "Don Henley Must Die," it mocks the performer 
with the same scabrous glee that Johnny Rotten once directed at Pink Floyd. It 
goes in part: 
</P>
<P>
 Turned on the TV and what did I see, 
</P>
<P>
 This bloated, hairy thing winning a Grammy, 
</P>
<P>
 Best rock vocalist, compared to what, 
</P>
<P>
 A bunch of pseudo-craft, Instamatic satanic fluff . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He's a poet of despair, pumped up with hot air, 
</P>
<P>
 He's serious, pretentious and I just don't care, 
</P>
<P>
 Don Henley must die, don't let him get back together with Glenn Frey. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he picked on Henley (as opposed to say, Sting), Nixon explained: 
"Because Don's the ringleader of this pompous-twit, brain-dulling anti-rock 
Muzak of the '90s. The way I look at it -- you cut off the head and the beast 
will die. Don and I agree on a lot of political things, but if you played his 
songs for some guy in Africa, he'd say, 'Why is this white guy whining so 
much?' Rock 'n' roll has simply left him. He's as far removed from Little 
Richard as you can be." 
</P>
<P>
The notoriously thin-skinned Henley, famous in media circles for writing heated 
letters about allegedly inaccurate stories, countered with a statement saying: 
"I've never heard the song in its entirety, but some of the lyrics were read to 
me over the phone. We then extended an invitation to Mr. Nixon via his manager 
to be the opening act on the remainder of my tour with our blessing to perform 
the song. He declined our offer. Personally, I think the boy just needs a good 
laxative." 
</P>
<P>
(Nixon says he "never received a formal offer" to tour with Henley and "is 
ready to go" if Henley contacts him.)
