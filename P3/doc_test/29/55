<TEXT>
<P>
Pearl Bailey, a Southern preacher's daughter who became a top performer best 
known for her throaty rendition of "Hello Dolly," died Friday at Thomas 
Jefferson University Hospital. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital official refused to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
The singer, dancer, humorist and homespun philosopher -- Pearlie Mae to friends 
-- had suffered from a recurring heart condition since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Singing does bring out the soreness," she once said. "But when I get on the 
floor, baby, you know nothing hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the singer underwent surgery to replace her arthritic left knee 
with a metal and plastic joint. 
</P>
<P>
She left Pennsylvania Hospital on July 30, intending to continue visiting two 
sisters for a week while undergoing physical therapy. She then planned to 
return home to Arizona with her husband, jazz drummer Louis Bellson. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a performer for 57 years, is one of the few entertainers who could 
still be called a trouper in the classic sense. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Newport News, Va., Bailey moved with her family to Washington and then 
to Philadelphia, where she made her debut at age 15, winning an amateur contest 
by singing "Poor Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps best known for playing Dolly in the black version of the musical 
"Hello, Dolly!" in the late 1960s, she also enjoyed a long film career and 
appeared in "Carmen Jones," "Porgy and Bess" and other movies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, she received a special Tony award for her role in "Hello, Dolly!" 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey considered herself foremost a singer. 
</P>
<P>
Her standbys included "Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home," "St. Louis 
Blues," "Row, Row, Row," and "That's Good Enough for Me." 
</P>
<P>
She also has served as a delegate to the United Nations during the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey did her first show for U.S. servicemen in 1941 and had been a staple 
performer of the USO ever since. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote humorous and inspirational books, including "Hurry Up" and "America 
&amp; Spit." Her autobiography, "Between You and Me," appeared last year. 
</P>
<P>
Flipping a feather boa or swathed in chinchilla, ablaze with rhinestones and 
jewels, Bailey was famous onstage for her throwaway style of singing, a 
mumbling growl laced with husky patter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a comedienne," she once told an interviewer, "I call myself a 
humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people 
who call me an actress." 
</P>
<P>
She attributed her talent to God. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Pearl, what style do you have?' I say 'it's God, not style.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tall, folksy daughter of a preacher quit school for show business at 15. 
Her blossoming career made her a star of nightclubs, motion pictures, 
television and Broadway shows and earned her the friendship of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
At a Washington performance of "Hello, Dolly!" she was joined onstage by 
then-President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1970, President Richard M. Nixon named her America's "ambassador of 
love" to the world. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her death she was married to Bellson, her fifth husband, a white 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
The interracial marriage proved to be a happy one. The Bellsons adopted 
children and at one time lived on a ranch in Northridge in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The singer said in 1970 that perhaps she had failed to speak out enough about 
racial injustice, "but I've lived that way. I walk with love and hope it rubs 
off." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in humanity in that you don't bother to look at the color of a man's 
face. That's brotherhood," she added. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, she took a spin around the Persian Gulf to visit U.S. Navy personnel 
on ships there. 
</P>
<P>
That year she also told the World Health Organization that she wanted to 
dedicate her life to fighting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had her own television show in the early 1970s and in 1982 appeared in 
an NBC production of "Member of the Wedding."
