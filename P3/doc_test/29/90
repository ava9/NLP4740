RICHARD L. STROUT; COVERED POLITICAL SCENE FOR 60 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Richard L. Strout, the venerable journalist who began covering presidential 
press conferences when Warren G. Harding would show up in golf knickers and was 
on hand as they evolved into the stylized, televised spectaculars of the Ronald 
Reagan White House, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Strout, who reported for the Christian Science Monitor for more than 60 years 
while also writing the political column "TRB From Washington" in the New 
Republic magazine from 1943 to 1983, was 92 when he died Sunday night at 
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Sperling, a longtime colleague at the Monitor, told the Associated 
Press that Strout had been hospitalized after a fall on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most revered members of the nation's press corps, Strout was 
esteemed by colleagues and readers alike for his biting insight and historical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
He personally liked Harding, he said shortly before retiring. He said of former 
President Jimmy Carter, "Poor old Carter, who didn't know the game rules when 
he came here." And he considered Franklin D. Roosevelt the most effective of 
all the 12 Presidents he had covered. 
</P>
<P>
Under Strout, the TRB column became one of the most widely echoed sources of 
liberal political opinion in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
When he gave it up, the New Republic's editors observed, "You don't get out of 
Strout's church without hearing the sermon, but the hymns are lovely. . . . He 
looks and listens, and tells you what he has seen and heard in vivid, simple 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Strout described the Eisenhower Administration as "government by sedative" and 
likened Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.) to "a mist that carries lethal 
contagion." 
</P>
<P>
Of Richard M. Nixon, then vice president, he wrote in 1958, "He is out for the 
kill and the scalp at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, his name remained on the magazine's masthead as a 
contributing editor. Like his predecessors, Strout wrote the column in 
anonymity but in recent years it has been signed, currently by senior editor 
Michael Kinsley. 
</P>
<P>
The name TRB was coined by Bruce Bliven, an editor of the magazine before it 
moved from New York to Washington. Bliven, who carried his copy to the office 
by subway, said the initials stood for Brooklyn Rapid Transit in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
On his 80th birthday in 1978, Strout, still active, said, "If you live long 
enough, people confuse ability with longevity. I'm just an analytical writer 
with some color. I'm not a whiz-bang." 
</P>
<P>
The same year, he was given a special citation by the Pulitzer Prize committee 
for his lifetime achievement. Strout also won the George Polk Memorial Award in 
1958 and the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award in 1975, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Strout was raised in Brooklyn by a father who taught English and wrote poetry. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Harvard in 1919 and then worked his way across the Atlantic 
on a grain ship. He reported for two years for a paper in Sheffield, England, 
and returned to the United States where he was hired by the Boston Post before 
joining the Monitor in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
His assignments ranged from the Teapot Dome scandal in the Harding 
Administration to presidential political conventions and campaigns to 
Roosevelt's New Deal efforts to deal with the Depression and on through the 
Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Strout gradually became critical of the American electoral process, citing the 
ongoing decay in voter turnout, which he laid to disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
He advocated adaptation of the parliamentary system of government used in 
Britain and Canada but acknowledged that "the Founding Fathers tied us up so we 
can't change." 
</P>
<P>
In his final column, in April, 1983, Strout reflected on the divergences he had 
witnessed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes think," he wrote, "that you can measure the passage of time by 
counting the things that couldn't happen. A Roman Catholic couldn't be elected 
President. Schools couldn't be desegregated. Government couldn't expand budgets 
in a depression. Birth control couldn't be discussed in terms of national 
policy. Public welfare was 'socialism.' American troops couldn't be stationed 
in Europe in peacetime. We couldn't lose a war." 
</P>
<P>
As for democracy itself, Strout quoted E. B. White: 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half the people are right 
more than half the time."
