  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li Peng have sent a telegram of condolence on 
the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon today. 
  The full text of the telegram reads: 
  We are shocked to learn that Mr. Nixon has died. We wish to 
express our profound condolences. Mr. Nixon was a statesman 
with strategic foresight and political courage, and he opened a 
new era in Sino-U.S. relations together with late Chinese 
Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. 
  Since he left office Mr. Nixon continued to be concerned 
with 
Sino-U.S. ties and made an important contribution to the 
upholding and development of the relations. 
  The Sino-U.S. relations will surely be further promoted and 
developed by the joint efforts of the two countries. 
  We wish to express our sincere sympathy for Mr. Nixon's 
family.
