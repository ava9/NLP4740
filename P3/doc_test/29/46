Richard Nixon, who died on Friday night, was the only US president forced to
resign. To the end of his days he knew this single fact would be the
outstanding feature of any account of his life. In consequence he spent the
years after he left the White House in disgrace on August 9, 1974 in a
protracted effort to rehabilitate his reputation. His purpose was to regain
what political influence he could as an elder statesman.
In this he was remarkably successful. Ruthless, and widely hated for it, he
was nevertheless respected during much of his career, and most of all as he
neared the end of his life. A genuine expert in foreign affairs, he was
consulted by most of his successors at times of difficulty. He excelled in
the nuances of cold war policy; his messy and bloody withdrawal of the US
from the Vietnam war was perhaps the best that could be expected of a man of
his character. The mood of Congress and the people at the time gave him
little leeway.
A man who became accustomed to seeing his life as a struggle against
opposing forces, and whose political career was haunted by fear of failure,
Richard Milhous Nixon was born of poor parents in Yorba Linda, California,
and educated himself as a lawyer against considerable material odds.
His political career began in 1946 when he unexpectedly carried California's
12th Congressional District for the Republicans, after accusing the
incumbent of being soft on communism. It was a foretaste of the bitter
campaign he was to pursue against Alger Hiss, a former State Department
official under investigation by the Un-American Activities Committee, which
first brought him national fame.
To the end of his life, Nixon believed it was his handling of the Hiss case
that first set the liberal establishment, and above all the media, against
him. In his book, Six Crises, he spoke of 'a residue of hatred and hostility
towards me . . . which remains even to this day.' Those words must have
haunted him years later as the Washington Post and the New York Times
relentlessly pursued their investigations of the Watergate break-in.
In 1950, Nixon won a Senate seat in California after what many observers
called 'the dirtiest campaign on record'. Again, he accused his opponent of
being a semi-communist. Two years later, he was selected by Gen Dwight
Eisenhower to be his vice-presidential running mate. As to campaigning
style, Ike said, 'you take the low road, and I'll take the high road'. Nixon
knew well how to fight low. Accused of personal misuse of campaign funds, he
went on television, capturing an audience of 58m, the biggest yet of any
broadcast. He denied the accusations, but admitted one gift, which he would
not return. It was 'a little cocker spaniel dog' that 'our little girl -
Tricia, the six-year-old - named ..Checkers.' This shameless appeal to
emotion worked well. Messages to the Republican National Committee ran 350
to 1 in Nixon's favour.
He used his eight years as as vice-president, and president of the Senate,
to good advantage. By 1960 he was as knowledgeable about the details of US
politics as that other great product of the upper house, Lyndon Johnson. He
became familiar with every twist of policy, especially foreign affairs, an
understanding of which he enhanced in close conversations with John Foster
Dulles, and through constant trips abroad.
He became the world's most celebrated anti-communist, at a time when such a
stance was not universally popular. Overseas, his undoubted knowledge of
events in most areas of the globe was a characteristic to be respected. In
domestic political infighting, his chicanery with statistics, his sly
innuendo, cynicism, and hypocrisy made him the most hated politician in
America. Yet his solid conservatism, untainted by racial or religious
bigotry, laid the foundations for his later capture of a large and
respectable national constituency.
In 1960, having served as Ike's loyal apprentice, he campaigned for the
presidency, without his master's visible support, against John F Kennedy. He
lost by a whisker. Historians will never cease to debate whether less
questionable counting techniques in Texas and Illinois might have produced a
different result, but Nixon had the sense to resist a prolonged period of
inquiry and recrimination. Just 47 years old, his life then entered a dark
phase, from which many believed it would never recover. His fortunes seemed
to reach their nadir in 1962 when he failed to capture the Californian
governorship, and his much vaunted political comeback collapsed in ruins. He
had taken a beating from the media ever since the Hiss case 16 years
earlier; now he allowed his feelings to tumble out. . . 'You won't have Dick
Nixon to kick around any more,' he told reporters, 'because, gentlemen, this
is my last press conference. . .
Nixon joined the prestigious New York law firm of Mudge, Stern, Baldwin and
Todd, where he made money, regained his self-confidence and kept his name
before the public with a series of 'business trips' around the world. He
stayed close to his family; there is no evidence of any scandal in his
private life. He travelled widely in the US and campaigned actively for
Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election.
He continued to work hard for the Republicans in 1966, and in 1968, calling
in his accumulated IOUs, he was nominated for the presidency. He had thus
outlived his reputation as a loser, partly by beating Governor Romney of
Michigan and Governor Rockefeller of New York in the primaries. President
Johnson, battered by anti-war protests, announced that he would not run
again. Later that year, Nixon won by a narrow margin, causing him to remark
ruefully to his defeated opponent, Hubert Humphrey, that he knew how it
felt. So began the most controversial presidency of American history. He
took over at a time of social discontent and frustration with the unpopular
war in Vietnam. He succeeded in calming cities and universities, and
extracting the country from south-east Asia on terms that did not send it
pitching headlong into isolationism as many had predicted. Instead, with the
aid of his talented adviser, Dr Henry Kissinger, he tried to set foreign
policy on a new course, seeking better relations with Russia and China and a
sounder world economic system.
In time, these accomplishments may appear as a turning point, one that only
a Republican with the stealth and intelligence to steal the opposition's
clothing could have taken. At home, his accent on self-help and doubts about
the high-spending social programmes of President Johnson were not challenged
by his successors. If it was hard to defeat the populist Hubert Humphrey in
1968, victory over the amateurish radicalism of Senator George McGovern, his
Democratic opponent for the presidency in 1972, was comparatively easy.
Nixon's electoral margin in 1972 was overwhelming.
Almost immediately, everything went sour. As the Water gate scandal
unfolded, doubts that had been murmured in the past began to be shouted out
loud. Long-standing suspicions about his personal integrity were discovered
to have a foundation in fact as the full details of his financial dealings
were revealed. His reputation for unscrupulousness was confirmed by talks of
'dirty tricks' and the activities of the White House 'plumbers.'
When such disclosures were combined with his increasingly unconvincing
efforts to vindicate himself, Richard Nixon was transformed in the public
eye from a respected, if unpopular, leader, to one who seemed to have
violated the confidence of the people and the standards of his office on a
scale unparalleled in American history. (The venality of Kennedy and
Johnson, who preceded him, was as yet unrevealed.) The final straw came when
Nixon was forced to admit that he had lied continuously for two years. He
had no alternative but to resign. President Gerald Ford, who took over the
White House, brought an end to legal proceedings by pardoning him.
More than two decades of efforts to rebuild his reputation followed. He
travelled, wrote books, confessed error before the entire world, through a
televised interview with David Frost. He came to be seen as history may
regard him - unscrupulous, yes, but tough, decisive, disciplined, daring,
evidently indestructible. He was, as all successful politicians must be, a
consummate actor, untrusting and not to be trusted, but also highly
intelligent. His self-set goal was peace through a balance of power or,
better, containment of communism. Tricky Dicky he may have been in life; he
is perhaps, better remembered as Richard resurgent.
