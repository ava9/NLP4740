Mr Kakuei Tanaka, in whose image modern Japanese politics was crafted, died
aged 75 in Tokyo yesterday after a long illness, which had cut short his
career but had also ensured he would not be jailed for his involvement in a
bribery scandal.
The gravel-voiced Mr Tanaka dominated Japanese politics during the 1970s and
1980s, when he perfected the faction system of the Liberal Democratic party,
which ruled the country for four decades until this year and served as the
conduit between business and the bureaucracy.
Popularly known as the 'computerised bulldozer' for his straight-talking
determination and ability to calculate cost and benefit, Mr Tanaka's
fund-raising powers allowed him to reward generously his supporters and
constituents, ensuring his faction was the most influential in the LDP.
Newly-elected politicians sought his patronage and promised him loyalty. Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the current prime minister, is a former member of the
Tanaka faction, and the coalition government's kingmaker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
learned his political skills in the company of Mr Tanaka and carried on the
Tanaka tradition of fund-raising.
Mr Tanaka's organisational ability and his financial resources ensured his
power even increased after his resignation as prime minister in late 1974,
when his personal finances were the stuff of public scandal after the 'black
fog' was lifted by a Japanese magazine.
Two years later, the 'shadow shogun' was arrested on suspicion of accepting
Y500m (Pounds 3.1m) in bribes, and he was sentenced to four years' jail in
1983. An appeal against his conviction was pending when he died.
But the troubles with the law did not diminish his popularity in his home
prefecture of Niigata, where he was consistently re-elected. His speeches
were laced with references to his humble origins and his love of his home
town, while his lack of a university education was popularly regarded as an
antidote to the arrogance of the Tokyo University graduates who controlled
the capital.
Campaigning in 1946, Mr Tanaka promised he would level the mountains hemming
in his home prefecture; 'then we shall have no more of the heavy snowfalls
that have tormented us for centuries'. On later becoming a minister, he
refused to attend the lecture provided by bureaucrats for education of the
incoming politician.
It was said there was a little bit of Mr Tanaka in every Japanese, that he
represented the embodiment of old rural values in the post-war political
world. He had a habit of wearing traditional wooden sandals with his
business suit, and his rough-and-ready speaking style conjured images of the
crude but endearing rice farmer.
But Mr Tanaka's later life, spent in a comfortable Tokyo compound complete
with pond jumping with Y1m carp, was far removed from that of the common
man, and the earthy campaigning style became in part affectation. He was
increasingly consumed by political intrigue, and his considerable personal
wealth became an ever larger target for public criticism.
Mr Tanaka began his business life in the construction industry, and Tanaka
Civil Engineering profited during the war, when poor health led to his
discharge from the army. His links to the construction and transport
industries allowed him to build the network of political influence, fuelled
by money from companies grateful for receiving lucrative public contracts.
His first skirmish with scandal came in 1948, when he resigned as
vice-minister of justice after allegations that he accepted bribes from coal
mining companies. But he returned as minister for postal services and
communications in 1957, later serving as finance and trade minister, when he
collected ideas for a grand plan to 'remodel the Japanese archipelago'.
Mr Tanaka was felled by a stroke in 1985 but did not retire from politics
until 1989. His former associates fought over control of his faction; his
daughter Makiko reformed his supporters' group this year, being elected to
the Lower House.
As with Mr Richard Nixon, the former US president, the sins of Mr Tanaka
were overlooked by the Chinese government, which remembered him fondly for
travelling to Beijing to normalise relations in 1972. China last night
'deeply mourned' his passing.
