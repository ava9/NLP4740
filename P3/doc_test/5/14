By now most of you will surely have discovered the compulsive appeal of
Cracker (ITV, 9.00).
This series about Fitz, the burly criminal psychologist (Robbie Coltrane),
has it all - a flawless script, superb acting, and fine camera-work. There
is a touch too much gore for queasy stomachs but these days that appears to
be unavoidable.
Addressing the theme of evil, Panorama; The Sinful Messiah (BBC 1, 9.30)
investigates religious guru David Koresh and his cult of the Branch
Davidians in Waco, Texas, and the siege and subsequent tragic confrontation.
Tales from Borges (BBC2, 12.00) is a season of films based on short stories
by the great Argentinian writer, Jorge Luis Borges.
Will To Win: Out Of Africa (BBC2, 7.40) looks at the sporting achievement of
countries like Kenya and Uganda.
Sporting victories give a positive image to African peoples but successful
athletes often find they have to emigrate because of government corruption
and interference in sport.
