FT  20 JUL 93 / Clinton at last fires FBI chief

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday dismissed Mr William Sessions as director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, finally despairing of persuading the
embattled former judge to resign grace-fully.
'We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United
States as the FBI,' Mr Clinton said at a news conference yesterday after a
meeting with Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, at which he had decided to
fire Mr Sessions.
Mr Clinton said he would name a new director today. In the meantime he had
asked Mr Floyd Clarke, the FBI's deputy director and Mr Sessions' principal
foe within the agency, to serve as acting director.
Mr Louis Freeh, a former FBI agent and federal prosecutor who is currently a
judge in New York, is expected to be nominated for the FBI directorship.
Mr Sessions has served little more than half of his statutory 10-year term
at the head of the principal US federal police force; his ability to lead
the FBI has been considerably impaired since a January report by the Justice
Department accused him of ethical violations, including the misuse of FBI
cars, aircraft and employees for personal ends.
Mrs Alice Sessions complained on Sunday that her husband was the victim of a
campaign by a group of old FBI hands who objected to his efforts to bring
some racial and gender diversity to the largely white, male agency.
Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that Mr Sessions had performed a
considerable service in broadening the look of the FBI but said that he
agreed fully with Ms Reno's judgment that he was no longer capable of
leading the FBI. He said one of the reasons he had taken so long before
dismissing him was his belief that the FBI should not be politicised and
that a change of president should not be sufficient reason for changing the
director.
