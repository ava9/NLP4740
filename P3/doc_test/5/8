THE days of Judge William Sessions as head of the FBI appear to be numbered.
Yesterday President Bill Clinton said he was waiting on a report from Ms
Janet Reno, the new attorney general, before determining the director's
fate.
He also pointedly declined to confirm or deny reports of the existence of a
short list to succeed Judge Sessions. Prominent on the list was said to be
Mr Richard Stearns, now a state judge in Massachussetts but Mr Clinton's
contemporary as a Rhodes Scholar in England and like the president, a
campaign worker for Senator George McGovern in 1972.
The FBI director came under heavy fire from the outgoing Bush
administration, which accused him of misuse of public funds for private
purposes. His stock had risen a little lately because of early FBI arrests
in the World Trade Centre bombing. The administration was also reported not
to want to remove him while the siege of a religious cult outside Waco,
Texas, drags on.
A further indication of of the administration's drive to purge law
enforcement of Republican officials was provided yesterday when Ms Reno
asked for the resignations of all US attorneys (federal prosecutors) from
around the country.
Ms Reno said she wanted to 'begin to build a team that represents. . . my
views and the views of President Clinton.' US attorneys are political
appointees, but more than 90 Republicans have continued to serve. There is
one potential controversy to her action yesterday. The Republican US
attorney in Washington, Mr Jay Stephens, has been aggressively investigating
allegations of corruption against Mr Dan Rostenkwoski, powerful Democratic
chairman of the House ways and means committee.
