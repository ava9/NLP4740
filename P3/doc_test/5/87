Re "Fountainhead of a New Fury": Why was there so little mention of Ayn Rand's 
philosophical work? Why was there no mention of the Ayn Rand Society, a branch 
of the American Philosophical Assn. (an organization of university 
philosophers, with similar branches for Plato, Aristotle, David Hume and 
others)? Or of the Ayn Rand Institute, right here in Marina del Rey, which 
conducts a yearly essay contest on "The Fountainhead" for high school juniors 
and seniors, and which sponsors academic work in philosophy?

I was glad to see her described as a "consistent (and) passionate champion of 
individual rights," but there is a lot more to Ayn Rand than politics. Ayn Rand 
provided new and important insights into the nature of reason and its role in 
human life, into morality and the important questions traditionally answered by 
religion. Especially with more and more people turning to fundamentalism, 
Shirley MacLaine, "crystal power," and drug cults for meaning in life, Ayn 
Rand's rational, benevolent message deserves better than to be carelessly 
dismissed as adolescent foolishness.
