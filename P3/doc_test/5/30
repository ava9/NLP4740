David Waco and Denny Vigo are no strangers to each other. West Valley League 
opponents in high school, they renewed their rivalry Tuesday when Waco's UC 
Santa Barbara team visited Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Waco, a second baseman from Chatsworth High, hit a career-high three home runs 
and drove in six runs and Vigo, from El Camino Real, was four for five with 
five runs batted in and a pair of home runs. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Barbara made the most of its power, winning the nonconference game, 
14-13, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Waco and Vigo were not the only hitters to enjoy the favorable wind conditions 
at Matador Field: There were 10 home runs -- five by each team -- and 15 
extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB (28-14) scored three runs in the top of the 10th to take a 14-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge (25-15) battled back on RBI singles by J. D. Haendiges and Craig 
Clayton in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gaucho reliever Gary Adcock (7-4) closed the door on the Matadors, however, by 
getting Scott Richardson (four for seven) to pop to short with runners on first 
and third, and striking out Scott Sharts (hitless in seven at-bats). 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely not a home-run hitter," said Waco, who had one home run and 20 
RBIs entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never hit two in a game before today. . . . But the wind was blowing and 
this is definitely a hitter's park." 
</P>
<P>
Waco's two-run home run in the fourth narrowed Northridge's lead to 5-4, and 
his solo shot in the sixth cut the Gaucho deficit to 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, his one-out, three-run blast off Eric Spellman gave Santa Barbara 
an 11-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo answered with a two-out, solo home run in the bottom of the inning to send 
the game into extra innings.
