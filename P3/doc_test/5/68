PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday mounted a robust defence of his record in
office and the performance of his much-criticised White House staff.
His appearance on a two-hour breakfast television 'town meeting' came just
hours before a budget bill pact with conservative Democrats was voted on by
the House of Representatives.
Mr Clinton confirmed that he would extend China's most favoured nation
trading status for a year 'because I want to support modernisation in China
and it is a great opportunity for America there'. But he said he expected
'some progress' from China on human rights abuses and the use of prison
labour. Other disputes with China, over arms sales and trade, would be
negotiated separately and directly with the Chinese, he said. 'I think they
will appreciate the gesture I'm making.'
On the issue of introducing a value added tax, the president said he thought
it was 'feasible if it is not regressive'. It was something 'we may look at
later on', but was 'such a big issue' that it had to come after economic and
health care reform.
Most of the questions put to the president by his audience of 200 members of
the public in the Rose Garden were about national economic and social
issues, while the programme's hosts concentrated on the controversies over
the White House travel office and Mr Clinton's recent haircut on board Air
Force One which delayed traffic at Los Angeles airport.
On the latter issues, Mr Clinton conceded only 'a few glitches' in their
public presentation. He said reforming the travel office would save money
and was 'good for the country and good for the taxpayer'. He flatly denied
charges of nepotism and cronyism over proposed alternative travel
arrangements.
He insisted his staff had only followed past practice in calling in the FBI
to investigate the travel office without directly consulting the attorney
general's office. But he praised Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, who
has objected to being circumvented, for her 'great judgment', adding: 'She
can question whatever she wants to'.
He also defended his White House staff who, he said, were not as young as
popularly supposed. He would neither confirm nor deny that he was
considering bringing in political heavyweights well versed in government to
bolster the operation.
'If you try and change a lot of things you might break some eggs and it is
not an exact process,' Mr Clinton said. He suggested the Washington
establishment was also partly responsible for difficulties in getting the
administration's message across. 'I think we've done a lousy job of cutting
through the fog that always surrounds this town.'
He listed a variety of achievements and said his own analysis of his first
100 days showed he had spent a quarter of his time on foreign policy, 55 per
cent on the economy and health care and 20 per cent on other domestic
policies.
The president said he spent just 2 1/2 hours on the issue of gays in the
military. But he added he favoured the latest compromise proposal, known as
'don't ask, don't tell,' which would permit homosexuals to serve in the
military but require them to keep their sexual practices private.
