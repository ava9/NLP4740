The first cancer therapy using genetically altered living cells was approved 
last week, and doctors at the National Institutes of Health said the first 
patient should start treatment within a few weeks. Steven A. Rosenberg said his 
team has been poised to start the revolutionary gene therapy in patients 
critically ill with advanced melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, and was only 
awaiting the final approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

The still-experimental therapy amplifies the body's own cancer-fighting 
ability. It uses natural cancer-fighting cells, called tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, that have been removed from a patient's tumor and given extra 
genes that should enhance their ability to attack the tumor. The technique has 
been shown to be effective in laboratory animals.

Earlier this fall, other NIH researchers were granted permission to use gene 
therapy to treat children with an inborn defect in their immune systems that 
renders them highly susceptible to infections. Those studies are already under 
way.

<P>
Rosenberg's team was given permission to treat up to 50 melanoma patients using 
the new gene technique.
