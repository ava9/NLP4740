Vaccine"] 
  [Text] Pronova has secured for itself the sole right to 
develop and sell a cancer vaccine that is now being tested at 
the National Hospital. 
  The Norwegian pharmaceutical firm Pronova has entered into 
an 
agreement to develop and sell the cancer vaccine that has been 
developed at the Institute for Transplantation Immunology (ITI). 
  If the results of the therapeutic vaccine are as promising 
as 
the scientists believe, great possibilities may open up on the 
world market for the Norwegian pharmaceutical firm. 
  The state company Medinnova at the National Hospital has 
negotiated the agreement. It includes 10 million kroner for 
further basic research at the Institute for Transplantation 
Immunology. In addition, there are possibilities of license 
earnings in the future. 
  "We have collaborated with the Institute for two to three 
years already. The cancer vaccine project is extremely 
interesting, but it is a long way off," says Sven Arild 
Andersen, administrative director of Pronova. 
  The Norwegian scientists at ITI and the doctors at the 
National Hospital are the first in the world to test this type 
of cancer vaccine on humans. 
  The cancer vaccine is supposed to help the patient's own 
immune defenses to attack the cancer tumors. If the results are 
as the scientists hope, the vaccine can help approximately 
one-fourth of all new cancer patients each year. This pertains 
to a part of the patients who get cancer of the colon, lungs, 
pancreas, and thyroid, along with leukemia and malignant 
birthmark tumors. 
  "Without the cross-professional and very competent milieu at 
the Institute for Transplantation Immunology we would never have 
been where we are today," says Gustav Gaudernack, leader of the 
group of scientists behind the cancer vaccine project and senior 
scientist at the Norwegian Cancer Society. 
<H5>  Five Patients </H5>
  In the research project, five patients at the National 
Hospital with cancer of the pancreas are involved in testing out 
the first vaccine. 
  An operation or other treatment is not appropriate for these 
patients. 
  For the moment, the vaccine has not been shown to produce 
side effects. It is too early to say anything about results. If 
this first test goes well, the research group will seek 
authorization to test the vaccine on colon cancer patients by 
spring. 
  Not all patients can take part in the experiments. The 
vaccine is supposed to awaken and work as a team with the 
patient's own immune defenses and, therefore, it is important 
that the immune defenses are functioning well. Patients whose 
immune systems have been suppressed after cell poisoning or 
radiation therapy will probably react poorly to the vaccine and 
are not appropriate for treatment. 
  "Therefore, we want to introduce the vaccine as early as 
possible," Gaudernack points out. "The idea is that the vaccine 
will prevent remaining cancer cells from developing further 
following an operation or other treatment. In the future, the 
vaccine can also be used as a preventive vaccine if we can 
identify persons at risk by gene testing and begin the vaccine 
before the cancer has broken out." 
<H5>  "Tailor-Made" </H5>
  The vaccine is tailor-made to each individual patient. 
  Cancer tumors are produced when changes occur spontaneously 
in some of the body's genes, so-called mutations. One gene 
family, which is called "ras," is important from the point of 
view of the cancer cell--a sort of "cancer cell Achilles heel." 
The cancer cell needs this gene in order to grow. 
  "We have found out that three mutations in ras genes are the 
most frequent. In the pilot study we are testing out these 
three. We must therefore find patients who have precisely such 
mutations in their genes," Gaudernack relates. 
  In order to chose the right patients the scientists at ITI 
have developed an extrasensitive gene test, for which an 
international patent has been sought. 
  Many scientists around the world are testing "rougher" types 
of cancer vaccines. But the Norwegian vaccine is special because 
it takes aim precisely against a specific gene mutation that has 
been identified within the patient. "Therefore, we avoid 
subjecting patients to treatment that in any case would not do 
any good," Gaudernack says. 
  In a few years, the research team at the National Hospital 
will know much more about the cancer vaccine's potentials. 
Gaudernack will not indicate when the vaccine may go into 
commercial production. 
  "This can take time, depending upon what sort of response 
the 
patients have to the vaccine--and whether the effects will be 
different for different types of cancer," he says. "We are 
breaking new ground and it is important to do the job properly 
before talking about offering the cancer vaccine as a part of 
the treatment of cancer patients."

<H5>  How the Vaccine Works </H5>

  -  A tissue test of the tumor shows whether the patient has 
the appropriate gene mutation that the vaccine will work against. 
  -  A blood sample is taken from the patient--white blood 
corpuscles are drawn out. 
  -  Specially suited vaccines--so-called peptides--are 
transferred 
to the white blood corpuscles drawn from the patient. 
  -  The "new" white blood corpuscles are injected back into the 
patient. 
  -  The "new" white blood corpuscles rouse the other white 
corpuscles to an attack against the cancer cells. 
  -  The cancer tumor is beaten back.
