BETTER UNDERSTANDING of the interaction between genes and the environment,
which controls an individual's susceptibility to disease, could lead to
personal health cards that identify areas of risk and enable individuals to
monitor their progress.
This could be one result of a new field of research called Ecogenetics which
examines the way an individual's genetic make-up responds to environmental
factors such as chemicals, food additives or smoking.
Professor Mark Ferguson of the Department of Cell and Structural Biology at
the University of Manchester told the association that this would allow
healthcare to be better targeted and more cost-effective.
Not all environmental agents caused disease in all people, so there was
clearly a genetic basis to susceptibility, he said. 'Understanding how
different individuals respond to different external factors is of major
importance in trying to understand and prevent, as well as treat, a number
of important disorders.'
If the main susceptibility genes could be mapped, it would be possible to
produce a health passport for every individual and everyone could be given
appropriate preventative advice and screening.
"Everyone knows of the association between smoking and lung cancer but not
everyone who smokes is at risk of the disease. Ecogenetics will make it
possible to make predictions about an individual's risk.'
Prof Ferguson said this would make anti-smoking information much more
potent. 'Humans respond better to warnings about individual risk than to
blanket prescriptions.'
It would be possible to target screening services, such as breast scans, to
those with a known genetic risk.
