GENETIC ENGINEERING ACHIEVES 'MAJOR STEP' TOWARD HEMOPHILIA CURE

Implants of genetically engineered skin cells in dogs with hemophilia B, a rare 
bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, can bring the 
symptoms under control for short periods, according to researchers from the 
Salk Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers have many technical obstacles to overcome before the 
new approach can produce a cure in the animals, their research, reported Monday 
in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents 
a bold new approach to this genetic disorder, which is now treated with an 
expensive protein isolated from concentrated blood plasma. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step forward toward a cure for hemophilia," said hematologist 
Frederick Rickles of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. "I think 
it's just terribly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia afflicts as many as 20,000 males in the United States. Women can 
carry the gene for the disorder, but generally do not develop it. 
</P>
<P>
It is caused by a defective gene that would normally serve as a blueprint for a 
protein that plays a crucial role in the clotting process that prevents people 
from bleeding to death after being cut or wounded. It exists in two main forms, 
called A and B. 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia A, the more common form and the type which is associated with 
European royalty, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor VIII. 
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease after the surname of the first 
two people diagnosed with it, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor 
IX. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only treatment for either type is injections of either Factor 
VIII or Factor IX isolated from the blood of healthy individuals. Because the 
proteins are present in blood in only very small quantities, large volumes of 
blood must be pooled for the isolation procedure, greatly increasing the risk 
that the material will be contaminated with the viruses that cause hepatitis or 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90% to 95% of the nation's 7,000 to 9,000 hemophiliacs with the 
most severe cases of the disease are thought to be infected with the AIDS 
virus. Among moderate hemophiliacs, who require fewer injections, the infection 
rate is thought to be 40% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have developed techniques to cleanse blood products of viruses, but 
the isolated protein is very expensive. A year's treatment may cost as much as 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to collecting Factor VIII from blood, researchers have 
produced it in the laboratory using genetic engineering techniques. This 
product has been successfully tested in humans, but the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has not approved it for marketing. Genetically engineered Factor 
IX has not yet been tested in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The new research reported Monday opens the door to a technique by which 
hemophiliacs would produce the protein in their own body. 
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted using dogs that suffer from hemophilia B. They are 
maintained in a unique colony at the University of North Carolina in Chapel 
Hill by pathologists Marjorie S. Read and Kenneth M. Brinkhous. Called keagles, 
the animals arose from a cross between a cairn terrier and a beagle, and the 
colony has been maintained for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Salk Institute molecular biologists Jonathan H. Axelrod and Inder M. Verma took 
skin cells from keagles and used a specially designed virus to introduce a 
healthy gene for Factor IX into them. Their paper reports that the cells 
produce and secrete Factor IX. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod and Verma have constructed mini-organs with the engineered cells and 
implanted them under the skin of the keagles. The implant produces Factor IX 
for at least a few weeks, and the animals' blood will clot normally, Axelrod 
said. But the clotting time gets longer and longer, indicating failure of the 
implant. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, "we can't pinpoint a specific problem." It may be that the 
cells are dying or that they stop producing Factor IX. The researchers are 
trying to isolate and correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not discouraged by that," said Rickles, vice president of medical affairs 
for the National Hemophilia Foundation. "While it may take some time, we are on 
the right track."
