<P>
Peru, a key ally in the war on drugs, called Thursday for cancellation of the 
upcoming Andean summit conference on drugs, a signal that Latin America's 
displeasure over the U.S. invasion of Panama has emerged as a serious threat to 
President Bush's anti-narcotics campaign. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. drug fighters officially maintained a stiff upper lip, saying that it is 
too early to speculate about adverse side effects that the U.S. move into 
Panama may have on their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But officials worried privately that agents of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration stationed abroad now may receive less cooperation and access 
from host countries and that governments like Colombia's might become more 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
American intrusion on Latin nations' sovereignty has been a highly sensitive 
issue as the United States has strived this year to take the anti-drug fight to 
the traffickers and producers in their home regions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Administration's drug strategy, American troops -- this week sent to 
topple Panama's Manuel A. Noriega -- were to play an important role. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Peru, which recalled its ambassador to Washington to underscore its 
protest, Colombia also denounced the U.S. incursion and refused to recognize 
U.S.-supported Guillermo Endara as the new president of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, the staunchest U.S. ally in the war against violent narcotics 
traffickers, did not immediately endorse the call to cancel the drug summit 
that it is scheduled to host Feb. 15 -- a meeting that President Bush has said 
he plans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
James Hoobler, an official with the State Department's Bureau on International 
Narcotics Matters, said: "We're proceeding on the assumption that the summit is 
going to be held. We have no indication that this (Panama move) will affect the 
war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy, declared that the ouster of Noriega would help the drug campaign 
because Panama "will no longer serve as a haven or vacation spot for drug 
traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
Others were skeptical, however. Never a significant producer or shipping point 
for drugs, Panama's major part in the illicit commerce was in the laundering of 
traffickers' profits, they said. Even with an honest government in power, that 
practice is so ingrained in the Panamanian financial community that it will be 
difficult to curb soon. 
</P>
<P>
Drug policy strategists said they hope a new Panamanian government friendly to 
the United States might pave the way for a U.S.-Panama treaty that would make 
it more difficult for the drug cartels to hide their money in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Such criminal justice agreements, which helped reduce money laundering in 
Switzerland, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, can take years to complete, 
and Panama's powerful banking industry could offer serious opposition, one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking indictments returned last year by federal 
grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., is charged with accepting bribes of $10 
million from members of Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect smugglers and 
cocaine shipments and to launder profits and supply drug laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, the protests by Peru and Colombia joined those previously 
made by Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Guatemala, Argentina and 
Costa Rica. Only El Salvador, heavily dependent on U.S. support for its battle 
against leftist guerrillas, said the intervention in Panama was "justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
In Bogota, Foreign Minister Julio Londono declared: "No country can assume the 
right to intervene, directly or indirectly, in other state's affairs, whatever 
reasons or purposes it may have, much less militarily." 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of American States, composed of the United States and most of 
the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, was moving at its session 
Thursday toward condemning the invasion but had not worked out the wording of 
the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Londono said representatives of several Latin nations plan to meet in 
Washington over the weekend to study possible solutions to the crisis. A 
Justice Department source said officials there regard the statements by Latin 
American leaders to be pro forma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone here believes there is anything but a positive reaction 
on the drug war from the steps taken in Panama," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Con Dougherty, a spokesman for the DEA, said he could offer "no speculation on 
what might be the effect" of the Panama invasion on such projects as the large 
U.S.-backed anti-drug mission in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug summit meeting is still on the schedule," he said. "It's too early to 
speculate about other things." The summit was called to intensify and 
coordinate the multi-pronged assault on traffickers in the Andean nations. 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration official involved in the drug war, while acknowledging 
concerns, remarked that "the honest answer is it's too soon to tell" whether 
the Panama invasion will impede Latin American cooperation.
