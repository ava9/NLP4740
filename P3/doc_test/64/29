</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three top opposition leaders defied a ban on rallies and marched through 
the streets of the Panamanian capital on Saturday, their first public 
appearance since they were physically assaulted after the May 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
And late Friday, U.S. officials reported that the government had released 15 
Panamanians employed to provide security at U.S. Embassy offices. Two 
Panamanians are still being detained. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and vice presidential 
candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten up on 
May 10 by paramilitary forces of strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The government Saturday prohibited "marches, meetings, public demonstrations or 
caravans of vehicles" by any political organization until at least June 5. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Endara, "The prohibition does not have any meaning to us." The 
politician spoke as he made his way through an outdoor market in San Miguelito 
on the capital's eastern outskirts. The stop was one of six made by a caravan 
of about 20 opposition vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blocked Traffic 
</P>
<P>
The caravan briefly blocked traffic on some major routes. Police watched but 
took no action. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said the caravan was designed "to thank the people for their support May 
7." 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading the 
Noriega-picked government candidates in the national election two weeks ago 
when Noriega's troops seized election ballots. The results of the election have 
been annulled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violence Probe 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government said the 17 security guard personnel were questioned 
as part of an investigation into the May 10 violence. 
</P>
<P>
Those detained work for Tesna Protective Services, an American firm that 
operates in Panama under the name Memsa. The company provides by contract about 
80 employees who serve as security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They 
are not employees of the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Guerra, a bodyguard of Ford, was killed in the May 10 violence, and 
another, Humberto Montenegro, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra was a Tesna-Memsa employee, on leave from the company. Montenegro had 
been employed by Tesna-Memsa until early this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Visit 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique saying the 
prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the upcoming visit by 
delegates from the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, 
accompanied by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, are due in Panama on 
Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of Panama's 15-month-old 
government crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The organization on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Gen Noriega, 
the commander of the Panama Defense Forces and the effective ruler of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February, 1988, when he 
was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida. Noriega has survived 
economic sanctions and international pressure, accusing the United States of 
seeking to scrap a treaty that will give Panama full control and supervision of 
the Panama Canal by the end of the century.
