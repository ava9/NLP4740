PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last organized military support for deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega collapsed Saturday, and Panama's new U.S.-approved leaders began 
efforts to form and run an actual government. 
</P>
<P>
According to European diplomats involved in the negotiations, the garrisons at 
five important provincial capitals have pledged their allegiance to the 
constitution and the new government sworn in after thousands of American troops 
invaded early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was clear that the optimism caused by the surrenders and the 
announcement of army reorganization had not brought all violence in the nation 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Shots continued to ring out in Panama City on Saturday night, and there were no 
reports of sizable surrenders, captures or suppression of the so-called Dignity 
Battalions, paramilitary units formed by Noriega last year to terrorize his 
political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the estimated 15,000 officers and enlisted men of the old 
Panama Defense Forces, commonly called the PDF, agreed to give their allegiance 
to the new, U.S.-installed civilian government and to restore order in their 
areas. But small numbers refused. 
</P>
<P>
Both the diplomatic sources and Panamanian military officers say the newly 
loyal troops already are searching for members of Dignity Battalions and others 
still supporting Noriega, once the "maximum leader of Panama." 
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached between the five unit commanders and Vice President 
Ricardo Arias Calderon and U.S. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army 
South, which is based at Ft. Clayton near the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that the Roman Catholic Church mediated the pact and will 
act as its guarantor, particularly concerning a pledge by Cisneros not to 
attack or otherwise molest the Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The PDF wasn't so much against the new government," said one European 
diplomat, "as it was afraid of the American forces. Once it was clear the 
Americans wouldn't attack them, they were willing to support the new leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly important was the surrender of the garrison in the city of David 
in the northern jungle province of Chiriqui, considered a Noriega stronghold 
and the likely place for him to hide and direct any anti-U.S. guerrilla action. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the unit commander, Col. Luis A. del Cid, is one of those who 
was indicted, along with Noriega, in a U.S. federal court in Florida on drug 
trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid told a news conference Saturday in David that he only wanted assurances 
of fair treatment and already had begun operations against irregular forces in 
the jungle. No one would discuss the possibility of his extradition to the 
United States on the drug charges, a major concern in the case of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The other units switching are in Santiago, Los Santos, Boca del Toro and 
Chitre. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of this generally optimistic turn, and in the face of misleading 
assurances Friday afternoon by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander of the U.S. 
Southern Command here, that there had been no battles in the previous 24 hours 
in Panama City, other American officers and eyewitnesses reported constant 
fire-fights between the invading army and resisting Panamanian units. 
</P>
<P>
Mortar Attacks 
</P>
<P>
American troops Saturday morning launched several mortars against forces of the 
Dignity Battalions entrenched in a jungle preserve on the edge of Ft. Clayton, 
which is about six miles from the Panama City limits. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. units also came under fire early during the day near the U.S. Embassy and 
the residence of American Ambassador Arthur Davis. Residents of Via Espana, a 
well-to-do neighborhood, watched as Dignity Battalion members exchanged gunfire 
with a hovering U.S. helicopter gunship. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting has caused the deaths of 25 American soldiers and the wounding of 
238, with one still missing. On the Panamanian side, at least 139 PDF members 
have died in action, 95 are reported wounded and 2,250 have been captured. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thurman said in a news conference that 15,500 weapons have been seized by 
his troops. 
</P>
<P>
Further weakening Noriega's ability to carry out a sustained resistance was the 
surrender Saturday of the so-called Palace Guard, a PDF unit that protected the 
presidential residence and offices in downtown Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
The building was occupied by U.S. troops in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And to prevent the military institution that was the Panama Defense Forces from 
reconstituting itself as a danger to his government, President Endara on 
Saturday announced the official dismantling of the PDF, which was the nation's 
sole military, police and security organization before its defeat by the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be replaced by a smaller organization called the Public Forces 
of Panama and will be limited essentially to police and other public order 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
Force Reduction 
</P>
<P>
The new organization ultimately will be reduced in size to about 3,500, 
according to diplomatic sources, and will be headed by Col. Roberto Armijo, a 
troop commander in the old PDF. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo (Billy) Ford, the second of Panama's two vice presidents, said in an 
interview that Armijo was not associated with the corruption, violence and 
mismanagement of the PDF. "He was the senior officer among the decent officers" 
in the old military, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
The second in command is another controversial ex-PDF officer, Col. Eduardo 
Herrera Hassan. He was dismissed by Noriega in 1987, allegedly because his 
popularity among the rank and file was a challenge to the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan was brought back to the PDF in 1988 to head special corps of riot troops 
called the Dobermans to suppress rising anti-Noriega civil unrest. Although he 
succeeded in that mission with bloody efficiency, Hassan was again fired and 
has been living in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Ford insisted that for the first time since the American invasion and the 
resulting anarchy, looting and vandalism have eased. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, travels Saturday through Panama City neighborhoods from the almost 
unbelievably poor sections of the inner city to the opulent areas of Altos de 
Gulf showed that at least in daylight people were behaving civilly. 
</P>
<P>
But the shattered store windows, the burned-out buildings, the hulks of wrecked 
vehicles blocking intersections and the stomach-turning smell of smoldering 
debris were all reminders of the utter chaos and lawlessness that have ruled 
the streets since the American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
No accurate figures are available, but prominent businessmen said the damage 
will run in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Street Interviews 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear from interviews with people on the streets whether law and order 
were being restored -- there were occasional American military patrols seen and 
some U.S. soldiers guarded key intersections and food stores -- or that there 
was simply nothing left to loot. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thurman emphasized that many Panamanians had been awaiting the arrival of 
the American troops and had welcomed them. Moreover, he said, in many cases 
they had identified members of the Dignity Battalions so that U.S. troops could 
capture them. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday saw the evident spontaneous creation of pro-government vigilante 
groups in the streets, armed men who established barricades and were actively 
seeking out Dignity Battalion members. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, American military patrols were disarming the vigilantes but not 
replacing them in any strength. The leader of one vigilante group that captured 
four Noriega followers and found three machine guns in the trunk of their car 
said he called the U.S. military and was promised an immediate patrol. Six 
hours later, no American personnel had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The existing danger also was underlined by the new government's refusal to 
publicly identify the members of the new Cabinet appointed to administer 
affairs of state. "We can't announce them because of security reasons," Vice 
President Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Careful Handling 
</P>
<P>
Although Endara, Arias Calderon and Ford have been extreme critics of Noriega 
and overwhelmingly defeated the general's handpicked candidate in last May's 
presidential election, they are handling the matter of his military followers 
as if it were a fragile egg. 
</P>
<P>
"We're screening (the military) for loyalty," Ford said, "and the loyal and 
decent military will remain." But even those culled will not be punished, the 
vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no revenge against the military who fought against the takeover. 
They will not be shot, jailed nor persecuted. But they will be required to lay 
down their arms," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He even indicated a sense of mercy for the usually despised Dignity Battalions, 
members of which nearly beat him to death with iron bars last May. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want repression nor reprisals," Ford said. "But we have to have them 
turn in their weapons."
