</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted as Panama's dictator five days ago by a U.S. 
invasion force, surrendered Sunday to the Vatican's embassy here and asked for 
sanctuary from his American pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
The development sparked a spontaneous demonstration of pot-banging and 
horn-honking elation as the news spread quickly through the city. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender came near the end of a day that for the first time since 
the U.S. invasion began was unmarred by reports of serious violence. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath, Panama's Roman Catholic primate, told reporters 
that Noriega "simply drove up in a private car and asked for political asylum." 
</P>
<P>
An American official, speaking on condition that he not be identified by name, 
added that Noriega rang the bell on the ornate iron gate of the papal 
nunciature, as the embassy is formally known, at 3:36 p.m. Noriega said he was 
seeking protection and ultimately wants political asylum to be arranged in 
either Cuba or Spain. 
</P>
<P>
He was then escorted through the yellow wall that surrounds the Victorian 
mansion housing the embassy by Father Joseph Esspeteri, secretary to the papal 
nuncio, Bishop Jose Sebastian Laboa. 
</P>
<P>
The papal envoy did not immediately announce that Noriega's request had been 
granted, but church officials and U.S. sources said they understood that it 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vatican, the news arrived a few minutes before Pope John Paul II 
celebrated his traditional Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. "There is 
nothing to say. Later today, we shall see," said Vatican spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish diplomats here would not comment, but the Spanish ambassador was 
reported to be in close touch with Madrid, awaiting instructions. The Cuban 
embassy did not answer its phone. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has successfully eluded the Americans from the moment U.S. troops 
attacked and burned his military headquarters and sacked his various homes in 
Panama City in the early morning hours of Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was deemed responsible for directing a series of hit-and-run 
attacks that harassed and frustrated American forces in 
</P>
<P>
the first days after the invasion, Noriega's hope of survival dissolved as his 
allies increasingly deserted him and U.S. troops gradually gained control of 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
That dwindling support and indications that U.S. agents were about to close in 
on his hiding place in Panama City prompted his surrender, European diplomats 
said, an assessment confirmed by a U.S. military source with a curt grunt of 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one U.S. commando unit was hot on his trail Sunday. When its members 
burst into a villa a mile from the Marriott Hotel, a few miles east of downtown 
Panama City, they found two women cooking a Chistmas turkey and evidence that 
the dictator had been there only 90 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Harry Axson of the 82nd Airborne Division, Ft. Bragg, N.C., who led 
the 2 p.m. raid, said the women were Noriega's mistress and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us he was going to turn himself in. . . . They told us he was 
thinking of turning himself in," Axson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said he had no doubt that the raiders had just missed Noriega. 
Neighbors confirmed that a helicopter had lifted off from the villa grounds 
just an 90 minutes earlier. That was just after a surveillance team, acting on 
a tip, had approached the plush villa in a heavily wooded area and had decided 
to get reinforcements before launching a raid. 
</P>
<P>
Axson said the surveillance party had gathered at the Marriott in the morning 
after being tipped that Noriega was nearby. The four-man commando team was sent 
to the villa soon after noon in a hotel vehicle that looked like a small moving 
van. When they returned to fetch back-up, they were sent out in the same van 
with 25 members of the 82nd Airborne, who then stormed the house, Axxon said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official here, when asked if Noriega had made a good move, answered 
that, "It was the only move. He had nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender met the most important of the American policy demands set 
in 1987 when the man who had been personally honored by two U.S. presidents as 
a loyal and dedicated friend was cast adrift because of his major role in the 
international drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida, 
Washington officials found the criminal charges to be impeding their real 
objective, that of ending his political and military control here. 
</P>
<P>
That view was expounded Sunday by a U.S. official. "Sure, we would have been 
happy to try him," he said, "but this (his surrender) is positive. It is good 
news. Noriega is out of circulation and that is the key." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the three crucial aims of U.S. policy were "one, (get) 
Noriega out of power; No. 2, out of circulation; and No. 3, he's going to be 
(stay) out of power." 
</P>
<P>
This official and military sources denied suggestions that the United States 
had botched its effort to apprehend Noriega by not staking out the Vatican's 
embassy, as they had done the Cuban and Nicaraguan embassies here. 
</P>
<P>
They also rejected any suggestion that they could simply enter the Vatican 
territory and seize Noriega. "If this were the Rwandan embassy, you'd say 
'Screw them.' But you're not going to do that with the Vatican," said one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they said, the U.S. strategy was to provide Noriega with an incentive 
to do exactly as he did by signaling that the relatively lenient treatment 
accorded his previous allies would be applied in some form or another to him. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between the papal envoy and U.S. officials two days ago, a 
conscious decision was reached to be as non-threatening as possible, Western 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that as former Panama Defense Force officers turned themselves in 
and were treated lightly, Noriega would realize both that he had no viable 
support and that the American goal was to get rid of him, not to send him to 
prison in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing was not to put up a threatening posture," one source said. "The 
big thing was to maintain public order by removing the one-time strongman as 
both a leader and inspiration of violent opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's fears may have been further eased by a statement earlier Sunday from 
the new Panamanian president, Guillermo Endara, who told a news conference that 
his American-sponsored government was not searching for the former dictator and 
would not 
</P>
<P>
extradite him to the United States if he were apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, we are not looking for him. We have other priorities," Endara 
said. He added that under the country's constitution, "we may not extradite any 
Panamanian citizen." 
</P>
<P>
In military action Sunday, U.S. troops discovered a cache of arms in a rented 
house near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of the city. 
Neighbors said the house had been rented by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cache included 300 G-3 rifles, 72,000 rounds of ammunition, 
at least 360 concussion grenades, about 300 AK-47 assault rifles with 20,000 
rounds of ammunition and 30 light anti-tank weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, three senior Panama Defense Forces officers turned themselves in 
to American troops. They were identified as Lt. Cols. Carlos Arosemena King, 
Daniel Delgado Diamante and Arnulfo Castrejon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States was apparently willing to allow Noriega to seek 
sanctuary in the Vatican's embassy, American authorities were determined that 
he not change his mind and walk out. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as American diplomats and officials were informed that Noriega was in 
the building, soldiers, a helicopter gunship, several light tanks and armored 
personnel carriers blocked the streets, sealing off the area at least four 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
The American soldiers, their faces totally covered with green camouflage paint 
and brandishing weapons from assault rifles to rocket launchers, prevented 
celebrating Panamanians from getting anywhere near Noriega's sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"We secured the hell out of the place," said one American source. "He is not 
leaving without us knowing about." 
</P>
<P>
But as cheering, clapping citizens and frantic journalists gathered at the 
barricades, an American UH-1 Huey helicopter gunship lifted off from a vacant 
lot across the street from the mansion. It appeared to be an escort for a 
caravan of diplomatic cars, including one bearing a U.S. Embassy license plate, 
that emerged from the Vatican embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation and rumor immediately had Noriega being kidnaped by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Laboa, as the senior serving diplomat in Panama, was to host 
a 4 p.m. reception for other envoys to meet the country's new foreign minister, 
Julio Linares. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa notified the invited guests, including American Ambassador Arthur Davis, 
but suggested that the meeting go on to avoid premature disclosure of Noriega's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Davis declined, but he sent an armored embassy car as security for Linares. 
Other diplomats did attend. Diplomatically, they did not ask to see Noriega and 
left about 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city began its celebration as news of what had happened spread. People 
lined Via Argentina, a major Panama City thoroughfare, and stood on balconies 
to bang kitchen pots and cheer for the Americans who set off the chain of 
events with their invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Panama can have a merry Christmas," one exultant Panamanian, Larry 
Larrinaga, exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy for my country," said Ruben Carles, chairman 
</P>
<P>
of the board of directors of La Prensa, a liberal newspaper closed by Noriega 
for most of its eight-year existence. "We will now gain our goal of getting rid 
of the military system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some expressed another sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been much better if he had shot himself or someone would have 
shot him," said a bitter businessman. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the reaction was happy, the people looking forward 
rather than complaining about the Noriega past. 
</P>
<P>
In the provincial town of Penonome, 95 miles west of the capital, stores 
reopened to sell liquor to the people who filled the city's square and streets 
in wild celebration. 
</P>
<P>
As 120 U.S. soldiers stood guard over an equal number of captured Noriega 
military supporters, the people chanted their praise for the American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are broke this Christmas but thanks to you gringos, we can now be happy," 
said Isaac Guardia, a mechanic who says he was impoverished by Noriega's rule. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Washington, President Bush declared himself very pleased with 
progress in the military situation in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good pre-Christmas report that I have received," Bush said after a 
briefing at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had dispatched Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Panama, but did 
not elaborate. A White House official said the trip was intended to boost the 
morale of the troops and to illustrate that the President, while proceeding 
with his own holiday plans, was closely in touch with the military and 
political situation here. Officials did not say how long Cheney would remain in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Concern 
</P>
<P>
American officials have been concerned about a political backlash in both the 
United States and Panama if it is determined the U.S. assault caused heavy 
civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for 
Latin America, acknowledged the figure could be as high as 1,000 Panamanians 
killed or injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that an early report that a Panama City hospital was full of hundreds 
of dead civilians turned out to be false. But, he added, "I don't mean to 
minimize the problem. There are clearly going to be civilian casualties, but I 
don't think we should speculate (on figures) based on rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Cheney acknowledged that the presence of a massive 
American occupation force in Panama was making it more difficult for President 
Endara to establish a credible democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said Saturday that news of the impending American invasion, which he 
received a day before American soldiers landed, was "like a kick in the head." 
He said he had made no prior plans for forming a government. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps Mr. Endara would say we are a mixed blessing," Cheney said. "We did 
what we did partly to stand up for democracy in Panama, but also to protect 
American interests and American lives in Panama. We have a legitimate right to 
be in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that some pro-Noriega paramilitary forces, called Dignity 
Battalions, were still "running loose in the streets, but the situation appears 
to be steadily improving." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the looting got out of hand after the invasion, Cheney said, "We 
didn't have any way to have people everywhere in Panama City at the same time. 
We sent in a large number of additional troops, but we had to focus in on 
specific targets." 
</P>
<P>
He said that many former members of the Panama Defense Forces were laying down 
their arms and that 1,000 of them had joined in efforts to restore civil order. 
"So, the situation does appear to be improving. It's not all over yet. I mean 
we still have a lot of work to do, but clearly we're in better shape today than 
at any point since the effort started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that U.S. troops would remain 
in Panama "as long as it takes to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
"We really ought not to put a date on it, because then we get into playing the 
old expectations game," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Aronson said that the chaos and looting that followed after the American 
military "neutralized" the PDF was regrettable, but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"Three months ago Hurricane Hugo hit St. Croix, Virgin Islands, which is U.S. 
territory. You saw the exact same pictures; in Detroit, in 1968; in Washington 
D.C. Wherever there is a temporary breakdown of law and order there's going to 
be a small criminal element who will go in and break a window and steal a 
television set. We don't minimize the loss; we obviously regret it. And it's 
not a happy occasion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Manuel A. Noriega became commander of the Panama Defense Forces Aug. 12, 1983, 
12 days after receiving his star as a brigadier general. He had risen through 
the ranks after joining the old National Guard in 1962. As a lieutenant 
colonel, he had headed the intelligence unit under the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, 
a military dictator who negotiated the Panama Canal treaties with the United 
States in the 1970s. He became a colonel and chief of the general staff in 
1982. Noriega defied a military rule and tradition when he refused to retire in 
1987, after 25 years of service. He was deposed Dec. 20 by invading U.S. 
troops.

PANAMA UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
Noriega 
</P>
<P>
Ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega turned himself in to the Vatican embassy in 
Panama City and asked for political asylum, U.S. officials announced. Earlier, 
four of Noriega's top commanders surrendered to U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
Fighting tapered off, with some Panamanians trying to clean up streets and put 
up Christmas decorations. U.S. troops discovered a huge cache of arms in a 
rented house near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of 
Panama City. Neighbors who tipped off the military said the house had been 
rented by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Local Government 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-backed President Guillermo Endara said that he hoped the Americans would 
be able to leave soon but that he wasn't optimistic. In Washington, President 
Bush said that American troops have accomplished "a real turnaround" in 
restoring law and order in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that U.S. casualties since Wednesday's invasion were 25 
American servicemen and two civilians killed, 281 servicemen wounded and one 
missing. U.S. figures on Panamanian casualties were 154 military dead and 113 
wounded, with 2,969 troops being held prisoner.
