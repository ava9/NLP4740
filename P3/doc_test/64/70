By ordering fewer than 2,000 U.S. troops to Panama, President Bush hopes to 
intensify pressure on Gen. Manuel A. Noriega without touching off a nationalist 
backlash either in Panama or the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they do not expect the action to force Noriega 
out of power any time soon, if at all. They also acknowledged that the various 
steps outlined Thursday by Bush constitute a minimal response to the fraud and 
violence that marked Sunday's aborted Panamanian election and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials and non-government experts agreed that the Bush program 
avoids the dangers inherent in a more forceful response. The President's plan 
was carefully measured to avoid feeding Latin American concern about Yankee 
interventionism. 
</P>
<P>
Although the soldiers and Marines being sent to Panama are combat-ready, Bush 
made it clear that their mission is to reinforce American troops already in 
Panama to protect American citizens and safeguard the Panama Canal. He made it 
clear that the forces will not intervene directly in Panama's political 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the President reaffirmed his support for the Panama Canal 
Treaties, which call for the United States to turn over full control of the 
canal to Panama at the end of this century. By rejecting the suggestions of 
some members of Congress that the United States abrogate the treaty, Bush 
avoided an action that non-government experts said would almost certainly turn 
public opinion in Panama against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"One must commend the President on not letting emotionalism run American policy 
as it did in the Reagan Administration," said Eva Loser, a Latin American 
policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. "It was important not to overreact and to stay within legal 
boundaries. The (Noriega) regime's propaganda machine has been charging that 
the United States wants to abrogate the treaty. Bush did not play into their 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latin Support Seen 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger added in a television 
interview: 
</P>
<P>
"The Latins are always going to be edgy about our response in the sense that 
they are always worried about intervention in the internal affairs of states in 
Latin America. In this particular case, however, I think it's fairly clear that 
there is going to be almost universal condemnation of Noriega's (election 
fraud), and I think we will find very substantial Latin American support for 
our response." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, U.S. action often has produced a nationalistic reaction throughout 
the region, with Latin Americans closing ranks behind nations facing a 
challenge from the north. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is expressed in terms of the United States against Noriega, that's a 
no-win situation for us," said Wayne S. Smith, adjunct professor of Latin 
American Studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International 
Studies. "The lead has to be taken by the Panamanians themselves and by the 
other Latin American governments." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said there is not much Washington can do by itself to dislodge Noriega, 
short of an invasion. But he said Noriega's position can be gradually eroded if 
Latin American nations join the United States in isolating Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining his program, Bush was careful not to promise early results. And 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, asked in a briefing if it would be 
acceptable to the United States if Noriega is still in power a month from now, 
replied: "I don't see why not." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Administration hinted it might take more forceful action 
later, with Bush saying, "If required, I do not rule out further steps." 
</P>
<P>
"This has to be a prelude to something," said Linda Robinson, an associate 
editor of the prestigious quarterly Foreign Affairs and an expert on Latin 
America. "They have to be seriously discussing the military option at this 
point."
