<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara is planning to announce 
this week an amnesty that will benefit 578 former officials of 
the former regime, according to official sources. 
  The list includes 75 former members, 510 former 
corregimiento 
representatives, former President Eric Arturo Delvalle; Juan B. 
Sosa, former ambassador to the United States; and Vice 
President-elect Gabriel Altamirano Duque [figures as published]. 
  The case of the 510 representatives exists because they 
appointed General Manuel Antonio Noriega as chief of government. 
The dossiers against Delvalle and Sosa are related to the 
investigations the second circuit prosecutor is conducting on 
alleged irregularities in the handling of $10.8 million from the 
funds the United States froze on Panama. The case against Tomas 
Gabriel Altamirano Duque concerns charges made by Omayra Correa, 
Panama City mayor-elect. 
  Concurrently, the assembly is debating an amnesty for 
political crimes. Legislator Raul Ossa has said the individuals 
in line to receive these benefits should only be those accused 
of violations against state security; otherwise, this amnesty 
would leave a door open to benefit those being investigated for 
common crimes. 
  Meanwhile, Miguel Bush, legislator from the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, has wanted to add an article to the draft 
amnesty so that it would exclude those charged with homicide and 
embezzlement. 
  A judiciary source has said the dossier against the former 
members of the General State Council includes: Manuel Solis 
Palma; Manuel Antonio Noriega; Francisco Rodriguez; Rodolfo 
Chiari De Leon; Jorge Ritter; Orville Goodin; Rene Bultron; Juan 
Bosco Bernal; Elmo Martinez Blanco; Darien Ayala; Cesar Martans; 
Jose Renan Esquivel; and Ricardo Bermudez. 
  It also includes Nander Pitty; Celso Carrizo; Carlos 
Villalaz; Olmedo Sanjur; Pascual Gonzalez; Virgilio Mirones; 
Rafael Arosemena; Azael Purcait; Jaime Simons; Francisco Sanchez 
Cardenas; Alejandro Vernaza; Aida de Gartner; Alberto Luis 
Tunon; Dario Fernandez; Dario Gonzalez; Carlos Orillac; Benjamin 
Colamarco; Tomas Noriega; Rafael Castrellon; and Gilberto Tunon. 
  Other former members of the General State Council are: Angel 
Jaen; Mario Luis Pitti; Luis Blanco; Cesar Montenegro; Bernardo 
Dominguez; Leovigildo Herrera; Euclides Tejada; Elvia de Ortiz; 
Dagoberto Lara; Ana Villa de Flores; Carlos Estrada; Veyra 
Remon; Victor Levy; Victoria de Robolt; Marcos Hughes; Jose 
Arauz; Jose Rodriguez; Marcos Mariscal; Alberto Arjona; Fermin 
Herrera; and Eufemia Laguna. 
  Also included in the dossiers are Julio Shaik; Jorge 
Bristan; 
Mateo Castillero; Arturo Diez; Augusto Valderrama; Aminta de 
Guillen; Nilson Espino; Hidalgo Fung; Abdiel Juliao; Eduardo 
Marin; Rafael Moreno; Paulino Romero; Jorge Tason; Aurea 
Torrijos; and Ligia Castro.
