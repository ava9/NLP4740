  [Text] Abu Dhabi--The deficit in the proposed UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] budget for 1994 has decreased in spite of the 
decrease in oil revenues as a result of lower crude oil prices. 
  Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for finance and 
industry affairs, disclosed that the deficit in the federal 
government's budget will decrease in 1994 by 322.6 million 
dirhams [UD] to UD1.3972 billion ($380 million) compared with 
UD1.720 billion ($468 million) in 1993. Al-Tayir stated that his 
ministry had passed the proposed draft budget along to the 
Council of Ministers that the Council will discuss tomorrow, 
Monday. 
  The 1994 budget is estimated at UD17.6172 billion ($4.8 
billion) compared with UD17.6309 billion ($4.804 billion), or an 
increase of only UD13.7 million ($4 million dollars). [sentence 
as published] 
  However, the important development that al-Tayir disclosed 
is 
the increase in private revenues in the federal government's 
budget for 1994, estimated at UD300 million ($81.7 million) more 
than 1993 revenues of UD15.911 billion ($4.335 billion), or 
UD16.22 billion ($4.420 billion) in the current year. 
  The minister did not disclose the sources for this increase 
in the new budget's resources, but financial sources indicate 
that a potential increase of private revenues for the government 
ministries and institutions is from fees and taxes that they 
receive from services offered to citizens. These are basically 
concentrated in the health, electricity, water and internal 
customs sectors. The electricity minister recently announced an 
increase in the electricity tariff to cover a large part of [the 
ministry's] losses. Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the largest Emirates in 
the state, participate in the federal budget with about 90 
percent of its total resources, according to an agreement 
reached on this matter in 1979. 
  The figures disclosed by the minister of state for finance 
and industry indicate that Abu Dhabi's and Dubai's participation 
in the 1994 budget did not decrease from that of 1993 despite 
the decrease in oil prices.
