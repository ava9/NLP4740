ahead - A 220,000 tonnes-a-year aluminium project

IT NOW seems that the Al-Mahdi aluminium smelter near Bandar Abbas in
southern Iran is definitely going to be built. Like most big projects, it
has spent a long time at the planning and early construction stages without
the backers feeling utterly certain that they will complete it.
But last week in Tehran the minister of mines and metals, Mr Hussein
Mahlouji, said that the project would be built 'unless something
extraordinary happens', and the managers on site now take it for granted
that 'we're building a smelter'.
The project is owned 60 per cent by the ministry of mines and metals and 40
per cent by the International Development Corporation of Dubai. The IDC, in
turn, is owned principally by the former United Arab Emirates' ambassador to
London, Mr Mahdi Al-Tajir, with the British contractor, George Wimpey, and
the Swiss metals trader, Marc Rich.
The intention is to build a smelter with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes, which
could be expanded to 330,000 tonnes. Actual construction costs are estimated
at Dollars 1.6bn, with financing costs and other spending, before full
production is reached, consuming a further Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.
So far, camp buildings, apartment blocks, compacting and foundations have
been completed and work on the smelter buildings is expected to start in the
next few weeks. Wimpey is concerned mainly with design and project
management. The actual building to date has been done by Iranian
sub-contractors, an arrangement described by Mahdi Sajjad, who runs IDC, as
'very, very successful'.
Work on the pot rooms in the later stages of construction will be done by
Wimpey with technical help from the Dubai Aluminium Company, which runs the
successful smelter in Dubai. Dubal is selling its technology and generally
advising on the project.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department in London, which put Iran 'on cover'
in December last year, has given Wimpey an indication in principle that it
will back work on Al-Mahdi. But the ECGD has held back from giving actual
guarantees because it worries that the smelter is not in the Iranian
five-year plan and it wants to be sure that there will not be changes in the
project. Now that the smelter has been given the approval of the Iranian
Central Bank and Finance Ministry, as well as the Planning Ministry, the
ECGD is said to be sounding very positive.
The European credit insurance agencies are already issuing guarantees on
exports of equipment, which will be principally German.
The owners feel confident that their smelter will be profitable. Although it
will be far from its source of alumina (aluminium oxide), which will be
Australia, and from its market, which presumably will be mainly the
fast-developing economies of the Far East, the smelter will benefit from
very cheap power, which is the biggest cost in aluminium production.
Mr Sajjad said the Iranians had 'made a bold decision to use their gas
without being too sensitive on how they price it'. The government has been
much more interested in having the smelter as a focus for development and a
source of employment than in extracting every last cent it can from its gas
reserves, which are by far the biggest in the Gulf region.
The smelter project will have its own 450MW power station fed from the
Sarkhoun gas field, which will be a tied source. It is also guaranteed 200MW
from a large 1,200MW power station nearby. The gas and electricity supplies
are priced at levels that will give the smelter the same cost per megawatt
for both its power sources, and, although neither the Iranian government nor
IDC are saying what the prices are, they have made it known that they will
be the cheapest outside Canada. They say the price will be comparable with
hydro-electric power, which in Canada costs some 0.3 to 0.5 US cents per
kilowatt hour.
If aluminium prices have recovered to Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 1,600 a tonne
by the mid-1990s, the owners say they will be perfectly happy. Prices have
fallen from Dollars 1,400 to Dollars 1,500 a tonne two years ago to Dollars
1,300 a tonne, and at one point dipped below Dollars 1,000 a tonne. But the
project's backers believe general trend of world demand, now just over 14m
tonnes a year, is strongly upwards, and everybody concerned is confident
that there will be a place for the smelter's production in the market. A
recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggested prices of Dollars
1,750 to Dollars 1,850 a tonne by 1995.
In the past year some old production capacity has been closed and the owners
believe that, when the recession ends, there will be demand for extra output
equivalent to at least two new Al-Mahdi smelters a year. 'You can't build
smelters as fast as that,' said Mr Sajjad.
The backers of Al-Mahdi do not feel threatened by their friends at Dubal,
which has an output of 243,000 tonnes a year, or by the expansion programme
under way to raise capacity at the other Gulf smelter, Aluminium Bahrain
(Alba), from 210,000 tonnes to more than 400,000 tonnes. Nor are they
concerned about a project for a smelter at Yanbu, in Saudi Arabia, where the
backers are still negotiating with the government on loan terms and gas
prices.
In case the market does not evolve as predicted, the Al-Mahdi backers say
they are aiming to make a very high quality ingot, so that at least they
will always be able to sell what they produce. Achieving this requires good
management and the right working discipline, rather than extra investment.
It will be a challenge for a later stage of the project.
