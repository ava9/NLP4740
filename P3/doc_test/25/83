THE sentencing yesterday of Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former head of treasury at
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, represents one of
the first prosecution victories in a series of criminal and civil court
cases related to the bank that are pending around the world.
Investigations across the globe have moved grindingly slowly since the
closure of the bank in July 1991 and have already led in the US to the
acquittal of Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer accused of profiting from
loans given by BCCI to enable him to buy shares in First American, the bank
of which he was president.
The three main spheres of investigation are in the UK, US and Abu Dhabi.
The UK has three outstanding cases arising out of investigations by the
Serious Fraud Office. All the hearings are scheduled to begin in January.
They involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former
chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi,
former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an
assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive.
The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. The
warrants cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor, believed to be in
Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank,
and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry
are thought to be living in Pakistan.
A number of indictments have been lodged in the US against BCCI officials
but Mr Robert Morgantheau, the New York district attorney who has been
spearheading investigations in the US, has had little success in bringing
any of those charged to justice.
Indictments were brought in the US in July last year for fraud, bribery,
conspiracy, larceny and racketeering related to BCCI against Mr Agha Hasan
Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder, Mr Naqvi and Mr Pharaon.
However, none of these men is likely to be extradited or to return to the US
while the charges remain.
A similar difficulty in relation to Mr Abedi faces prosecutors in Abu Dhabi,
the majority shareholder in BCCI, which brought charges against him last
month. He lives in Pakistan, and there is no extradition treaty between the
two countries.
More progress appears to have been made in Abu Dhabi which, after a two-year
investigation, has charged 13 senior BCCI officers, including Mr Naqvi, who
faces 36 years in jail if convicted on all counts. Preliminary hearings have
been set for October 9.
The criminal investigations are running parallel to a series of civil
actions launched by BCCI's liquidators on behalf of its creditors. On
October 27 the Touche Ross liquidator is hoping to secure final approval for
a joint compensation agreement with Abu Dhabi in which the emirate would
contribute between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.42bn) in return
for the liquidators' sacrificing the right to sue it.
In the longer term three other legal actions launched by the liquidators
could generate billions of dollars. The first - unlikely to take place for
at least five years - was brought in London against accountants Price
Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney (the latter is now part of Ernst &amp; Young) as
auditors to BCCI.
The second, also brought in London, is against the Bank of England as lead
regulator to BCCI. More than 5,000 depositors have assigned their claims to
the liquidators, giving a strong mandate to proceed. The Bank has still to
serve its defence in the case.
The third, also to be heard in the UK, is against the National Commercial
Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief
operating officer.
Related court orders obtained by the liquidators in connection with
recoveries include a worldwide freeze on the assets of Sheikh Khalid and Mr
Haroon Rashid Khalon, a retired banker, granted by the High Court in London.
Separate legal action remains in the way of the liquidators. Three BCCI
depositors have appealed in Luxembourg against court approval of the
compensation agreement on the grounds that they believe Abu Dhabi should be
sued. A decision is expected at the end of October.
Meanwhile First American Bancshares, acquired by BCCI in contravention of US
law, in June became the first litigant to sue Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan
al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The Dollars 1.5bn suit alleges that the
leader and his government were to blame for the bank's failure as the
dominant and controlling shareholder since 1972.
Price Waterhouse faces two other civil suits. It is named as one of 77
defendants in a class action brought in California. The case was at first
dismissed and is now under appeal, with written pleadings complete and oral
hearings estimated to take place within five to 15 months.
It is also named in a case brought in London by two Omani depositors who
claimed they relied on the audited BCCI accounts to deposit Dollars 600,000
with the bank. Statements of claim have been issued.
