  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, March 12 (AFP) -- 
Jordan is trying to re-enter lucrative Gulf markets after more 
than three years of estrangement caused by its alleged support 
for Iraq against Kuwait, officials said on Friday [11 March]. 
  More than 20 Jordanian companies will display clothes, 
furniture, medicine and other products at an international 
exhibition in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this 
month, they said. 
  "The participation in this fair and other fairs is aimed at 
restoring Jordanian manufacturers' share of the Gulf market to 
the pre-Gulf crisis level," a spokesman for the participating 
companies said in a statement. 
  "These non-traditional markets require a different set of 
marketing and manufacturing standards and our manufacturers are 
trying to meet them. In terms of quality and service, most 
companies have undergone restructuring while revamping their 
marketing practices to face new challenges." 
  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states were among the biggest 
markets for Jordanian products before they halted dealing over 
its alleged sympathy with Iraq. Amman has denied backing Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait and has tried to several times to 
restore links but has been rebuffed. 
  The six members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
Bahrain 
and the UAE-- were also the main financial backers of Jordan 
before the war, providing more than 12 billion dollars in aid 
and billions more in remittances. 
  A suspension of Gulf aid aggravated Jordan's economic 
problems, which include a debt of around eight billion dollars. 
  The Jordan Trade Association, the country's main export 
promoter representing more than 80 firms, is spearheading the 
participation in the March 16-20 fair in Dubai, the organisers, 
al-Fajir company, said.
