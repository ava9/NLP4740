The United Arab Emirates, in common with many Gulf states, is affected by
the continuing low oil revenues. So for the past few months there has been
talk of privatisation and the introduction of independent power producers
(IPPs).
Privatisation, it is argued, would release funds for other projects, cut
bureaucracy and speed decision-making.
The opposing arguments are practical and emotional. They include the
difficulties of private sector involvement in a complex power-producing
system and a previously unchallenged policy of cheap electricity for the
people.
But now things are changing. An official announcement that the government is
to finance a study on the privatisation of public utilities came on the
heels of the federal Ministry of Electricity &amp; Water's (MEW) hint that it
will phase out subsidies.
Tariffs have remained unchanged since federation in 1971, with no regard to
power costs or inflation. Electricity prices will now begin to be raised -
initially from two US cents to a still very low three cents a unit.
Close attention has been paid to what the neighbours are doing. British Gas
in Bahrain and international group UPGI in Oman are already building gas
turbine plants. In Qatar the government has set up a private company which
will eventually run all its power stations.
Rumours have been circulating in Dubai that private sector companies are
ready to construct power plants on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) and
build-own-operate (BOO) systems, so popular in the Far East.
It is not surprising that Dubai - the long-established trading centre of the
region - should be the prime mover on privatisation since it has four
separate power and water authorities.
The UAE was formed by the federation of seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Fujeirah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Qwain. Before federation
each emirate had its own utility and it was assumed that the newly set-up
MEW would take responsibility for the whole country.
It never came about. The three large emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and
Sharjah still run their own electricity organisations while MEW looks after
the four smaller emirates which have comparatively little income and very
scattered populations.
MEW's budget this year is around Dollars 100m, according to minister Humaid
bin Nasser Al Owais. This will provide another 150 megawatts in the northern
emirates which the federal ministry administrates.
MEW is headquartered in the federal capital, the city of Abu Dhabi, under
minister Al Owais. The deputy minister, Saaed Majid Al Shamsi, works mainly
from Dubai. 'MEW is politically responsible for electricity and water,' he
said.
'We represent the UAE internationally - for instance on negotiations for the
proposed Gulf grid project. We also cooperate with the electricity companies
in the three large emirates - especially on tariffs which are highly
subsidised throughout the country.'
Of the UAE's entire total installed capacity of 5,500MW, some 900MW is
controlled by MEW and is mostly gas turbines with 130MW from diesel
generating sets in the more remote areas. It is also responsible for a 132
kilovolt transmission network which is being upgraded by UK consultants
Ewbank Preece.
Power in Abu Dhabi emirate (including the city) is looked after by its own
Water and Electricity Department (WED). The WED is now in the process of
adding some 1,000MW to its present generating capacity of 2,440MW. By far
the largest slice of this will come from the Dollars 1.8bn 732MW Al Taweelah
B power and desalination plant - an extension to the original 253MW Al
Taweelah A commissioned in 1985.
Al Taweelah B is being built by a consortium headed by Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swedish-Swiss multinational, and including ABB Kraftwerke of Mannheim,
SAE Sadelmi of Italy and Six Construct of Belgium. Tractebel of Belgium is
the consulting engineer for the project which will be the world's largest
power and desalination station when it comes on stream in 1996. There is
certain to be yet another extension and ABB looks to be a frontrunner for
this contract when it is announced.
Other WED power projects under construction include Medina Zayed (60MW), the
200MW Abu Dhabi main power station extension and 100MW at Al Ain.
A 200MW gas turbine station with desalination plant is also being built in
Mifra by a consortium led by Ansaldo Energia with gas turbines by Siemens.
Deutsche Babcock of Germany has a Dollars 74m contract to undertake power
station maintenance and refurbishment work. WED has commissioned UK
consultants Kennedy &amp; Donkin (recently merged with the US Rust organisation)
to study existing transmission networks and make recommendations for future
demand. Ewbank Preece is overseeing two new 220kv links and the enhancement
of an existing 220kv overhead line system.
Proposals to build a load despatch centre to monitor all the water and
electricity flows in Abu Dhabi emirate have finally been accepted by WED.
The Dollars 90m contract has been awarded to ABB.
Electricite de France (EdF) is consultant for the project which will involve
a regional centre in Al Ain. Power Measurement of Australia is supplying
instruments to monitor the grid system.
Sharjah is in a construction boom reminiscent of Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sharjah Electricity and Water Department
(SEWD) currently produces some 700MW, nearly all from its Layyah station in
Sharjah town. Two General Electric Frame 9E gas turbine units and additional
desalination plant are now being installed.
This will help to meet the high summer peak when the 24-hour air
conditioning demand often overwhelms the emirate's ability to cope with a
rapidly increasing population attracted by the rapid building programme.
Distribution remains a problem on a network which started life supplying
power to the long-departed British forces base and airfield. A new link is
to be built from the Sajaa gas field to Layyah and further major power line
installations are planned.
Dubai has seen a phenomenal growth in its power supply since the first
lights were switched on in 1961. The recently set-up Dubai Electricity &amp;
Water Authority (DEWA) has grown out of the Dubai Electricity Company which
dates back to 1959.
Capacity was then just 1.4MW from privately owned generators. Now it is
nearly 2,000MW and increasing, as more plants come on stream this year. In
March, the 457MW Jebel Ali G power and desalination station built by a
Siemens-led consortium was fully commissioned.
Jebel Ali E is undergoing a Dollars 81m conversion to combined cycle by a
consortium led by ABB Kraftwerke. Kennedy &amp; Donkin is consultant for the
project which includes ABB SAE Sadelmi for civil works and boiler supply by
Combustion Engineering (Italiana).
The extension will add two waste heat recovery boilers to the GE Frame 9E
gas turbines installed in 1992. The much-talked-about Jebel Ali H is almost
certain to appear in DEWA's plans before the year is out.
Dubai's primary 132kv transmission system voltage has been reinforced by a
400kv network utilising the latest technology.
The construction work was undertaken by the National Thermal Power Company
of India (NTPC) which has recently opened an office in Dubai to supervise
its increased workload in the emirates.
Last year, DEWA was frequently in danger of having to cut power supply. This
would have been a severe blow for the extremely efficient utility and for
the people of Dubai who enjoy a highly-sophisticated lifestyle.
Kennedy &amp; Donkin is advising DEWA on upgrading its control and management
systems but the possibility of black-outs has forced power engineers into
thinking that yet another large station, either combined cycle or steam
turbines, must be sanctioned. It could be the UAE's first IPP.
