BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HE'S A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR VILLA PARK

Until coming to Villa Park High School, Gavin Arroyo was only used to taking 
his time in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Tustin's Southern California Swim Club, Arroyo specializes in 
such distance events as the 1,000 and 1,650 meters -- long races that take 
endurance and require pacing. 
</P>
<P>
But Arroyo has been asked to pick up his pace for Villa Park's team. He has 
become a sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first started swimming sprints for us, his mom was concerned," Villa 
Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich said. "She said he was doing so well as a distance 
swimmer. But we thought he had the ability to do the shorter races." 
</P>
<P>
He does. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, The Times' athlete of the week, won the 200-yard freestyle and the 
500-yard freestyle at the Foothill Invitational swim meet Saturday. He also 
swam the anchor leg of the 400 freestyle relay, which Villa Park won. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't expecting to do that well," said Arroyo, who was named the 
boys' swimmer of the meet. "There were so many good swimmers there. And they 
were even faster than I thought they would be." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's most impressive performance was in the relay. He swam his 100-yard leg 
in 46.18 seconds and overtook a San Marino swimmer down the stretch to give 
Villa Park the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming the sprints is so different," said Arroyo, a junior. "Distance 
swimming is endurance. In sprinting, you rely much more on reflexes." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has participated in sprints before, but he hadn't competed in one since 
he was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I swam the breaststroke until I was 10, but it wasn't working out so I 
switched to distance," he said. "For the last five years, that's all I've 
swam." 
</P>
<P>
Until Ehrlich needed a sprinter for his relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has adapted quickly to the role. His workouts change during the high 
school season because he doesn't need to log as many yards in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
He also credits water polo with improving his sprinting skills. Arroyo was a 
member of the Villa Park team last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Water polo is just like sprint swimming," he said. "You have to start swimming 
so quickly that you don't have time to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo has become so good in the sprints, Ehrlich said he has a good chance of 
breaking the Southern Section record in the 100-yard freestyle (45.54). Mike 
Kelly of Fountain Valley set the record in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had other high school coaches come up to me and say that Gavin could 
break the 100 record," Ehrlich said. "Even (Fountain Valley Coach) Ray Bray, 
who coached Kelly, said Gavin had a good chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think before Gavin is done at Villa Park, he'll have that record." 
</P>
<P>
