A team of bicyclists that included a San Juan Capistrano man zipped to victory 
after departing Orange County last weekend in the first cross-country test of 
high-tech bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Another team, featuring Seal Beach bike shop owner Greg Miller, abandoned the 
race Thursday with about 130 miles to go, despite leading most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Led by ultra-endurance cycling champ Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook and his 
brother, James, of San Juan Capistrano, the four-man squad took turns piloting 
a bike named Lightning to the finish line in New York City's Battery Park, 
covering the 3,000-mile race course in 5 days, 1 hour and 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The team, riding the bike Gold Rush America, was passed by Lightning on 
Thursday morning and then took a wrong turn onto a heavily traveled highway in 
Pennsylvania. The team members decided to pull out because of concerns for 
their safety in the traffic, according to Trisha Nerney, a spokeswoman for the 
Race Across America. 
</P>
<P>
Long a test of endurance for cyclists on traditional bikes, the Race Across 
America this year introduced a new division for such high-tech vehicles as 
Lightning and Gold Rush America. Pete Penseyres won the endurance test twice 
before switching to the "human-powered vehicle" division this year.
