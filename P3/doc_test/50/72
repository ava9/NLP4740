James Toback's 1983 Exposed (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a drenchingly 
romantic thriller lots stronger in style than credibility in which an ambiguous 
angel of death (Nastassja Kinski) captivates a concert violinist (Rudolf 
Nureyev) and also a Paris-based terrorist (Harvey Keitel). 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 Annie Hall (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is landmark Woody Allen, a 
declaration of maturity and a witty semi-autobiographical romance in which he 
stars with Diane Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie Crossing to Freedom (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a World War II 
drama starring Peter O'Toole as a reluctant hero intent on leading a band of 
French children to safety in England. 
</P>
<P>
Twin Peaks (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the new David Lynch TV movie, which 
launches the series of the same name and lays bare the dark underside of a 
small Pacific Northwestern town. 
</P>
<P>
King of the Gypsies (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) brought Peter Maas' 
engrossing 1978 multi-generational saga to the screen in synthetic, all-star 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Capital News (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie/series pilot set in a 
Washington newspaper and starring Lloyd Bridges and Helen Slater. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 That Was Then, This Is Now (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a sincere 
film about two delinquents starring Craig Sheffer and Emilio Estevez (the 
latter adapted the script from an S. E. Hinton novel). 
</P>
<P>
Forbidden Nights (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Melissa 
Gilbert and based on American teacher Judith Shapiro's experiences in China. 
</P>
<P>
Switching Channels (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), that frenetic, misfired 
1988 attempt to update "The Front Page" to the cable business, traps Kathleen 
Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in an enervating, joyless endurance 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Julien Temple's Earth Girls Are Easy (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a 
jazzy, snazzy 1988 rock musical about a dumped-on Valley Girl (Geena Davis) who 
ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, Damon 
Wayans) around town after they crash-land in her swimming pool. Fluff, but fun. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different British athletes who competed 
in the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Break of Dawn (Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is an awkward yet moving 
biography of Pedro Gonzalez (Oscar Chavez), a Mexican singer who became an 
influential recording and radio star whose career ran afoul of corrupt, 
exploitative Anglo politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Stick (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) took a gem of an Elmore Leonard 
novel and turned it into a mediocre Burt Reynolds vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Like all anthology comedies, the 1987 Amazon Women on the Moon (Channel 5 
Friday at 8 p.m.) is a hit-and-miss affair, with the hits outweighing the 
misses to yield an amiable enough diversion. 
</P>
<P>
Reckless (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a shallow, irresponsible 1984 
feature teaming then newcomer Aidan Quinn as a small-town Brando-Dean type 
entangled with bored rich girl Daryl Hannah.
