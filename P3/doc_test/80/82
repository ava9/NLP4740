FT  19 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Pregnant woman illegally dismissed -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman who was dismissed from her job for becoming pregnant was unlawfully
discriminated against on grounds of her sex, the European Court of Justice
held last week.
The case concerned the employment and dismissal of a British woman, Mrs
Webb. She had been hired to replace another employee who would be taking
maternity leave. This leave would not begin for six months, and it was
planned that Mrs Webb should undergo training during that time. It was
envisaged that Mrs Webb should continue to work for the company after the
return of the other employee from leave. Some three weeks after starting
work, it was confirmed that Mrs Webb was pregnant. A week later, she was
dismissed for becoming pregnant. Mrs Webb brought proceedings before the
industrial tribunal, alleging sex discrimination contrary to the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975.
The industrial tribunal dismissed Mrs Webb's case, finding that there had
not been direct sex discrimination, in that the real reason for her
dismissal was not her pregnancy but the anticipated inability to carry out
the primary task for which she had been recruited - to cover the job of the
other employee while the latter was on maternity leave.
According to the industrial tribunal, if a man had been recruited for the
same purpose and he had told the employer that he would be absent for a
comparable period to the likely absence of Mrs Webb, he too would have been
dismissed. The tribunal also found that there had been no indirect sex
discrimination. Although more women were likely to be unable to do the job
for which they had been recruited because of the possibility of pregnancy,
the employer had shown that the reasonable needs of its business required
that the person recruited be available during the other employee's maternity
leave.
Mrs Webb's appeals to the employment appeal tribunal and court of appeal
were both unsuccessful. Mrs Webb then appealed to the House of Lords. The
court decided on the basis of ECJ case law that it had to construe the
applicable national legislation, so as to accord with the provisions of the
relevant EC directive. It sought a preliminary ruling from the European
Court of Justice.
The Court first emphasised that the purpose of the relevant EC directive was
to put into effect throughout the European Community the principle of equal
treatment for men and women as regards access to employment. The directive
made it clear that equal treatment meant there should be no direct or
indirect sex discrimination.
The Court reiterated its jurisprudence in this area: first, that the
dismissal of a female worker on account of pregnancy constituted direct sex
discrimination and, second, that the directive in question recognised the
legitimacy, in terms of the equal treatment principle, of both protecting a
women's biological condition during and after pregnancy and of protecting
the special relationship between a women and a child in the period after
childbirth.
The Court further held that notice should also be taken of a recent
directive, which was not due to be implemented into national law until
October 1994. This directive prohibited the dismissal of pregnant women in
the period from the beginning of their pregnancy to the end of their
maternity leave.
The Court then held that there was no question of comparing the situation of
a pregnant woman incapable of fulfilling the task for which she was
recruited with that of a man similarly incapable for medical or other
reasons. Pregnancy was not comparable with a pathological condition.
Further, the protection offered by Community law to a woman during pregnancy
could not be dependent on whether her presence at work during maternity was
essential to the functioning of the company.
Thus termination of a non-fixed-term contract on grounds of an employee's
pregnancy could not be justified by the fact she was temporarily prevented
from performing the work for which she was employed.
