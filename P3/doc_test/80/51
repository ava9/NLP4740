Set in the future, "The Amendment" begins in New Orleans where abortion 
conservatives are celebrating their victory: the ratification of a 
constitutional amendment denying all women in America the option of legal and 
safe abortions. Until recently, this premise seemed remote, perhaps even 
contrived. However, the passage in Louisiana legislature of an almost identical 
statute gives "The Amendment" a chilling prescience. 
</P>
<P>
The novel turns on a plot to kidnap First Lady Mary Morgan, leader of the 
Rights for the Unborn League, and to extort from her and the League the huge 
sum that will be required to set up an underground that will provide American 
women safe abortions in Sweden. Most readers will already have strong emotions 
and opinions on the subject of abortion. Author Sue Robinson, a former United 
Press International and Associated Press reporter, surely knows that their 
intense feelings will help carry this story and hold it together. 
</P>
<P>
The book exploits a white hats/black hats, David-and-Goliath mentality. The 
narrow-minded injustice and hypocrisy of the league engages the reader's own 
sense of vulnerability. A Southern-backwater sort of evil fills the reader with 
suspense: How will the league, now at the height of its power, be stopped? 
</P>
<P>
We know -- and hope we are wrong -- that young, innocent Hilary Foster, and the 
courageous physician who has risked his career to help her, will die at the 
hands of one of the league's back-street patrols that search out and destroy 
illegal abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Thus set up, I accepted the proposition that Hilary's unconventional but 
heretofore law-abiding mother will kidnap the First Lady. I wanted to know 
whether Mrs. Foster would elude the cynical Jack Riley, the league's mercenary 
bloodhound, who sniffs out her scheme. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to side with Robinson's good guys, who also include a warm-hearted 
nurse in love with the murdered doctor/musician who, we are reminded, will play 
the dulcimer no more; the bright, capable Elizabeth McKinley, who suddenly 
finds meaning in life in avenging her best friend's death; a respectable 
girls'-school dean who risks her own position (Jean Harris with a good cause?) 
to help young ladies in need of abortions. Never mind that these characters are 
white, affluent, educated and very well-connected, or that their possible 
success will most likely benefit their sisters who are similarly situated. 
</P>
<P>
The bad-guy league members are the kinds of sanctimonious uglies we love to 
hate. Robinson pointedly suggests at the outset that they are contemptible: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . First Lady Mary Holt Morgan's voice vibrated to a high- fever pitch, 
soaring on hot-fevered wings across the high golden ceiling of the Louisiana 
Superdome, reaching out to the multitudes gathered there, their sweat-streaked 
bodies jammed tightly into every high-backed bleacher seat . . . their hot, 
shining eyes were fastened on the podium on the ramrod-straight, triumphant 
figure of the First Lady of the United States . . . the sweat of this exultant 
capacity crowd reeked not of the sour, salted crust of fatted perspiration, it 
ran sweet instead, sweet and pure as only the mother's milk of the righteous is 
sweet and pure . . . Saint Mary of the terrible swift sword of righteousness . 
. . Saint Mary, the glorious blond Madonna of the forces for life." 
</P>
<P>
Readers familiar with Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" may be reminded 
of Serena Joy, another evangelical figure whose zeal in saving the unborn also 
is equaled only by her own self-deception and barrenness. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's overwrought and peculiarly repetitive style has a distracted -- and 
distracting -- life of its own. The volume of images (heat, lights, circles, 
mirrors, eyes, darkness, and especially sweat) stupefy like a night of restless 
dreams. Repetition of names, words, phrases and syntax, a mannerism currently 
practiced with success by Joan Didion, often seems to abduct the author 
herself, leaving the reader in a confusion of pointless echoes and mixed 
metaphors: ". . . It was Jonathan's eyes that startled Elizabeth. They were an 
extremely light blue, an almost transparent blue, as if lights were on behind 
them, and set in Jonathan's slender, aquiline face, and punctuated by his light 
eyelashes and eyebrows and his light-blond hair, his light eyes seemed to 
glitter across a long distance at Elizabeth, glittering transparently like 
clear water in bright sun. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Readers in search of an examination of the issue of abortion or the subtleties 
of sex and politics will not linger over "The Amendment" -- obviously. In fact, 
this novel is so generic that any of a number of other issues -- gun control, 
for instance -- could provoke equal emotional intensity for readers and provide 
a backdrop for this plot. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson relieves the reader of any responsibility for logic or consideration 
of diverse views and claims -- not to mention the broader contemplation of the 
meaning of life or the taking of it. The shape of our thinking on the matter of 
abortion and other gender issues and its implications is far better exposed in 
"The Handmaid's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
"The Amendment" entertains in the mechanical way a bizarre amusement park 
attraction entertains: a ride in the gloom accompanied by lots of special 
effects and action, but, in the daylight an experience that would be easy to 
forget were it not for its particular relevance to our darkest fears. 
</P>
<P>
It's summertime. For a quick thrill, take "The Amendment" on the airplane or to 
the beach and pass it on to a friend. With that idea in mind, more practical 
abortion liberals may want to wait for the paperback edition, and, meanwhile, 
write to their legislators.
