Every year, in preparation for Aug. 26, the anniversary of the passage of 
women's suffrage, I gather together a list of those people who have done the 
most in the past 12 months to slow the progress of women. In deference to our 
foremothers, I then with great fanfare dispense the Equal Rites Award. 
</P>
<P>
This year, even without such perennial winners as Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese. 
</P>
<P>
The competition was every bit as keen as ever. And so without further ado, the 
envelopes, please. 
</P>
<P>
We begin with the ever-popular Raging Hormonal Imbalance Award. This 
testosterone special goes to none other than Mike Tyson for his many acts in 
and out of the ring and most especially for his boy-talk relayed by 
buddy-author Jose Torres: "I like to hurt women when I make love to them. I 
like to hear them scream with pain . . . It gives me pleasure." Mike's denial? 
"I don't have any problems dating anybody. Thank God." To Mike, we send a glass 
of warm milk, an estrogen tablet and a lonely Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
As for high-flyers, The Male-Adjusted Mogul Prize goes with deep regrets to Al 
Neuharth, the retired founder of USA Today. After years sheltered in a 
corporate jet, Al is back to reality complaining that flight attendants are no 
longer young, single and nubile, but are "aging women who are tired of their 
jobs or flighty young men . . . ." His solution? "Bring back the skygirls." Our 
prize? A second career for Neuharth: "I'm Al. Fly me." 
</P>
<P>
While we are talking images, the hotly contested Ms-Guided Madison Avenue Award 
must go to the folks who penned the Camel campaign. They offered a set of 
instructions for Camel men out to pick up women: "Run into the water, grab 
someone and drag her back to the shore. . . . The more she kicks and screams, 
the better." We send them a plaque: Warning: This ad may be dangerous for your 
product's health. 
</P>
<P>
A special Entrepreneur With an Attitude Award goes to Harry E. Figgie Jr, 
chairman of Figgie International, who told Fortune magazine, "You don't build a 
company like this with lace on your underwear." To him we ship a special 
catalogue full of Victoria's Secrets for Success. Try it. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the Blind Justice Award. This year there were so many contestants the 
award is being shared by two of the jurists who labored mightily for 
recognition. One goes to the New York judge who, in a flight of sensitivity, 
gave Don Lu Chen five years probation after he killed his wife with a hammer. 
The man was Chinese, the wife was unfaithful, the judge explained: "He was a 
product of his culture." To him we send a misfortune cookie. 
</P>
<P>
The other goes to an equally understanding judge in Michigan who lightened the 
sentence of a convicted rapist to three years' probation and $200 compensation. 
The judge explained that he didn't want to prevent the rapist from achieving 
his goal: becoming a police officer. We give this judge a new phone number: 
911. 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think it's just the American legal system that has gone awry, a 
special mention goes winging its way to Korea where a woman was convicted and 
sentenced to six months in jail for biting off the tongue of a rapist. We send 
the judge a booklet titled "The Korean Art of Self-Defense." The pages are 
blank. 
</P>
<P>
On now to the Dubious Equality Award for the woman who fought the hardest for 
the most questionable achievement. This year it goes to Roseanne Barr for her 
effort to prove women, too, can dump on men: "You may marry the man of your 
dreams, ladies, but 15 years later you are married to a reclining chair that 
burps." We send her a liberated laugh-track. Silent. 
</P>
<P>
The G-String for Gratuitous Sex was pulled out of the closet this year and will 
be sent post-haste to Life magazine for its June cover story: "Hurrah for the 
Bra." This titillating anniversary issue offered 100 years of pulchritude 
disguised as history. To them, we send a shirt and a story idea: Hurrah for the 
Jock Strap. 
</P>
<P>
Now on to the International Backlash Award, which has gone in previous years to 
assorted ayatollahs. This year it goes to Japan's prime minister, Sousuke Uno, 
the guy with the geisha, and to his agricultural minister, Hisao Horinouchi, 
who said, "It is wrong for women to come to the forefront of politics." We send 
them no prize because they already got what they deserved: defeat at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Success at the cash register has brought the winner of the Sexism in Song Prize 
to our notice. This prize has shifted from various hard-rockers to the rap 
group N.W.A., which in lyrics too rank to repeat here has advocated a use 'em 
and throw 'em away approach to women. We give them a one-way ticket to the 
women's museum at Seneca Falls. This includes a trip over the falls in a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a prize is surely due to that marketing genius who has found a novel 
product to keep the male ego inflated. So the Macho in Merchandizing Award goes 
to David Mayer of Mayers Lab for creating Maxx (sic), a condom that is 25% 
larger than the others. To Mr. Mayer we send the perfect accompaniment to Maxx: 
helium.
