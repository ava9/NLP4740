WOMEN POWER IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice president in 1984, the "women's vote" was 
billed as the sleeping giant that would awaken and save the Democratic Party. 
But the women's vote that year turned out to be a nonhappening. It was a 
different story for state treasurer Ann Richards of Texas this week. "Woman 
power," if you will, is considered a decisive factor in her Democratic 
gubernatorial primary victory -- even after a bruising campaign that could 
serve as the model for how low politics can sink. 
</P>
<P>
While there continues to be difficulty harnessing the women's vote in a 
national U.S. election, gubernatorial campaigns are proving time and again to 
be susceptible to the politics of gender. Specifically, women voters respond 
strongly to issues that cross ideological lines, such as the right to choose 
whether to have a child and personal safety issues like crime. In Texas, 
Richards clearly hopes to capitalize on her advocacy of the right to choose an 
abortion. She now faces a tough fight in the general election against 
millionaire opponent Clayton Williams Jr. But surely he'll gain no points with 
women for a stupid remark -- for which he later apologized -- that compared bad 
weather to rape: "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that raises the question of how will the gender mix play in 
California? Will former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, billed in 
commercials as "tough and caring," be able to hold onto her 2-to-1 poll lead 
with women? Especially when her Democratic primary opponent, Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, has a record on women's issues that is probably more 
conventionally in line than Feinstein's with the thinking of most feminists and 
Democratic Party activists? We wouldn't venture to guess. But the increasing 
opportunities for female and male candidates to face off are certain to make 
for more races where a few more male and female stereotypes can be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there's a broader stereotype -- this one about politicians -- 
that the Texas primary did not shatter. The primary between Richards and Atty. 
Gen. Jim Mattox illustrated, in almost cartoon strokes, that men and women are 
equally capable of stooping to conquer. Mattox started it, insinuating without 
any proof that Richards, a recovering alcoholic, was also once a cocaine 
addict. She shot back by pointing out that Mattox had been indicted on bribery 
charges, without mentioning his acquittal. Then it got even dirtier. As 
California politicians watched the Texas campaign, we can only hope that they 
exorcised whatever mudslinging impulses they may have.
