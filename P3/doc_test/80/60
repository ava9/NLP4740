<F P=106> [Statement issued by the FSLN to mark "this month of the </F>
60th anniversary of Augusto Cesar Sandino's death, as well as 
the upcoming special FSLN Congress, responding to the mandate of 
the Sandinist Assembly and the desire of militants to increase 
reflection and debate on the nature of our party"; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] views 
the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the Army 
and police as the fruit of the RPS [expansion unknown], and it 
endorses the subordination of their institutions to human 
rights, the Constitution, and the laws of the Republic. 
<H5>  Political Democracy </H5>
  The legitimacy of political power depends on the people's 
general representation and on the involvement of every civilian 
organization. 
  The FSLN respects and democratically strengthens the 
political institutions and values most representative of 
national culture, administrative honesty, universal suffrage, 
the separation of the branches of state, national sovereignty, 
and independence, and it discourages, questions, and fights any 
exclusionist political culture. 
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all the sectors 
in 
Nicaragua regardless of race, religion, social class, gender, 
ethnic group, or political position, as well as those struggling 
for peace, stability, security, and the political rights of all 
Nicaraguans. As a revolutionary party, the FSLN is struggling 
for real social participation in civilian and state concerns and 
institutions nationwide, especially by workers, the general 
masses, and dispossessed sectors in Nicaragua. 
  The FSLN respects, promotes, and develops civic means of 
enhancing the people's and popular organizations' involvement in 
demanding their political, social, economic, and cultural rights. 
  The FSLN defends all Nicaraguans' individual safety and 
freedom from abuses by the state or any other national or 
international institution. 
  The FSLN is struggling to preserve the nation's ecosystem by 
promoting technical and cultural practices that will strengthen 
the conservation, improvement, and maintenance of our resources. 
  The FSLN promotes economic policies that are favorable to 
all 
social sectors, especially producers in the countryside and in 
the cities; the democratization of loans; investment 
oportunities; and the exchange of commercial and financial 
information between producers and workers. It also promotes 
policies that discourage the flight of capital and the 
plundering of resources. 
  The FSLN uses every possible source of influence, nationally 
as well as internationally, to allow the state to safeguard the 
nation's economic development and to regulate the social 
distribution of wealth. 
<H5>  Partisan Organization </H5>
  The FSLN is open to all sectors of Nicaraguan society and 
aspires to represent all of society, whether from a position of 
opposition or while in power, in order to achieve democracy, 
economic development, and social justice. Its primary concerns 
are the poor and unemployed, who constitute the majority of 
Nicaraguans. 
  The FSLN is a revolutionary, democratic, and participatory 
party struggling to reconcile freedom and individual initiative 
with the party's interests and the programatic principles by 
which it is governed. 
  The FSLN is a party that promotes national and international 
political alliances with other parties to achieve the goal of 
social and economic well-being for all of society in general and 
for the low-income sectors in particular. 
<H5>  Proposal From the Sandinist Democratic Left </H5>
  The de jure state, social justice, and humanistic socialism 
-- The FSLN defines itself as a revolutionary party whose 
fundamental goal is to struggle and work in the short- and 
mid-term for the establishment of a de jure state, social 
justice, and humanistic and democratic socialism which will 
consider the individual, the family, and the community its main 
concerns. To this end the FSLN is opposed to the implementation 
of liberal and neoliberal principles and measures to resolve 
Nicaraguan society's political, social, and economic problems. 
  The FSLN aspires and proposes to all of Nicaraguan society 
the gradual and progressive achievement of humanistic socialism 
in which the de jure state is combined with social justice and 
political and economic democracy in which popular sectors and 
organizations can truly participate in the Nicaraguan nation's 
political and economic power. To achieve these goals, the FSLN 
must join with all forces interested in eliminating dictatorial 
and authoritarian trends in the political sphere, as well as 
polarizing and exclusionary trends in the area of economics, 
which still prevail in Nicaragua's capitalist society. 
  The FSLN advocates relations based on respect and mutual 
benefit, as well as peaceful coexistence with the neighboring 
governments and peoples of Central America and the Caribbean, 
and especially with the United States. 
  The FSLN joins with the peoples of Latin America and the 
Caribbean to defend self-determination and national sovereignty. 
<H5>  Political Power </H5>
  The nation's sovereignty rests with the Nicaraguan people. 
  The people are the source of political power, which is not 
expressed solely by the state apparatus or government 
institutions, but also by the institutions and organizations of 
civilian society -- namely, trade unions; labor unions; 
churches; municipalities; student, women's, professional, 
artistic, ethnic, cultural, agro-environmental, sports, and 
youth organizations; and nongovernment organizations in general. 
  The FSLN must encourage the creation and democratic 
development of local, municipal, territorial, and cooperative 
authorities without excluding anyone. 
  The FSLN advocates a system of full autonomy for the peoples 
and ethnic communities of the Atlantic Coast. 
<H5>  Economic, Social, and Cultural Democracy </H5>
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all sectors 
seeking national economic development and social justice. As a 
revolutionary party it especially represents the popular forces, 
middle classes, professionals, intellectuals, and artists 
seeking equitable participation in the distribution of the 
nation's wealth. 
  The FSLN opposes any position that advocates the restoration 
of the oligarchic system, such as exclusionary and neoliberal 
policies that foster contradictions, conflicts, and social 
instability. 
  The FSLN respects public and private property and any other 
form of property; it struggles for the democratization of 
property; and it promotes and encourages all forms of 
associative property -- namely, communal, cooperative, APT 
[expansion unknown], municipal, autonomous, labor, federative, 
and joint businesses. 
  The FSLN is struggling to democratize the economy; to make 
it 
respond to the needs of the majority of people and not to the 
needs of minorities; to prevent its competitiveness from 
becoming oligopolist; to ensure that it is based on ethical and 
popular criteria and not on demagogic morality; to ensure that 
society and the state will guard it without jeopardizing its 
role in the effective and productive allocation of resources; 
and to ensure that it will be an economy that favors human 
beings and not capital. 
  The FSLN promotes economic policies that seek productive 
growth and involve the granting of opportunities based on an 
individual's work, productivity, and initiative, as well as 
promoting policies through which the assurance of employment, 
health, education, and housing are considered priorities. 
  The FSLN is developing every possible initiative and measure 
to diminish the poverty and unemployment suffered by most 
Nicaraguans. 
  The FSLN is struggling to provide the minimal conditions for 
a dignified life to every individual who for reasons of age, 
gender, or physical disability have no access to society's 
general benefits. 
  The FSLN takes its inspiration primarily from the historic 
and cultural roots of the Nicaraguan people, and it is trying to 
establish an economic model that will be the most beneficial for 
the nation as a whole and for the largest and most impoverished 
sectors in particular. 
  The FSLN respects the autonomy and interests of social and 
popular organizations, supports their demands and struggles, and 
strives to attract them to the party's way of thinking. 
  The FSLN is a broad, democratic party that can be joined by 
all citizens who accept the party's way of thinking, respect the 
unity of Sandinism, and abide by decisions made by the majority. 
  The FSLN encourages consensus among its members through 
debate and dialogue as a method for settling internal 
disagreement. 
  The FSLN regards renovation, modernization, change, and 
internal democracy as factors to strengthen Sandinism from the 
left. 
<H5>  Methods of Struggle </H5>
  The FSLN regards as legitimate the combination of 
parliamentary and legal methods of struggle, as well as popular 
mobilizations and public debates. 
  The FSLN believes that the struggle of any one popular 
organization must be backed by the largest possible consensus in 
the organization's own rank-and-file. The organization should 
strive for the help, coordination, and solidarity of similar 
organizations, and it should strive to persuade the population 
to endorse its goals. 
  The FSLN regards humanistic knowledge, education, and 
training as essential tools for strengthening the political, 
social, and economic ethics of Sandinists and all Nicaraguans in 
general. 
  The FSLN regards direct, secret, and universal suffrage as a 
legitimate means of electing municipal and parliamentarian 
representatives, presidents, and all other officials, both 
within the government and within political parties.
