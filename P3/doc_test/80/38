BARRISTERS' chambers which fail to recruit and promote women are likely to
come under pressure from the bar council to improve their record following
the launch today of government-funded research into sex discrimination in
the profession.
Women account for fewer than 9 per cent of the nearly 7,000 practising
barristers in England and Wales. Men and women now gain legal qualifications
in roughly equal numbers.
The bar council has already taken action in an attempt to reduce racial
discrimination. In a move considered radical for any of the professions, it
last year told barristers' chambers they should aim for at least 5 per cent
of their members to be drawn from ethnic minority groups.
The sex discrimination research, which will be carried out by external
management consultants, is being funded by a Pounds 5,000 grant from the
Lord Chancellor's department.
Questionnaires are being sent to practising and non-practising women
barristers asking them about all stages of their career.
The bar council said the research would aim to find out:
Whether women experienced difficulties obtaining pupillages or tenancies at
the start of their careers.
How women were treated in chambers.
Whether chambers made provision for maternity leave.
Whether women could come back into practice easily after having children.
Whether women tended to specialise in areas of law such as crime and family
law.
Mr Stephen Sedley QC, chairman of the bar council's sex discrimination
committee, said the findings would 'enable the bar to develop a code of
practice to eliminate and redress any disadvantage experienced by women
barristers'. Results of the survey are expected in the summer.
Whose Flexibility? Discrimination and equality issues in atypical work. Prof
Linda Dickens. Institute of Employment Rights, 20 Durand Gardens, London SW9
OPP. Pounds 5.50 (Pounds 20 for commercial organisations).
ONLY 'honorary men' - women who conform to male patterns of working and
domestic responsibility - are currently likely to be able to gain promotion
at work, according to a study published today by theInstitute of Employment
Rights, the labour-law think-tank.
The report's author, Professor Linda Dickens of Warwick Business School,
argues that male work is taken as the norm, yet for many women 'atypical'
work, particularly part-time work, is the norm. Systems of labour law and
social security 'have similarly taken the male as the neutral standard of
the worker, to thedisadvantage of women who ..fall outside various
protections,' she says.
The best that equal opportunities legislation has achieved is 'opening up
male structured employment to women on the same terms as men and ..this
underpins discrimination and inequalities in atypical work,' the report
finds.
There is strong evidence that the extension of legal protection and
occupational benefits to part-time and temporary workers would not have an
adverse effect on job opportunities for those groups, Prof Dickens argues.
