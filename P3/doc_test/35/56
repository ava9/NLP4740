BLOOD IN the streets? This is how Hollywood proper is characterizing the new 
amalgamation of Frank Price with Jon Peters and Peter Guber at Columbia 
Pictures. "Can you imagine a man like Price, already a success in his own right 
as the one-time head of Columbia in the good old days -- can you imagine him 
reporting to a volatile person like Jon Peters?" 
</P>
<P>
On this, the day of the Academy Awards, Hollywood is talk, talk, talking. 
Another exec says: "Let's see, this would make a marriage of arrogance -- the 
arrogance of Frank Price matched with that of Jon Peters. They'll never get 
along." (Peter Guber, we should add, seems to figure mostly behind the scenes 
in these imagined conflicts, because he is considered such an extremely passive 
person; one who uses Jon Peters as his top gun.) 
</P>
<P>
I suppose Frank Price must surely be smart enough to have ironclad stuff in his 
new contract with Guber and Peters assuring his being able to work with them 
and not find them too onerous. "How?" asks one wise-acre. "They are still going 
to be his bosses and and Frank Price isn't used to being bossed or 
second-guessed." 
</P>
<P>
And -- the latest hot skinny out of L.A. -- despite denials to the contrary -- 
is that Sony itself is now looking somewhat askance at this incredible deal 
they have made with Guber and Peters. It cost Sony something like $700 million 
right up front. It is estimated it could cost them billions more in the long 
run, for no one has ever seen anything like the way Guber and Peters like to 
spend other people's money. And now it is obvious that the unprecedented Guber 
and Peters deal with Sony threw the entire Hollywood money factor out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
Jealousy, envy, gnashing of teeth ensued, with subsequent misery for agents, 
producers, studio executives. The deal ended with a fallout that has sent costs 
soaring all down the movie world's line. 
</P>
<P>
Question -- did Jon Peters really use a company plane to woo a new girlfriend 
in London with $300,000 worth of fresh flowers? Oh, how can we even dignify 
this one with a question mark. I hereby deny it. Jon Peters wouldn't do 
anything like that. And to ask him would mean we'd have to climb all the way up 
where he now dwells, like Jove, among his zaps and thunderbolts. That's not for 
mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
TRUMP-MANIA, or nothing succeeds like excess! They say there are 2,400 members 
of the press arriving for the Taj Mahal opening in Atlantic City on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
One beautiful woman who happens to feel she just has to go down there for this 
asked her designer, "What should I wear?" 
</P>
<P>
Came the answer: "A suit of armor!" 
</P>
<P>
MARY TYLER MOORE became the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's "Woman of the 
Decade" the other night at the Waldorf in New York and the happiest thing was 
that most of her co-stars from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" showed up and 
burbled on happily about Mary. And wow -- do they all look good! I do mean Ed 
Asner, Betty White, Nancy Walker, Eileen Heckert, Cloris Leachman, Gavin 
MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
Only Valerie Harper and Georgia Engel were among the missing, both with 
pressing commitments elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mary flew down from Canada for the night and she looked dazzling in a red, 
off-the-shoulder Scaasi gown. She has been been filming "The Last Best Year of 
My Life," an NBC-TV movie to be seen next fall, co-starring Bernadette Peters.
