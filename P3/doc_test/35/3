TRUMP'S MARGIN FOR ERROR ON THE TAJ IS NOT BIG

Donald J. Trump may have a lot of things, but it's clear that he doesn't have 
everything. The one thing he obviously doesn't have is shame. Or if he has any, 
he hides it well. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, if you will, Trump's endless boasting about how his Taj Mahal 
casino-hotel in Atlantic City, the biggest and most expensive building ever 
erected in New Jersey, was finished on time and on budget. Trump has made the 
on-time, on-budget claim so many times that he may even occasionally believe it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
But when Trump is out of the limelight and has a legal obligation to tell 
something resembling the truth, he tells a somewhat different story about the 
Taj. In this version, the Taj finished about six weeks behind schedule and has 
a $65-million cost overrun. 
</P>
<P>
And the sure sign that the building's construction didn't work out as Trump 
planned is that he has agreed to wait "at least a year" to take the $10-million 
fee to which he's entitled for finishing the Taj. (Master Builder Trump 
actually paid Perini Corp. $1 million to manage the Taj's construction, but it 
would be churlish to point that out.) 
</P>
<P>
Trump leaving money uncollected? It's a violation of natural law. It's as if 
the sun rose in the west, an investment banker stopped caring about fees or a 
sucker got an even break. 
</P>
<P>
Where do you find this less-than-upbeat version of the way things are in 
Taj-land? In the 1989 annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission earlier this month by something called Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc. 
This obscure corporate creature, 100% owned by Trump, has its name on the bonds 
that were issued in November, 1988, to raise money for Trump to buy the 
partially built Taj Mahal from Resorts International and finish building it. 
</P>
<P>
Because Trump's reports to the Taj bondholders are subject to federal 
securities laws, Trump has a legal obligation to tell the truth in them -- an 
obligation that doesn't apply to his press releases or interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Read the Taj Mahal Funding documents, and you discover that the Taj cost $65 
million more than it was budgeted for a year ago. Of the $65-million increase, 
Trump told Taj bondholders, $11.8 million consists of the interest paid on the 
Taj's bonds between the time the Taj was supposed to open and its actual 
opening date. You can argue that the interest is a bookkeeping item rather than 
a cost overrun -- but it does show that the building was finished late. The 
other $53.2 million of cost increases, Trump says, comes from design changes 
that he believes "will improve operating efficiency as well as the perceived 
and actual quality of the facility." Whatever that means. 
</P>
<P>
This overrun is probably the reason that the Taj, originally scheduled to be 
completed with the proceeds of the $675-million bond issue, has ended up 
borrowing another $50 million from banks. Should the Taj run through the bank 
money as well, Trump himself has to lend the next $25 million to the Taj, under 
terms of his contract with the Taj bondholders. As of Dec. 31, the Taj hadn't 
borrowed any money from Trump, but it may have borrowed some or all of it by 
now. 
</P>
<P>
How does Trump explain these differences between what he tells the public and 
what he told Taj bondholders? Beats me. I couldn't get him on the phone to 
discuss it. Not that it matters much, since Trump is not exactly the most 
reliable interviewee in the world. In our last conversation, he berated me for 
having been foolish enough to believe what he had said in the conversation 
before that one, in which he had sworn up and down that he would never sell 
control of Resorts International to Merv Griffin. No matter what he told me, 
Trump explained, I should have known that when he wants to buy, he acts as if 
he's selling, and that when he wants to sell, he acts as if he's buying. 
</P>
<P>
But even though you can't rate Trump too high on candor, you have to give him 
top marks for nerve. He has not only borrowed $675 million from bondholders and 
$50 million from banks, but he even borrowed the $75 million that he put into 
the Taj as his equity. 
</P>
<P>
How could even Trump do this? Easy. Documents on file at the New Jersey Casino 
Control Commission show that Trump got banks to lend him $75 million against 
money he doesn't have yet: the management fee that the Taj has agreed to pay 
him. Trump gets the fee, 1.75% of the Taj's revenue, provided that the Taj has 
made its interest payments first. The Taj would have to bring in more than $450 
million a year -- or $1.2 million a day -- for Trump to take in enough 
management fees to cover the interest on the borrowed $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that Trump has none of his own money tied up in the Taj, but 
he would have to dig into his own pocket to pay back the $75-million bank loan 
if the Taj goes belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
Does a $65-million overrun and a six-week construction delay mean that the Taj 
Mahal is going to fail? Obviously not. You're dealing here with a project that 
cost something on the order of $1.12 billion -- $870 million of Trump's money 
and $250 million of Resorts International's money. The $65 million is sales 
tax, not a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But the extra $65 million does reduce Trump's margin for error. And it reminds 
us, once again, that when you lend money to a promoter, you damned well better 
read all those boring documents that he files.
