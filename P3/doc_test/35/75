The U.S. Transportation Department gave tentative approval Wednesday to the 
sale of the lucrative Eastern Airlines shuttle to flamboyant real estate tycoon 
Donald J. Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for the sale, which was announced in October by Trump and Texas 
Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, is $365 million. The shuttle, Eastern's 
only profitable operation, has hourly, non-reservation flights between New York 
and Washington and New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Observers have called the deal a coup for Trump, who probably would expand the 
shuttle's service to Atlantic City, the East Coast's gambling mecca. Trump owns 
two large hotel-casinos there and has a 12% stake in Resorts International, 
which is building a casino and hotel in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department said it found Trump's plans for operating the 
carrier to be sound financially and that his key personnel have the necessary 
managerial and technical skills. The Trump Shuttle still must pass a safety 
review by the Federal Aviation Administration before the sale can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The way was cleared for the transaction to move ahead when a federal court last 
month denied the objections of labor unions that challenged the sale as a 
union-busting tactic by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air. The unions had 
maintained that the sale was part of a plan by Texas Air, which also owns 
non-union Continental Airlines, to dismantle Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, industry sources said Wednesday that Eastern, in another 
divestiture move, is close to selling its operations at Philadelphia to USAir 
Group for about $80 million. Eastern, which has lost more than $1 billion in 
the last 10 years, in August eliminated service to 14 cities, closed its Kansas 
City hub and dismissed 12% of its work force.
