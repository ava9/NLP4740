Trump Confident He'll Get Loans: Donald J. Trump's advisers are confident that 
the real estate magnate will write $36 million in checks today to pay the 
interest on his junk bond debt, but a pending bank loan deal to ease his cash 
crunch is still in doubt. Trump, who celebrated his 44th birthday Thursday, is 
seeking to arrange $60 million in financing to ease the cash shortage facing 
his massive but debt-laden real estate and casino empire.

Trump advisers, appearing on the "Donahue" television talk show to defend their 
employer, said they were confident that Trump would make the payment. Bankers 
are worried that Trump may become hard-pressed to meet payments on his 
estimated $2 billion in bank loans if he goes ahead and makes the bond payment. 
As a result, they are seeking a deal before the bond payment is made.
