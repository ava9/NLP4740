Continental Airlines may not survive its second visit to bankruptcy court, 
which began this week, but, if it goes under, it won't be for failing to master 
the intricacies of bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
The debt-heavy carrier delayed seeking Chapter 11 court protection until it had 
amassed a $138-million cash hoard and until the Christmas season, when many of 
its passengers were carrying deep-discount, non-refundable tickets. This 
guaranteed that ridership would be high for weeks -- and that initial news 
reports on the bankruptcy would carry the reassuring word that travelers were 
sticking with the airline. 
</P>
<P>
"They handled it just about right," said Russell Thayer, executive vice 
president of Airline Economics, an airline consulting firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's strategy reflects corporate America's increasing sophistication 
in tilting the bankruptcy process in its favor. As a growing number of large 
companies have lurched into such proceedings in the aftermath of the debt binge 
of the 1980s, they have learned to fortify themselves with strong cash 
positions and protect their relationships with key suppliers, customers and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have learned that they can return to bankruptcy court -- in what 
lawyers jokingly call "Chapter 22." Others have found how to shorten their 
visits with "prepackaged" bankruptcies, which can compress the expensive 
reorganization process into a few weeks. And companies have become more 
skillful in handling the public relations aspects of bankruptcy, aided by the 
fact that bankruptcy no longer carries the public stigma it once did. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder whether corporations are becoming too adept at playing 
the bankruptcy game, even though two out of three do not emerge from Chapter 
11. Although reviving firms is a top priority of U.S. bankruptcy law, some 
wonder whether it sometimes shields incompetent managers and props up weak 
companies that should be allowed to expire. 
</P>
<P>
"These are questions that should be asked," said Walter N. Torous, an assistant 
finance professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what the future holds for Continental, but its skilled handling of 
the bankruptcy process this time around is in sharp contrast to the way 
airlines have fumbled through these situations in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff blundered into Chapter 11 in 1982 with no cash, stranding passengers 
with worthless tickets and leaving employees and travel agents unpaid. It 
emerged from bankruptcy court in 1983. But, in part because it had so alienated 
customers and travel agents, it skidded into bankruptcy court for a second and 
last time last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Continental, too, had a much harder time with reorganization because 
it closed down for three days after its bankruptcy filing, then returned with 
sharply diminished operations. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Continental's big cash balance will help it weather the slow season that 
begins after New Year's, and its firm holiday season bookings will give it 
needed momentum. The Houston-based carrier was clever, too, in telling 
passengers and travel agents that it would continue to honor all tickets and 
operate all flights. 
</P>
<P>
By continuing operations with no interruption, Continental has been able to 
preserve a very important asset: the reservations that are impossible to fully 
recapture once they are lost, consultant Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, airline executives believed that any bankruptcy filing would be 
fatal to an airline. They reasoned that customers would avoid a distressed 
airline, fearing that the company would skimp on maintainance and aircraft 
might plunge from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
But the airlines discovered during the first Continental bankruptcy, and the 
bankruptcy of its subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, that many passengers will 
continue to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Other industries have discovered in recent years that customers are blase about 
bankruptcy cases. "With so many household names in bankruptcy court . . . and 
doing nicely, people are behaving much more rationally," said Wilbur Ross, an 
investment banker and leading bankruptcy adviser at Rothschild Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the common wisdom was that retailers had the most to risk from 
frightened customers in a bankruptcy. But, as last year's Chapter 11 filing by 
Allied and Federated department store chains has shown, "people don't care, 
most don't even know the reorganization is going on," said David Rachman, 
marketing professor at Baruch College in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Customers have been largely unfazed by the bankruptcy reorganizations of 
Greyhound Lines, the bus company; Southland Corp., the owner of 7-Eleven 
stores; A. H. Robins, the big drug company, and Allegheny International, the 
maker of Sunbeam and Oster appliances, Rothschild's Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the attendant publicity can even bring in customers. When Donald 
Trump's Taj Mahal casino was briefly in bankruptcy court last month, "it seemed 
like people who just happened to be somewhere near Atlantic City began to drop 
in," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are also increasingly turning to the prepackaged bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
In these prearranged reorganizations, companies negotiate new repayment deals 
to win support from specified majorities of the holders of each class of the 
company's stocks and bonds. With such backing in hand, the company can seek 
bankruptcy court protection and ask for immediate approval of a reorganization 
plan, to end-run the minority objections that often make bankruptcy a long, 
expensive and bitter process. 
</P>
<P>
Major company reorganizations often take two to three years, noted Mark Roe, a 
bankruptcy-law specialist at Columbia University Law School. With prepackaged 
plans, some have taken less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the expenses of bankruptcy court is a major advantage of these 
arrangements. Drexel Burnham Lambert, the one-time junk-bond powerhouse that 
failed last February, is expected to pay $75 million in fees for lawyers, 
bankers and accountants in its first year of reorganization, noted Barry J. 
Dichter, bankruptcy lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have also discovered that they can smooth their path through 
bankruptcy by seeking court orders at the outset that will enable them to pay 
employees, continue benefit plans and pay debts owed to suppliers up until the 
moment of the filing, Dichter said. 
</P>
<P>
Such moves enable them to preserve important relationships, while restricting 
the focus of the bankruptcy proceeding to the company's central financial 
problem, which so often today is junk-bond debt rather than any operational 
weakness, Dichter said. 
</P>
<P>
Distressed companies have found new access to financing while in bankruptcy. 
Several banks, such as Wells Fargo and Chemical Bank, have been attracted by 
the profitable return on such lending and the high-priority claim they have on 
corporate assets, said David Minnick, a bankruptcy specialist at Lillick &amp; 
McHose in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ames Department Stores, for example, recently began its way through a 
reorganization by establishing a $250-million credit line from Chemical Bank. 
</P>
<P>
A second trip through bankruptcy court also is an option for companies. But it 
is used rarely and only in the direst circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers contend that executives' new awareness of how to navigate the 
bankruptcy maze has led some to consider Chapter 11 as a choice even before 
their financial distress begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who plays the high leverage game has got to start thinking about it 
from the beginning -- when the junk financing or leveraged buyout takes place," 
said Richard A. D'Aveni, professor of corporate strategy at Dartmouth 
University. 
</P>
<P>
So is bankruptcy court too easy an alternative? 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the debt holders aren't complaining about the system; they 
have usually done better in smoothly run reorganization proceedings in which 
the company is able to get back on its feet and pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the major cases, the suffering debt holders aren't widows and 
orphans "but sophisticated institutional investors who bought junk bonds and 
enjoyed those big 16% coupons," attorney Minnick said. "They went in with their 
eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
Even if bankruptcy reorganization is easier than it was, corporate executives 
can't be enthusiastic about it because, often, they lose their jobs, Columbia's 
Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
They can be fired, like the management of Manville Corp., which sought Chapter 
11 to deal with asbestos-related lawsuits; or they can have the company sold 
out from under them, as happened to the family that owned Robins. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean many top executives don't survive the process. The 
management teams at Texaco and LTV Corp. remain at the helms of their 
reorganizations, and James M. Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer 
of Allied Stores, remains in his post, Joseph Kelly, a New York bankruptcy 
lawyer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon to have the same people in there, unless the creditors think 
they're real scoundrels," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most companies don't survive Chapter 11, big companies with a lot 
of momentum -- and particularly those that suffer from too much debt but not 
operating problems -- frequently endure and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recent celebrated cases, Texaco, Resorts International, A. H. Robins, 
Allegheny International, Public Service of New Hampshire, Wheeling-Pittsburgh 
Steel and Storage Technology are healthy or appear to be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of problems arise from bad management," said Minnick, a 
lawyer who represents creditors.
