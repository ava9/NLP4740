<P>
With only five minutes left in its 64-minute launch "window," the space shuttle 
Atlantis roared into orbit on a cloud of flame and smoke at 11:47 a.m. PDT 
Thursday, launching the United States into a new era of planetary exploration 
after an 11-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
A little over six hours after launch, at 6:01 p.m., Atlantis carried out its 
prime objective when mission specialist Mark C. Lee triggered a spring-loaded 
platform that sent the $325-million Magellan spacecraft spinning from the 
orbiter's 60-foot-long payload bay. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly an hour later, after Atlantis had moved a safe distance away from it, 
the first of Magellan's two solid rocket motors ignited, launching the craft on 
its 15-month, 800-million-mile voyage to Venus, where it will use radar to map 
the surface of Earth's sister planet. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is the first interplanetary probe launched by the United States since 
1978, and the first ever launched by the shuttle. With it, NASA is entering an 
unprecedented period of scientific activity that will include the launch of the 
Galileo probe to Jupiter in October and the orbiting of the Hubble Space 
Telescope in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is ever going to question our leadership in planetary science again," 
said Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, the astronauts had expressed delight with their 
perfect, if delayed, launch. "Four of us are happy to be back in space, and the 
fifth is happy to be here," radioed commander David M. Walker shortly after 
Atlantis entered its 160-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a cliffhanger," said acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers, 
referring to the cloud cover at Kennedy's main runway, where Atlantis would 
have landed if the launch were aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Cloud cover at the site forced a 59-minute delay in the launch, almost causing 
the mission to be scrubbed for the second time in six days. An attempted launch 
last Friday was halted 31 seconds before liftoff when a cooling pump on one of 
the shuttle's engines failed. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's weather was a sharp contrast to last Friday's perfect conditions. A 
light rain soaked Atlantis on pad 39B for an hour shortly after dawn, and thick 
clouds threatened rain for most of the day. Air Force meteorologist Capt. 
Thomas Strange noted that "all of the clouds on the (Florida) peninsula" seemed 
to be right over Cape Canaveral and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
But a brisk breeze from the ocean blew most of the clouds westward at the last 
minute, and chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying over the Kennedy landing 
strip, finally reported that the skies were clear enough for an emergency 
landing if one proved necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the weather, the countdown went virtually flawlessly, and launch 
director Robert B. Sieck called it "exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
"Did somebody win the pool up there?" mission control commentator John 
Creighton asked the crew. "We had only five minutes left in the window." 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't want to push it any closer," replied Walker. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth shuttle launch since the space program was jarred by the 
January, 1986, destruction of Challenger and the 60th manned launch in the U.S. 
space program. Four more shuttle launches are scheduled for this year, 
including the first post-Challenger flight of Columbia, which is still in the 
process of being refitted with changes mandated after the Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan, designed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and assembled by 
Martin-Marietta Corp., will not reach Venus until Aug 10, 1990, when its 
braking rocket will shift it into a 3-hour, 9-minute elliptical orbit. For 37.2 
minutes of each orbit, a sophisticated radar system built by Hughes Aircraft 
Co. will map an 18-mile-wide swath of the planet's surface. It will then use 
the rest of the orbit to radio the data back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 243-day primary phase of the mission, Magellan will map 80% of Venus's 
surface, sending back more data than all previous planetary probes combined. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the data will allow them to understand the motion of tectonic 
plates on Venus, shedding new light on the causes of earthquakes on Earth, 
where tectonic motion is obscured by erosion and weathering. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope to learn more about the conditions that caused a so-called 
runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, which raised its surface temperature to 
nearly 900 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the crew are pilot Ronald J. Grabe and mission specialists 
Mary L. Cleave and Norman E. Thagard. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base at 12:44 p.m. PDT 
Monday.
