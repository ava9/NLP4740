Scientists studying photographs relayed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft have 
discovered huge icy boulders in a mysterious ring around Neptune, possibly 
providing a clue as to why the planet's outermost ring is so bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
The icy "moonlets" measure up to about 10 miles in diameter, far larger than 
the dust-like particles believed to make up the rest of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, they were found in an area that is much brighter and wider 
than the rest of the ring. Ground-based astronomers discovered that segment of 
the ring several years ago and concluded erroneously that they had found only 
partial rings, called ring arcs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clue in Photograph 
</P>
<P>
No one could explain then why any planet would have ring arcs because 
scientists could see no reason why ring particles would not be distributed 
fairly uniformly around the entire planet. 
</P>
<P>
Voyager scientists determined last week that Neptune's rings are complete, 
although the segments discovered by astronomers earlier were lumpy and highly 
irregular. That too has eluded explanation. 
</P>
<P>
That changed Saturday when scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
announced that a smeared photograph may provide the answer. For the Voyager, 
even when something goes wrong it seems to turn out right. 
</P>
<P>
A smeared photograph is the nemesis of any shutterbug, but one sent back by the 
intrepid 12-year-old robot caught the interest of the scientists, said Bradford 
Smith of the University of Arizona, leader of the Voyager's imaging team. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that when scientists looked at the image, they detected about six or 
eight bright spots that had been moving along the ring during the exposure and 
thus appeared as long lines. Camera movement, which smeared the image, also 
caused the lines to twist, resulting in what appeared to be a braided ring. 
</P>
<P>
The "braids" were in fact just bright spots that had to be clumps of matter 
large enough to show up as streaks, just like a distant star that also appeared 
in the image, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
That told the scientists that the ring contained "some embedded rocks," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The "rocks," which he said probably contain a lot of ice and might best be 
described as "moonlets," dominate the fatter segments of the ring. The narrow 
band of smaller particles extending the rest of the way around Neptune was 
discovered just before Voyager's closest approach last Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking to see if there's something that is different about this 
particular ring" that could explain why it is so inconsistent, Smith said. 
"This may be it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Two Rings 
</P>
<P>
Voyager data also revealed Saturday that Neptune is more than just a two-ring 
circus. Voyager images now show that the distant planet has up to five rings. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the most recently discovered rings are so broad that their small 
particles are spread so thin they can just barely be seen, and all lie closer 
to the planet than the outermost ring that was confirmed last week. 
</P>
<P>
The broadest of the rings is many hundreds of miles in width and lies closest 
to Neptune, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the moonlets was only one of many developments Saturday at 
JPL, where scientists continue to revel in the immense amount of data that 
Voyager sent back to Earth in its grand finale as the unchallenged leader among 
planetary explorers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gravity Slows Voyager 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager is now nearly a million and a half miles beyond Neptune, speeding 
toward space at nearly 38,000 m.p.h. Its speed is less now because it is 
fighting Neptune's gravity instead of being pulled by it as it heads off toward 
its first encounter with another star. 
</P>
<P>
It is due to pass within about 25 trillion miles of Bernard's Star in the year 
8571. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, JPL scientists were entering the home stretch Saturday, comparing 
notes as they prepared to wrap up the "close phase" of the Neptune encounter 
this Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There are 11 scientific teams on the Voyager project, each concentrating on 
different disciplines ranging from the study of the "interplanetary medium" to 
the composition of Neptune's backward traveling moon, Triton. 
</P>
<P>
The planetary encounter provides a unique opportunity for experts in one field 
to compare their results with findings by colleagues in other disciplines. That 
cross-fertilization makes it possible for experts to engage in instant 
analysis, although not always with a great deal of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
For example, geologists on the imaging team were fascinated by features on the 
surface of Triton that appeared to have been shaped by winds, just as sand 
dunes in the desert are molded by the wind on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
For that to work, however, Triton would need a fairly dense atmosphere, and the 
geologists asked the project's atmospheric scientists if their data showed that 
Triton's atmosphere could be heavy enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We need (a dense atmosphere)," Smith said, "but they won't give it to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen in Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
So if some of the features on Triton's surface were in fact shaped by the wind, 
it must have been at some other time, in some other season, when the conditions 
on the moon's surface were different than they are today. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also determined that Triton's atmosphere has one of the 
components of Southern California's smog, nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery also required the assistance of a distant star. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sandel of the University of Arizona said it had not been possible for 
astronomers on Earth to determine all the constituents of Triton's atmosphere 
because they cannot separate the moon from its atmosphere when viewed from the 
Earth. So researchers have debated among themselves over the nature of Triton's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a controversy that has been with us for years," Sandel said. 
</P>
<P>
An ultraviolet spectrometer aboard the Voyager solved that problem by studying 
the light from a star as it was eclipsed by first the atmosphere and then the 
icy surface of Triton. Since different light frequencies are absorbed by 
different elements, the spectrometer could define the atmosphere's composition 
by detecting which frequencies were absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Data from that experiment shows that nitrogen dominates Triton's atmosphere, 
although there is some methane (natural gas) close to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also reported Saturday that Neptune's magnetic field is inclined at 
least 30 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation. On most planets, including 
Earth, the inclination is about 10 degrees, so Neptune's is odd but not as odd 
as Uranus', which is inclined 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Humble' Magnetosphere 
</P>
<P>
The magnetic field also creates an envelope around the planet, called the 
magnetosphere, which plays an important role in such things as the auroral 
activity that creates the northern and southern lights on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Tom Krimigis of Johns Hopkins University reported Saturday that 
"Neptune's magnetosphere is rather humble." 
</P>
<P>
That may be one reason Voyager scientists have not found conclusive evidence 
that the spacecraft detected northern lights when it passed within 3,000 miles 
of the clouds over Neptune's north pole.
