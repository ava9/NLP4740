THE HISTORY OF THE GINGER MAN By J P Donleavy Viking, Pounds 17, 517 pages
There are two stories here. The first is of the life, loves and friendships
of J P Donleavy, an Irish American in his 20s, who left the US Navy at the
end of the second world war and used his entitlement of a free education
under the GI Bill to enrol as a law student at Trinity College, Dublin. The
energy released by his new freedom went on a variety of activities in the
Irish capital, of which heavy drinking, fights in bars and the pursuit of
innumerable women were a high - and the academic study of law a low -
priority.
The second, and the more absorbing story is of how his first book The Ginger
Man came to be published by the Olympia Press in Paris in 1955 and of his
subsequent bitter legal battle to extricate it from their 'Travellers'
Library' (a list of pornography) and get it brought out in England by a
reputable publisher where it could be taken seriously. Its rampageous
foul-mouthed hero Sebastian Dangerfield and its brutal candour about sex,
pioneered a new approach in fiction. It was both hilarious farce and
wonderfully evocative of location. Donleavy had been a painter before
becoming a writer.
Story one describes Don- leavy's life as a recently married man whose wife
showed saintly forebearance at his violent antics and frequent absences. His
gregarious love of male company derives from a childhood in the Bronx, where
his Irish immigrant background set him apart from the other children at his
school. His aggressive nature was apparent even then. One of his victim's
mothers intervened during a scrap with another boy pinioning him so that her
son could punch Donleavy with impunity. He was rescued by his own mother who
told the other woman: 'You are going to have to do that for the rest of
(your son's) life'.
In Donleavy's adult life rescue from imminent danger is a recurring theme.
It might take the form of a timely loan from from a friend; or the
fortuitous presence of a bruiser-pal who would keep angry pursuers at bay
while Donleavy made his escape through a side-exit of the pub. More often it
is Donleavy, pugilist as well as literary artist, who has to perform a
rescue for one of his cronies.
He re-creates the drunken chivalries and verbal jousting of a male set whose
fame, unlike his, has not survived post-war Dublin. Apart of course from
Brendan Behan, a firm friend who recognised Donleavy's powers early on, and
whose skill as a mimic, persistence as a lecher and outrageous behaviour as
a guest, are all hilariously noted. But the exploits of such as Gallagher,
McKernan, Craig, and even one Gainor Stephen Crist who was the model for the
Ginger Man are rather less entertaining to read about here than were those
of the fictional counterparts they inspired.
The novel still reads well thanks to its lively prose. Donleavy learned a
lot from the thought processes of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. But
now, approaching 70, the ginger in Donleavy's writing has given way to a
blander flavour; a maturity that has unfortunately been accompanied by the
onset of prolixity. Eventually we move from Ireland to other places where
Donleavy has lived - the Isle of Man, Boston, London, Paris, where, from
time to time, the former fine descriptive touch returns.
It is to Paris that he goes to confront Girodias, publisher of Olympia
Press. Letters exchanged between author and publisher, gastronomic lunches
followed by fraught meetings in the office, then the shock of the early
copies of the book with the company's porn-titles emblazoned on the
fly-leaf, are the opening rounds in a costly legal battle that culminated in
an auction many years later at which the Olympia Press came wholly into
Donleavy's possession. He was now a rich man thanks to the success of the
rescued Ginger Man and of later books.
Page 400 onwards should be read by anyone who is about to sign an agreement
to publish a first novel. That Donleavy won his battle to rescue his book
says much for his courage; it also shows that his training in law was not
wasted time.
