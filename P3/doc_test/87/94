Sooner or later some bright Ph. D. student is going to publish a thesis on
'The Pause in 20th-Century Drama'. The origins of the pause will no doubt be
traced back to Greek drama and to Shakespeare; Ibsen may be acknowledge as
the secret godfather of the pause, and Chekhov as its undisputed father. The
prose of Proust and Joyce, the poetry of Pound and Eliot, the films of DW
Griffiths et seq., the music of Erik Satie and John Cage, will all be seen
as major influences, and the importance of Stanislavski and Brecht will be
given due weight. The Pause will be seen as one of the key technical and
expressive devices of modernism.
The pause in Beckett will be reassessed, of course, and given yet more
honour. A revisionist chapter will give fresh credit to Joe Orton and
Marguerite Duras for their hitherto under-praised use of the pause in all
its ambiguities. Who knows? Maybe Coward and Rattigan will prove to have
been secret masters of the pause as well. I confess that I await 'The Pause
in 20th-Century Drama' with no small impatience. But it will stand or fall
by its treatment of Harold Pinter.
Readers of Pinter's plays will know that 'Pause' and 'Silence' are frequent
directions in the text, and will have pondered the separate implications of
both words. Theatre-goers, however, may feel that there should be more than
two words to cover the wordless moments in Pinter. If the Eskimos have
umpteen different words for snow, after all, why not as many for Pinter's
pauses? He gives them umpteen different nuances.
In One for the Road (1984), pauses are simply part of police-state
interrogation. In four scenes, Nicholas, who is or seems to be chief of
police, interviews a family of prisoners: husband, wife, seven-year-old son.
The pauses here are filled with suspense. They are the prisoners' refusal to
answer, their failure to comprehend the question, their shock at the nature
of the question, and they are also moments in which the interrogator changes
tack from one line of thought to another.
As often in Pinter, one actually finds oneself wanting more pauses, for
Nicholas - who does almost all the talking - jumps from one thought to
another with bewildering fluency. The bewilderment is both ours and the
prisoners'; and so, as we follow Nicholas's words, we begin to react as they
do. Nicholas is a monomaniac, and his interrogation is at least half filled
by his declarations of his own importance, his nearness to God, and his
irresistible allure. As he proceeds, we sense something else: that all his
talk only reveals the flaws of his own mind. Silence, by contrast, is
golden.
One for the Road was being performed in the second week of Dublin's Gate
Theatre's Pinter Festival, along with Old Times (1971). Talk about contrast]
Whereas One for the Road is (with Mountain Language) Pinter's most overtly
political play, Old Times is entirely to do with a man (Deeley) and a woman
(Anna) meeting, and in part competing, to stake personal claims upon the
past and present of Deeley's wife, Kate. And whereas the several ambiguities
of One for the Road (director: John Crowley) are not its most forceful
feature, the ambiguities of Old Times (directed by Kevin Billington) keep
growing.
Deep beneath the surface, however, both plays express one of Pinter's most
deep-held concerns: that no one can or should possess or control anyone
else. In One for the Road, this point is immediately and overtly political.
In Old Times, it is subtly and eventually feminist: Kate resists the claims
of both husband and oldest friend, affirming her own independence no less
than Nora in A Doll's House. Yet the play is no more about her than it is
about the other two. Very beautifully, it shows time past within time
present, and shows people using, and being used by, old times. Not only can
no one be possessed by anyone else; eventually, no one can ever be known by
anyone else. Here is the quintessence of Pinter.
A brilliant gimmick of this festival has been to cast a leading actor, each
week, in two plays. In Week Two it was Michael Pennington who played both
Nicholas and Deeley. Pennington is one of the last of a line of those RSC
stars whose command of vocal technique is (forgive the pun) breathtaking.
His Nicholas is a bass, his Deeley a tenor. He can, as Nicholas, produce an
effortless fortissimo - and then, as a psychological twist, produce an
effort-ful fortissimo. His phrasing is always musical, and one attends to
his every word. His only abiding fault - never a major problem, but a fault
in Pinter as in Shakespeare  - is that he lacks the art to conceal his own
art.
In this pair of Pinters, however, I found that he slightly overplayed the
contrast between the two characters. Deeley has his feeble side, sure; but
if Nicholas is played so much as the sinister controlling figure, One for
the Road loses its subtler tensions. This fault was shared by his Irish
colleagues, who stressed the terrorised protesting side of the imprisoned
family. The two women in Old Times, Olwen Fouere and Catherine Byrne, were
also Irish. Doesn't the text suggest reverse casting? Though the play is set
in England, Deeley slips into Joyce-like parlance ('bejasus'), whereas
Anna's lyrical stream-of-consciousness flights sound rather Virginia Woolf.
This hardly matters, however. All the Irish actors bring a naturalness to
Pinter that frees his plays of the hothouse atmosphere that can, in England,
become precious. And a common theme throughout the festival has been the
designs by Eileen Diss. Their elegant economy is always in ideal accord with
the plays. At each performance the Dublin audience responds readily to
Pinter's humour, lyricism, and deeper humanity.
The Pinter Festival ends this week with a matinee of Landscape and evening
of Moonlight.
