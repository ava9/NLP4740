<TEXT>
<P>
A play dramatizing the relationship between poet William Butler Yeats and the 
fierce Irish nationalist Maud Gonne is a curiosity whose appeal might point to 
literati and keepers of the Gaelic flame. 
</P>
<P>
But in this West Coast premiere of "The Country of the Young" at the Celtic 
Arts Center, Yeats' unrequited love for tempestuous freedom-fighter Gonne in 
turn-of-the-century Ireland assumes a gnarling passion that is absorbing as 
theater and literary history. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Susie Burke shows us Yeats in his middle 20s, before his fame, when 
he is bedazzled by the beautiful, wealthy, agrarian protest leader Gonne, who 
enlists him in her cause to free Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
As Yeats, sublimating his love for Gonne into his art, Michael Bryan is 
endearing in his restrained ardor. Vikki Powell's heroine catches the force of 
a suffragist, a worldly, rebellious woman who sublimates her own human 
passions, including her children, to the cause of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Yeats once wrote in an unpublished memoir that Gonne became "the troubling time 
of my life," and director Brendan Dillon accelerates the churning rhythms of a 
relationship that both inspires and agonizes the virginal Yeats. 
</P>
<P>
Most interesting, in this two-character play, is the couple's 
literary/political axis, a kind of surrogate sex. But undying patience takes 
its toll on Yeats. The characters, through the decade or so that we follow 
them, tumble into deepening confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
The play's staging suffers ragged moments. A desk and settee fail to counter 
the dankness of the interior set design. But this earthly reduction of lofty 
figures never deflates or demeans the subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5651 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., 
through March 26. Tickets: $6-$10; (213) 462-6844. 
</P>
<P>
'La Ronde' 
</P>
<P>
A carrousel of sexual entanglements in decadent Vienna, Austrian playwright 
Arthur Schnitzler's "La Ronde" slips in and out of focus in Martin Magner's 
production at the Harman Avenue Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The show enjoys sybaritic moments as it spins through 10 seductive dialogues. 
Actors Stephanie White, Tim Didlake, Rick Telles and Ron Brooks stylishly catch 
the promiscuity and the last hurrah of Hapsburg Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
But director Magner, a specialist in modern central European drama, has 
discarded the traditional Eric Bentley translation for a new and more idiomatic 
translation by Carl R. Mueller. The contemporary shift in tone alternately 
wings the play out of Imperial Vienna (turn-of-the century nightshirts 
notwithstanding). In one instance of miscasting, Jeffrey Winner's abrasively 
clownish poet blows the fin de siecle aura altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Schnitzler, a contemporary of Freud, wrote with the dispassion of the physician 
he was. And the majority of Magner's 10-member cast mirrors the cynical, 
furtive dance of loveless love (Stacey Havener's deceptive sweetness is a 
plum). But too many of these shifting duets end up as cardboard sex instead of 
Schnitzler's intricate betrayals. On the other hand, the lascivious actress and 
the count (White and Didlake) epitomize the cynical intangibles of an overripe 
Vienna. There are Strauss waltzes in the air, but no student prince. 
</P>
<P>
 At 521 La Brea Ave., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., through 
April 2. Tickets: $8-$12; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Bodies Once Young' 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Baroque's theater wing is committed to the use of language, and in the 
case of "Bodies Once Young," the company is dramatizing two short stories, 
Sherwood Anderson's "The Man Who Became a Woman" and "Fudge" by Meridel Le 
Sueur. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alec Doyle's evocation of these Midwestern monologues is seductive, 
pristine, almost bleached in the production's lean and clean verbal momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fudge," first published in "Fantasy" magazine in 1933 and adapted by Martin 
Worman, performer Jay W. MacIntosh's rich country accent has to fight echoic 
stage acoustics, but she prevails. Her portrait of a woman looking out her 
window and recreating a woeful tale of lost opportunity is quietly riveting. 
</P>
<P>
The more bizarre solo turn is by Joseph G. Medalis playing a husband taking a 
bath in "The Man Who Became a Woman," from Anderson's short-story collection 
"Horses and Men" (1923) and adapted by William Lanteau and director Doyle. Easy 
preconceptions make the title misleading but it makes psychological sense. 
</P>
<P>
Medalis is sublime splashing water around in his old-fashioned bathtub with its 
four little feet. His character blithely shares his strange coming-of-age 
story, concerning an attraction for a racehorse when he was a youthful groom on 
the fairgrounds circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The evening is short but unique, with expressive acting turning the 
first-person narrative form into theatrical coinage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Old Venice City Hall, 681 Venice Blvd., Venice, Saturdays and Sundays, 
8 p.m., through March 19. Tickets: $8; (213) 822-3006. 
</P>
<P>
'Joseph' 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Community Playhouse is staging the nostalgic "Joseph," a young 
man's reminiscence of his childhood growing up in his father's New York deli in 
the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The new play by Long Beach playwright Arthur Josephs has 13 cast members, four 
of whom give credible performances: Ralph Richmond's boisterous Jewish father 
figure, Jesse Sweeney as his young son, Jim Grollman as the young boy grown up, 
and Dennis Mooney's staunch family friend. 
</P>
<P>
But stereotypical characters abound. Director Robert Telford's staging is flat 
and stiff. The show has no momentum or respect for detail. We're in the early 
1930s and hear the father describe Trotsky's murder, which didn't occur until 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5021 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, tonight and Saturday only, 8 p.m. Tickets: 
$9; (213) 494-1616. 
</P>
<P>
'Generations' 
</P>
<P>
The Colony's generational drama at the Studio Theatre Playhouse features strong 
acting and a textured production design. But these rewards are lavished on a 
crisis that never generates tension. 
</P>
<P>
Set outside a family cabin in the Oregon mountains, "Generations" by Dennis 
Clontz is overwrought with relationships difficult to sort out and slow to 
gather momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The play's catalyst, who alights from her cabin in the second act, is a 
mentally ailing mother with brief intimations of awareness (distinctively 
played by Kathryn Fuller). 
</P>
<P>
Frustrations fester among the old lady's caring husband (the quiet dignity of 
Russ Marin) and the aging couple's three visiting adult children (an affable 
Richard Lineback, a jittery-when-not-hysterical Judith Heinz and the simmering, 
visceral J. Downing, who also designed the dimensional, woodsy set). Meanwhile, 
a gathering storm brews within a reticent in-law (Kristina Coggins). 
</P>
<P>
Few of these eddies and swirls are involving or focused. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1944 Riverside Dr., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday, 7 p.m. 
Tickets: $10-$15; (213) 665-3011.
