PADDY CLARKE HA HA HA by Roddy Doyle Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 12.99, 282
pages
TOWARDS the end of this novel its eponymous hero, Paddy Clarke, a
10-year-old from the dismal working class Dublin suburbs of 1968,
inarticulately senses he needs affection, badly - even from his younger
brother Sinbad. Sinbad's role in life is to be used by Paddy as a punchbag
or a receptacle for lighter fuel.
'I won't hit you again, okay; ever,' says Paddy. No answer from Sinbad.
Paddy continues. 'I waited a bit. Then I kicked him. And I thumped him.
Twice. Then I felt my back go freezing; someone was looking. I turned.
No-one. I couldn't hit him again though.'
Roddy Doyle has lost none of his talent for close social observation and
linguistic emulation in this, his fourth published novel in four years. His
three previous - The Commitments (1987), The Snapper (1990) and The Van
(1991) - were set in fictional Barrytown and established Doyle's reputation
for having a perfect ear for the vernacular of the back streets of working
class Dublin.
The Barrytown trilogy depicts Dublin's underclass as having immense power,
self-esteem, innate dignity, wit and sense of humour, qualities which enable
the characters to surmount the shabbiness of their context. Despite the
social and intellectual deprivation, they inhabit an attractive, vigorous
world, where poverty is eclipsed by a fecund, rollicking, communal humanity.
With Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha Doyle stays inside the head of Barrytown's
underclass, but the world has become much darker, fiercer, fragmented.
Rather than finding comfort inside his community or breaking out of it into
a wider world, Paddy Clarke is trapped, limited to discovering the
inadequacies of his context without being able to either fight or accept
them. He becomes estranged, breaching one of his society's taboos - fighting
well but dirty - and his defiance in his consequent isolation rings hollow.
In other words, there is much less Roddy Doyle ho ho ho; much more Krapp's
Last Tape. What we have is a novelist of considerable power who knows he can
turn on the tricks and make us smile wryly or hoot with laughter, but who
delves instead into something more profound - the creation of an
individual's moral self.
That makes the novel sound didactic. It isn't. But when the laughter died
away in The Snapper a background vitality ebbed back into the picture. In
Paddy Clarke, each time the smiling stops the heart is left a fraction more
frozen over.
Doyle has not been universally adored in his home city. His characters use
what conventional society regards as foul language. Their world is dominated
by the pub, music, football, TV and sex - hardly the kind of thing the
snobbish elites of Dublin society wish to have their city associated with.
They should be much more seriously offended by Paddy Clarke, a novel with
much less swearing and hardly any references to sex. On the basis of this,
Doyle is setting out to explore themes much more subversive than bad
language. Paddy Clarke shows Doyle's ability to deliver crushing judgments
on the shortcomings of human society, yet like Joyce to be above, beyond,
absent from the novel, paring his fingernails; but only with apparent
indifference.
