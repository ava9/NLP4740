C P TAYLOR wrote more than 70 plays; this Edinburgh Festival has presented
seven of them. On this evidence seven is more than enough. Taylor is not a
playwright whose work benefits from being gathered together. Though each
play has its own distinct character, there are too many similar dramatic
devices and too many larger ideas in common. How many times have we heard
two characters not conversing but carrying on an alternation of monologues?
How many farcical situations have there been in which a central character is
caught between the various aspects of his life?
Taylor's chief subject, it appears, was conflict of interest. He homed in on
the areas where public and private lives clash; he made black comedy from
situations where disinterested good intentions (especially within the same
person) are defeated by selfish interests. He particularly enjoyed making
his protagonist an artist (see Good, Schippel, The Black and White
Minstrels, Walter) and showing how a passion for music is yet another of a
man's private lives (see also Operation Elvis and And a Nightingale Sang).
It is often said that his best play is Good, and certainly it has been the
best of this festival's seven. But - so suggests this festival - it is
simply the ultimate version of the play he had written often before in
different guises: the most deft treatment of the themes that run through his
other work. There is no blacker subject for comedy than complicity in Nazi
politics; and Good charts with some brilliance the absurd whirlpool of
private interest that sucks John Halder, an initially amiable and
well-meaning intellectual (forever haunted by music), into becoming the
first Kommandant at Auschwitz.
Taylor wrote this for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1981, the last year
of his life.
It seems probable that RSC conditions stimulated him to the top of his form.
He was, by all accounts, a playwright who incorporated and utilised his
cast's abilities; and, though I never saw the RSC production, I believe even
now you can hear Alan Howard's delivery (he was the original Halder) in the
lines themselves.
Not that the new production, by Glasgow's Tron Theatre, feels like a
pastiche. Some of the actors employ Scots accents; the designer, Michael
Boyd, has provided a semi-circular no-place-in-particular set, out of whose
five doors characters keep popping. Conrad Squith's muted slightly dead
about the eyes performance conveys much of Halder's fazed passivity.
Glasgow was Taylor's birthplace and the setting of several of his plays;
Northumberland became his later home, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne the home of
many of his premieres. One of these, the memory play And a Nightingale Sang
(1977) is also set in Newcastle. As presented by the Northern Stage Company
in a new staging by Alan Lyddiard, this turns out to be an adept kind of
wartime soap-opera, half way between Dad's Army and When the Boat Comes In.
What with 'Me Mam' (obsessively Catholic), 'Da's' or 'Our George' (forever
playing the piano) and the gloom-mongering grandpa, it is not far from
Bread.
Set against these relentlessly stock types - and endless refrains of 'Ee,
sit down, yer daft ol' bugger' and 'Joyce, man, I'm that glad to see yer' -
are some more three-dimensional views of the younger generation. Joyce is
pretty but scared of marriage and, subsequently, of sex; later, however, she
is not sure which 'feller' has caused her wartime pregnancy. Her sister
Helen, one leg shorter than the other, is the narrator, plain,
self-conscious and sensible. She welcomes love when it happens to her. Even
when her lover turns out to be married with a child, she is stoically
grateful for what love left her: new confidence.
What is most Taylorish about all this is the way these girls live their own
lives against the insistent background of the war. It is one of his most
deeply sentimental plays: a fact which Helen's apparent hard-headedness and
the stereotyping of the older folk only help to underline. I too am a sucker
for this kind of thing, but it is so close to umpteen television treatments
of growing up in the war that I do not need to go to the theatre to see it.
When Taylor was at his best, he interlaced politics and personal lives far
more tightly; he showed his characters' reluctant complicity, duplicity,
guilt. In short, he made Good.
The Tron production of Good at St Bride's Centre and Northern Stage's And a
Nightingale Sang, at the Church Hill Theatre, both end their Edinburgh
performances today.
