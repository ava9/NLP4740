THE CALL OF THE TOAD by Gunter Grass Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 248
pages
THE PROFESSOR hero of Gunter Grass's new novel is nicknamed Jeremiah, a
reproach often levelled at his creator. The Call of the Toad - a funny,
wise, hugely enjoyable fantasy - confirms Grass as Germany's most eloquent
literary prophet.
Since the Tin Drum in 1959, Grass has transformed figures from European folk
tales into potent symbols for his distrust of 20th-century Germany, and has
written a string of anarchic, warning novels. The fable titles - The Rat,
Cat and Mouse - are giveaways; there was also a malevolent black hound in
Dog Years; a feminist fish in The Flounder; an elusive snail, metaphor for
political change, in the 1970s; and, most famously, the dwarf Oskar who
refuses to grow up in amoral Nazi Germany in The Tin Drum.
With The Call of the Toad, Grass brings the fable landscape of the Europe of
his lifetime up to date. At once a satire on post-1989 politics and a love
story, it shows two sides of the author: firebrand and mellowed, humane
observer.
In the Tin Drum, sex was as sordid as the regime that encompassed it; 30
years on, the heart of this new piece is the romantic meeting between
Alexandra and Alexander, both widowed, at the Gdansk market just before the
fall of the Berlin wall. She is a Pole exiled from Lithuania; he, like
Grass, is a German born in the city when it was Danzig and now exiled in
west Germany. She is a gildress, he an expert tomb restorer. From a double
optimism - their art and their late-blooming love - emerges an ironic
fantasy.
The couple found a Cemetery of Reconciliation for German natives of Gdansk
to be buried in the city, and for Poles to be buried in Lithuania. But the
idea takes off too quickly; speculators move in, the powerful Deutschemark
devours plots all over Gdansk. There are vulgar re-burials and
recrimination. Capitalism defeats idealism: a metaphor for present west-east
relations and the too-hasty German reunification, against which Grass
campaigned from the start.
As in the Tin Drum, his masterstroke is to interpret horror through a
so-called image which amuses without being flippant. Satirical echoes crash
through the pages. At the lyrical core is a folklore parallel: the call of
the toad, which the couple record on the Baltic estuaries, by superstition
foreshadows disaster. In 1990, the toad calls too early in the spring; by
1999, the nightmare is of 'a spanking new bicycle rickshaw with a toad as
passenger, rolling in the direction of the future.'
Grass's novels are always embellished by the same grotesque chorus - fish,
eels, toads, snails, boletus mushrooms squirm like details from German
expressionist paintings, the edible or vegetable now animate, now
transformed into a human face. Among contemporaries, only the novelist
Garcia Marquez equals him as an image-maker.
Stone by stone, rivulet by mudbank, Danzig and the Baltic coast build up
into the poetic symbol and creative spring of all Grass's work; like Joyce's
Dublin or Bashevis Singer's Poland, they are the dream home of the exiled
writer, evoked half a century on with the microscopic precision of a guide
book. But they are also an historical symbol.
In the Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse, Danzig is the backcloth for Grass's
dissection of nazism; it was also the prize at the end of the Polish
Corridor for which Hitler began the second world war. In the 1980s, unrest
in Gdansk's shipyards heralded the end of communism in eastern Europe. In
The Call of the Toad, Gdansk citizens are guilt-ravaged but on the make, and
the city loses its soul to the Deutschmark:
Danzig holds the novel together like a magnet; taut yet exuberant, complex
yet clear as a nursery rhyme, endlessly inventive, its themes pull always
back to this central image. Translated by the masterly Ralph Manheim (who
died so recently) into limpid, lively prose,The Call of the Toad shows Grass
as one of our greatest living storytellers.
