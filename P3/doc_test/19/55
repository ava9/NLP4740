<P>
No local survey on the question exists, but the most frequent religion 
newsmaker in Southern California during 1989 was Roman Catholic Archbishop 
Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, 53, was in the news throughout the year -- from the disclosure in 
February of a $395,000 jet helicopter donated for his use in the three-county 
archdiocese to his leadership role in a statement on AIDS that criticized 
condoms. The statement eventually was approved by the U.S. Catholic bishops in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Although in the news much less than Mahony over the course of the year, San 
Diego Bishop Leo T. Maher took on a high media profile late in 1989. Maher set 
off a storm of reaction by barring a Catholic parishioner, Democrat 
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, from Communion in the midst of her campaign for a 
state Senate seat because of her pro-choice position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts -- and Killea's opponent -- said Maher's action might 
have, due to the publicity it generated, mobilized pro-choice forces and 
contributed to her election. 
</P>
<P>
In what was a precursor to Maher's action, Mahony stirred criticism on June 1 
when he declared that all Catholic officeholders in government "have a positive 
moral obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion. Mahony 
did not threaten church sanctions, however. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, Mahony's protracted, losing battle with Catholic cemetery 
workers who voted to unionize led to strained relations in Los Angeles with 
organized labor leaders. But Mahony won praise in the civic arena for his 
efforts to help AIDS sufferers with hospices and to defend the rights of 
immigrants and refugees, as well as for serving on the city commission that 
wrote a wide-ranging ethics code for Los Angeles officials. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the archbishop became chairman of the Catholic bishops' 
International Policy Committee, making him the point man on policy statements 
on Vietnam and the Middle East and a spokesman for the bishops' views on 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Merely being the spiritual and administrative leader of the nation's most 
populous (now 3.4 million Catholics) archdiocese would seem to ensure automatic 
newsmaker status for the resident archbishop. But that hasn't always been the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's predecessor, publicity-shy Cardinal Timothy Manning, avoided the 
public spotlight. Manning, who learned early this year that he was suffering 
from cancer and died in June at 79, was in the news more in 1989 than he was 
during most of the 15 years he headed the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Other religion newsmakers in Southern California during the year included two 
Buddhists: the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize during his second 
extended visit to this region, and U.S.-born Buddhist leader Osel Tendzin, who 
went into seclusion in La Jolla (later in Ojai) after leaders of his Tibetan 
sect accused him of not disclosing that he was infected with the AIDS virus 
while continuing to have homosexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Rev. Fred Price of Crenshaw Christian Center opened the 
largest-capacity church in the country last September, his 10,145-seat 
FaithDome in South-Central Los Angeles. The same month, Bill Bright, 
founder-president of Campus Crusade for Christ, announced that the group's 
headquarters will move from San Bernardino to Orlando, Fla., in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
* FLOAT 
</P>
<P>
For the 39th year, a layman's league affiliated with the Lutheran 
Church-Missouri Synod will have a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade on 
Jan. 1 in Pasadena. The only religiously sponsored float amid 60 entries, it 
will feature a dove with outstretched wings that lower at key points along the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
* PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James Angell, former pastor (1969-87) of Claremont Presbyterian Church 
and now serving temporarily at St. Mark Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, 
will serve as interim pastor, starting in March, at historic Madison Avenue 
Presbyterian Church in New York City. The Rev. David H. C. Read, who held forth 
at the Manhattan pulpit for 33 years, retired this month at 80. JOHN DART
