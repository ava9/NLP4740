IT HAS been a gloomy year for the UK economy but a reasonably profitable one
for stock market investors. As 1993 approaches, investing prospects are
clouded by hopes for recovery in the UK and the US, and fears of recession
in Europe and Japan.
To help private investors make their choices for the New Year, the Weekend
FT asked leading fund managers to look into their crystal balls and forecast
what would happen to the world's major markets.
Michael Hart, joint manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust says: 'I
am reasonably hopeful about all the major markets in 1993. German interest
rate policy will continue to be the dominating influence. The Bundesbank
will probably reduce interest rates later rather than sooner but reductions
are inevitable at some stage as the recession deepens in Germany.
'UK rates can probably be safely reduced another notch in the New Year and
further falls will be possible later as German rates come down. The UK
market should be encouraged by lower interest rates and a good corporate
profits outlook based on rationalisation benefits, devaluation and lower
financing costs.
'A target of 3000 for the FT-SE 100 Index seems within reach. Continental
markets should also respond to easier interest rates with France a prime
beneficiary.
'I am positive about Wall Street with a favourable profits outlook and
inflation staying low but the largest part of the return in 1993 will
probably come from a stronger dollar.
'Although I was proved completely wrong about Japan in 1992, I remain
hopeful in the coming year. The market is discounting a great deal of bad
news but the government will soon have to increase liquidity and implement
the supplementary budget. A 15 per cent rise to the 20,000 level could
easily occur.'
Recalling the old Chinese proverb, Martin Wooller, fixed income director of
Fidelity Investments in London, expects 'interesting times' in 1993. 'Global
equity, bonds and foreign exchange markets will continue to diverge widely
(and wildly),' he says.
'The cyclical trough has been seen for the US dollar and bonds. The currency
will appreciate by at least 10 per cent trade weighted (Dollars 1.30/Pounds
by end 1993) and the 30 year bond yield will rise to 8.5 per cent.
'In Europe, the implosion of the German economy will be the driving force
for markets. Eventually, even the Bundesbank will ease - but probably not
until March/April. When it does the speed and extent of the ease will
astound most observers. This will provide the backdrop to an eventual
valuation-driven recovery in European equities.
'The UK, struggling to re-ignite its economy, will follow the US approach -
cutting short rates to 4 per cent by June, embarking upon competitive
depreciation of the pound against the European partners (DM/Pounds at below
2.20) and steepening the yield curve until the long end of the sterling bond
market offers outrageous value to the non-resident. Expect long gilts to
reach near 10 per cent before they enjoy a brief, but sharp, rally in the
latter half of 1993.
'By late 1993, though, markets will be concerned about the government's
inability to control either the budget deficit (Pounds 55bn in 1993-94) or
its current account deficit (rising towards Pounds 17bn). There is thus the
significant risk of a 1976 IMF-style crisis during 1994.
'Finally, in Japan, recovery will come eventually - but probably not until
the second half of 1993 as a second reflationary package, involving direct
tax cuts is introduced.
'World growth in 1993 is likely to be anaemic', believes David Rosier,
chairman of Mercury Fund Managers. 'Currencies will continue to have a
significant impact on the relative performance of equity and bond markets.
We expect the US dollar to strengthen further against sterling.
'In the UK, the debt burden, the depressed housing market and rising
unemployment will restrain consumer confidence, leading only to a gentle
economic recovery. However, the equity market should make reasonable
progress as we now have a realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates,
which will help corporate profits to recover.
'Given our view that corporate growth will be uneven and patchy, we believe
that it is too early to overweight the highly cyclical recovery stocks and
we therefore continue to emphasise growth stocks. The market is not
outstandingly cheap for this point in the economic cycle but the rating is
sustainable given that we are emerging from recession, inflation is under
control and the real dividend yield is attractive.
'We expect that interest rates in Germany will decline in 1993, allowing
rates in other major European markets to do likewise. As a result, we
believe that the prospects for continental European markets are exciting,
with the exception of Germany, where the economy will continue to slow.
'The US market seems now to be discounting much of the anticipated stimulus
from Clinton's new administration but encouraging economic trends point to
an acceleration in economic growth in 1993. We expect the best performance
to come from the small and medium-sized companies. Japan remains expensive
and risky with little recovery expected from the current recession. In the
Pacific region, growth will remain strong but the progress of markets is
likely to be volatile and influenced by political factors.
'As in 1992, sluggish economic growth worldwide and low inflation should
also allow bonds to perform well, especially in Europe, given the outlook
for interest rates and we believe that there is unlikely to be a wide
divergence between the performance of bonds and equities. In an environment
of falling interest rates, cash is our least favoured asset.'
Alistair Haddow, investment director of Murray Johnstone Unit Trust
Management, says: 'We expect 1993 will be a year of low, but almost
non-inflationary, economic growth, suggesting a generally favourable
background for equities as well as bonds. However, with the major economic
blocs at different stages of the cycle, next year could be a story of two
halves.
'Although the UK and US stock markets have been pushing into new high
ground, it is in these areas that most of the corporate pain of
restructuring and cost reduction have already occurred and the potential for
a recovery in profits is therefore greatest. We would stay with these
markets but at some point, possibly mid year, the good news will be fully in
the price. Smaller companies may well keep running, as investors seek out
undervalued situations.
'Also at about mid-year, the bad economic and corporate news currently
unfolding in Japan and Europe will cease to shock and these markets will
pick up, not in an expected profits recovery but in falling interest rates.
From a UK perspective, the home market will be hard to beat over the full
year.'
'Global growth prospects are not synchronised,' argues Paul Manduca, who is
shortly to become deputy chief executive of the merged Henderson/Touche
Remnant group. 'While the US is now emerging from recession and should show
growth of 2 per cent during 1993, and the UK economy looks about to recover,
the Japanese economy will remain severely depressed during 1993 and is
likely to show zero growth. In addition, mainland Europe is on the point of
entering recession.
'This picture suggests that world inflation is likely to stay low in 1993
and that commodity prices generally will remain soft. Although budget
deficits are rising throughout the OECD for both cyclical and policy
reasons, private savings rates are also rising while investment, except in
the US, will remain further. This suggests that world interest rates will
decline a bit more in 1993. Against this background, selective investment in
bond markets could prove rewarding.
'Currencies are likely to reflect these economic cycles. The dollar should
be strong while the yen and DM blocks weaken. Sterling looks undervalued
against the DM but not against the dollar. The crucial test for sterling
will come when the underlying inflation rate breaches the chancellor's
current target, possibly in late 1993. Provided interest rates are raised at
that point, sterling should finish the year strongly.
'As far as share prices are concerned, the US market looks fairly fully
valued, although sterling investors may gain from dollar strength. The UK
market should have a good year as economic recovery takes hold and profit
prospects improve, particularly in the smaller companies sector. We remain
nervous about the Japanese market, although prospects may look better later
in the year. European stock markets hinge on lower German interest rates and
on this basis, we expect good returns from France and Germany by year end.
Finally, for high risk investors, we like Hong Kong and Australia, but would
avoid Italy.'
'Next year should see the start of a slow but sustainable recovery in the UK
economy, with low levels of inflation,' believes Dick Barfield, chief
investment manager of Standard Life. 'There are many similarities with the
recovery in the early 1980s, but one major difference. The amount of debt
which was built up in the late 1980s will dissuade people and companies from
borrowing much more for some time.
'The cost reductions which companies have undertaken, together with some
improvement in demand for their products and the lower level of sterling,
will cause company profits to jump by around 20 per cent in 1993. This,
together with the low level of inflation, should enable UK equities to
produce a return in excess of cash. Gilts should also show a good real
return.'
'Equity market returns should also be positive outside the UK. The recovery
in the US economy should continue. The US equity market is anticipating this
so returns will be low, but should be helped, for a UK holder, a strong
dollar.
'Japan is still suffering from its over-indulgence in the late 1980s when
too much money was lent and property prices went through the roof. Inflation
is very low there and interest rates should fall further in 1993. The equity
market is unlikely to move up until there are signs of economic recovery,
which may not be until later in 1993.'
'Germany is suffering from the costs of absorbing the East and its economy
is weakening quite sharply. Interest rates should continue to fall but
probably not very quickly. This will limit the opportunities for growth in
Europe outside Germany and will probably continue to cause pressures in the
Exchange Rate Mechanism. European equities might perform better late in the
year, once policy in Germany becomes clearer.'
'Overall, we are optimistic about the returns which can be achieved in
financial markets. Longer term returns will be lower than in the 1980s, but
should be higher than inflation.'
Peter Smith, managing director of AXA Equity &amp; Law Investment Managers,
says: 'Strength in the US economy will be essential to the well-being of all
other major markets during 1993. Although now trading close to record
levels, with equities largely fully priced, the US market will respond
positively to the emerging recovery under President Clinton. 'In the UK,
corporate profits will benefit from the combination of low interest rates,
stable inflation, currency devaluation and improved productivity. Coupled
with better consumer sentiment, this should provide a powerful kick to the
economy and hence to the equity market.
'Continental European investors will enter 1993 faced with numerous
uncertainties. Although tentative signs of monetary easing are detectable,
fiscal policy is still restrictive. The outlook for the ERM will continue to
cause volatility in currencies and thus in markets, until the Germans show
signs of reducing interest rates. We favour companies with an exposure to
the US economy.
'The outlook for Japanese equities remains difficult. Slow economic growth
will prevent a recovery in corporate profits. Given the high valuation of
the market, the upside on the Nikkei 225 index appears limited to 19,000,
but official support may prevent a fall below 14,000.
Finally, someone who is not a fund manager but who has featured regularly on
these pages as a pessimist about equities. David Kauders, a Taunton-based
investment consultant, says 'equity markets perceived the policy changes of
1992 as miracle cures. 1993 may be the year that the miracles run out of
steam.
'This recession is changing form; the squeeze hurts governments, which will
be less willing to bail out ever-growing social needs. Financial
institutions will also have less activity all around, and the combined
effect must drain equity enthusiasm.
'US Treasury bonds continue to be the only market where the odds favour
sterling investors. I see Dollars 1.50 as a pausing point on the way to
purchasing power parity at Dollars 1. Gilts remain a hold, but otherwise
most investments are too risky. My advice is stand aside and let others make
the mistakes.'
