FT  09 JUL 93 / Underweight and over here: UK bonds and equities are
attractive foreign targets for US institutional investors

US investment institutions have been notoriously shy of investing in
overseas securities. But with Wall Street putting a value on US corporate
earnings and assets higher than that prevailing before the 1929 crash, there
are signs that the rest of the world risks catching the fever as US fund
managers see attractions in cheaper overseas markets. Indeed, there is a
hint of a parallel with the Japanese speculative bubble in the late 1980s.
While the monetary symptoms are different, an important shift in asset
allocation is under way and the impact is no less significant for third
parties - not least the UK, which has almost certainly been the biggest
recent beneficiary of the outward flow of funds. Meanwhile, a wider process
of international diversification gathers pace, raising questions about how
far differences in earnings multiples and dividend yields between individual
country markets might be ironed out.
First, the data. In 1992, US investors' net purchases of foreign bonds and
equities increased by 9.3 per cent to Dollars 51bn. On the crude statistics
from the US Treasury, nearly all of the Dollars 19bn earmarked for foreign
bonds in 1992 went into the UK, while the UK displaced Japan last year as
the biggest repository for US equity investors' money, accounting for
Dollars 11.3bn of a Dollars 32bn total outflow. That Dollars 11.3bn compares
with net purchases of equities by UK life funds and pension funds in 1992 of
Dollars 4.4bn out of a total cash flow of Dollars 35.7bn.
In practice, the UK share is probably overstated, in that it almost
certainly includes some funds that ultimately find their way into
continental Europe. But Dollars 4.9bn is said to have been invested in the
UK equity market in the final quarter of last year alone, after the
September devaluation added to the attraction of sterling and equities. This
compares with Dollars 4.4bn that found its way to Japan in the whole of
1992; so the broad thesis that the London market has been grabbing the
lion's share looks plausible.
At the same time the flow of portfolio investment from the US into foreign
markets in the first quarter of 1993 has accelerated sharply. According to
UBS Global Research, a record Dollars 26.6bn went into foreign bonds and
equities, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the previous quarter. But, within
those totals, the UK's share of the equity outflow fell from Dollars 4.9bn
to Dollars 1.4bn. That turnround clearly helps explain the sideways movement
of UK equities this year.
The balance of international portfolio diversification is inevitably unequal
because the US and Japan, which respectively accounted for 38.7 per cent and
30.8 per cent of the FT-Actuaries World Index at June 30, are elephants in
the rowing-boat: while inflows from the rest of the world cannot impact
greatly on these two countries' domestic markets, changes in asset
allocation that are small for the US and Japan can cause huge upheavals in
the large number of countries that make up the remaining 30.5 per cent. Put
another way, last year's Dollars 51bn US outflow was equivalent to less than
three months' cash flow of the mutual fund industry alone.
US insurers and pension funds hold only 4-5 per cent of their assets in
foreign securities. But there is a growing awareness of the theoretical
benefits of diversification, which increases returns for a given degree of
risk; and, as Andrew Garthwaite of SG Warburg Securities points out, most
risk analysis models in the US suggest the figure should be nearer 15 per
cent.
The incentive to raise the portfolio percentage overseas has been reinforced
by the beneficial impact of prolonged dollar weakness on the performance of
institutions with above-average foreign holdings. The fact that the US
equity market remains obdurately overvalued, and that private investors
continue to pour money into mutual funds, makes higher-yielding markets in
Britain and France look all the more tempting.
Increasing integration in world capital markets should be economically
beneficial in that it encourages capital to flow more efficiently into
investment that promises a high return. Yet in practice the flows are oddly
distributed. The UK market, for example, offers less in the way of
diversification benefits than any other European market because of the UK
corporate sector's disproportionately large direct investment in the United
States. Yet it hogs a disproportionate share of international money. The
emerging markets in developing countries offer the biggest diversification
benefits, because of their low correlation with international market
movements: they do not move in step with the fund manager's domestic market.
Yet the World Bank calculates that they account for less than a quarter of a
per cent of worldwide institutional assets.
This highlights the fact that institutional money tends to go to the most
liquid markets, rather than to those that offer the highest degree of
diversification. And it raises a question about how far integration can go.
In theory the scope is immense. The World Bank estimates, for example, that
global institutional investment funds are worth Dollars 14,000bn. If the
fund managers were to make a modest genuflection to modern portfolio theory
and put just 10 per cent into foreign securities, the impact on markets
would be considerable.
Yet even in the US the constraints on foreign investment are not to be
under-estimated. While private sector pension funds enjoy considerable
freedom, state pension funds, whose cash flow is still growing strongly,
often have restrictions on overseas investment. For US insurers, state rules
are often prohibitive. Even where they are being relaxed, as in New York
State where the ceiling on foreign investments was lifted from 3 per cent to
6 per cent in 1990, insurers are still prevented from obeying the full logic
of risk analysis.
In Japan, fund managers formally enjoy sufficient discretion to diversify
their portfolios significantly. But in practice official guidance still
plays an important part in determining the flow of funds. In continental
Europe, there are heavy restraints on cross-border investments, as well as
explicit requirements in some countries to invest a given portfolio
percentage in government bonds. This means that capital market integration
is more of a one-way street; and now the process has in effect been frozen,
after a decision to put a liberalising European Community pensions directive
on the Brussels back burner last month.
As for the developing countries, their capital markets suffer from lack of
liquidity, poor information and regulatory restraints on foreign capital.
Yet many are beginning to recognise that portfolio inflows reduce the cost
of capital for domestic companies. One spectacular result of this change in
attitude can be seen in Latin America, where gross equity portfolio inflows
have gone from Dollars 434m in 1989 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. International
bond issues have performed in similarly dramatic fashion. Repatriated flight
capital has played a part, as have high-risk, high-return funds. But foreign
insurers and pension funds have so far been insignificant contributors.
At first sight, a reduction in the cost of capital in the recipient country
looks an attractive gain from capital market liberalisation. So, too, does
the idea that these flows represent more stable long-term finance for budget
deficits and the balance of payments. On this ground alone, the UK might be
thankful that US institutions are a little less underweight,
internationally, and over here. Yet there is scant evidence that US
institutions are building up core holdings in European markets, establishing
big foreign companies as permanent features in the portfolio. And there is
plenty of anecdotal evidence that cross-border institutional investment is
just hot money in another guise - witness the role of pension funds in the
currency turmoil in Europe last September.
Certainly British institutions take a shorter-term view of foreign markets
and generate a far higher level of turnover and activity in overseas
securities than at home. All of which points to a greater degree of
volatility as world markets integrate further.
