A WELL-RECEIVED bond auction in Germany provided an impetus for bund
investors yesterday.
The DM4.25bn auction of bonds issued by Treuhand, the state agency
responsible for privatising companies in the former east Germany, resulted
in an accepted bid price of 99.49 and a yield of 6.7 per cent. There was no
official statement of the demand but dealers said it was well-covered with
considerable domestic interest.
Traders said investors were selling bund futures to buy the Treuhand bonds,
which form part of a DM10bn issue announced on Tuesday.
The sale was the main factor in a generally quiet day with no signals coming
from the repo rate announcement - the variable rate was left unchanged at
7.3 per cent - and little indication that the Bundesbank intended to cut
rates when it next meets on July 15.
However, economists hope to glean some information from the next money
supply growth figures, due at that central bank meeting. The last M3 figure
of 6.7 per cent was above the central bank's target range and if next week's
figure is within the range there is a greater chance of a further monetary
easing at the final council meeting before the summer break on July 29.
Futures selling to buy the Treuhand bond saw the bund contract for September
lose earlier gains and close only 2 basis points higher at 95.39.
THE UK government bond market ran out of steam yesterday as both sterling
and gilts had been considered overbought.
With no economic data on the horizon and the tap of 9 per cent stock dated
2008 said to be finally exhausted, the gilts market drifted. Any support
that it received was psychological and came from overseas. Gilt futures for
September were down on the previous close but  1/8 up on the day.
FRENCH government bonds held steady yesterday despite a growing belief that
they have hit a short-term high and are ripe for profit-taking.
Bond prices were helped by a slightly stronger franc, which recovered from
recent weakness against the D-Mark. The yield spread between French and
German 10-year government bonds remained very low, closing at 6 basis
points, according to JP Morgan. On the Matif, September futures rose 0.18 to
119.78.
JAPANESE debt prices were weaker in Tokyo as the Bank of Japan sought to
pour cold water on increasingly heated rate cut rumours.
Speculation has gathered pace that the central bank will cut its official
discount rate, presently at 2 1/4 per cent, by as much as 50 basis points.
Although it is considered unlikely that the bank will ease before the
general election on July 18, traders have been busily discounting any
change.
At its money market operations yesterday, the central bank provided far less
supply than expected and forced short-term rates higher.
The yield on the JGB No 145, which has been below 4.3 per cent in the past
few days, rose to 4.35 per cent and when Japanese bond futures began trading
in London, the September contract slipped 7 basis points to 109.13.
Following comments from a Japanese government official that the pain
threshold for Japanese exporters could be Y95 to Y105 against the dollar,
the September contract recovered to close at 109.30.
AFTER posting early gains on cheaper commodities, US Treasuries fell back as
commodity prices retraced their steps.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 105
11/32 , yielding 6.679 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.992 per cent.
After Tuesday's steep rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index had
deflated Treasury prices, yesterday morning's retreat in the index prompted
some buying among market participants, mostly the professional dealers.
Treasuries fell back from their early gains, however, when the CRB index
began to recover.
Otherwise, attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee, which was meeting to discuss monetary policy. Although the rise
in the CRB index raised some fears that the FOMC would keep its strategy
tilted towards tightening monetary policy, most analysts believe it will
vote to return the bias to neutral in the wake of weak employment data.
