US Treasury prices rose sharply across the board yesterday after the Federal
Reserve, responding to concern about the sluggishness of the domestic
economy, and with one eye on a possible financial crisis in Japan, eased
monetary policy.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  19/32 at 101 19/32 ,
yielding 7.854 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  13/32 at 101
1/4 , yielding 5.058 per cent.
Prices had been firmer in early trading following a positive inflation
report, which showed producer prices rose just 0.2 per cent during March.
The indication that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted may
have been the trigger for the Fed's easing move, which involved intervention
in the credit markets.
The Fed's actions, a series of overnight system repurchase agreements while
the Fed funds rate was trading at 3 7/8 per cent (below its target of 4 per
cent), surprised the market, which had been expecting no intervention. The
move was immediately interpreted as an easing of policy, although analysts
were unsure whether the new target rate was 3 3/4 per cent or 3 1/2 per
cent. In late trading Fed funds were holding steady at 3 3/4 per cent.
Recent messages emanating from the Fed have suggested the authorities remain
concerned about the sluggish nature of the economic recovery, and in
particular about the weakness in money supply growth. Yesterday's signal
that the Fed wants to see lower interest rates was interpreted as an attempt
to address those problems.
The sharp declines in Tokyo stock markets over the past week, and growing
concern that an economic slump in Japan could stifle world - and therefore
US - economic recovery, may also have helped persuade the Fed the time was
right for a further easing.
DURING normal trading hours yesterday, UK government bonds continued their
last-ditch pre-election advance with further gains of more than half a
point. The market's apparent belief: that the ruling Conservative party
could yet find itself still in office when the votes have been counted.
'It could be the triumph of hope over reason,' one analyst said, adding that
some speculative money had come into the gilts market during the day.
Yesterday's gains come on top of a strong performance already recorded this
week. The market has now climbed firmly away from its low point of a week
ago, when yields touched their high point for the year so far. The benchmark
9 per cent bonds maturing in 2011 had recovered from 93 27/32 to 94 3/4 by
the opening of business yesterday, and during the day moved ahead further to
95 3/8 .
In a moderately busy day on the futures market, the long gilts future, which
opened at 94 17/32 , rose to a high of 95 on news of an easing of US rates,
before easing slightly.
Yesterday's gains reflected both a more positive showing for the
Conservatives in late opinion polls before voting began, and further moves
by traders to cover short positions.
SHORTER-dated bonds in Germany moved ahead yesterday while long dated paper
remained steady, bringing about a further flattening of the German yield
curve.
Two things prompted the greater confidence in shorter-dated paper. One was a
comment by Mr Norbert Kloten, president of Baden-Wurttenberg central bank,
that interest rates should fall in the second half of the year. The second
was the recommendation of an arbitration committee that public sector
workers should receive a pay rise of 5.4 per cent - lower even than the
level the market had been hoping for.
'The market has clearly taken a different view on monetary policy,' said Mr
Klaus Baader, an economist with UBS Securities in London. A week ago,
10-year bonds were yielding 47 basis points more than five-year paper:
yesterday, that differential had fallen to 36 basis points.
JAPANESE government bonds eased yesterday, as investors continued to watch
with horror the havoc being wreaked on the financial sector by the plunge in
share prices.
With the confirmation of the Japanese budget (with its projected borrowing
of Y7,300bn) yesterday acting as a reminder of the extensive supply of bonds
to come in the year ahead, there was little cheer during the day.
The yield on the benchmark bond no. 129 rose during the day from 5.555 per
cent to 5.585 per cent.
