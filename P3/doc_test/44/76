  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (CNS) -- According to the 
Department of Industry and Transport of the State Statistical 
Bureau, since the beginning of the second quarter this year, 
industrial production growth has speeded up at a certain degree 
with such growth in May being two percentage points higher than 
the first quarter, the highest in the same period in the past 
ten or more years. Some problems, including the improper 
linking of production with marketing and low-efficiency of 
enterprises, however, still exist in this sector. 
  According to statistics, between January and May, the added 
value earned by the industrial sector at township level and 
above across the country was RMB [renminbi] 619.6 billion, 
increasing by 16 per cent over the same period last year, and 
the industrial output value in this period in the country was 
RMB 1390.5 billion, 19 per cent up. Of this, RMB 144.7 billion 
of industrial added value and RMB 363.4 billion of industrial 
output value were earned in May, increasing respectively by 17.3 
per cent and 20.5 per cent. 
  The light industrial output value last month in the country 
increased by 23.2 per cent over the same month last year, the 
heavy industrial output value by 18.2 per cent. The growth of 
the former was five percentage points higher than that of the 
latter, and the gap between the two industries' growths 
continued to widen. 
  Since the beginning of this year, light industrial 
production 
has maintained a comparatively high growth. Key durable 
consumer goods and household electrical appliances like wrist 
watches, cameras, video cassette recorders, tape recorders, hifi 
sets, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, and 
vacuum cleaners increased by a range from 30 to 180 per cent. 
Products of textiles, chemical fibre, and clothing grew by a 
rang from 18.5 per cent to 51.2 per cent. 
  The gross output volume of energy last month was 100.93 
million tonnes, 9.1 percentage points higher than the same 
period last year and 5.6 percentage points higher than the first 
four months. Of this, crude coal increased by 10.9 per cent, 
electricity by 12.2 per cent, and crude oil by 1.5 per cent. 
  Relevant officials pointed out that some problems still 
existed in this sector. The sales value of industrial products 
in May was RMB 335.8 billion, 18.1 per cent up over the same 
period last year but 2.4 percentage points lower than that of 
their production in the same period. The ratio of sales to 
production of such products last month was 92.77 per cent, 2.39 
percentage points lower than the same period last year. This 
ratio in the first five months was 92.38 per cent, a drop of 
1.57 percentage points over the same period last year. 
  According to the Bureau, industrial output value in June 
will 
reach RMB 390 billion, about l9 per cent up over the same month 
last year.
