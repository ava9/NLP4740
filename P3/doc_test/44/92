UK government bonds continued their inexorable rise yesterday, helped by the
release of favourable economic data and the expectation that inflation will
stay low, possibly paving the way for a further cut in the base rate.
The biggest gains were seen in the index-linked sector, where long-dated
issues rose over a point. Dealers said the sharp rise reflected the fact
that the index-linked sector had underperformed the rest of the market
recently and was simply 'catching up', encouraged by the release of some
strong buy recommendations from a couple of gilt-edged specialists.
Among conventional stocks, the longer-dated issues performed well, with
gains of over half a point on the day, spurred on by the producer price
data.
Producer output prices were unchanged in November compared with October,
while the annual rate fell to 3.6 per cent from 4 per cent. Input prices
showed a monthly increase of 1.2 per cent, but the yearly rate declined by
1.8 per cent.
While the figures provided cheer for the gilts market by suggesting that
inflationary pressures remain subdued, dealers said the key focus of the
market is the release tomorrow of the Retail Price Index. Market
participants expect underlying inflation to be unchanged or slightly lower
for November.
Gatt and the Bundesbank provided the two main talking points in the European
government bond markets.
Most market participants are optimistic about the prospects of an agreement
on Gatt by the December 15 deadline. In addition, there is plenty of
speculation that the Bundesbank may cut its official interest rates at
Thursday's council meeting.
German government bond futures reached a new high on reasonably good volume,
with dealers saying the market was buoyed by hopes of a cut in the discount
and Lombard interest rates this Thursday.
Even though the repo rate was fixed at 6.00 per cent until January 5, some
dealers said there was a chance of a 25 - 50 basis point cut in headline
rates at this week's council meeting.
In addition, the market will be closely watching the Bundesbank's M3 target
announcement.
The bund futures contract, which opened at 100.76, hit a new all-time high
of 100.95 before slipping back to 100.86 by late afternoon.
Among the high-yielding European markets, Italy ended nearly half a point
higher, helped by a more settled political background, expectations that the
1994 budget will be approved, and hopes of a possible cut in official
interest rates before Christmas.
However, some dealers said that the thin, pre-holiday volume meant that the
market's move was somewhat exaggerated.
Spanish government bonds closed lower, mainly on domestic selling.
Japanese government bonds ended firmer in the cash market as market
participants shrugged off last Friday's news of 0.5 per cent growth in
third-quarter GDP and chose instead to focus on the gloomy quarterly Tankan
survey from the Bank of Japan.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB opened at 3.125 per cent and ended at
3.12 per cent, having traded at 3.1 per cent (corresponding to the lowest
benchmark yield in over six years).
The market had expected the third-quarter GDP figures to show a decline
rather than a rise.
However, dealers said that the market paid more attention to the Tankan
report, which helped support speculation that the Bank of Japan may lower
interest rates in order to stimulate the economy.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds posted moderate losses amid a mixed reading
on commodity prices, but notes with shorter maturities were unchanged in
light activity.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at
100 5/16 with the yield climbing by about 3 basis points to 6.233 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32
, yielding 4.216 per cent.
After falling late on Friday despite a tame report on November consumer
prices, the inflation-sensitive long bond showed further weakness in the
face of a sharp rise in Comex gold prices and an early increase in the
closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index.
The 30-year issue remained anchored in negative territory throughout the
session, even though Nymex January crude oil futures - down 46 cents a
barrel - offered a more positive picture. The 21-commodity CRB index later
reversed direction to show a 0.76 decline to 224.43 late in the day, but the
long bond failed to bounce back.
Most traders were keeping to the sidelines, as the market looked ahead to
November retail sales data, which are due out today.
Forecasts centre on a 0.4 per cent increase, after a 1.5 per cent jump the
previous month.
