Italy yesterday launched the largest eurobond issue of the year in order to
complete its international borrowing programme for 1994. The issue takes the
amount the country has borrowed on foreign markets this year to Dollars
11.6bn, making it the world's second-largest borrower on international bond
markets.
The Y450bn (Dollars 4.58bn) issue is the largest offering of yen-denominated
bonds ever offered outside the Japanese government bond market.
It is the high point of a four-year campaign by the Italian treasury to
increase international investors' interest in the country's bond market  -
the world's largest outside the US and Japan.
The strategy has proved a success, with the proportion of Italy's debt held
by outside investors increasing from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent between 1990
and 1992, and reaching a peak of 14.5 per cent last February.
However, since May this year, international bond and equity investors have
been frightened away from the Italian market by uncertainties about the
future of the rightwing coalition led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Italian
treasury officials believe the proportion of foreign investment may have
dropped below 10 per cent.
However, Mr Vincenzo La Via, a director of foreign borrowing at the Italian
treasury, hailed the offering as a success. Bond traders said interest from
European investors was disappointing, but Mr La Via said there had been
strong demand from Japan.
The issue comes amid continued political sparring between government,
opposition and trade unions - and within the coalition itself - over the
1995 budget. Aimed at cutting Italy's large annual deficit, the budget was
at first welcomed as tougher than expected. But analysts now fear it may
have to be toned down to win parliamentary approval by the December 31
deadline.
Mr Berlusconi has used confidence motions this week to force sensitive
elements in the budget through the chamber of deputies.
Italy has turned to the Japanese yen market for all three of its main
foreign borrowing operations this year. In January it borrowed Y300bn, and
in June it borrowed Y175bn as part of a Dollars 4bn multi-currency
transaction.
The bond offering was split into three separate issues, of three, 10 and
20-year bonds, designed to appeal to Japanese and European investors.
