   THE MARKET for Japanese equity warrants
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
long-dated options to buy shares - bounced back in April, when 23 new issues
of equity warrant bonds were launched.
The recovery of the market is the latest in a series of resurrections over
the past year or so. But potential supply in the sector still outstrips
demand, so the market is being carefully monitored in an effort to ward off
another collapse.
At the end of last year, about 80 per cent of warrants were out of the money
 -that is, the exercise price of the warrant was lower than the share price,
so they were not worth converting. Now, according to Robert Fleming, 114
actively-traded dollar warrants are in the money and 282 are out, following
the recovery of the Japanese stock market.
Although new issue volume has picked up steadily, demand for paper is not
even close to the peaks of 1989.
Equity warrants follow underlying stock prices, but their movements are
exaggerated because they are highly-geared instruments.
Consequently, they are most useful - and most dangerous - in volatile
markets. The current trading range of the Japanese stock market between
26,000 and 27,000 has put a damper on the secondary market. 'In a flat
market, it is impossible for investors to make the 1 1/2 points bid/offer
spread to break even,' one analyst pointed out.
Japan's Golden Week holiday this week is further stifling activity.
Meanwhile, the pattern of the new issues market is changing. Seven of this
months' new issues were denominated in a currency other than dollars, the
usual sector for equity warrants.
There are signs that warrants in European currencies will form an
increasingly important portion of the market. D-Mark and Swiss franc issues
made up less than 9 per cent of the market at the end of 1990, but accounted
for more than 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter of 1991.
Historically, the D-Mark sector has been the domain of smaller, lesser-known
companies. Japanese investors have not bought such paper because these small
issues were rather illiquid, but larger companies have started to enter the
market, enticed by better swap opportunities and the chance to tap a fresh
investor base.
According to Robert Fleming research, the all-in yen cost of borrowing is
now marginally cheaper in D-Marks than in dollars, at 3.5 per cent versus
3.6 per cent for a four-year issue of 4 per cent bonds with warrants. There
have also been suggestions that large issuers have stayed away from the
dollar sector because of embarrassment that their existing warrants in the
sector were substantially out of the money.
The appearance of larger deals, such as a DM400m issue for Daiwa earlier
this month, has encouraged Japanese investors to become more active in the
D-Mark sector. However, they are still not buyers of Swiss franc equity
warrants, because that market, dominated by the domestic investor, is still
quite illiquid.
Meanwhile, marketmakers in dollar warrants based in London, which provides
much of the market's liquidity, are starting to make markets in D-Mark
warrants as well.
More importantly, it is expected that D-Mark warrants will soon be traded on
the broker-broker market in Japan, which would encourage greater
participation by Japanese investors. Issues of more than DM200m are expected
to be traded.
The growth of the Ecu bond market this year has increased the prospect of
Ecu-denominated warrants. But the relatively high cost of funds for
borrowers remains a barrier. The Ecu/yen swap market is less liquid than
either the D-Mark/yen market, as well as the dollar/yen market.
Further, the Swiss franc and D-Mark sectors were supported at the outset by
domestic buying, while there is no obvious investor base for Ecu warrants.
The lack of a domestic investor base may also slow development of a market
in French franc equity warrants. The first such deal, a FFr1bn offering for
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, was launched at the beginning of April, and
opened at a three-point premium to its par issue price.
Japanese securities houses are keen to nurture demand for their lucrative
equity warrant business. The Y50bn equivalent limit on the size of new
issues has been in force for a year and is likely to remain.
However, the market may face a further threat in the form of supply from
another source. The Japanese equity market, which has been closed to new
issues for a year, may reopen in June or July. The reopening of this market
'may take some of the money out of the equity warrant market,' said one
Japanese banker.
