RATE-CUT optimism and US congressional approval of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta) boosted European government bonds in the morning,
but prices eased back on afternoon profit-taking after the Bundesbank left
leading German interest rates unchanged.
While few had expected a cut in German key rates, many were slightly
disappointed by the Bundesbank's announcement of fixed-rate securities
repurchase agreements at 6.25 per cent for next week - 4 basis points below
this week's rate. The repo rate fell 9 basis points this week, fuelling talk
that the Bundesbank had adopted a more aggressive easing policy, and
yesterday's announcement damped hopes for further sharp repo rate easing in
the near term.
'They clearly wanted to signal that, while they will continue easing,
they're not stepping up the pace,' said a trader. Nevertheless, most traders
remain confident that the key discount and Lombard rates will be cut again
in December.
The December bund futures contract slipped off its day's high of 100.45 to
end at 100.22, down 0.04 point from Wednesday.
IN FRANCE there was some disappointment that the central bank left its 6.45
per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation, but hopes
for easing in the next few weeks and the German repo ease kept prices
underpinned.
Switching into intermediate maturities from the long end caused the yield
spread between 10-year bonds and the higher-yielding 30-year bonds to widen
to some 73 basis points, from 69 basis points on Wednesday. OATs
outperformed bunds, with the 10-year French yield gap over Germany narrowing
to 14 basis points from 16 on Wednesday and 23 last week.
UK GILTS shed most of their early gains and closed slightly lower in line
with European and US bonds, but sentiment remained bullish following
unemployment and earnings data which were seen to confirm the picture of
non-inflationary economic recovery.
The long gilt future closed at 115 13/16 , down  1/32 from Wednesday.
AMONG Europe's high-yielders, Spain continued to outperform Italy, with the
10-year yield gap between the higher-yielding BTPs and their Spanish
counterparts widening to 85 basis points, from 53 basis points at the start
of the week.
Spanish bonds have been boosted by hopes for a successful completion of the
social pact talks as well as speculation on near-term rate cuts, while
Italian bonds are beset by jitters ahead of Sunday's municipal elections and
worries over the budget outlook.
But according to Mr Andrew Roberts, bond analyst at UBS, investors should
consider switching out of Spain into Italy. 'The spread has widened out so
much there could well be a correction next week,' which could bring the
yield gap back to some 70 basis points, he predicted.
NAFTA'S passage through the US Congress and the political reform bill's
passage through a plenary session of the diet pushed Japanese bonds about
1/2 point higher. The JGB futures contract rose 0.53 point to 114.45.
US Treasury prices fell across the board yesterday in the wake of bearish
jobless claims data and a stronger-than-expected regional economic report
from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at
100 3/16 , yielding 6.226 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 17/32 , to yield 4.110 per cent.
Investors ignored Congressional approval of Nafta, and instead focused on
the latest data to point to accelerating economic growth. First, prices
ticked lower after the government announced that claims for state
unemployment insurance fell by 20,000 in the second week of November.
Both the short and long end of the market posted further losses later in the
day when the Philadelphia Fed said its index of local business activity
jumped from 15.4 in October to 22.4 in November. Trading was slow throughout
the day.
