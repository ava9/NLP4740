JAPAN'S big life insurance companies, hit by steep drops in Japanese share
prices and interest rates, posted sharp declines in their returns on
investment in the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
With the Tokyo stock market showing no signs of recovery and premium income
growth slowing, the life insurers would continue to pump much of their new
money into domestic loans to secure stable returns, according to industry
officials.
The eight leading life insurers announced their business results for 1991-92
yesterday .
Return on investment at the eight companies ranged from 4.75 per cent to
6.13 per cent, down more than one percentage point from a year earlier.
'The gaps between insurers are widening, and will continue to widen, based
on their skills as investors,' said an official at Meiji Mutual Life
Insurance.
Assets at the eight insurers rose to Y110,310bn (Dollars 875.47bn) in
1991-92, an average growth of 8.5 per cent and the slowest rate since the
Second World War.
Officials ascribed the slow tempo to lower sales of savings-oriented
insurance products and poorer returns on investment. The eight companies
account for more than 75 per cent of the assets held at Japan's 26 life
insurance companies.
With 'risky' securities holdings at high levels, the investment heavyweights
trimmed their foreign currency assets by an average 1.6 per cent in 1991-92
to Y17,110bn at end-March.
Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance and Meiji Life bucked the trend, increasing
foreign assets by 8.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. However,
Nippon Life Insurance slashed overseas assets by 8.6 per cent, Sumitomo Life
Insurance by 9.5 per cent, and Asahi Mutural Life Insurance by 1.2 per cent.
At the same time, the insurers were cautious about domestic equities because
of low returns and high volatility since the 225-share Nikkei average index
fell about 26 per cent in 1991-92.
Nippon Life cut its holdings of foreign securities to Y3,380bn in 1991-92
from Y3,500bn a year earlier. As a result, foreign securities as a share of
assets fell to 11.7 per cent at the end of March, from 13.1 per cent a year
earlier.
The sharp decline in Japanese share prices in 1991-92 forced the eight life
insurance companies to take a securities write-down of Y1,870bn, an increase
of 135.3 per cent from a year earlier.
Life insurers would remain net stock buyers in the current year since they
expected their assets to grow, but would remain cautious about equity
investments, according to the officials.
An official at Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, said his company
would continue to allocate new money mainly to domestic loans and domestic
bonds in the 1992-93 financial year.
Unrealised share profits at the eight insurers fell to Y8,430bn at end-March
from Y21,610bn a year earlier.
After the write-down of securities and plunges in unrealised profit in
shareholdings, the eight insurers will cut dividends to policy-holders in
1991-92.
'It is a sign that Japanese insurers will be forced to offer different
dividends to policy-holders in future,' said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst
at Nikko Research Centre.
