FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Playing the markets - This has been
a relatively strong summer for UK equities. Although the FT-SE-A All-Share
index is still about 8 per cent below February's peak. What are the
prospects for the UK and elsewhere over the rest of this year and 1995?

SIMON DAVIES, HEAD OF GLOBAL INVESTMENT, GARTMORE:
The key to most world markets is what is likely to happen to interest rates
over the long term. The first half of 1994 saw bond markets collapse
world-wide, pulling equity markets down with them.
In the UK, a dismal performance by the gilt market has prevented equities
from reacting positively to higher than expected dividends and better
earnings prospects. The gilt market must recover for equities to have any
real chance.
In fact, the outlook for long-term rates now looks positive. Inflation looks
likely to stay down for some time and may not cross the 3 per cent barrier
until the end of 1995.
At 8.5 per cent, gilt yields look attractive, given our view that base rates
will not have to rise for some time.
With a bond market recovery, equities should do well. Economic growth should
be 3.5 per cent this year and possibly next year as well. Profits should
meet or exceed expectations.
We are probably talking about returns of 10 to 12 per cent rather than an
explosion, but still an attractive return against deposits or viewed against
2 per cent inflation. The FT-SE 100 could reach 3,400 by the end of this
year and 3,600 by the end of 1995.
Overseas, the picture is complicated by the poor showing of sterling, which
has boosted the return of overseas assets to date but seems unlikely to be
repeated.
The only currencies against which the pound looks over-valued are those in
the dollar bloc. Investors could diversify with purchases of US dollar
bonds.
Pacific and other Emerging Market equities look good value again after their
setback and are also dollar linked.
Overall, bonds and equities look a good bet relative to cash.
MICHAEL HART, CHAIRMAN, FOREIGN &amp; COLONIAL MANAGEMENT:
We are taking a fairly optimistic view of stock markets for the end of 1994
and 1995. The key factor is that higher interest rates in the United States
have begun to slow down the economy, with the result that stock and bond
markets may now be taking too pessimistic a view of the outlook for
inflation.
We expect the UK base rate to be 5.75 per cent at the end of 1994 and 7 per
cent at the end of 1995, but this is well discounted in the market.
Ten-year bond yields should move lower by end-1994 and even lower by
end-1995. Bonds in the UK and France could be especially cheap.
As far as equities are concerned in the UK, Europe and Japan, profits could
be showing good increases. However, the US is four years into its recovery
and further advanced in the profit cycle, so the best of the increase in
profits may have been seen.
If all goes well, the FT-SE 100 index could be 3,500 by the year end and
3,850 by the end of 1995. Japan could be a particularly attractive market if
local investors are encouraged by further political reforms.
Probably the most exciting returns may be obtained in Latin America.
Brazil could be the star, with gains of up to 50 per cent if the new
president, to be elected in October, is able to introduce vital reforms.
Gains of around 25 per cent could be possible in Mexico.
South Korea looks the most promising of all the emerging Asian markets, with
a possible rise of 25 per cent.
KENNETH LEVY, HEAD OF FUND MANAGEMENT, CAPEL-CURE MYERS:
The fundamental backdrop for UK equities remains quite attractive, despite
the disappointing performance of the London market so far this year.
Inflation is displaying little tendency to accelerate and pay settlements
have barely budged, despite the sharp decline in unemployment over the past
18 months. More importantly for equities, the gilt market already appears to
be discounting a significant deterioration in the inflation environment.
Given all this, we expect the FT-SE 100 index to advance to about 3,400 by
the end of this year and perhaps to 3,700-3,750 by the end of 1995.
Elsewhere, the picture is more mixed.
We feel the outlook for Wall Street is relatively positive, with recent
corporate results indicating that double digit profits growth will be
achieved this year. But we are more cautious on the prospects for
continental Europe. Valuations remain stretched, even allowing for
substantial profit gains, and this is likely to exercise a restraining
influence on the performance of these markets.
Japan may also offer private investors only limited potential over the next
12 months. The economy is gradually emerging from recession but the recovery
is likely to be anaemic.
We believe that it is right for private investors to remain committed to
equity markets. Our preference is for the UK and US markets, and we would
retain a relatively modest exposure to cash and bonds.
DAVID ROSIER, CHAIRMAN, MERCURY ASSET MANAGEMENT:
We remain positive about the UK for three main reasons: the large degree of
under-utilised capacity, enabling the economy to grow above trend without
provoking inflationary pressures; the likelihood of a significant
improvement in public sector finances, so improving the technical position
of the gilt market; and a favourable valuation compared with other major
markets.
This year has seen a dramatic upswing in sentiment towards Japan, partly
fuelled by the underweight position in Japanese stocks of many international
portfolios. Anticipated shifts in the economic structure, combined with the
opening-up of the domestic Japanese market, will encourage inward
investment.
In the Pacific area and other emerging markets, the main risks are the
reversal of international portfolio flows and adverse developments in China.
But the profit potential now appears more significant than the downside
risks.
We remain underweight in the US mainly because the opportunity for
outperformance is stronger elsewhere. Our stance on continental Europe is
still neutral due to the likelihood of corporate earnings disappointing
expectations, uncertainties in the political arena, and the valuation of its
equity markets relative to other regions.
CLIVE BOOTHMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SCHRODERS UNIT TRUST LTD:
As far as the UK and Europe are concerned, a combination of relatively
pallid consumer demand, spare capacity and continuing low costs, especially
wage costs, points to the continuation of a slow growth, low inflation
recovery. Consequently, we believe both equity and bond markets represent
reasonable value at these levels and have good growth potential over the
medium term.
Our most-favoured market remains Japan and we believe that it also offers
low inflation growth. But both the depth of its recession and the scale of
its market falls suggest that it may well have greater recovery potential.
Inflation fears are most pronounced in the US which is hardly surprising -
it is now entering its fourth consecutive year of growth and so spare
capacity is inevitably becoming scarce.
However, the series of pre-emptive interest rate rises seem to be slowing
growth and we predict that US inflation will show only a modest rise to just
over 3 per cent.
Increasing evidence of low inflation is stabilising the bond and equity
markets already and should give them some scope to rise.
Stability in the US bond markets will be especially good news for the
emerging markets of the Pacific and Latin American regions and should begin
to allow their strong economic growth potential to be once more reflected in
rising stock markets.
DICK BARFIELD, CHIEF INVESTMENT MANAGER, STANDARD LIFE:
Economic growth in the UK is well under way; although consumers are not
racing back to the shops, we are spending a little more than last year.
Companies are benefiting from lower unit costs and increased productivity.
Earnings and dividend growth are, so far at least, justifying the confidence
shown by market ratings and I expect this to continue.
Inflation is still weak. I do not think the government will find enough
reasons to raise interest rates far from where they are now.
The Chancellor will not stifle a recovery that has yet to translate into a
'feel good' factor so I will assume a business-friendly Budget.
Despite the decline in markets since February, equities are still quite
highly valued against bonds. Although we expect bonds to stabilise in the
face of continuing good inflation figures, the tide has turned for bond
markets. This will undoubtedly restrain equities.
For similar reasons, the US and continental Europe will not produce
outstanding returns for equity investors. The Far East - and, in particular,
Japan as recovery there gains momentum - will move ahead quite well.
My verdict for the FT-SE is around 3,400 at the end of 1994 and above 3,600
by end-1995.
