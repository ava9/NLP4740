UCLA researchers believe they have isolated the gene that causes loss of vision 
in a strain of mice, a defect that serves as a model for retinitis pigmentosa, 
an inherited disease that has produced blindness in about 100,000 Americans and 
1.5 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Retinitis pigmentosa, commonly known as RP, is thought to be caused by a number 
of different genes. The gene isolated at UCLA, whose discovery is reported 
today in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is 
the third that has been discovered this year -- one in humans and two in mice 
-- and the fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe that isolation of the mouse genes will lead to 
discovery of their human counterparts within a few months. Identification of 
the human genes will make it possible to screen fetuses for the genetic defect 
in families with a history of RP. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a great step forward for us because it will allow us to begin 
thinking . . . about more rational pathways for treatment," said molecular 
geneticist John Nickerson of the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
Currently, there is no therapy for RP. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery will also help researchers understand how normal vision works. 
"Every time a new gene is found, we learn something more about the normal 
process (of vision)," said geneticist Jeanette Felix of the RP Foundation 
Fighting Blindness in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers cautioned that there may be other, as yet unidentified genes 
that also cause RP. And because there are a number of different genes involved 
in causing the disease, it will probably be necessary to develop multiple 
therapies for it, Felix said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists know that there are three major inheritance patterns for RP: 
X-linked, dominant and recessive. 
</P>
<P>
In the X-linked form, which accounts for about 10% of RP cases, the defective 
gene is found on the X chromosome, which occurs only in males. Such genes are 
the easiest to identify because they are already known to be on the X 
chromosome, and two different X-linked RP genes have been identified in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In the dominant form, which accounts for about 20% of RP cases, a child who 
receives the gene from either parent will develop the disease. In July, 
researchers from Ireland and Texas reported that they had identified the 
dominant gene that causes RP in a large Irish family. 
</P>
<P>
In the recessive form, which also accounts for about 20% of RP cases, a fetus 
will develop the disease only if it receives a defective gene from both 
parents. In March, Texas researchers reported that they had found a recessive 
RP gene in a strain of mice different from the mice used by the UCLA 
researchers. The UCLA researchers have now found a second recessive gene. 
</P>
<P>
In the remaining 50% of RP cases, only one member of a family has the disease , 
so researchers are not able to identify an inheritance pattern. The disease in 
these cases might be caused by one of the five known RP genes, or it might be 
caused by as-yet-unknown genes. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA team, led by geneticist Debora B. Farber of the Jules Stein Eye 
Institute, has been working with a strain of mice called rd, for retinal 
degeneration. In the rd mice, the photoreceptor cells in their eyes, which 
convert light waves into an electrical signal for transmission to the brain, 
begin to degenerate about nine days after birth. 
</P>
<P>
Within 15 days after birth, half the photoreceptors are gone and by the end of 
the first month, the mice are completely blind. Farber's group had previously 
identified the biochemical defect that causes this cell death, a defective 
enzyme that allows a chemical normally present in the photoreceptor cells to 
build up to toxic levels. 
</P>
<P>
Farber and her colleagues have now isolated from the photoreceptor cells of 
these mice a piece of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of 
life) that is different from its counterpart in healthy mice. They believe, but 
have not yet conclusively proved, that the DNA fragment is the gene that causes 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The group is currently trying to identify each of the 3,600 individual 
chemicals, called bases, of which the fragment is composed. When they have done 
that, they will know whether the fragment is the blueprint for the enzyme known 
to be defective in the rd mice, and thus whether it is the gene that causes the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are confident that it is the gene, however, they are already 
searching for a corresponding piece of DNA in human cells. Because of their 
similarity in function, the human gene should be closely related to the mouse 
gene, making its identification relatively easy. Farber said the group hopes to 
find it "within a few months." 
</P>
<P>
And once the human gene has been identified, a prenatal test for it can be 
developed within a matter of weeks.
