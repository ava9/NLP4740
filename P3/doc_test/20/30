  [Text] According to Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger 
(CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], speaking in Bonn on Tuesday, 
the federal government intends to increase the funding for 
genetic engineering research and to turn research results more 
rapidly into practice. 
  Krueger said there are already signs that important 
competitive positions of industrial companies could also change 
over the next few years due to the results of genetic 
engineering research. To ensure that Germany's advantages 
achieved in basic research are now turned into products and 
applications, Bonn intends to extend its funding. 
  As an important step in this direction, Krueger cited the 
new 
funding project, "Techniques for Deciphering and Using 
Biological Structures," which will put genome research on an 
efficient methodological basis. The Federal government intends 
to provide 100 million German marks for this research program 
over the next five years. The program, which takes an 
interdisciplinary approach, will intensify biomedical research 
and help to fight to date incurable diseases. 
  When presenting the new program, Krueger called for the 
public to pay more attention to the "important and sensitive 
area" of genetic engineering and genome research. It was 
definitely unfortunate for the Federal Republic that, for 
example, authorization procedures for the application of 
research results in this field took six to eight years, but only 
a few months in the U.S. This discrepancy should be removed. 
  For the Research Minister, genome research sets the basis 
for 
progress in bioengineering and medicine. In spite of all the 
ground yet to be made up, genome research has also developed in 
Germany over the past five years to become an innovative core 
area of modern biology. At the center lay questions of 
deciphering and using the biological structures present in 
molecular form as genetic information in cells. With the aid of 
genome research it would be possible to put medicine, industry 
(particularly the pharmaceutical industry) and agriculture on a 
"new scientific and technological basis." 
  The Research Minister made it clear that further development 
of genome research in Germany would be accompanied by legal 
framework conditions. One area requiring particular protection 
is that of data on the genetic structure of individuals. Legal 
regulations guaranteeing effective data protection and 
preventing any misuse are of prime importance. There would be 
no "see-through man," a concern often warned against in this 
respect. Appropriate government bills to amend the Code of 
Criminal Procedure or the skeleton law on employment protection 
have already been prepared. 
  Experts at the German Internists' Congress have spoken in 
favor of increasing the use of genetic engineering in medicine. 
The cancer specialist, Volker Diehl, from Cologne stated in 
Wiesbaden on Tuesday that numerous promising treatments 
involving genetic engineering methods were about to be tested in 
clinical tests. Genetic engineering therapy was often the last 
possibility for helping incurably ill patients. 
  Medicine had a "missionary zeal" to advance, said Diehl. 
However, science had made an error in not having made the goals 
of genetic engineering sufficiently clear to the public at 
large. The sole aim was to treat diseases with genetically 
improved substances or cells. Dr. Hermann Heimpel from Ulm said 
that genetic manipulations on human genetic material were 
prohibited throughout the world and were taboo amongst 
scientists, although it remained to be seen whether this 
consensus would still exist in 20 years' time.
