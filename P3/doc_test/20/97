In 1970, a terrible thing happened to the US maize crop. A virulent new
strain of fungus made its way into Florida and quickly raced northwest,
killing half the crop from Miami to Texas. The cost to farmers was estimated
at Dollars 1bn.
The blight, scientists say, came close to transforming the US from a food
exporting nation into a food importer. The incident taught scientists a
valuable, albeit expensive, lesson.
One reason the devastation was so great was that farmers were using one
basic variety of maize. Billions of rows of the crop were carbon copies of
each other. Another strain might have proved resistant and stopped the virus
in its trek across the country. But since farmers were working with such a
narrow genetic base, most of the maize had the same degree of susceptibility
to the disease.
Since then, both US and international scientists have taken the preservation
of different plant varieties more seriously. Organisations like the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, with an operating
budget of up to Dollars 300m a year, scour the planet in search of rare
plant strains which, crossed with more traditional varieties, would provide
resistance against various diseases.
The United Nations is heavily involved in collecting and preserving plant
varieties, as are many national governments. Indeed, gene banks, both public
and private, have sprung up around the globe from Malaysia to Alaska.
In times of crisis, these gene banks prove valuable. When a disease hits a
major crop, botanists search for a section of DNA which would provide
resistance to infection. Once the area is identified, scientists can
transfer genes between related plants by traditional cross-pollination
techniques. In the future, genetic engineering will be used.
The collection of rare plant species for crossing with traditional crops has
already begun to make a financial difference to the world's farmers.
According to the Rural Advancement Foundation, varieties created through the
introduction of rare plant genes produce Dollars 2.7bn in wheat sales each
year, and Dollars 677m in rice sales.
One Turkish wheat variety which proved immune to several North American
plagues is alone worth Dollars 50m a year to US farmers. Scientists say rare
plant species may also prove valuable in the search for more nutritious
foods.
'We collect berries from the tundras of Canada because they have extremely
high vitamin C content,' said Henry Shands, a senior botanist with the
Genetics Resources Group at the US Department of Agriculture. 'Someday we
may be able to use that.'
Over the last few years, the search for rare plants has gained a new
urgency. As civilisation encroaches on previously wild areas, from tropical
rain forests to the tundras of Siberia, scientists fear the rate of loss of
plant varieties has accelerated to 2 per cent a year.
'We have lost 75 per cent of the genetic diversity of the world's top 20
crops since the Second World War,' estimated Patrick Mooney, a botanist at
the Rural Advancement Foundation.
Some of the world's most genetically diverse areas are under threat from
dams, roads, logging and modern agriculture. Robert Rhoades, an
anthropologist at the University of Georgia, estimates that as many as
60,000 plant species - a quarter of the world's total - may be lost or
endangered within the next 50 years.
The advancement of biotechnology has added to the sense of urgency. 'In the
old days, we just concentrated on different strains of major crops,'
explained Shands. 'But now, scientists can make use of the genes of plants
which are from a different species to improve disease resistance.'
Scientists say the narrowness of the gene base of many major crops is
frightening. 'All the coffee in Latin America comes from one original tree,
brought from Africa,' said Mooney. 'The rubber crop in Malaysia began with
21 trees smuggled out of Brazil. This kind of narrow gene base makes plants
vulnerable to being wiped out by disease.'
Technology improvements of the 1960s made matters worse, as scientists
developed 'miracle' seeds by cross breeding plants to increase yield and
hardiness. The resulting crop was such a success that many farmers abandoned
other varieties, cutting down the world's genetic base even further.
As recently as 1959, rice farmers in Sri Lanka cultivated some 2,000
traditional varieties of rice. Today, they grow just five principal strains.
In India, which once harvested 30,000 varieties, more than 75 per cent of
total production is now accounted for by 10 strains.
Many scientists feel so strongly about the preservation of plant material
that their work has taken on a heroic aspect. Even in the 1920s and 1930s, a
handful of Soviet botanists realised that rare plant materials would some
day be valuable.
Nikolay Vavilov, the head of a team which collected stocks from the far
corners of the earth, was sent to prison after a dispute with one of
Stalin's favoured agronomists. His associates, during the 900-day siege of
Leningrad in the Second World War, starved to death rather than eat the
plants and seeds which they had been saving in the laboratories.
Today, researchers still have to brave dangerous conditions in their search
for rare plants. Scientists at the Potato Centre in the Andes mountains of
Peru have been attacked by guerrillas in the course of gathering rare potato
strains. 'There is the sense that we are doing something so important, the
danger is worth it,' said George White, who heads the gene bank for the US
Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland.
Not all the collection work involves trips to the tropics, though. Kent
Whealey directs an organisation in Iowa called the Seed Savers Exchange,
which depends on local resources for its seed bank. According to Whealey,
many farmers in the US grew traditional varieties their ancestors brought
with them many years ago. When the farming crisis gripped the country, many
were forced out of business.
The Seed Savers Exchange gave them a place to deposit the seed heirlooms,
rather than watch them die out with the family farm. Another source for the
exchange is seed companies which are closing down, or being bought out by
other, larger companies.
'There's been a lot of consolidation in the seed industry over the last few
years,' said Whealey. 'So we go through catalogues of companies that are
going out of business, to see if there might be something worth saving.'
The organisation says it holds some 10,000 seed varieties in storage. With
the preservation of the world's plant varieties gaining greater urgency,
many scientists complain that resources for their work are too limited.
'We were hoping the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro this year would
grant us more funds, but we didn't get much,' Mooney complained.
But Shands of the USDA puts things in another perspective. 'Sometimes we
don't really know what the materials might be used for,' he said. 'So it's
hard to argue that this should receive more priority than, say, feeding the
starving people of Somalia. I guess we should be happy with the funding we
get.'
