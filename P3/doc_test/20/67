  [Abstract] The use of viral DNAs as vectors for in 
vitro implantation of foreign genetic codes into animal 
cells and the large number of defects in hybrid in 
vitro SV virus genome as well as the physiological activity 
of bradykinine are discussed, and an attempt is made to obtain a 
replacement vector of the SV40 virus which does not require the 
presence of a helper virus. In so doing, the gene of one of the 
proteins in the VP-1 virus envelope was fused with a synthetic 
oligonucleotide which encodes bradykinine (brd), a short 
biologically active polypeptide. In addition, the biological 
activity of the resulting vector was examined on the kidney 
culture of African green vervet monkeys (CV-1), which are 
permissive to the SV40, using immunofluorescent T-antigen 
identification, a cytopathic activity study of the recombinant, 
by testing its infectious potential, and by determining the 
physiological activity of bradykinine by the contractile action 
of new-born rat cardiomyocytes. The findings demonstrate that 
substitution of the C-terminal region of the VP-1 gene with a 
bradykinine gene sequence does not upset the principal functions 
of the VP-1 protein; the constructed SV40 (brd) vector is stable 
and serves as the basis for forming biologically active viral 
particles. The potential for using similar replacement vectors 
as producers of short active polypeptides and for studying human 
gene expressions is noted. Figures 5; references 27: 12 Russian,
