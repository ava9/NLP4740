Michigan doctors have succeeded in using genetically altered cells to act as an 
internal Band-Aid, a technique that eventually might be used to prevent 
atherosclerotic lesions from worsening, it was reported here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the work so far has been done only in animals, and with genes that do 
not produce biologically active products, the research represents a leap toward 
gene therapy to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the president of the 
American Heart Assn. told science writers. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan work is generating much excitement among cardiovascular 
researchers because it "points out to them the potential for broadly moving 
their field and other fields forward," Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel, assistant professor of medicine at the University of 
Michigan, reported at the meeting that her research group had used a common 
cardiovascular technique -- balloon angioplasty -- to insert genetically 
engineered cells into the arteries of Yucatan mini-pigs. 
</P>
<P>
The group infected endothelial cells -- which line the interior of the blood 
vessels -- that had been taken from the pigs earlier with a retrovirus that had 
itself been altered with a bacterial gene. Because a retrovirus inserts its own 
genetic code into infected cells, the enzyme-producing bacterial gene became 
part of the pig cells' genetic machinery. 
</P>
<P>
The altered cells were inserted into the pig artery through a balloon catheter. 
There they established a healing layer of endothelial cells over the 
atherosclerotic lesion, which is an accumulation of fat-filled cells on the 
artery wall. The layer successfully produced the bacterial enzyme, showing that 
a foreign gene could work in this way, Nabel said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of problems that other proposed gene therapies have had in obtaining 
results, Nabel was cautiously optimistic. "We have established the feasibility 
of using endothelial cells as factories for artery repair," Nabel said. 
</P>
<P>
The endothelial cells eventually might be modified to secrete anti-clotting 
proteins to prevent blockage of the artery at atherosclerotic plaque sites. 
Noting that plaques themselves produce substances that promote their own 
growth, Nabel said the endothelial Band-Aid might also contain genes to block 
these growth promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Since endothelial cells are in organs throughout the body, she added, these 
designer cells might even be engineered to produce anti-cancer drugs at tumor 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she called such applications "pie in the sky," and said she did not 
expect the research to bear clinical fruit for perhaps 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for that is the extensive safety monitoring that would have 
to be done before such techniques could be used in humans, she said. 
Retroviruses would have to be shown unable to cause harmful infection before 
they could be used in humans. The inserted genes would also need to have only a 
localized effect, so they would not harm other body systems. 
</P>
<P>
Weisfeldt, however, said he thought that if the technique proves promising, it 
might be usable early on in people for whom there is no other hope of survival. 
For instance, heart transplant patients often develop life-threatening 
atherosclerosis a few years after transplant as a result of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Endothelial cells have become a prime target for genetic engineers because 
their location inside the blood vessel ensures that hormones or other 
biological agents they produce will be distributed throughout the body. They 
are also easier to work with than bone marrow cells, which had previously been 
the target of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Geneticists around the country are already experimenting in animals with 
altered endothelial cells that deliver CD4, a protein that blocks the AIDS 
virus; a clotting factor to prevent excessive bleeding in hemophilia; adenosine 
deaminate, which is missing in children with certain genetic disorders of the 
immune system; and von Willebrand's factor, which cures another genetic 
bleeding disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers speculate the technique could also be used to produce tissue 
plasminogen activator, which would prevent the formation of blood clots that 
cause strokes and heart attacks, and even insulin for diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Most researchers agree that several years will elapse before attempts are made 
at human therapy by genetic engineering. To date, genetically engineered cells 
have been introduced into only a handful of humans as part of an anti-cancer 
therapy devised at the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, researchers there used genetic engineering techniques to insert 
markers into white blood cells that are used in therapy of malignant melanoma, 
a particularly severe form of skin cancer, to help track the cells through the 
body. A total of 10 patients are to be treated, and so far no ill effects from 
the genetically engineered cells have been observed. 
</P>

REPAIRING INJURED ARTERIES 
</P>
<P>
In miniature pigs, scientists at the University of Michigan used this 
two-ballon technique to insert replacements for the injured cell layer that 
normally lines the arteries, but which is damaged in atherosclerosis. Because 
the inserted cells successfully produced an enzyme that they had been 
genetically altered to make, the researchers see the angioplasty technique -- 
already used to unblock arteries in humans -- as a potential way to both repair 
injured artery walls and make them produce lesion-inhibiting proteins that 
would reverse or prevent further atherosclerosis.
