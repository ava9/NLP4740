The last of the dinosaurs grazed on a primeval grass which has since evolved
over 65m years into thousands of different species, including the cereal
crops which together account for more than half the food eaten by mankind.
Today, the different cereals vary enormously in their overall genetic
characteristics. At one extreme is wheat, with a vast amount of genetic
material - six times more DNA than a human being - divided between 21 giant
chromosomes. At the other is rice, which has 12 tiny chromosomes and only
three per cent as much DNA as wheat. In between lie maize, sorghum and
millet.
Research over the past two years has shown, however, that the genes
themselves are remarkably similar in wheat, rice and all other cereals - and
they are arranged in exactly the same sequence in each species. In wheat
(and barley and rye) the genes are interspersed with long repetitive
stretches of 'junk DNA', whereas in rice there is little of this apparently
superfluous DNA which does not control the plant's growth and development.
This surprising discovery, by Mike Gale, Graham Moore and colleagues at
Britain's John Innes Centre in Norwich, working with the Japanese Rice
Genome Research Programme, has huge implications for cereal breeding. It
means that breeders, who have traditionally studied each species separately,
can pool information and quickly come up with a common genetic map that
applies to all grasses and cereals.
Once genes for important characteristics - for example those conferring
resistance to heat or cold, disease or drought - are identified in one
cereal, they can be inserted into another, using the rapidly developing
technology of genetic engineering.
Rice will become the main focus of genetic research in cereals, because its
genome is so much smaller and therefore easier to manipulate than the other
species. (Genome is a useful technical term, meaning all the genetic
material in a species, including the functioning genes, control regions that
switch them on and off, and all the junk DNA in between.) Rice can be used
as a general tool to isolate genes from any cereal crop.
'We will be using rice as a bridge for research on wheat,' says Dick
Flavell, director of the John Innes Centre. 'If I had stood up a few years
ago as head of a British research institute and said we needed to invest in
rice research, people would have thought I was bonkers. But we do need to.'
The latest developments are good news for Japan, which had already decided
to focus its agricultural genetics research on rice. The government-funded
Rice Genome Research Programme, is now half way through the task of
discovering the precise chemical sequence of the estimated 30,000 rice
genes. Fortunately for the rest of the world, the Japanese seem to be
publishing their results quickly and openly, rather than restricting access
or patenting them.
At the same time, plant scientists worldwide are making rapid progress in
developing the genetic engineering technology that will be required to make
practical use of the newly discovered genes.
The 1980s was a frustrating decade because the technique used to transfer
genes to other plants - infecting them with bacteria which carried in the
new DNA - did not work in cereals. But it has turned out during the 1990s
that a brutally direct way of inserting genes - coating thousands of
microscopic gold balls with DNA and firing them into plant cells - is highly
effective.
And earlier this year Zeneca, the British bioscience and seeds company,
announced success with an extraordinarily simple method: the researcher
shakes a test-tube full of water, plant cells, DNA and tiny crystals of a
common chemical called silicon carbide. The crystals (known as whiskers)
punch holes in the cells through which foreign DNA can enter.
The first field trials of genetically engineered wheat, maize and other
cereals are getting under way. Easily traced 'marker genes' have been added
to these plants; they do not confer commercially valuable characteristics
but are used for scientific analysis. In Cambridgeshire, for example, Ciba
Seeds is growing two types of wheat this summer: one has a red pigment gene
taken from wild Peruvian maize and the other produces a bacterial enzyme
that can be detected in simple tests.
In the laboratory, meanwhile, researchers are beginning experiments to
transfer genes that would be industrially useful. The Institute of Arable
Crops Research in the UK has a project, for instance, to give wheat more
genes for gluten proteins, to enhance its bread-making properties.
Another early target might be the genes that control the movement of nitrate
across cell membranes. Their enhancement could help wheat to use nutrients
more efficiently. If so, farmers could cut the amount of nitrate fertilisers
spread on their fields.
In the longer run, there is potentially huge scope for genetic engineering
of all cereals to make them more resistant to attack by pests and diseases
and to withstand adverse weather. But as Paul Lazzeri of the IACR's
Rothamsted Experimental Station points out: 'In parallel with the research,
we have to resolve the question of the public acceptance of genetic
engineering of food.'
Scientists believe that the world will have to accept genetically engineered
cereals. On current projections, twice as much wheat and rice will have to
be produced during the next 50 years as in the past 10,000. Although
improved agronomy can make a contribution, the only real hope for feeding
the growing human population without catastrophic environmental damage lies
in applying cereal genetics.
