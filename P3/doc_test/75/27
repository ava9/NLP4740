The London Symphony Orchestra starts the current concert season in
commemorative mood, recalling two colossi of 20th-century music. A week ago
it was Leonard Bernstein (who died three years ago); last Sunday it was
Olivier Messiaen (who died last year). On both occasions the mixture of
memorial and celebration has been expertly judged.
Sunday's LSO Messiaen concert launched a series of four at the Barbican Hall
 -two by the LSO, two by the London Sinfonietta, the last timed to fall on
what would have been the composer's 85 birthday (Dec 10). During its course
the orchestra will give the eagerly-awaited London first performance (a year
after the New York premiere) of Eclairs sur l'au-dela, the last big Messiaen
composition.
But in the first of the series the approach was both introductory and
panoramic: in four works covering more than 50 years of creation -
L'Ascension (1933), Poemes pour Mi (1937), Chronochromie (1960) and La Ville
d'en haut (1987) - the evolutions in language and style of a composer who
came to dominate French music in the second half of the century were fully
and rewardingly adumbrated.
The idiom may have altered, sharpened, enriched its amalgam over time -
birdsong, Messiaen's most remarkable and most personal appropriation for
music, entered his artistic universe only in the 1950s. Yet the vision
behind the idiom remained utterly consistent. For Messiaen music was always
a means of glorifying God: this is the chain that securely joins up the
complete span of his compositions.
Sunday's LSO conductor was Pierre Boulez, in most respects a Messiaen
conductor non-pareil. The accuracy, brilliance, clean cut and balanced
outlook of his readings hardly need describing at this date. Not for the
first time, however, it struck me that the determinedly 'non-mystical' side
of Boulez's character sometimes prevents him from penetrating that very
region in Messiaen.
In L'Ascension, for instance, the numinous atmosphere that should accrue
from the ritualistic passage of four richly-textured movements was undercut
by the conductor's matter-of-fact-ness; and in Chronochromie, the most
ruggedly complex of Messiaen compositions, though Boulez always sorts out
the barrage of detail with enviable lucidity, the spiritual purpose behind
the detail remained unclear.
Yet when so much of Messiaen's thinking is characterised with so much
mastery, by conductor and orchestra alike, it is hard to remain long in this
critical mode. And to the performance of the rapturously romantic Poemes by
the French soprano Francoise Pollet, ample, beautiful and serenely dignified
in every bar, surrender was the only possible response.
Earlier on Sunday the Barbican had offered the first of its 'Celebrity
Recitals': Stephen Kovacevich played Beethoven and Schubert (two more later
this month). In spite of an early technical hiccup with the Steinway, the
pianist produced the sort of playing that now places him among the world's
small number of reigning Classical masters. Kovacevich seems boldly
unconcerned with tonal allure; his Beethoven Op 31 sonatas were often gruff,
but never lacking in spirit. His Schubert - the late A major - combined
simple lyricism and long-term dramatic intensity in a way to bring to mind
the late Rudolf Serkin. No praise could be higher.
