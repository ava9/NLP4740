David Atherton wrapped up his Westgate Mainly Mozart Festival in style Sunday 
night. A strong all-Mozart program, lively performances from the players, and a 
full house in Davies Festival Theatre provided ample reasons for the British 
maestro's air of self-assurance and confidence on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
In this farewell program, two of the festival orchestra members favored the 
audience with solo turns. Concertmaster William Preucil's performance as 
soloist in Mozart's "Turkish" Violin Concerto was conventional and rather 
small-scaled, although it was still polished and brimming with conviction. His 
sweet, agile sound flourished in the intimate middle movement, where he ably 
captured the composer's transcendental introspection. 
</P>
<P>
Although flutist Jean Larson's solo was limited to the single movement "Andante 
for Flute and Orchestra," K. 315, she made the most of her opportunity. Her 
playing Sunday confirmed the favorable impression she made in a festival 
chamber concert last week: the silver-toned Texas flutist can spin out a 
sinuous melody with grace, charm, and apparent nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to demonstrate Mozart's development as a symphonist, Atherton commenced 
his program with the composer's First Symphony, K. 16 (written when he was 8 
years old), and concluded with his penultimate Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, K. 
550. Even though this First Symphony is little more than a curiosity, the 
conductor took pains to make the most of it, demanding precise articulations 
and assiduous adherence to its naive, rococo contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
If only Atherton had delved as deeply and patiently into the great G Minor 
Symphony. He took an aggressive stance, demanding a Beethoven-like grandeur 
rather than cultivating the undercurrent of turbulence that propels this 
complex, late Mozart work. He was satisfied with high energy and tight 
discipline, but there was little poetry beneath all of that brio. And, although 
this approach may have generated a few more decibels for the unsympathetic 
acoustics of the open-air theater, it brought out an unflattering, hard-edged 
timbre in the strings. 
</P>
<P>
This reviewer's evaluation of the festival's inaugural season remains 
equivocal. While it was well-organized and well-attended, its musical 
achievements were embarrassingly modest. If the level of performance never sank 
below professional respectability, it rarely soared or strayed from the norms 
of traditional Mozart interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Chamber Music Society's annual SummerFest, to cite the record of 
another well-run festival, has provided the crucible for some spine-tingling 
performances and daring interpretations of major works of the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of repertory, Atherton's choices cry out for improvement, especially 
if the festival is to continue next year. The festival's title may have been 
"Mainly Mozart," but the rest of the repertory was surprisingly miscellaneous. 
Although Atherton's programming did not stray beyond the Classical period -- 
creative choices might have juxtaposed neo-Classical 20th-Century works -- not 
a single major work by Beethoven or Haydn complemented the Mozart repertory.
