Having revived prime-time animation with "The Simpsons," Fox seems well on the 
way to sparking a similar renaissance on Saturday morning. Three of the 
network's first children's cartoon shows are imaginative, original and 
entertaining: For the first time in years -- if not decades -- watching 
Saturday morning television is fun for adults as well as children. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has allowed a creative group of writers, artists and directors to exercise 
their talents freely, and the results sparkle with imagination, a quality their 
network counterparts sorely lack. 
</P>

Created by children's author-illustrator Shane DeRolf, the delightful "Zazoo U" 
focuses on the often surreal goings-on at a bizarre school. Two rap-speaking 
birds walk on and change the backgrounds whenever the scene shifts. The casual 
insanity of "Zazoo U" is utterly unlike anything that's ever been on Saturday 
morning. 
</P>

In keeping with the trend toward younger characters on children's shows, "Tom 
&amp; Jerry Kids" stars junior versions of the cat-and-mouse team that won Bill 
Hanna and Joe Barbera seven Oscars. Like the original shorts, the new cartoons 
use no dialogue, only sight gags -- a welcome respite from the talky formulas 
of so much kidvid. 
</P>

"Droopy and Dribble" brings back Tex Avery's phlegmatic basset hound, with a 
slightly smaller son. The wild takes and exaggerrated expressions may not be as 
perfectly timed and animated as they were in Avery's theatrical shorts, but 
this frenetic show is truer to the spirit of those classic '40s cartoon than 
the flamboyantly stale "Tiny Toon Adventures."

Comedian Howie Mandel provides the voice for a suburban father and his 
4-year-old son in "Bobby's World." Much of the action takes place in the world 
of Bobby's overly fertile imagination: When Dad announces the family's going to 
visit Aunt Ruth, Bobby pictures himself commiserating with distorted victims 
who've had their cheeks pinched out of shape by the terrible Aunt Ruth Monster. 
Both funny and charming, "Bobby's World" deserves a prime-time spot.

In contrast, the new shows on ABC, CBS and NBC suggest that a truckload of 
threadbare teen-age sitcoms crashed on the way to the dump, flooding the screen 
with stale ideas. Viewers can tell these weary retreads are supposed to be hip: 
The characters use dude at least once in every sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"New Kids on the Block" (ABC), combines a badly animated version of the popular 
bubble-gum rock band with cuts from concert footage. Apparently the biggest 
problem the Kids face is how to escape the hordes of female admirers, and this 
fanzine mentality makes the show even less interesting than the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
Down the block, as it were, are "The Guys Next Door" (NBC), a live-action 
attempt to re-do "The Monkees" in the '90s. The producers apparently spent more 
on hair mousse than writers, and the show demonstrates its ecological awareness 
by recycling used gags. If these guys live nearby, the neighborhood must be 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
The live action/animation "Kid 'n' Play" (NBC) features lame stories about a 
teen-age rap group and stiff animation. Black characters are rare on Saturday 
morning TV, and it's regrettable this show doesn't have more going for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick Moranis in Gravedale High" (NBC) features an uninteresting caricature of 
the movie star riding herd on a standard assortment of teen-age monsters. "Bill 
&amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" (CBS) repeats the inanities of the recent film 
about two dimwitted but cool dudes traveling through time. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the pseudocomic slate is "Little Rosie" (ABC), featuring a cartoon 
version of Roseanne Barr as a child. Unlike her brash adult alter-ego, the 
young Roseanne is just an ordinary kidvid character. The stories that send her 
on imaginary adventures use material similar to "Bobby's World," but the 
difference is the one letter that distinguishes class from crass. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz" (ABC) must rank as the nastiest trick that's been played on 
the inhabitants of L. Frank Baum's enchanted land since the villainous Mombie 
cast a spell on Princess Ozma. The producers foolishly based the program on the 
classic 1939 film: Everybody knows how Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, 
Margaret Hamilton et al. are supposed to look and move and sound, and the 
cartoon versions don't even come close. Watching this show is a bit like 
watching a cassette of the MGM musical that got caught in the trashmasher. "Oz" 
fans should consider dropping a house on ABC headquarters.
