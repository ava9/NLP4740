Perhaps it is just coincidence that the simple title of "The Duane Michals 
Show" seems more fitting to a comedy hour than a 30-year museum retrospective 
of a New York photographer. But images of, say, Howdy Doody, persist when a 
visitor is faced with a blow-up self-portrait of Michals using head and hands 
to make a shadow image of a duck on the wall behind him at the entrance to his 
show at the Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Guileless and often goofy, Michals seems contented to leave a first impression 
of himself as an entertainer in this first American survey of his work. But as 
the more than 200 black-and-white photographs quickly show, Michals is much 
more. A mix of portraits and multi-image narratives with short written texts, 
this wonderful show combines humor with nostalgia, religious commentary, astute 
social observation and personal fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
A bluntness and modesty pervade this work, a simplicity that leaves each viewer 
to go further beyond the surface. To project and extrapolate. To be swept up in 
the nostalgia, without being trapped in sweetness. To keep an eye on the 
gimmick inherent in the medium, while still appreciating its enormous power. 
</P>
<P>
An early work sets the tone of surrealist quasi-religious symbolism and 
photographic manipulation that remains consistent throughout: "The Illuminated 
Man," 1968, shows a shadowy man whose head has been transformed into a 
featureless, glowing flash of light. "I Met God in the Subway," 1990 -- the 
latest here -- takes the same theme further: A man is shown riding the New York 
subway, his head lit from behind to look like a halo. Just below, the artist 
has written: "I met God in the subway/He looked like you and me/I asked which 
train went to Heaven/He said take number three./When I got off in Heaven/It 
looked like Union Square/Seems when you go to Heaven/You don't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Constantly questioning reality in art and in life, in both of these works 
Michals plays the mysterious powers of manipulation available to the 
photographer against the mysticism of religion. Calling himself a "lapsed 
Catholic," Michals has spoken often of his devoutly religious childhood. A 
sense of paradise lost governs much of his work, imbued with a nostalgia for 
the transcendent visions that can come through faith. There is a slightly 
mocking tone to such quasi-religious work, but it is dryly mixed with the 
possibility of optimism. That Heaven and Earth are equal, that death does not 
transcend life. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1932 in blue-collar McKeesport, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb that was also 
the birthplace of Andy Warhol, Michals has made many works that appear directly 
autobiographical. His unresolved relationship with his father is often a 
subject. Among these, one of the most subtle, yet most poignant, is the 1978 
"Self Portrait Shaking Hands With My Father." 
</P>
<P>
In a barren room, the two men shake hands at the extreme right side of the 
photo and the contrast between them is striking. The older man, slightly bent 
from age, wears a somewhat rumpled suit, a mark of formality that hides the 
fact that he is a retired factory worker. The younger Michals wears a dark 
turtleneck, casually formal as would befit an artist. In their handshake is the 
symbol of resolution, across what appears to be significant distance. An open 
door at the left of the picture appears as an escape route from these powerful 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Death comes up often in Michals' work, too, with a sense of both sorrow and 
curiosity yet never morbidity. "Hamlet's" Yorick, for example, is remembered in 
a memento mori picture of a young man holding a skull. Scrawled below in the 
artist's rough hand is a short poem "All Things Mellow in the Mind . . . ." 
about the brevity of life. "So let's hold tight, and touch and feel," Michals 
wrote. "For this quick instant we are real." 
</P>
<P>
There are lighter moments, too, belying Michals' Pop background and his links 
to a post-modern real-life metaphysic similar to that found in the work of such 
artists as John Baldessari and Edward Ruscha, among others. A group of 
exquisite celebrity portraits -- many of them commercial work done for 
magazines -- starts the show. Some are of well-known artists, like a rare pair 
of portraits of Joseph Cornell, as well as images of Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and 
Rene Magritte. Others are of movie and arts stars: Dennis Hopper lounging on 
the floor in a smoke-filled room, Joe Dallesandro as a gargoyle on a New York 
rooftop and a beautiful but apparently narcissistic Russian ballerina, Ludmila 
Tscherina, shown just in the circular frame of a hand-held mirror in a 
photograph from 1964. 
</P>
<P>
And the narrative can be both sweet and borderline cute, like children's book 
illustrations. One well-known work shows a child who looks up at a coat and hat 
hanging on a rack, then falls asleep and dreams the bogey man has come to life. 
</P>
<P>
A series of forays into painting show the artist painting on top of vintage 
photographs, obliterating the precious images of photographic masters with 
colorful, childlike imagery. Here, Michals exhibits a bad-boy daring 
reminiscent of Robert Rauchenberg's erasure of a Willem DeKooning drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Michals' 1989 work, too, takes a tongue-in-cheek jab at the pretentions of 
photography. "There Are Nine Mistakes in This Photograph" shows a man reading 
an upside down newspaper with an upside down top hat on his head, sitting 
across a breakfast table from a blindfolded girl eating cake, among other 
foolishness. "Can you find them?" the picture teases. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, all of Michals' art seems immediately accessible. A renegade 
from the seriousness of both fine art photography and photojournalism, Michals 
makes it all seem easy. But, again, there is more than meets the eye. Lighting 
and darkroom techniques often add enormous subtlety to the beauty of the 
prints.
