Mumbles, Big Boy Caprice, 88 Keyes, Little Boy Beard, Flyface, Flattop, the 
Brow -- some of the most dastardly enemies that Dick Tracy ever faced. Enough 
to scare any self-respecting crime-stopper out of his two-way wrist radio. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't faze Paul Maher. He has 'em all in hand, even the sinister 
Rhodent and the slippery Spots, in the form of an antique Dick Tracy board 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is based on the old Dick Tracy cartoon show" (from 1961), said 
Maher, 37, cradling the item gently. "That's how I remember Dick Tracy the 
best. Other people might remember him from the radio show, or the serials, or 
some of those low-budget 1940s movies. By the way, this game goes for $150." 
</P>
<P>
Lest that price sound like a crime in itself, it helps to remember that finding 
the Dick Tracy board game -- and the plethora of other Tracy-ana in Maher's 
custody -- required a good deal of sleuthing. For as soon as collector 
extraordinaire Maher heard that Warren Beatty was bringing the hawk-nosed 
detective to cinematic life, he began haunting swap meets and collectors' shows 
in search of every bit of memorabilia he could glom onto -- of Tracy, Sam 
Catchem, Tess Trueheart, Sparkle Plenty, B.O. Plenty and the rest of the 
denizens of the legendary comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Enough, ultimately, for the former archivist for Hanna-Barbera studios and 
Walter Lantz (creator of Woody Woodpecker), to devote an entire corner of his 
archives to cartoonist Chester Gould's funny-page police detective. 
</P>
<P>
His archives? Indeed. Not just a collector of Dick Tracy items, Maher is also 
the founder, owner, caretaker, cataloguer and protector of what he calls the 
Children's Television Archives -- a three-story North Hollywood townhouse 
crammed floor-to-ceiling with memorabilia of characters such as Tracy, Bugs 
Bunny, Felix the Cat, Caspar the Ghost, Bozo the Clown -- and just about every 
inked creature that ever lived in a comic strip or cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars are the ones that hurt the most, as far as prices go," said Maher, 
carefully hoisting an enormous tin squad car housing Tracy and Sam Catchem, 
dating from about 1950. "If this was in absolutely mint condition and had the 
windshield and the siren on the side, it's worth -- honest-to-God -- about 
$1,000, without the box! I've had other people tell me that they've seen them 
with the windshield, but without the Dick Tracy inside. So maybe someday I can 
fix the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, anyone looking to build a Tracy collection at this point is pretty much 
out of luck. Maher's hard-won collection -- including toys, games, photos, 
articles and books -- numbers no more than 50 items. Yet it's worth, he 
estimates, somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If I went to a collectors' show right now, most likely I wouldn't find any 
more Dick Tracy," Maher said. "I mean, I can call all the collectors' stores 
all over, and they'll tell me we'd like to, but we already have four people in 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Why the paucity of Tracy collectibles? Reason No. 1: Tracy has not existed 
outside a comic strip since the 1961 cartoon show, and as a result, 
merchandising of Tracy-related items has been minimal. Reason No. 2: Larry 
Doucet. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more than 2,000 items in my collection, and I've been collecting for 
more than 30 years," said Doucet, a 43-year-old Yorktown Heights, N.Y., 
consulting engineer regarded as the king of the Dick Tracy collectors. "When I 
first read Dick Tracy when I was a 10-year-old, I was immediately hooked on the 
character. It was instantaneous. The stories, the great villains grabbed me. I 
started a quest for every comic book I could find. When I ran out of all the 
comic books, I knew there had to be more. So I started buying everything else I 
could find -- board games, cars, whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Doucet has the tin car -- with the windshield -- and it has indeed been 
appraised at about $1,000. The author of the forthcoming "Authorized Guide to 
Dick Tracy Collectibles" (Chilton, $12.95, with a foreword by Jean Gould 
O'Connell, Chester Gould's daughter) also counts among his many prized pieces 
things such as a Tracy cap pistol engraved by Chester Gould in 1978, some of 
the first Tracy character dolls and a Miller Bros. Hat Co. felt fedora, circa 
1947, with a Tracy logo inside. The value? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, people are pretty much speculating and hoarding this stuff and asking a 
lot more than it's worth," said Doucet, reached by phone. "Especially because 
of the movie. Some of these items, like dolls, are worth several thousand 
dollars. I have, for example, one of three known copies of a Dick Tracy comic 
book called No-Numbered Feature Book of 1937, and that's worth over $3,000. But 
it really comes down to what people are willing to pay." 
</P>
<P>
What of the slew of new, Disney-authorized Tracy merchandise? Well, without the 
pre-movie groundswell of interest, as there was months in advance of "Batman," 
Tracy-related sales have been slow -- or so says Bill Liebowitz, owner of the 
Golden Apple comic book stores in Hollywood, Northridge and West L.A. The sales 
"reps felt that people needed to see more publicity on the movie," he said, "so 
they didn't take orders for merchandise until April." Liebowitz does not 
predict a repeat of Batmania. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think 'Dick Tracy' will be a good solid merchandising, but I don't see 
anything hysterical," he said. "I don't see people coming in and demanding 
Madonna blowup dolls. I could probably sell a lot of those but . . . I mean, 
Disney is just doing an exceptional job. If it can be marketed, they're going 
to do it. It's probably safe to say that everyone in America will know about 
Dick Tracy. The question is whether they will have a shirt with a tommy gun on 
their chest, or if they will just go to the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Maher, whose archival material is regularly loaned out for use in television 
and movies, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman proved to manufacturers that Dick Tracy can work," said the collector, 
wearing an oversize Tracy T-shirt. "There's even a car that might be this 
year's equivalent to the Batmobile. Even if the reviews are bad, it's 
automatic. And this Tracy is a mysterious guy, in a sense a modern-day 
vigilante out to stop all the nonsense in town. He's more of a person than 
Superman or Batman. He reminds me almost of a Peter Falk-like character, only 
with class. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see a lot happening with this. There's going to be a whole line of Dick 
Tracy cars, and I'll bet you there's going to be a Dick Tracy trench coat, hat, 
watch, two-way wrist-radio. The merchandising that you see right now is just 
the beginning of it." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the be-all and end-all of bachelor Maher's existence, really -- the 
stuff that keeps people such as him and Doucet in the business of collecting. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting," he said, "all relates to a part of a person that we all wish we'd 
kept, and kept alive. That's the one thing Peter Pan had, in a sense. He was 
able to know how to keep that going and not lose it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 13 years old, I felt stupid with all my collection of Beany and 
Cecil stuff and Shari Lewis hand puppets. So I took it all to a swap meet and 
sold it for 50 bucks and got a transistor radio, felt really cool for a while 
with that transistor radio. Now I hate myself for having done that." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that he's compensated for the error in judgment. A few of his most 
prized Tracy items: 
</P>
<P>
* The Dick Tracy Siren Pistol -- "There were a number of different guns," Maher 
said. "I've seen others, but never this one." The heavy tin revolver, which 
sounds like a ray-gun from a Daffy Duck cartoon and probably dates to the late 
'40s, goes for "maybe a thousand -- maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
* Dick Tracy (squirting) Machine Gun -- in a box proclaiming, "Shoots over 500 
shots in one fill!" with Dick's cartooned head saying "Okay, boys, let's get 
goin' and stop or I'll shoot!" "There have been thousands of these made in the 
early '50s," said Maher, "but it has to survive, to get to this point in 1990. 
It has to make it through all those years! That's the fun of getting something 
in mint condition. The box is in mint condition, and the product itself has 
never been squirted! Found it at a collector's show, and to me, it's like a 
crown jewel. You put this in a case." 
</P>
<P>
* Junior and Dick Tracy salt-and-pepper shakers from the mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
* A Big Little Book entitled "Dick Tracy Encounters Facey." 
</P>
<P>
* A Dick Tracy Two-Way Wrist Radio from the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
* A Dick Tracy Golden Book. "This simple little Golden Book -- 60 bucks," said 
Maher proudly. "You won't find it at any shows." 
</P>
<P>
Maher, who has played host at tributes to everyone from the late 
animator/puppeteer Bob Clampett to Vance Colvig (L.A.'s Bozo the Clown in the 
early '60s), the late Jay Ward, and Jimmy Weldon (father of Webster Webfoot), 
speaks of his Tracy-ana and the rest of his archives in the expert tones of an 
art appraiser -- handling the toys and irreplaceable memorabilia with downright 
reverence. They are, after all, his business as well as his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
But it goes beyond business. There is love in his voice as he shows his 
original animation cels of Bugs Bunny (autographed by Fritz Freleng), his 
Movieola projector owned by Walt Disney in the 1920s, his thousands of dolls, 
toys, mugs, hand puppets of every character from Crusader Rabbit to Lambchop, 
his taped interviews with legendary Southern California kiddie-show hosts 
Sheriff John, Engineer Bill, Walker Edmiston and Tom Hatten, his Oscar Meyer 
Wiener Wagon model autographed by "Little Oscar" himself, Jerry Marrin. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at TV for a second and say, 'God, I haven't seen that since I 
was a kid!' what does that do to you?" said Maher, who so loves television that 
he has one in just about every room -- including a small set mounted on the 
bathroom wall for shower-viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"Your memory is important," he continued. "As a kid you look at that record 
jacket of something like 'Bozo on the Farm,' and it's important! You look at it 
maybe a hundred or a thousand times. Now, after all these years that it's been 
erased from your memory, you suddenly see it here, and it's 'Wow, I had that!' 
</P>
<P>
"And when people come into this room, there's such a mixture of different 
times! I'll have people as old as my grandpa see a Dick Tracy car and say 'Oh 
my God, I had one of those!', and I've had kids come in here and go right to 
the Ninja Turtle dolls and go 'Ohhhhh. I haven't seen those.' And the Dick 
Tracy car doesn't mean anything to them." 
</P>
<P>
A Dick Tracy car having no meaning to a child? Those days, it's safe to say, 
are over.
