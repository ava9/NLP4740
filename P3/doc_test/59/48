  [Text] A large shipment of the synthetic drug known as 
"crystal," worth nearly $1 million on the drug black market in 
the United States, was seized by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
personnel assigned to Baja California State [BCS]. The PGR's 
[Attorney General's Office] branch agency in the state reported 
that, during the operation, three presumed drug traffickers were 
captured with the drug while attempting to reach the city of San 
Jose, in the state of California. 
  Information provided by the Federal Judicial Police General 
Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, reveals 
that members of the force succeeded in arresting three subjects 
identified as Xavier Madriz Hernandez and the sisters Maria and 
Veronica Rios Chacon. They were leaving the ferry Azteca, 
arriving from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa, at the Pichilingue 
marine terminal in La Paz. 
  Personnel under orders from the PJF deputy commissioner in 
the state, Manuel Ramirez Cardoso, began a routine inspection of 
the vehicle being driven by those now indicted: a 1987 Mazda 
pickup truck with Washington, D.C., plates No. 8574J1. Upon 
opening the vehicle's hood, they discovered a special 
compartment, especially designed to carry drugs and narcotics, 
in its lower part, directly below the windshield wiper area. 
  Inside the compartment the PJF agents found 13 packages of 
various sizes containing the narcotic, with a gross weight of 13 
kg and 700 grams. It was identified as "crystal," a drug known 
as one of the laboratory type, and highly toxic. 
  According to the statements made to the public prosecutor by 
the accused, entered in preliminary investigation 99/02/94, the 
presumed drug traffickers purchased the narcotic in the town of 
Tacapaltepec, Michoacan. They later moved it to the port of 
Mazatlan, where they boarded the ferry taking them to La Paz, 
Baja California Sur. They told the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office that they intended to travel by land from that area to 
the border at Tijuana, subsequently entering the town of San 
Jose, California. 
  In this connection, the PGR's representative in the state, 
Irma Garcia de Cuevas, stressed that "crystal," owing to its 
chemical composition per se, is a drug creating physical and 
psychological addiction from the first time that it is consumed. 
It also causes lack of appetite, hallucinations, and toxic 
psychosis. She concluded by noting that, had it reached its 
destination, it would have commanded a price of nearly $1 
million. Meanwhile, those now indicted will be placed at the 
disposal of the pertinent district judge of criminal 
proceedings. They will be tried based on their presumed guilt of 
committing crimes against health in the form of drug 
transportation and possession.
