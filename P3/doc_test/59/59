A ranking Mexican police official "got loaded" on cocaine while he attended 
parties at the home of a Guadalajara narcotics cartel leader, a prosecution 
witness testified Friday during the federal trial of four men accused of 
murdering U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The government witness, Hector Cervantes Santos, said that Federico Castel del 
Oro, a first commander with Mexico's federal security directorate, used cocaine 
at the Guadalajara home of Javier Barba Hernandez, an attorney who was a leader 
of the drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, 30, who served as security chief at Barba's sprawling "La Quinta" 
estate from 1982 to 1985, made the statement during his third day on the 
witness stand under cross-examination by four defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony appeared to heap more embarrassment on Mexican police officials, 
who have seen some of their top ranks identified during the trial as 
cooperating with drug traffickers. Four law enforcement officials are among the 
19 defendants who have been indicted for involvement in Camarena's February, 
1985, murder in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Castel del Oro has not been charged in the Camarena murder. He left his post 
several years ago, according to U.S. government sources, and his current 
position is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
During cross examination, Cervantes said Friday that cartel members and friends 
attending parties and meetings at Barba's home frequently used so much cocaine 
that they had to be revived by doctors who were also in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also testified that during one of the 1984 meetings where Camarena's 
kidnaping was discussed, Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a commander with Mexico's 
Federal Judicial Police, said that the group needed information about how 
Camarena had learned about a large marijuana operation in Zacatecas that was 
raided in May, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Aldana, who led the raid, has been indicted in the Camarena murder here. He was 
arrested in Mexico earlier this year on other charges, shortly after his Los 
Angeles indictment. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, about 20 tons of processed marijuana were seized, along with 
150 acres of marijuana fields and enough marijuana seeds to plant about 6,500 
acres, according to "Desperadoes," a book on the Camarena murder by author 
Elaine Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
The raid could have been even more successful had the operators not been tipped 
off by corrupt officials in Mexico's Federal Judicial Police, according to U.S 
Drug Enforcement Administration officials. Although 177 people were arrested, 
the key suspects were able to flee before the raiding party arrived. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, Camarena -- who had shown up as an observer -- was spotted by 
an aide to drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero. Some U.S. officials believe that 
Camarena's presence at the raid convinced Mexican drug traffickers that he was 
a threat and led to the plot against him. 
</P>
<P>
In several less exotic exchanges Friday, Cervantes appeared to be caught in 
significant contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that he had never been shown any photographs of people involved 
in the case by DEA officials. But defense lawyer Martin R. Stolar held up a DEA 
report which showed that Cervantes indeed had been shown photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also said that the bodies of two people allegedly killed by cartel 
members a week before Camarena was abducted had been buried near a house in 
Guadalajara owned by defendant Ruben Zuno Arce. But one of Zuno's lawyers said 
that his client did not own a house in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes -- who has been paid more than $36,000 by the U.S. government since 
he agreed to become a witness -- acknowledged that he was pleased to be in the 
United States and said that he could be killed if he returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Barba, was shot to death by Mexican federal judicial police in November, 1986.
