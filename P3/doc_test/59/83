<F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General Office's [PGR] Planning Center 
for Drug Control [Cendro] has said the area devoted in Mexico to 
narcotics crops "continually increases due to, among other 
things, the poverty created for years by low agriculture yields, 
the lack of infrastructure, and the low prices of agricultural 
products." 
  Cendro added that, after narcotics crops on thousands of 
hectares in northern Mexico were razed, drug traffickers moved 
to the southern part of the country, devastating forest areas in 
Veracruz, Puebla, and the tropical jungle in Oaxaca, Chiapas, 
Tabasco, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. 
  The PGR has admitted that production of narcotics, mainly 
opium, has increased in nearly every southern state in the 
country as a consequence of the reactivation of the opium market 
in the United States and Europe. 
  Oaxaca is one of the four states where opium fields are most 
abundant. These fields are located in San Vicente Coatlan, 
Coicoyan del las Flores, Miahuatlan de Porfirio Diaz, Oaxaca de 
Juarez, Pinotepa de Don Luis, San Baltasar Chichicapam, and San 
Carlos Yautepec, all of them in La Mixteca and the Southern 
Sierra Madre, where it borders with Guerrero state and the 
Tehuantepec isthmus. 
  Cendro reports that as a result of unemployment in Oaxaca, 
more than 2,000 Zapotec, Mixtec, and Chinantec Indians have been 
hired by drug traffickers to grow marijuana and poppy on their 
plots of land and store marijuana in their storage areas. This 
happens in Ejutla de Crespo, Ixtepec, and San Miguel del Puerto 
municipalities. 
  In Chiapas, Indian communities and Guatemalans, working 
together near the border with Guatemala, participate in the 
production of drugs. The Papaloapan River basin, one of the 
largest production areas located on the border between Oaxaca 
and Veracruz, has begun to be used as a distribution center by 
drug traffickers who force peasants to grow narcotics crops. 
  According to the Cendro report, the Pacific region was 
Mexico's largest production area from 1988 to 1992, and it 
elicited the strongest action by the authorities. 
  Sinaloa was the top marijuana producer, with 20.90 percent 
of 
the total that was destroyed throughout the country. Michoacan 
was second. In Jalisco, the area where marijuana was destroyed 
in 1992 and 1993 was three times larger than in 1991, 
particularly in the municipalities of San Sebastian, Tequila, 
and Villa Corona. Other municipalities have been more active, 
such as Hostotipanquillo, Magdalena, Colotlan, Pihuamo, 
Tecalitlan, and Ciudad Guzman, where vigilance was improved with 
1,500 soldiers, who have intensified the fight against the 
growing, harvesting, and transporting of drugs. This fight has 
been supported by Mexican Air Force and PGR helicopters. 
  In Sinaloa, which ranks as the largest grower of poppy, the 
area where this crop was destroyed increased by 74 percent in 
1992 and 1993, as compared to 1991. The destruction of crops 
took place mostly in Badiraguato, Mazatlan, and Choix. Last 
year, 3,552 hectares planted with poppy were razed in the state. 
  The municipalities most affected were Choix, Cosala, 
Badariguato, Ahome, and San Ignacio, where peasants continue to 
be hired on a large-scale basis to grow and harvest the 
narcotic. Irrigation systems and tools were observed in some of 
the fields that were destroyed. 
  Cendro says the production of marijuana has been steady in 
most Nayarit municipalities. Nevertheless, the usage of land 
increased by as much as 80 percent in 1993, mostly in the 
municipalities of Ixtlan, Huajicori, Compostela, Nayar, and San 
Pedro. 
  In Durango, eight times more marijuana was destroyed in 1993 
than in 1992. The increase in the identification and 
destruction of marijuana fields has been marked. The 
municipalities where this problem is greater are Armeria, 
Tecoman, Minatitlan, and Coquimatlan. This situation is caused 
by the weather conditions both along the coast and in the 
highlands. 
  In states where crops were less abundant, the strategy 
changed. This is what happened in Atolinga, Zacatecas State, 
where the Federal Judicial Police discovered marijuana fields 
interspersed with corn fields. In the Pacific zone, regarded as 
one of the largest producers, 24.7 percent more narcotics fields 
were destroyed than last year. 
  In 1992, the eradication of poppy plantations in the area 
increased by 24.69 percent compared with 1991, mostly in 
Guerrero State. There, 4,071.4 hectares, which represented 35.1 
percent of the total nationwide, were destroyed in 1992. Poppy 
plantations were located in the municipalities of Ajuchitlan, 
Copanatoyac, Coyuca de Catalan, Chilapa de Alvarez, 
Chilpancingo, General Heliodoro Castillo, Iguala, Jose Azueta, 
Leonardo Bravo, and Metlatonoc. 
  The Cendro contends that physical and socioeconomic 
conditions in Michoacan favor a high level of drug trafficking. 
As a result, Michoacan is one of the major producers of 
marijuana and, according to statistics, 3,231 hectares were 
eradicated during the 1992-93 period, which is a 60-percent 
increase over the previous year. 
  The mountains of Acuitzio, Apatzingan, and Tacambaro 
continue 
to be areas for growing illegal crops while Nuevo Urecho, 
Penjamillo, Los Reyes, and San Lucas are municipalities that 
have recently joined the program to eradicate illegal crops. 
  Heroin is produced in Michoacan, a state where there is 
virtually no eradication of poppy, which leads to the assumption 
that the opium comes from Guerrero State. 
  As for central Mexico, the Cendro reveals that drug crops on 
plots equipped with an irrigation infrastructure on ranches 
owned by Juan Jose Quintero Payan were detected in San Miguel de 
Allende. In addition, marijuana plantations have been detected 
in Dolores Hidalgo and Juventino Rosas. 
  A field of marijuana ready to be harvested was found in 
Tejupilco, Mexico State. Mexico State is considered a broad 
area for sowing and growing marijuana, particularly places such 
as the hills of San Vicente, San Miguel Grande, the highlands of 
San Pedro Limon, and along some of the road to Los Bejucos. 
<H5>  They Even Have Irrigated Agricultural Areas </H5>
  There is a generalized increase in the lands used for 
growing 
marijuana, expanding its scope of influence in the central area 
and incorporating new plots equipped with irrigation systems. 
  This practice promotes the relocation of this crop in areas 
that, because of their characteristics, yield a larger amount 
and higher-quality drug. These practices have been detected in 
areas bordering San Luis Potosi-Hidalgo-Veracruz and 
Guerrero-Michoacan. 
  As for northern Mexico, the problem of drug crops in 
Chihuahua is increasing, especially in the region inhabited by 
the Tepehuan and Tarahumara Indians. 
  In those regions, the Cendro notes, given the poverty levels 
among native groups, illegal crops are easily incorporated. In 
1992-93, there was a determined antidrug effort by the 
authorities in Baborigame. 
<H5>  Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa: the "Golden Triangle" </H5>
  Drug-sowing in the Tepehuan region include the States of 
Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. This area, also known as "the 
Golden Triangle," possesses the best conditions for the 
production of marijuana and poppy among all areas in northern 
Mexico. The Tepehuan region garners elements such as 
geographical isolation, poverty and social backwardness, which 
make it particularly attractive to drug traffickers. 
  The emergence of drug production in southern Baja California 
State is troubling. In 1992-93, marijuana plantations, equipped 
with a modern and working irrigation system, were eradicated for 
the first time since 1984 in the municipality of Comondu. 
Marijuana plantations have also been found near Guerrero Negro. 
  "Mobile" crops represent an option for drug traffickers 
because they can be removed easily and rapidly if the 
authorities detect them. During 1992, there was an increase in 
the eradication of plantations of this type in the States of 
Sinaloa and Sonora. 
  In the months of July, August, and September 1992, 1,559 
hectares of marijuana were destroyed in Sinaloa and Sonora, thus 
increasing to 33 percent the average of eradicated marijuana 
registered during the same period in the three previous years. 
  Reports indicate, however, a reversal for illegal crops in 
the municipalities of Alamos and Ures, Sonora State. The 
eradication of mobile crops in El Venadito's ejido in the 
municipality of Alamos, where marijuana was grown in plastic 
bags is worth mentioning. 
  Regarding poppy production, 2,713.6 hectares of poppy were 
destroyed in the states near the northern border. These 2,713.6 
hectares represent 23.6-percent of the total destroyed 
nationwide, and represents a 136.4-percent, 44.2 percent, and 
77.2 percent increase compared with the three previous years, 
respectively, the Cendro ends.
