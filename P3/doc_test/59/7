  [Excerpts] Over 50 million new pesos worth of heroin, 
cocaine, ephedrine, maritol, and packed marijuana were 
confiscated during the past 48 hours by Federal Judicial Police 
forces in counternarcotics operations conducted in 15 federative 
states. The traffickers presumably intended to smuggle the drugs 
into the United States for sale and consumption. 
  It was stressed that no incidents nor confrontations between 
authorities and criminals were reported during the activities. 
  The operations were carried out in Sonora, Baja California, 
Michoacan, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, 
Coahuila, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, Jalisco, and 
Morelos. They also enabled the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic [PGR] to arrest 52 presumed drug dealers, and to 
seize 13 vehicles, a boat with an outboard motor, five firearms, 
and scores of useful rounds, which are at the disposal of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Offices. 
  It was specified that, at the highway checkpoint established 
on the outskirts of the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, federal 
agents intercepted a tank truck purported to be carrying liquid 
petroleum gas. However, over 4.5 tons of cannabis indica were 
found in its tank, outfitted with special compartments. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for Baja California State, the PGR reported that, in 
operations conducted in the towns of Tijuana and Mexicali, 
Humberto Fernandez Vazquez, Aurelia Peralta, Martha Bernal 
Silva, Margarita Montano Avila, Manuel Gracia Ramirez, and Juan 
Luevano Luna were arrested. They had in their possession 80 kg 
of ephedrine, a chemical precursor for refining cocaine and 
processing amphetamines. They intended to smuggle the ephedrine 
north into neighboring California. 
  Concurrently, at the ferry terminal in Pichilingue, Baja 
California Sur, the federal agents seized approximately two tons 
of compressed marijuana being transported in special 
compartments on a trailer body and under mudguards of a 
passenger bus. Two persons were placed at the disposal of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in connection with this 
incident. [passage omitted]
