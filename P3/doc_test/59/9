  [Excerpt] A spectacular blow was dealt to the drug traffic 
yesterday by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR]. In several operations conducted in five of the 
Federation's states, it seized 11 tons and 215 kg of dried and 
packed marijuana worth over 200 million new pesos. In addition, 
22 presumed drug traffickers were arrested, and 15 automotive 
vehicles confiscated. 
  During the same operations, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
personnel seized 92.5 kg of ephedrine, a chemical precursor used 
to manufacture amphetamines and to "cut" cocaine, so as to make 
that stimulant more potent. 
  The institution of federal justice cited a report from 
Sonora 
State, on the largest seizure of drugs, totaling 5,304 kg of 
marijuana, in an operation carried out in the vicinity of 
Benjamin Hill, at a PJF highway checkpoint. The PGR's 
representative in that state noted that the drugs were found on 
a tank truck bearing the label "nitrogen," which had left 
Guadalajara bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. The 
Federal Judicial Police discovered the ephedrine together with 
the marijuana. 
  The vehicle's driver, Juan Silva Saenz, claimed that the 
drugs had been packed in Jalisco State, and stored in a false 
bottom of the tank truck's structure. [passage omitted]
