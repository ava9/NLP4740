<TEXT>
<P>
Revenge was on Sen. Marian Bergeson's mind as she walked out, shellshocked and 
grim-faced, after a defeat in a committee hearing chaired by Assemblyman 
Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose). 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Republican convened her own Senate Local Government Committee 
two hours later and killed two of Cortese's bills by calling for a vote when 
too few senators were in the room to support the measure. Then, in a rare 
procedural twist, she persuaded her Senate colleagues to reconsider a Cortese 
bill approved by her committee just that morning so she could switch her "aye" 
vote to "no," personally scuttling that measure too. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Bergeson's pique: Cortese put Orange County's half-cent jail tax 
bill on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Touted by Orange County officials as their best hope to solve jail overcrowding 
problems, Bergeson's bill would allow the county to ask voters in June, 1990, 
to approve a half-cent-per-dollar sales tax increase aimed at financing 
construction of new adult and juvenile detention facilities, as well as 
additional courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the tax increase would produce an extra $121 million a 
year, crucial seed money for the planned 6,000-bed Gypsum Canyon jail that is 
projected to cost $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates said he figures the proposed sales tax hike would cost the 
average Orange County family $50 to $75 a year. That, Gates contends, is a 
small price to pay to keep an estimated 50,000 criminals a year from being 
prematurely released to Orange County streets. 
</P>
<P>
But those kinds of gut-level arguments have failed to impress lawmakers or 
erase the political and legal questions surrounding the Orange County measure, 
not the least of which is whether the proposal is legal under Proposition 13, 
the landmark tax limitation measure passed by Californians in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge invalidated a similar jail construction sales tax 
enacted by San Diego County voters because the county supervisors would control 
the revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled if that county's supervisors hold the purse strings, such a 
special tax requires approval of two-thirds of the voters. If a separate agency 
not controlled by the supervisors was in charge, the tax could be enacted by a 
simple majority, which is what the San Diego sales tax measure won at the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Despite amendments to the bill to cure any similar flaws in the Orange County 
sales tax measure, that legal decision was cited as one of the reasons Cortese 
on Wednesday asked his Assembly Local Government Committee to postpone a vote 
on the measure for at least a month of study -- a delay that angered Bergeson 
and prompted her retaliatory actions against his bills regarding growth 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for the Orange County sales tax measure is timing. 
</P>
<P>
While it is certainly of paramount importance to Orange County residents, it is 
only one of seven "urgent" sales tax proposals before the state lawmakers this 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Five of them would ask voters to increase local sales taxes to finance jail 
construction in Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles, Ventura and Humboldt counties. 
Bergeson, herself, is carrying the bill for Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The two other bills would allow communities around the state to add sales taxes 
to pay for everything from police services to local improvements such as 
streets, sewers and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese contends that the spate of sales tax bills is a problem because each 
measure is written differently. The resulting hodgepodge stands a good chance 
of being rejected at the last minute by Gov. George Deukmejian, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine him saying, 'Hey guys, give me one bill that makes sense,' " 
Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman said that to forestall that possibility, he wants his committee 
staff to see if there is a way to streamline and combine all the measures into 
one sales tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legality In Question 
</P>
<P>
Yet the legality question surrounding the Orange County sales tax measure, as 
well as its legislative siblings, remains. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 says that before a local government, such as a county board of 
supervisors, can impose a tax for a special purpose, such as building jails, it 
first must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the affected voters. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orange County officials could take that route without the aid of 
Bergeson's bill. The Board of Supervisors could call a bond election to pay for 
the new jail through an increase in property taxes, said Richard Keefe, the 
county's manager for intergovernmental relations. But it is considered very 
difficult to get a two-thirds majority at the polls, especially for a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying they won't" hold a bond election, Keefe said. "That's a 
possible tool for our Board of Supervisors, (but) the reluctance to do that is 
based upon the dismal record of any kind of (tax) proposal submitted to the 
electorate by any agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to get the two-thirds approval," Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's bill would require only a simple majority approval for the sales 
tax, a distinct advantage for Orange County officials who are gearing up to 
campaign for the measure locally. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the money raised by the proposed half-cent-per-dollar sales tax 
would not go to the county, but to a new government agency called the Orange 
County Regional Justice Facilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent of County 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and her supporters argue that the new agency would be independent of 
the county because only two of its five board members will be county 
supervisors, who, therefore, could not control decisions of the committee. (Two 
other members would be elected officials from Orange County cities, and the 
fifth would be a public member chosen by the other four.) 
</P>
<P>
As such, they contend, the new body should be treated just like the Orange 
County Transportation Commission, which by law only needs a majority vote to 
impose a sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the plan say that distinction still won't be enough to stave off 
a court challenge of the Orange County jail tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The new agency's function is to build jails and courthouses, traditionally the 
county's job. While it could theoretically make independent decisions on how to 
spend the sales tax money, the agency was created primarily to help fund a new 
county jail and courthouse. And Bergeson's bill still calls for county 
supervisors to make a final decision on how and where a detention facility 
would be built. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to have a difficult time going to court with a straight 
face and saying, 'Yeah, this is a legitimate agency formed with another purpose 
other than evading Proposition 13,' " said Thomas Homann, one of the attorneys 
who successfully challenged the San Diego jail construction sales tax. "I don't 
see them winning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Mention of Commission 
</P>
<P>
Critics also note that when it was introduced on March 9, there was no mention 
of an independent commission. The bill originally allowed the Orange County 
supervisors, through a special taxing district, to collect the money as well as 
spend it. 
</P>
<P>
But after a Riverside Superior Court Judge ruled March 24 that a similar 
proposal in San Diego County was unconstitutional, Bergeson and attorneys for 
the county scrambled to rewrite the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego jail construction tax, approved last year by 50.8% of the voters, 
funneled the money indirectly to the county through a new agency called the San 
Diego Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency. But Judge Gordon R. Burkhart 
ruled that the agency was so closely aligned with the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors that it was an "alter ego" of county government. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart also overturned the San Diego sales tax measure, saying it "purposely 
circumvented" the two-thirds provision for a special tax under Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that the tax here is placed in the . . . treasury and was not 
to be spent for any general purpose the county wishes but rather must be spent 
for the special purposes of constructing and operating justice facilities," 
Burkhart wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Amended 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, Orange County supervisors voted to relinquish control of the 
proposed Gypsum Canyon jail to a new government agency. On July 5, the Bergeson 
bill was amended with language creating the independent Orange County Regional 
Justice Facilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Critics such as Homann contend that such efforts, coming after the judge's 
ruling, could help bolster a charge that the county is trying to do an end-run 
around Proposition 13 with its sales tax. Even one of the measure's supporters, 
who asked not to be identified, admitted privately last week that the move by 
the county was a "strategic error." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bergeson said she intends to continue pushing the sales tax proposal, 
despite these questions, because it is the "best option" open to Orange County 
officials, who have been under federal court pressure to relieve overcrowding 
in jail facilities. She noted, too, that the San Diego case could still be 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be action taken," Bergeson said. "The county is almost at a point 
of desperation in finding a mechanism . . . to comply with an issue that is a 
health and safety matter. It's literally a crisis as a result of releasing 
prisoners, arrestees, back onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that they (the county) are willing to go forward right now, 
even with the San Diego case, highlights the need." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who has already organized an informational campaign to persuade voters 
to pass the sales tax, said emphatically that Orange County's proposal is not 
designed to circumvent Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sick and Tired' 
</P>
<P>
"I get sick and tired of people who complain about these kind of things but 
don't step forward with a recommendation or a solution to the problem," Gates 
said of critics of the sales tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
But in delaying action on the Orange County bill for further study, Cortese 
said he is trying to make sure the sales tax solution doesn't create more 
problems. He predicted that if the Legislature passes the Bergeson bill in its 
present form, its chance of surviving a court challenge is "almost nil." 
</P>
<P>
Cortese spoke gingerly when asked if the Orange County plan was an effort to 
get around the limitations imposed by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Orange County officials) are not supposed to say that, and I'm not 
supposed to say that, either. They would obviously be letting the cat out of 
the bag. If they said it, it would go on record as their motive and it would 
ruin their whole effort overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it either." 
</P>
<P>
But maybe with minor modifications over the next month, the sales tax measure's 
odds of withstanding a court challenge can be improved. "At least they will be 
50-50," Cortese said.
