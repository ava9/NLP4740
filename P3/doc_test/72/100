<P>
A Senate committee Tuesday rejected legislation that would have required the 
California Public Utilities Commission to weigh the results of an advisory vote 
of San Diegans before acting on the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric and Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee approved two other measures designed to ensure 
that San Diegans and their environment are not harmed by the merger, which, if 
approved by the PUC, would create the largest electric utility in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), author of the advisory-vote measure, blamed 
his bill's defeat on the considerable clout Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric wield in the Legislature. The vote was the first test of strength on 
an issue that will probably dominate San Diego politics for most of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Good at It' 
</P>
<P>
"These are non-competitive monopolies," Stirling said of the utilities, which 
annually spend hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying the Legislature and 
the PUC. "They make their money not by providing a competitively priced product 
but by manipulating the government. I think you've seen a strong indication 
today that they are very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling said he hopes San Diego County will still call for a vote on the 
issue, even if the utilities commission is not be required to consider the 
result as part of its deliberations. He also proposed that all San Diegans 
write the words "No Merger" on the outside of their envelopes before mailing 
monthly payments to SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"Elected officials in Sacramento are not able to deliver the votes to do 
anything about Edison through the legislative process," Stirling said. "So it's 
up to every San Diegan to stand up and be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's bill, as it was introduced, would have given San Diego voters veto 
power over the merger. But the lawmaker, in the face of the utilities' 
opposition and a legislative counsel opinion suggesting that the measure would 
be unconstitutional, amended the bill to allow only an advisory vote, which the 
PUC would have had to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E still argued against the measure, contending it was an 
unnecessary intrusion into the PUC's regulation of utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill would just confuse the issue," said Mary Wood, assistant general 
counsel for SDG&amp;E. "Present law gives (utility customers) the protection 
that they need." 
</P>
<P>
The bill received only two votes from the nine-member Energy and Public 
Utilities Committee. The measure needed five votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition to the two bills the committee approved was not as strong. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bills, by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) establishes 10 
standards for the PUC to use when weighing a proposed merger. Four of the 10 
would be mandatory: The merger would be required to benefit customers, to be 
"fair and reasonable" to employees, to be fair to stockholders and to not 
"adversely affect" competition. The six other standards, involving utility 
service, management and the local economies, would have to be met "on balance" 
in the judgment of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said the bill is needed to ensure that the utilities are forced to 
keep the promises they are making as they argue in support of the proposed 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC has absolutely no statutory criteria for determining what conditions 
must be met before a utility merger is approved," Rosenthal said. "The whole 
process is unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Edison opposed the measure, but a lawyer for the company said he believed the 
utility could "live with it." The bill passed on a vote of 8 to 1 and was sent 
to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Require Study 
</P>
<P>
The third bill, by Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) would require the preparation 
of an environmental impact study before the PUC could approve the merger. The 
bill, which would apply only to the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger, was approved 8-1 
and forwarded to the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who left the Capitol to return to San Diego 
before the vote on Stirling's bill, said she was encouraged by the committee's 
approval of Rosenthal's measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point, the only players have been the PUC and Southern California 
Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric," O'Connor said. "Now you're seeing a 
big push here to make sure that the ratepayers get some kind of a voice." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, whose bill might be reconsidered by the committee in May, also said 
he was encouraged by the success of Rosenthal's bill, although that measure 
still gives the PUC great leeway in deciding whether to allow the merger to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the bills are a step in the right direction," Stirling said. "The PUC 
process has not worked for the people of San Diego. We had the highest rates. 
When they started down again, the guys with the highest rates come in and take 
us over. It's not a working system."
