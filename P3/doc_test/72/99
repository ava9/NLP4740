Next time you dip a spoon into your honey pot consider this: A single bee will 
only gather enough nectar to make one teaspoon of the syrupy sweetener during a 
short and busy life span -- which can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Honey is a crop produced in a wide variety of locations and climates. In North 
County, coastal areas are better suited to honey production because of the 
abundance of eucalyptus trees, according to Alan Mikolich, vice president of 
the Beekeepers' Assn. of San Diego County. The Department of Agriculture Crop 
Report for last year lists the value of honey production in San Diego County at 
$475,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among North County beekeepers is Salvador Mendoza, a veteran of 20 years in 
apiculture in Mexico who now tends bees at the Peterson Farm in Fallbrook. 
Mendoza speaks of beekeeping in almost reverential tones: "I feel such an 
affection for my bees, that, for me, raising them is not work, it's a labor of 
love." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Mendoza -- his head hidden under a protective veil -- went 
about checking his 12 beehives. He temporarily calmed the bees with a puff of 
smoke from his smoker, and carefully lifted off the top of a hive. "You have to 
concentrate on what you're doing," he said as he gently pulled out a frame 
alive with insects. "The bees sense when you make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Bees understand our moods, they can sense if we're afraid," Mendoza said. The 
bees around him were gathering nectar from eucalyptus trees, and bushes of 
sumac and toyon -- a protected California plant. "Do you know that they even 
recognize me?" he added, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The knowledge that bees are sensitive to a person's mood is shared by Emil 
Stoll, another North County apiculturist. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll began beekeeping as a hobby eight years ago in his back yard. Today, his 
hobby has grown to about 350 hives, with an annual yield of 15,000 to 20,000 
pounds of honey. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll's bees favor mesquite and desert flowers, which bloom year-round in 
Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
For the Stolls, beekeeping is a family affair. On farmers' market days, it 
falls upon Stoll's wife, Mable, and his daughter, Patricia Ann, to help sell 
honey, honeycombs, bee pollen and beeswax candles. 
</P>
<P>
Although honey is a natural product, it is difficult to call it completely 
organic because there is no way to control the honeybees' feeding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest, or Grade A honey is the most popular with American consumers, 
said Mikolich of the Beekeepers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Bee pollen and royal jelly (which purportedly has rejuvenating properties) are 
also prized among connoisseurs of natural foods.
