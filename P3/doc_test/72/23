SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years as the nation's top mental health officer, Dr. Lewis Judd is 
returning to his former position as head of psychiatry at UC San Diego School 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Judd, 60, had been on a leave of absence from UCSD to direct the National 
Institute of Mental Health since January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He will resume his UCSD post Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
During Judd's federal tenure, two other professors served as acting chairmen. 
They were Dr. Mark Schuckit, through July, 1988, and Dr. Igor Grant, since 
August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Judd was the first active scientist named as federal mental health director. 
His initiatives have included developing research programs or plans for 
addressing schizophrenia, mental illness in children, and the molecular 
genetics of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, UCSD was designated as a federal center for research into 
how the AIDS virus affects the brain. In addition, last week the San Diego 
county's mental health department received a major federal grant to study how 
to best deal with homelessness among the chronically mentally ill.
