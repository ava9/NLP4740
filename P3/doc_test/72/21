The Board of Supervisors on Wednesday gave tentative approval to a $1.6-billion 
county budget for 1990-91 that includes $13.5 million in administrative fees 
that will be charged to special districts, including school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The county will impose the controversial fees for its services in collecting 
property taxes for the districts. About $9 million in fees will come from 
school districts, and the rest will come from cities and special districts. 
There are 45 school districts and five community college districts in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
County spokesman Robert Lerner said the unprecedented fees will be used to help 
offset a $21-million shortfall in state funds for the county's medical programs 
for the working poor. During the current fiscal year, the County Medical 
Services health program for the poor had a $41-million budget. However, that 
will be reduced to $20 million beginning Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county will lose $23 million in state funds in the coming fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state Legislature passed a law to allow counties to impose the 
administrative fees, county officials expect local educators to challenge the 
fees either in court or by lobbying legislators to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
If the fees are successfully challenged or repealed, the county's medical 
programs for the working poor could be eliminated entirely as early as next 
February, Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that health care for 25,000 persons will be stopped. You'll have an 
awful lot of working people who cannot afford to pay for health care on their 
own going without it," Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
The county contracts with nonprofit community clinics to provide health care 
for the working poor. On Tuesday, representatives from various clinics were at 
the board meeting to express their concern over the funding shortage and 
possible elimination of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant supervisors voted 4 to 1 to impose the administrative fees. Only 
Supervisor John MacDonald, a former educator, voted against the fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a protest vote more than anything," MacDonald said. "Although the 
county needs to backfill some important health programs, the way the 
Legislature forced us into raising those fees was tantamount to being 
unethical." 
</P>
<P>
"The formula imposed on us by the Legislature was not fair. It had nothing to 
do with the size of the districts. It only had to do with the amount of taxes. 
There are some small districts that will have $250,000 obligations. I felt it 
was a real unfair formula." 
</P>
<P>
According to MacDonald, schools will pay $100 million in administrative fees in 
California because of the new law. The San Diego Unified School District is 
expected to pay about $3 million in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Boysen, superintendent of the County Office of Education, called the fee 
a way of "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Although Boysen blamed the state for 
forcing the board to take action on the fees, he complained that the county is 
attempting to balance its budget by "taking $9 million away from 
schoolchildren." 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely going to be a challenge at the state level. I think the 
California School Board Assn. will get all the school districts together and 
file one lawsuit," Boysen said. 
</P>
<P>
In another effort to raise revenue, cash-starved supervisors also voted to 
charge a booking fee to cities for all prisoners in the county jails. County 
officials estimated that the fee will raise about $3 million in new funds, 
which will be used to help run the jails. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego would be exempted from paying the booking fee because of an agreement 
that it signed with the county last year, Lerner said. However, the board 
directed its jail subcommittee to reopen talks with San Diego in hopes of 
getting the city to agree to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Other features in the budget approved by the board: 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the Superior Court budget by nearly $1 million and the Municipal 
Court's by more than $555,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the county marshal's budget by $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Allocating $2.5 million more for alternate defense counsel contracts for 
indigent defendants. 
</P>
<P>
* Directing the chief administrative officer to find ways to implement a 3% 
across-the-board reduction in general fund expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The chief administrative officer is expected to offer a pro forma resolution 
for approval of the budget at the board's Sept. 25 meeting. Final approval is 
expected Oct. 2.
