COUNTY NEEDS FAIR SHAKE ON FUNDS;

<P>
THE COUNTY DESERVES A BIGGER SHARE WHEN STATE GIVES OUT MENTAL HEALTH MONIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine that you made an error in financial judgment some 33 years ago, and you 
are still paying for it today. And paying. And paying. 
</P>
<P>
That's the burden San Diego County -- and many other late-developing California 
counties -- bear today because of mental health policy decisions made decades 
ago. In 1957, when the state was developing its funding policy for 
then-voluntary county mental health programs, San Diego was putting its money 
into its own county mental hospital and didn't jump aboard the gravy train. 
</P>
<P>
When it subsequently did seek state funds for county mental health programs 
(which the state declared mandatory in 1968), funding patterns were already set 
in stone. 
</P>
<P>
The result: San Diego County, with 2.4 million people, today receives $19 per 
capita, $9 less than the state average, and less than a third of the $62 per 
person received by politically powerful San Francisco, whose population is far 
less than half of San Diego's. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of this unfair situation can be seen on San Diego's streets every 
day. Some of those clearly disturbed people you see wandering downtown might be 
receiving help if the system were designed more equitably. Less money means 
fewer mental health clinics and other programs. The county also is limited to a 
horribly disproportionate number of state-funded beds in state mental 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature should straighten the system out. But with Los Angeles and San 
Francisco enjoying better-than-average funding allocations, that hasn't 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the county played its other card when it began court arguments in a 
4-year-old case designed to overturn the system. To do so, the county will make 
two arguments: that the entire funding system violates the equal protection 
clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and that the state is 
consistently violating a 1985 law calling for all newly allocated mental health 
money to be funneled toward counties like San Diego and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's opponents, which include the state attorney general's office and 
the city of San Francisco, argue that communities that were quick to take 
advantage of state funding and build mental health programs shouldn't see their 
efforts crippled by Johnny-come-lately counties like San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
They also claim that, despite its larger size, San Diego may not have the same 
mental health needs as places like San Francisco. But San Diego's lawyers will 
offer epidemiological studies that they say show that mental health needs are 
roughly equal everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys claim San Diego has been shortchanged $8 million to $18 
million annually since 1980 for programs that indirectly affect everyone in the 
county. With that much at stake, the Legislature must find a way to gradually 
give San Diego County its deserved share of mental health funding.
