The Senate Thursday easily approved legislation to force the state Commerce 
Department to open an office in San Diego County to aid the development of 
business between companies in the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure, passed by the Senate 34-0 and sent to the Assembly, appears 
headed for a certain veto, just as a similar bill was rejected last year by 
Gov. George Deukmejian. Both bills were carried by Sen. William Craven 
(R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian objected last year to the cost of the new office, which would need 
about $200,000 a year to operate, according to the Commerce Department. And the 
lobbyist for the department said Thursday that the state still lacks the 
resources to open an extra Commerce Department outpost in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is money," said Rich Allen, the department's legislative 
coordinator. "There just isn't the money to open an office -- not that we don't 
want to." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the department does "a land-office business" at its offices in San 
Jose and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego, being the second largest city in the state, I'm sure that we could 
do business there," he said. But Allen added that San Diego is served 
adequately by the department's other offices. 
</P>
<P>
Craven said the office is warranted because San Diego is the "gateway" to the 
Pacific Rim's Latin American sector. 
</P>
<P>
As the California city bordering the United States' third-largest trading 
partner, San Diego has become increasingly involved in the maquiladoras program 
-- under which U. S.- or foreign-owned companies build plants on the Mexican 
side of the border that produce or assemble products destined for sale in the 
United States.
