The debate over whether San Diego County will regulate the emissions of 
ozone-depleting chemicals got off to a fiery start Thursday, as 
environmentalists and businessmen gathered to discuss the county's proposed 
curbs on the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 people attended the public meeting, at which Air Pollution Control 
District officials had hoped to field suggestions to help polish 16 draft 
proposals they had intended to present to the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors for approval March 27. By meeting's end, however, the officials 
said they would consider postponing that date to gather more information. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the proposals would prohibit the sale of certain 
non-essential aerosol products, ban the use of foam food-packaging containers 
when alternatives are available and increase restrictions on businesses that 
work with refrigerants and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Local environmental groups said the APCD's proposals could be tougher and more 
focused. Diane Takvorian, executive director of the Environmental Health 
Coalition, said it is not enough to rely on industries to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is fairly clear that all industries are not going to voluntarily 
comply," she said. "The time for study is basically over. We should take 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the automotive, electronics and firefighting industries that 
use CFCs and halons, meanwhile, said the proposals are misguided and 
under-researched. Many requested a chance to suggest revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a county supervisor, and you should be thankful for that," said Ervin 
Rubey of the San Diego County Auto Recyclers Assn. He said he is angry that 
input from the affected industries had not been solicited earlier. "If I were 
and, you brought this intellectual vomit to me, I would throw it back in your 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Al Thornton, a spokesman for Great Lakes Chemicals Corp., a Louisiana-based 
halon manufacturer, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people here have written that March date down and intend to 
show up with their guns," he said, referring to the planned March 27 
presentation to the county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
By the workshop's end, APCD officials said they would consider postponing their 
presentation in order to hold a second workshop with those industries that 
would be most affected by the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Sidhu, a deputy director of the APCD, chastised those industry 
representatives who are "saying San Diego shouldn't do anything because their 
efforts will not solve the problem. It's a collective effort. You can't just 
pass the buck." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the idea is to close businesses down," he added. "But, if there 
are alternatives, we want you to use them." 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are widely used as a coolant in refrigerators and air-conditioning units 
and as a solvent in industrial processes. Halons are used exclusively in 
firefighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists agree that both CFCs and halons have caused severe depletion of 
the Earth's atmospheric ozone layer that, if allowed to continue, could cause 
more skin cancer cases and gradual global warming.
