<P>
Southern California transit agencies and the Santa Fe Railway have begun 
swapping figures in an attempt to reach a multimillion-dollar deal to purchase 
rail rights of way for commuter and intercity travel. 
</P>
<P>
However, former state Sen. Jim Mills, who heads the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board and the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency board of directors, said 
transit negotiators and Santa Fe officials are "far apart" on the price. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, commuter train service is planned along Santa Fe tracks 
between Oceanside and San Diego by early 1993, and between Oceanside and 
Escondido by 1995. Train service between San Diego and Los Angeles also is 
scheduled to be upgraded to allow commuters to use rail transit for their 
morning and evening commutes. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe officials confirmed Wednesday that railroad negotiators had met with a 
number of Southern California agencies Aug. 15 to discuss purchase of the Santa 
Fe right of way from Fullerton south to San Diego, but stressed that the 
railway was not interested in selling its lines north into Los Angeles or in 
allowing greatly increased rail traffic on that segment of the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very friendly meeting to discuss areas of mutual interest," said 
Robert Gehrt, Santa Fe vice president for public relations. "We are hopeful we 
can work out an arrangement that will be agreeable to all parties concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that there will be additional meetings from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Santa Fe's Gehrt nor MTDB general manager Tom Larwin would reveal 
appraisal prices or offers made for the railroad right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
Jointly negotiating with the Chicago-based railroad line are LOSSAN (Los 
Angeles-San Diego), the umbrella agency coordinating passenger service on the 
rail corridor between the two cities; San Diego's MTDB, which controls transit 
in southern San Diego County; the North (San 
</P>
<P>
Diego) County Transit District; the San Diego Assn. of Governments; the Orange 
County Transportation Commission and the Los Angeles Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Larwin said the transit agencies banded together in joint negotiations because 
it was felt "we could negotiate from a stronger position jointly." However, he 
added, "if the interests of the individual agencies differ, they may drop out 
and negotiate separately." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said that LOSSAN has hired a consultant, Bob Banks, to represent the 
agency in negotiations and to help appraise the railroad right of way. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Santa Fe wanted to appraise by the "over-the-fence" method, which 
uses the value of the adjacent land as if the tracks could be converted to 
industrial use or ocean-view building lots. Transit groups were seeking to use 
an appraisal method that would base the value on the actual, approved use of 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
The appraisal figures compiled by the railroad and by the transit appraisers 
vary widely, Mills said, and the two sides' estimates of the value of the rail 
line "are far apart." A joint offer made by the rail agencies was not accepted 
by Santa Fe negotiators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mills was not pessimistic about reaching agreement because, he pointed out, 
Santa Fe first broached the idea of selling its Fullerton-San Diego tracks to 
the counties and transit agencies interested in starting passenger lines to 
relieve freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe also is in need of cash to pay a major judgment in a suit it lost over 
a pipeline project. The award against Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the 
parent company of Santa Fe Railway, totaled about $750 million in actual and 
punitive damages when a Texas court found that the corporation and other 
railroads conspired to delay, hinder or stop construction of a 1,700-mile 
pipeline to carry coal slurry -- a mixture of coal and water which can be 
transported long distances by pipeline. Coal now is transported almost 
exclusively by rail. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the money to deal, and they have the need for cash, I would think 
that we could come to some sort of a meeting of the minds," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that propositions 116 and 108, approved by voters last June, contained 
considerable funds for mass transit and commuter systems. San Diego County also 
has an added half-cent sales tax levy earmarked for road and transit projects.
