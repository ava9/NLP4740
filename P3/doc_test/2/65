China's hardline Premier Li Peng celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary in
a Romanian vineyard yesterday and let slip rare remarks on his personal life
as he tasted wines with his wife. Reuter reports from Murfatlar, Romania.
'My wife and I are very happy, just like the day we married 36 years ago,
maybe happier,' Mr Li said.
'A family is happy when both husband and wife help each other. But a husband
especially must obey his wife's orders.'
Mr Li made the remarks as he sampled wine at the renowned Murfatlar
vineyards, where he dropped in for a tasting session during a weekend rest
on Romania's Black Sea coast.
He arrived on Saturday for a four-day trip, the highest-level visit to
Romania by a Chinese leader in 10 years.
Mr Li and his wife Zhu Lin took their hosts in Murfatlar by surprise when
they said Sunday was their anniversary.
'My wife agrees we are a happy family,' Li said, gently pressing his hand on
Zhu's arm as she sat next to him at a long wooden tasting table in the
Murfatlar cellars.
To mark the anniversary, the two sipped wine from each other's glass, to the
applause of 100 accompanying Chinese and Romanian officials and businessmen.
Mr Li's affable banter contrasted with the image he earned over the bloody
crushing of demonstrations in Beijing in 1989, for which he is widely
blamed. Earlier legs of his European tour, in Austria and Germany, were
dogged by human rights protests.
Today, Mr Li flies to the capital Bucharest to meet President Ion Iliescu,
once his classmate at a communist cadre school in Moscow. The two leaders
are to sign a joint political declaration and a set of economic and cultural
agreements.
