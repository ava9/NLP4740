Caltech has announced the establishment of a new professorship with a 
contribution of $750,000 from the TRW Foundation. It will be the Ruben F. and 
Donna Mettler Professorship in Engineering and Applied Science, named for a 
Caltech alumnus and former board of trustees president and his wife. Mettler 
retired in January as chief executive officer of the aerospace and technology 
company in Cleveland, Ohio, and the couple have returned to Los Angeles to 
live. Mettler was one of the first alumni to receive Caltech's Distinguished 
Alumni Award in 1966.
