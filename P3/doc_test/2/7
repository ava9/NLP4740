Frank J. Lausche, the son of Slovakian immigrants who emerged from the ethnic 
neighborhoods of Cleveland to become a dominant and durable figure on the 
political scene for 40 years, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Democrat who served as a judge and mayor in his native city 
before becoming a five-term Ohio governor and two-term U.S. senator was 94. 
</P>
<P>
He died at the Slovene Home for the Aged in Cleveland where he had been 
admitted two months ago, said his sister-in-law, Antonia Lausche. 
</P>
<P>
One of 10 children of a steel worker father who died when he was only 13, young 
Lausche earned his first pennies lighting gas street lamps and acting as a 
court interpreter for his fellow Slovenians who came from a land now part of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
He studied for a career in law, received a degree in 1920 from John Marshall 
School of Law -- where he ranked second in his class -- and quickly became 
known as one of Cleveland's better trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Lausche's courtroom popularity encouraged him to make his first political race, 
an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio House in 1922 and then a second losing 
campaign for the Ohio Senate two years later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932 he was appointed judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court and in 1941 
became mayor of that city, a position he held until his election in 1944 to the 
first of five terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only governor in Ohio's history to be elected that many times. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor he was credited with establishing Cleveland's city-owned transit 
system and setting up committees that dealt with labor, health, transportation 
and Cleveland's growing racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Democrat, Lausche earned a reputation as an independent who often 
ignored party positions and consistently proved popular among independents and 
Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
He was called a "sturdy independent" who favored right-to-work legislation and 
sponsored a $336-million turnpike across Ohio while creating a resources 
department that directed the planting of 27 million trees. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a new Ohio law that prevented any governor from serving more than 
two successive terms, Lausche turned to the U.S. Senate where he was elected in 
1956 and reelected in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
He served on the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, the Foreign 
Relations Committee and as chairman of the Far Eastern Affairs subcommittee of 
the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lausche's lengthy political career ended in 1968 with his defeat -- due mostly 
to a long-running feud with organized labor -- in the Democratic primary for 
reelection to a third term in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a beautiful, wonderful life. We're sorry he didn't live long enough to 
see Slovenia become an independent country," said his sister-in-law. "They're 
part of Yugoslavia right now, but they're fighting for independence." 
</P>
<P>
Lausche is survived by a sister, Josephine Lausche Welf, 95, who also lives at 
the Slovene Home, and three sisters-in-law. His wife, Jane, died in 1981.
