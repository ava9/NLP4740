fall - Desktop Video

Desktop video is potentially bad news for airlines and for courier
companies. But, though they don't know it yet, it is good news for
executives who hate airports, and also for far-flung teleworkers.
People have heard this kind of promise from technology before and are
understandably suspicious. For most people, multimedia still belongs in a
science fiction limbo. It comes somewhere between the ubiquitous PC (itself
a safe, known quantity) and the human transporter in the television series
Star Trek which flushes people from the starship Enterprise to any handy
planet.
But this seems authentic. People really can phone up (over one of the new
ISDN lines, which can carry two bands of traffic, voice and pictures
simultaneously) and see the person to whom they are talking.
While talking, they can send pictures from videos or from text. They can
share a word-processed document that pops up on a screen-window, and work
together on it while still talking.
You, the user, can see a moving video of your colleague, displayed in a box
in the corner of the screen, and of yourself. Unless, of course, you want to
point the camera at some other subject to display it over the line. For
long-distance valuation of antiques, perhaps, or a second opinion on a
patient's medical condition?
BT has already installed 40,000 ISDN 2 channels for multimedia use in the
UK. Within a few years, the paraphernalia of desktop video - camera,
microphone, plug-in card to the PC, software, storage and backup mechanisms
 -will be cheap enough for small businesses to use, even to install at home
for fun.
Steve Cramoysen, marketing manager for Mercury Communications, believes that
the availability of ISDN will bring a flood of newcomers to join established
video-conferencing companies such as Picture-Tel V-Tel and others -
'integration of the various technologies has become as easy, cheap, and
small enough to think about packaging it as desktop video, for one-to-one
communications,' he says. 'Desktop video is about collaborative working:
it's much more useful to be able to share documents.'
NEW APPLICATIONS
Nuts Technologies in Hong Kong has a growing base of business users for its
Connect 918 full-motion colour system. They include the United Nations
organisation Unctad, a surveillance user in Israel, and a manufacturer of
highly customisable printing presses in Germany, which has until now sent
its commissioning engineers all over the world.
Eric Rixen, Nuts business development manager for Europe and the Middle
East, believes that once the video network has reached critical mass, it
will take off - 'initially it's being adopted by publishing houses because
they already have ISDN in-house for transferring large files.'
Teleconferencing Marketing Review from IFC Research of Guildford estimates
the value of the world market for Video conferencing products and services
will rise from Dollars 800m in 1992 to Dollars 7.7bn in 1997.
There are three components for multimedia applications: hardware (getting
cheaper and more standard), software and the source media itself: motion
video, stills, or whatever is being sent.
Large software companies such as Microsoft are promoting the potential of
the marketplace and moving fast to provide the delivery mechanisms for the
source media already amassing.
Database company Oracle claims it is already on the 'information highway',
promising access to database information and video on demand in the home.
Software alliances are happening: BT with Oracle and Sybase with IBM. Most
recent addition to the multimedia stampede is Reuters, with its online
business information products.
The coming together of disciplines depends on specialists in particular
areas. For example, Apple is producing software such as QuickTime, which
speeds up the rather jerky moving picture from the 12 frames per second to a
more realistic 30.
Doceo of Norcross Georgia produces a 'video benchmark' kit for comparing
software-only codec boards. Micropolis of Reading is ready for the boom with
the first high-volume disk drive to store images. Attica Cybernetics of
Oxford is producing the actual CD-ROM media for home, education, libraries
and business.
Video-conferencing companies are also re-positioning themselves. It was
events such as the Lockerbie air disaster and the Gulf War that put an edge
on video-conferencing, according to Mr Phil Simmonds, the marketing manager
of Luton-based GPT Communication Systems, a GPT/Siemens joint venture set up
in April 1991 to explore the new market.
'We're now focusing down on what we call 'the business desktop.' I, as a
user, would like to bring together fax, phone, PC, video and file transfers
on the PC, and we know that that is what users want. We expect the UK market
to have a potential of Pounds 40m . . . with some prediction of Dollars
2.4bn by 1996.'
Mr Peter Niblett, multimedia brand manager for IBM UK, has his eyes on the
home market: 'Up to now, the factors holding back multimedia have been its
very novelty - people can't imagine how it will help them - and the
availability of source material.
'We see the home market as very promising, especially given the spread of CD
ROM, sound cards, and affordable DIY image and motion video capturing and
editing.'
By 1997, the cost will have plummeted, and it might cost Pounds 50 - less
than the cost of a computer game - to look up distant relatives in
Australia.
