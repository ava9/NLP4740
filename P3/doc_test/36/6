A just-out book about the making of "Star Trek V" -- by director/co-star 
William Shatner, and his daughter, Lisabeth Shatner -- purports to tell the 
behind-the-scenes account of "the most spectacular 'Star Trek' movie yet!" 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the book -- "Captain's Log: William Shatner's Personal Account of the 
Making of 'Star Trek V' " -- was published by Pocket before the "spectacular" 
film's anticipated box office grosses didn't roll in. 
</P>
<P>
In 4 1/2 weeks, "Star Trek V" -- generally panned by the critics -- has to date 
grossed less than the previous films -- just $45.7 million and is sputtering 
badly. Compare previous screen Treks: "I" totaled $82.2 million; "II," $78.7 
million; "III," $76.4 million; and "IV," $109.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Harve Bennett argued, "You can't make those comparisons -- not 
considering that this is the summer of the great (blockbuster) blitz. Relative 
to the box office of 'II' and 'III,' we are off just 18%. Being off 18% this 
summer is not exactly chopped liver." 
</P>
<P>
As for the critical knocks singling out Shatner's direction: "Listen, I don't 
think there's one critic in the world who knows what the (heck) a director 
does." Bennett applauded Shatner for "creating a working environment of fun and 
energy -- we had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
(As for the possibility of another sequel: "In the words of Spock, 'There are 
always possibilities.' ") 
</P>
<P>
According to reps for Shatner, "He is being inundated with scripts to direct." 
</P>
<P>
They declined to specify the inundations. Pat H. Broeske
