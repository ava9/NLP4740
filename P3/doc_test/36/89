As a fan of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," I discovered its March 24 program 
titled "The Offspring," by Rene Echeverra, to be a poignant fantasy.

The story in which Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) fathered and educated a child of 
his own creation with the hope that he could give something back to the 
Federation was done with a high degree of insight and joy. I do hope they bring 
back Data's daughter as this was an outstanding teleplay that should lead to 
another episode.
