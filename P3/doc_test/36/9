Nichelle Nichols says she wasn't particularly interested when her friend Gene 
Roddenberry insisted that she audition for a part in his new science fiction 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Nichols considers "Star Trek" to be "just an interruption in my 
singing career, a nice interlude." 
</P>
<P>
Still, though Nichols is best known for her role as Lt. Uhura, she has never 
abandoned her musical career. Her one-woman show, "Reflections," pays tribute 
to musical legends. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, born in Chicago in 1936, was discovered by Duke Ellington, toured with 
Lionel Hampton and danced with Sammy Davis Jr. Eventually, she was playing 
successful engagements in European nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
Next thing she knew, she was decoding subspace communiques from Starfleet 
Command. 
</P>
<P>
But Trekkies need not fear. She and the old Enterprise crew "are still family," 
she says, and she is looking forward to "Star Trek VI."
