FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trans Union will not raise UAPT offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trans Union, the US credit information group, yesterday said it would not
increase its 550p offer for UATP-Infolink, in spite of a higher bid from
rival predator Equifax.
Equifax is offering 600p a share, increased from 500p after Trans Union's
offer. However, Equifax's bid may be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. UATP's board is recommending Trans Union's lower offer in light
of the MMC risk.
Equifax's offer closes on Friday; Trans Union's will lapse on August 31.
