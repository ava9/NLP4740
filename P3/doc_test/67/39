MR Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who gained control of Trans World
Airlines in 1986, yesterday formally relinquished his controlling interest
in the carrier. Mr Icahn resigned as chairman of the bankrupt and
heavily-indebted airline, and placed his entire stock interest in escrow.
The financier's departure was anticipated in an agreement last month between
the company's unions, its creditors, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the federal agency which underpins the payment of basic pension
benefits in the US.
Under this deal, TWA employees are proffering wage concessions in return for
a 45 per cent equity interest in the carrier, once it reorganises and
emerges from bankruptcy. Creditors, meanwhile, are forgiving around Dollars
1bn of debt, and will receive the remaining 55 per cent of the shares.
In the wake of Mr Icahn's departure, the company is headed by a two-man
management committee, appointed by employees, unions and creditors. This
week, TWA asked the bankruptcy court to extend the date for its
reorganisation plan filing to be extended to February 17.
