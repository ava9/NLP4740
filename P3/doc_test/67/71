BRITISH GAS told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that its share of the
UK gas market would fall to 68.5 per cent by 1998 compared with a share of
91.8 per cent last year.
In a submission made last year and published in yesterday's MMC report, the
company indicated that it expected competitors to win a large part of its
market for industrial customers, particularly power stations. However, it
expected to retain 100 per cent of the regulated tariff market for small
customers, including households.
The forecast was based on an earlier agreement between the company and the
Office of Fair Trading whereby the company would cut its share of the
non-tariff market to 40 per cent by 1995. Since then the MMC has recommended
that more of the tariff market be thrown open to new competitors by 1997.
This forecast is one of the few in the MMC report that has survived the
censor's scissors. Much of the information supplied to the commission has
been erased from the report because of its commercially sensitive nature.
Several pages in the 1,000-page document are blank.
Other information supplied by the company includes a detailed calculation of
the costs of various proposals for restructuring the company. These ranged
from a net present cost of Pounds 330m to implement the arrangements already
agreed with the OFT, to Pounds 2.9bn for a complete break-up of British Gas
into separate operating companies and several regional distribution
companies.
In recommending the partial break-up of the company, the commission later
said it believed these estimates were unnecessarily high.
The report also includes details of submissions from other energy companies.
Many complain about alleged predatory and anti-competitive behaviour by
British Gas.
Kinetica, a leading independent gas company, said that when it was
developing plans for a new gas pipeline, British Gas dropped its prices for
that route by almost two-thirds.
Summaries of submissions showed virtually all energy companies favouring a
break-up of British Gas, particularly a separation of its trading and
transportation operations because of the conflict of interest.
A notable exception was Shell, one of the largest North Sea gas producers.
The company told the MMC that it did not believe that a total break-up of
British Gas was necessary because this was likely to 'impair efficient
planning and operation at a time when these key activities were becoming
more difficult'. Instead, Shell advocated the division of the company into
two distinct, auditable cost centres.
