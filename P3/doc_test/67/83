<P>
Outgoing baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth has lined up financing for a 
bid of approximately $412 million to acquire strike-crippled Eastern Airlines, 
The Times learned Wednesday. The board of Texas Air Corp., the parent company 
of Eastern, is scheduled to meet today to consider his offer. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, the former head of the Los Angeles Olympics Committee, has put 
together a team headed by seasoned airline executive J. Thomas Talbot, who 
helped found two West Coast carriers -- Air California and Jet America. He also 
has retained the Los Angeles law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian Not Involved 
</P>
<P>
But contrary to some reports, Kirk Kerkorian, Ueberroth's friend and former 
employer in the airline industry, is not involved in the union-supported effort 
to acquire Eastern. As part of Ueberroth's package, union members would own 
about 30% of Eastern Airlines in return for contract concessions. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the board of Texas Air approves Ueberroth's offer, additional 
approval will be needed from a bankruptcy judge, a bankruptcy examiner, who 
will be appointed this week, and Eastern's unions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, other potential hurdles exist. It was understood that Eastern has 
other suitors including Denver billionaire Marvin Davis, members of Chicago's 
wealthy Pritzker family and Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World 
Airlines, all of whom might make competing offers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, America West Airlines, desperately seeking a major foothold in the 
lucrative northeastern market, is prepared to outbid billionaire developer 
Donald Trump for the Eastern shuttle, the Washington Post reported industry 
sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
America West officials would not confirm that a formal bid had been made for 
the Washingtion-New York-Boston shuttle service, but a spokeswoman for the 
Phoenix-based airline acknowledged that the company had been talking to Texas 
Air about purchasing "certain (Eastern) assets." 
</P>
<P>
It was understood that the unions initiated discussions with Ueberroth some 
time ago. After the strike by the International Assn. of Machinists began March 
4, discussions resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, representing Ueberroth, and representatives of Frank Lorenzo, chairman 
of Texas Air, have been negotiating for the last 10 days. Lorenzo has also met 
several times with Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as a Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that Ueberroth sees not only a management and 
human relations challenge in seeking to preserve the airline but he believes 
that a significant degree of employee ownership is vital if service industries 
are to remain competitive in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, who steps down as baseball commissioner this week, has steadfastly 
declined all comment since his name has become connected with the bid for 
Eastern. Pilots union officials, however, have made it clear that they would 
like to see Ueberroth take over the airline. Machinists union sources have been 
more circumspect, having earlier supported an Icahn bid. 
</P>
<P>
He would bring not only airline experience to Eastern but broad knowledge of 
the travel business. Ueberroth created the First Travel Corp., turning it into 
the second-largest travel agency in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot runs his own real estate firm, The Talbot Co., in Newport Beach. He was 
one of the founders of Air California, which later became AirCal and was 
acquired by American Airlines. He served as legal counsel to AirCal before 
becoming its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he was one of the founders and later chairman of Jet America, which 
was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to say if the company, which is privately 
held, was holding a board meeting today. But Frank Borman, vice chairman of the 
board, said that a meeting would take place. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospects of Ueberroth's bid going through, Borman said: 
"We'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Borman was the chairman of Eastern for several years before being forced out 
three years ago, when Lorenzo bought the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board of Airline Pilots Assn. met in Miami Wednesday and 
continued to express guarded optimism that the Ueberroth deal would be 
consummated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Await Court Decision 
</P>
<P>
The pilots and other parties involved in the Eastern strike anxiously were 
awaiting word on the decision of U.S. Bankruptcy trustee Harold Jones on his 
choice of a bankruptcy examiner. Earlier this week, he indicated that he would 
make his recommendation to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland by early 
next week, perhaps as early as today. The list of candidates includes former 
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and securities fraud lawyer Leon Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davis will hold a hearing in Miami today in 
response to a motion by Eastern seeking to compel its pilots to return to work. 
Eastern contends that the pilots are waging a strike of their own, not merely 
honoring the picket lines of the striking machinists. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of Eastern's 3,600 pilots have been observing the picket lines since 
the strike began and this has forced Eastern to cancel about 90% of its 
flights. The company began training a new class of pilots this week. There are 
just 35 recruits enrolled in the six-week course.
