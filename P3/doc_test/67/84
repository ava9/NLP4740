pan-continental networks to give the single market an infrastructure

If the European Commission has a big idea these days, it is trans-European
networks. The bruising struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the
near-collapse of the exchange rate mechanism last year may have knocked
monetary union off course. But across Brussels, dozens of Eurocrats are
beavering away at the next ambitious programme for European integration: a
plan to develop transport, energy and telecommunications networks spanning
the continent.
The initiative was launched with much fanfare last December by Commission
president Jacques Delors. His white paper on Europe's competitiveness listed
a large number of new railway, road, telecommunications, gas, electricity,
airport and port projects that would knit Europe's far-flung regions with
the core of the European Union, and provide an infrastructure backbone for
the single market. The networks would also extend beyond the Union into
European Free Trade Association countries and eastern Europe.
The programme's total cost is put at Ecu400bn (Pounds 300bn) by the end of
the century. Of this, Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for
telecommunications and Ecu30bn for energy.
Leaders at last December's Brussels summit gave the initiative a qualified
go-ahead. They approved the overall thrust, but not specific details - in
particular Commission plans for financing the programme.
Now the Commission's challenge is to refine its plans and win over the
doubters. A crucial role will be played by Mr Henning Christophersen, the
economics commissioner, who will today chair the second meeting of a
taskforce consisting of high-level officials from each member state. The
group will hear new Commission ideas on how the initiative could be
financed. It will also discuss which transport and energy projects should
receive priority.
A parallel taskforce, consisting of telecommunications users, operators and
manufacturers, is being chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner. It will look at how an advanced telecommunications
infrastructure - which would be needed if, say, 'teleworking' from home was
to become much more common - can be developed. The Commission is anxious
that Europe does not fall behind the US, where the Clinton administration is
trying to encourage the construction of such 'information superhighways'.
Meanwhile, officials from more than half a dozen Commission directorates are
working on detailed aspects of the trans-European networks initiative. Both
the Christophersen and Bangemann groups will present progress reports to the
next European summit in Corfu in June.
The reason the initiative was launched was belief in Brussels that European
businesses and consumers are disadvantaged because networks have developed
on national rather than transnational lines. 'Networks were designed to
satisfy the European nation states of the 19th century,' says Mr
Christophersen.
There are many examples of what Commission officials see as anomalies:
cross-border phone calls cost three times as much as domestic calls of a
similar distance; air travellers can face long delays because poorly
co-ordinated national air traffic control systems cannot handle as many
flights as a single unified system; Italian lorries thunder through the
Rhine Valley on their way to Rotterdam because Italy's ports are not modern
enough; and there are as yet no high-speed rail links between national
capitals.
Enthusiasm in Brussels is one thing; winning the necessary support - and
finance - from member states is quite another. The general idea that
fragmented networks damage Europe's competitiveness has widespread
acceptance. That was why an article was written into the Maastricht treaty
giving the Commission authority to draw up proposals for trans-European
networks and promote their development.
But there is still much debate about three big questions. Are all the
projects identified by the Commission really necessary? Will the Union need
to subsidise the networks or can investment be left to member states and
private companies? Will the networks develop faster and more efficiently if
traditional national monopolies in telecommunications, energy and transport
are abolished?
Doubts over the list of projects stem largely from the way they have been
chosen. The Commission asked member states to propose candidates and then
collated the suggestions into master plans. But because favoured projects
may qualify for EU subsidies, each government had an incentive to get as
many of its national projects as possible included.
The initiative is viewed in some quarters as the next European gravy train.
'It is about money,' admits a transport official in one member state.
This explains why the programme's cost has reached a staggering Ecu400bn. It
also explains why the list includes projects which appear to be of mainly
national, rather than pan-European, benefit. For example, the master plan
for trans-European roads - consisting of 55,000km of roads, 12,000km of them
motorways - is largely an amalgamation of existing national road plans.
Officials argue that, even when infrastructure is confined to a single
member state, it may be of broader European interest for two reasons:
Spill-over effects. For example, Ireland has an interest in motorways being
built across England and Wales so its traffic can have easy access to the
Channel tunnel. Equally, a planned railway from Rotterdam to the border with
Germany will be more profitable if Germany continues the line into its
industrial Ruhr region.
Incompatible standards. For example, trains travelling from Sweden to
Denmark have to switch to a different electricity system. Similarly, many
advanced telecommunications services such as electronic mail systems do not
interconnect smoothly across borders.
The Commission believes it can play a useful role in co-ordinating
investment plans across frontiers. One way of achieving this could be for
the Commission to hold roundtable discussions for particular projects to
identify what is stopping them moving ahead. The Commission would then knock
heads together to remove the blockages.
A prime candidate would be air-traffic control, says Mr Robert Coleman, head
of the Commission's transport directorate. National air-traffic controllers
have been discussing harmonising their systems for years without much
progress. The new powers in the Maastricht treaty would allow aviation
ministers to vote on a common approach and then make it stick.
Mr Christophersen admits that not every project in the overall programme is
equally important. But he says the Commission has already made a preliminary
selection of priority projects which cost only Ecu160bn. His taskforce will
further refine priorities.
Examples of the priority projects include: high-speed rail links between
London, Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam at a total cost of Ecu8.5bn;
a motorway from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw costing Ecu3.2bn; and a new
Athens airport costing Ecu2bn.
Even if agreement is reached on priorities, the financing of the new
networks will remain controversial. In his white paper, Mr Delors argued
that the Union would need to provide Ecu20bn a year in subsidies and loans.
Of this, Ecu5bn would come from the Union's cohesion and structural funds.
These channel aid to Europe's poorest regions and countries: in particular,
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. This money has already been earmarked
in the Union's budget.
A further Ecu7bn, Mr Delors suggested, could be raised by loans from the
European Investment Bank. The final Ecu8bn would be raised on the financial
markets by the Commission and then lent to governments or private companies.
This last proposal, for what were dubbed 'Union Bonds', caused particular
controversy at the Brussels summit. Germany and the UK criticised it on the
grounds that borrowing by the Commission would offer governments a back-door
route to avoiding public expenditure disciplines.
The critics were also concerned that the Commission's AAA credit rating in
financial markets might be damaged if it made large loans to countries with
poorer credit ratings, such as Greece and Italy. They said that, if more
money for infrastructure investment was needed, it should come from the EIB
which has a track record in project finance.
These objections have caused the Commission to beat a tactical retreat. Mr
Christophersen says Union Bonds are just one of several financial
instruments that could boost infrastructure investment.
Mr Enrico Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, suggests
other possibilities:
Bonds, issued by the Commission but linked to particular road, rail, air or
maritime traffic projects. Coupons paid to investors might depend on the
volume of traffic the project attracts. Loan guarantees by the Commission.
These could be used for those parts of a network located outside the Union
such as motorways or telecommunications lines extending into eastern Europe.
Although the Commission is no longer pushing Union Bonds as the main option,
the thinking behind the other ideas remains the same: the Commission could
use its AAA status to cut borrowing costs for countries with lower credit
ratings. The benefit for states such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark
could be the equivalent of between half and one percentage point off
interest rates, says Mr Cioffi. But such proposals could run into the same
opposition from member states as Union Bonds.
Part of the Ecu20bn envisaged by Mr Delors could be provided as direct
subsidies to projects, though the Commission has yet to spell out how this
might work. Subsidies would not necessarily be limited to regions that
already qualify for structural and cohesion funds.
Some member states, however, are worried that such handouts could be a waste
of public money. They could merely lead to the construction of grandiose
projects with little economic benefit.
Whatever is decided on Union funding, there is a consensus that national
budgets are so strapped that the bulk of the money for trans-European
networks will have to come from the private sector. This raises the question
of whether a bigger push is needed to privatise and liberalise monopoly
sectors.
There are sharp differences between member states over liberalisation. The
UK has traditionally led the free-market group, while France has supported
the continuation of public-sector monopolies.
Within the Commission, there are similar, though less sharp, differences.
Most officials agree that liberalisation would help the trans-European
network initiative, but they differ over whether the Commission needs to do
more than it is already doing.
The liberal camp believes that national monopolies in transport,
telecommunications and energy are the root cause of fragmented networks.
Public-sector monopolies have little incentive to look beyond their national
frontiers, while their monopoly status has prevented private operators
building transnational links instead.
Those who hold this view point to the US, where transcontinental networks
and competitive markets go hand in hand. In particular, they say a lesson is
to be learnt from the Clinton administration which is seeking to develop US
information superhighways by liberalising the telecommunications and cable
television industries, rather than pumping in government money.
Abolishing monopolies would allow private investment to flow into
infrastructure projects. Priorities would be chosen on economic criteria as
companies sought out the most profitable opportunities. There would also be
less need to co-ordinate investment as operators would be free to range
across boundaries.
'The big issue is lifting the restrictions. That is the only way of
mobilising the investment,' says Mr Herbert Ungerer, who runs the
Commission's telecommunications policy unit.
But others say that liberalisation is not the complete story. For a start,
it is harder to apply the approach in loss-making sectors such as railways
and roads than in profitable sectors such as telecommunications and energy.
Moreover, even in a liberalised market there would be a need for
co-ordinated investment and harmonised standards.
Such issues will have to be addressed by EU member states in the next few
months, if the foundations of trans-European networks are to be laid before
the end of the century. With the future of European competitiveness at
stake, there is already some impetus behind the plans. But if the
trans-European network initiative is really to gather momentum, members will
have to overcome any qualms they may have about a fresh commitment to
working together on a pan-continental scale.
