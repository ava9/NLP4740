FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap approach rebuffed by Trans World

The board of Trans World Communications yesterday rebuffed an approach from
Emap, the media and exhibitions group, for a recommended takeover that would
have valued the commercial radio group at about Pounds 70m.
The statement came after last week's announcement that Emap, which already
owns 30 per cent of Trans World, had an agreement giving it until June 22 to
buy at 181p a share the 22 per cent stake owned by Mr Owen Oyston.
The six members of the 10-strong Trans World board who did not exclude
themselves from the decision concluded that the premium on offer was not
high enough.
The board also expressed concern that the deal could face a legal challenge.
A full Emap takeover of Trans World would breach the legal limit on the
number and size of commercial radio licences which can be held by one
company.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, has agreed 'an ownership
structure' that could be put in place for part of Emap's existing radio
interests to enable it to comply with the rules.
The directors of Guardian Media, publishers of The Guardian, which owns 20
per cent of Trans World, separately made it clear yesterday that it was
considering a legal challenge to the ownership arrangements.
The Trans World board said yesterday that the 181p price represented a
premium of 5 per cent over the 172.3p average of marked bargains on the day
before the Emap announcement.
The board also emphasised yesterday that under the City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers, Emap's statement that it would not increase its 181p offer was
now binding.
Emap declined to comment yesterday, although it is clear that if, as seems
likely, it decides to go ahead with its purchase of the Oyston stake before
tomorrow's deadline, it will hold a majority of the company.
That in turn could lead to considerable uncertainty if there is a legal
challenge.
For now the Trans World directors urged shareholders to take no action at
the moment.
