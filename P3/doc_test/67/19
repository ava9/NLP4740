rating is an industry in its own right

THE business information market has expanded significantly over the past
decade. New players have emerged to challenge the old-established groups and
the demand for ever-faster credit decisions has both pushed and been pushed
by rapid technological change.
At the same time, only a tiny percentage of commercial sales decisions are
taken on the basis of information provided by an outside credit rating
agency. The challenge for the industry is two-fold: to convince more
businesses of the need for properly informed sales decisions and to refine
the technology to make this possible.
'Credit vetting should start at the sales stage,' says Mr Philip Mellor,
marketing manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International (D&amp;B), which claims to
be the largest provider of business information in the UK. 'The sales force
will become disillusioned if it takes an order which is not accepted by the
credit control department. Consider that the average cost of a sales call is
Pounds 150.'
'A credit control policy should enable the sales people to concentrate on
customers who will be the most profitable,' says Mr Brian Bailey, managing
director of UAPT-Infolink. 'Yet often this is hampered by a conflict between
the sales director and the finance director.'
If these barriers can be broken down the potential for the business
information providers is enormous. Only one in 15 commercial sales decisions
is taken with help of 'third party' information, calculates Mr Mellor. Mr
Bailey puts the figure at 'a few percent'.
The reason for this reluctance may lie in the availability of business
information in the UK from one central source, Companies House. Compare this
with continental Europe where company information is often lodged with local
chambers of commerce or even the US, where relatively few companies - 17,000
against 900,000 in the UK - are required to file returns.
But the value of this information may be more apparent than real, the
business information groups claim. Companies House data can be up to 15
months out of date. In boom times, let alone a recession, this delay can
conceal payment problems at a company.
Fortunately for the credit rating industry demand for credit information
comes not just from the corporate end-user but from a host of
intermediaries, financial groups such as finance and leasing companies,
factors and the credit insurers. Although they collect a great deal of
information themselves they provide a ready market for the services of the
information companies.
The task for the information provider is to collect the published
information available - company reports, county court judgments, directors'
disqualifications - and to supplement this with unpublished information on
the past payments performance of companies and individuals. Where the
information companies add value is in bringing this disparate information
together in a single credit report and, even more important, interpreting it
for their customers.
It has been in the market for consumer information where the most rapid
growth occurred during the 1980s. Increasing affluence led to a rise in the
purchase, on credit, of expensive consumer durables such as video players,
cars and boats. At the same time the deregulation of financial markets meant
that many more financial products, also involving long-term financial
commitments on the part of the purchaser, became available.
Unlike the commercial sector there was often very little information
available on the ability of the private individual to meet his credit
commitments. And whereas a supplier could take security on the assets of a
company or the personal assets of its directors there was less security
available when granting credit to a private individual.
Some of the information providers have their origins in serving the consumer
market, providing information to mail order houses, for example, while
others come from a commercial background. As time has gone by commercial
pressures have forced the larger groups to provide both sorts of
information, either by collecting it themselves or by establishing links
with companies which could fill the gaps in their portfolio.
There are considerable benefits from being able to provide both commercial
and consumer information, says UAPT-Infolink's Mr Bailey. 'With new
companies which do not have a trading record it is important to be able to
flip over into our personal database with information on directors.'
UAPT-Infolink claims to be the oldest UK credit information organisation,
tracing its origins back to 1842 and the foundation of the London
Association for the Protection of Trade, a mutual association of traders to
exchange information about their customers. Amalgamations turned the London
association into a united association or UAPT in 1965.
The other main players in the business information market have also
broadened their scope. D&amp;B has established links with Equifax Europe (UK), a
consumer information group, while CCN which started out providing consumer
information, now offers commercial information services. ICC Information
Group specialised at an early stage in the financial analysis of companies
and industry sectors and still provides a range of City-oriented services
but it too offers credit checking information.
The information collected by these organisations is available in many forms,
in hard copy, print, by post, telephone, fax, viewdata or computer link-up.
Increasingly information is required immediately to permit a sales decision,
so on-line services have grown in importance.
Customers with a heavy demand for information may take out a subscription
while those with only intermittent need for information may buy one-off
reports. Some customers may require a detailed financial report while others
may make do with a quick credit assessment. 'We have a modular system which
allows us to carry out checks to different levels of detail depending on the
risk,' says Mr Kevin Still, marketing manager of UAPT-Infolink.
Some of the information groups provide a written summary of the company
being assessed while others have devised short-hand codes to convey a credit
rating.
The result of all this work on compilation and analysis has been to make
information much more readily available to a broad range of users. 'The
small firm can now exploit information which would have only been available
to the bigger company 10 years ago,' says Mr Bruno Tavernier, a director of
ICC.
