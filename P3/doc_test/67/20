FT  02 DEC 93 / MMC recommends curbs on Stagecoach

The Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled yesterday that the acquisition
by Stagecoach Holdings, the fast-growing bus company, of a bus depot in
Lancaster could operate against the public interest.
It recommended that Stagecoach should give undertakings limiting its ability
to retaliate against new bus operators entering the market.
Perth-based Stagecoach said the commission had not found evidence that it
had restricted competition, and it would be happy to hold discussions with
the Office of Fair Trading. The operations affected by the report produced
revenues of less than Pounds 2m out of the company's total Pounds 175m
turnover.
The reference to the monopolies commission arose after Stagecoach bought a
bus depot and 12 buses from Lancaster City Transport in August for Pounds
700,000. Stagecoach, which feared that a bid for the entire company would
prompt a monopolies reference, offered more for the depot than other bidders
had offered for the entire company, and the municipally owned bus company
subsequently went into voluntary liquidation.
The OFT will seek undertakings from Stagecoach that if it reduces fares or
increases its bus frequencies to fight off competition, it will not
subsequently raise fares or reduce services if the competitor withdraws. It
will also attempt to gain an agreement that it will not introduce a more
frequent service than a new competitor on any route.
Mr Derek Scott, Stagecoach finance director, said: 'We are very frustrated
at the inquiry because we have been investing and we have not put up fares.
The undertakings they want are for the most part not unreasonable.
'We are unhappy about not being able to run a more frequent service than
competitors. That seems to be re-regulating what has been de-regulated.'
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report is the fourth on Stagecoach in
three years and OFT is also investigating allegations of anti-competitive
behaviour by the company's Fife Scottish Omnibuses subsidiary.
Mr Scott said: 'It seems a lot, but there are 400 bus company complaints a
year to the OFT. We have 6 per cent of the bus market and regard it as an
occupational hazard.'
