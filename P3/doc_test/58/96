ERCROS, Spain's largest chemicals, fertilisers, mining and explosives
company, has reached an agreement in principle with Freeport McMoRan of the
US under which Ercros would spin off its troubled fertiliser and mining
divisions into a new company controlled by the US chemicals group.
The Spanish government is likely to insist that the agreement include a cash
injection by Freeport of up to Dollars 350m into Ercros's loss-making
fertiliser operation, Fesa-Enfersa, and its copper mining company, Rio Tinto
Minera (RTM).
Under the agreement, announced in Madrid last night, Ercros will transfer
these assets into a new holding company in which Freeport will hold 51 per
cent. Ercros said the deal would only go ahead if the government supported
it.
The Torras group, the main Spanish investment vehicle of the Kuwait
Investment Office (KIO), is Ercros' largest shareholder with 40 per cent. A
group of investors led by the Catalan financier, Mr Javier de la Rosa, who
is KIO's chief adviser in Spain, has another 20 per cent. About 35 per cent
of Ercros is traded on the stock market.
The Spanish government takes a close interest in Ercros because the company
has a virtual monopoly in fertilisers in the country. Two years ago, it
merged its businesses with the fertiliser operations of INI, the state
holding company.
The government also became involved in the late 1980s when Torras bid for
the then Union Explosivos Rio Tinto (ERT), a leading supplier of explosives.
Torras merged ERT with its Cros fertiliser group to form Ercros.
Ercros has found it almost impossible to make the most of its control of the
fertiliser market in Spain. Losses in the fertiliser division accounted for
more than 80 per cent of its Pta16bn (Dollars 153.47m) pre-tax loss last
year.
Madrid has insisted that if more of Ercros were to be sold, it would have to
be done by finding an industrial partner.
Freeport is a leading producer of phosphates and natural gas used in
fertiliser production and will be able to supply Fesa more cheaply.
