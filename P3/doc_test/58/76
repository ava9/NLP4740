THE French threat to veto the EC-US farm accord has caused concern among the
European partners but something close to anguish in Spain.
Officials in Madrid, who need no reminding of Spain's close trading and
political links with France, are shocked by what they view as a veiled
threat issued by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, when he
addressed the parliament in Paris on Wednesday night.
Mr Beregovoy said France had backed Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece when
they sought increased funding that would narrow economic imbalances within
the EC and that France therefore counted on the solidarity of these
governments when essential French interests were at stake.
The Spanish government is torn between its desire for a Gatt agreement, and
its fears of discord both within the Community and with the US provoked by
the threatened French veto. Spain's discomfort is made all the more acute
because it is counting on French support for an agreement on the EC's Delors
II package, which includes budgetary provisions for cohesion funds, at the
Edinburgh summit next month.
'The Spanish government is in a quandary,' an EC diplomat in Madrid said
yesterday.
The Spanish Foreign Ministry said Spain saw the EC accord with the US as
'very important' and perceived any veto as 'extremely serious'. Spain has
far more to gain than to lose from the compromise because it has never
subsidised its farming to the extent that France has and because, as a
latecomer to the EC in 1986, it has never been a significant beneficiary of
the Common Agricultural Policy.
France, the recipient of more than 20 per cent of Spanish exports, is
nevertheless Spain's main trading partner. France is also a key player in
the Spanish economy, where it is present in strength in sectors ranging from
insurance and distribution to petrol refining and car manufacturing.
The economic ties have moreover been cemented over the years by increasing
political links.
In addition to French backing for expansionary EC budgets, the Madrid
government has in the past sought close French co-operation in its struggle
to contain cross-border Basque terrorism.
Lately Madrid has been counting on France to support its bid for increased
Brussels funding in North Africa so as to stem the stream of immigrants.
Caught in a web of conflicting interests, Madrid fervently hopes for an EC
compromise that will satisfy Mr Beregovoy and save Spain the pain of taking
sides.
