  [Excerpts] According to an agreement reached with UN 
observers, the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front have agreed 
to the evacuation of foreigners who are still in the country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Javier Solana informed the Senate about the 
evacuation of Spanish citizens. 
  [Begin Solana recording] According to the latest information 
I have at my disposal, right now I can say that about 25 
Spaniards are on the verge of leaving, a certain number have 
already left, and there are 25 ready to leave. I think that 
they will be able to leave at 1400. That is the mainly good 
news I can give, but as I say, overall it is a bad picture 
because the situation in Rwanda is still very unpleasant, very 
bad. [end recording] 
  The Spanish Government is in permanent contact with France 
and Belgium, the countries which are coordinating the evacuation 
of nationals. Spain has offered two Hercules transport planes 
to help with the evacuation. So a unit of the Legion's special 
operations group is on stand-by should it be needed.
