  [Text] Harare, 15 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina, who is currently in Harare, reacted with 
annoyance to the Spanish Government's demand that Cuba free six 
political prisoners before Robaina's next visit to Madrid in 
March. 
  "We do not make visits conditional upon someone being 
released," the Cuban foreign minister told AFP upon arriving in 
Harare, the third leg of his African tour. 
  He declared that he was not aware of Madrid's effort but 
added: "I believe there is someone interested in certain cases 
in Spain." 
  "The Spanish leaders have enough relations and experience to 
know how we have studied and treated this type of case in recent 
years," Robaina continued. "First, it would be necessary for me 
to personally receive their request so I can later tell them 
what I think of it." 
  Last Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana gave 
Isabel Allende, Cuban deputy foreign relations minister, a list 
of prisoners accompanied by a request for their release. 
Allende is on a working tour of Spain.
