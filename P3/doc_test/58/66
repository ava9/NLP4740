  [Text] His Excellency Arturo Avello Diez del Corral, 
ambassador of Spain to Equatorial Guinea, returned to Malabo on 
2 January from Madrid with a message from Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez to President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Spanish 
envoy, who was called for consultations by his government, left 
for Spain on 12 December following the expulsion of the Spanish 
consul in Bata. The consul was declared persona non grata after 
holding an eight-hour meeting on 10 December with the political 
parties that did not take part in the 21 November legislative 
elections. At the meeting, the Spanish consul supported [words 
indistinct] of violence likely to jeopardize the order, peace, 
and tranquility prevailing in the country. Despite this act, 
considered as interference and a provocation, the Equatorial 
Guinean Government has continued to maintain good relations with 
Spain since that country decided unilaterally to (?reduce) its 
cooperation with Equatorial Guinea. This decision was followed 
by the departure of a large number of Spanish technical staff 
from our country. The Equatorial Guinean people, who are aware 
of the importance of the ties between them and Spain, hope that 
the contents of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's message are 
positive and promising. In fact, that is the wish of all the 
sons of this country.
