THE European fighter aircraft (EFA) suffered its second setback in as many
days yesterday when the Spanish government suggested that it, too, had
serious doubts about the jet's production costs.
The mood in Madrid threatens to undermine Britain's efforts to salvage the
Pounds 20bn project, whose future was thrown in doubt on Tuesday when
Germany decided not to go ahead with production preparations next year.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is said to have expressed
'understanding' of Germany's decision when he met Chancellor Helmut Kohl
privately at the EC summit in Lisbon last month.
Further evidence of Madrid's concerns about the EFA came yesterday in a
statement from the Defence Ministry, which said that while Spain was
contractually obliged to complete the development stage of the aircraft, 'it
supports a reduction in the costs of each aircraft by way of cutting
technical specifications and the total cost of the project.'
The government would need a great deal of persuading to proceed with Italy
and Britain on producing the original aircraft, officials suggest.
Spain may try to mediate between the remaining partners and Germany over a
compromise that cuts costs significantly.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has proposed a lighter and simpler
version.
The Spanish Defence Ministry said that while it sympathised with industry's
interest in the project, budgetary considerations were paramount.
A sharp clash is now certain with the state-owned aerospace company, Casa,
which has vowed to build EFA with its two remaining EFA partners, even if
this increases Spain's 13 per cent share of the project.
But Madrid, facing economic slowdown, a 55 per cent rise in its budget
deficit for the first five months of 1992, and a 60 per cent rise in its
current account deficit, is urgently reviewing spending plans.
Mr Gonzalez believes Spain has not been involved in the most sophisticated
parts of the EFA, and participation in a cheaper aircraft would not greatly
undermine Spanish companies involved in the project.
