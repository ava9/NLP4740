  [Text] Salamanca, Spain, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico and 
Spain will ask that the UN Security Council be enlarged and that 
its organizations vary their appointments to allow continuing 
democratization efforts, it was reported here today. 
  This is the main agreement of the 18 reached at the Seventh 
Mexican-Spanish Inter-Parliamentary Meeting, after three days of 
work in Salamanca, northeastern Spain. With the approval of 
these agreements, political and legislative ties between both 
countries are expected to increase. 
  Both countries revealed their increasing initiatives in 
international politics by calling for changes in the UN Security 
Council to democratize its function and for it to reflect not 
only geopolitical criteria but economic and social issues too. 
They agreed to provide more institutional follow-up to the 
Ibero-American summits of chiefs of state and governments to 
further regional and transatlantic integration. The 
parliamentarians agreed to expedite the ratification of 
agreements to avoid double taxation, fight monetary fraud, 
provide reciprocal guarantees for investments, and speed 
negotiations for the modification of the bilateral extradition 
treaty. 
  The delegates agreed that beginning with this meeting, Spain 
will increasingly become a representative for Mexico and Latin 
America before the European Union and that Mexico will do the 
same for Spain and Europe in North America. 
  Juan Jose Laborda Martin, the leader of the Spanish 
delegation and Senate president, also highlighted the points of 
agreement between the two countries in issues related to 
internal policies. "Our two nations are working intensely to 
achieve greater clarity in the implementation of democracy by 
doing all we can to further reflect the will of the people and 
not that of pressure groups," Laborda stated. "Mexico and Spain 
agree it is illogical that countries like Japan and Germany be 
excluded from the Security Council. We believe in a unipolar 
world. The UN needs to strengthen itself as a sphere of 
supranational authority," Laborda, senator of the governing 
Spanish Socialist Workers Party, said. 
  In a news conference after the close of the meeting, Saul 
Gonzalez Herrera, president of the Mexican delegation and 
senator from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, underscored 
the importance that "legislators should give to their efforts at 
the summits of chiefs of state and governments to boost 
improvements in the Ibero-American integration process." 
  Initially, the two delegations had been scheduled to discuss 
the issue of Cuba's future in the Ibero-American community and 
the role that Mexico and Spain could play to counter U.S. 
pressure on the island. Although the issue was not included in 
the final communique, Laborda told NOTIMEX "it is not something 
we have forgotten about." "Cuba must be helped to equalize the 
political and economic situation -- while maintaining its 
sovereignty -- of its government. We do not agree with the 
embargo or with the future of the island being dictated by a 
minority in the United States," Laborda indicated. Gonzalez 
Herrera emphasized that "Cuba's problems will not be solved by a 
blockade. Mexico has always favored Cuban self-determination 
and hopes that this unilateral attitude will be overcome."
