FT  07 JUL 92 / Sharp split in Spain: Government and industry disagree about
the costs and benefits of the aircraft

Germany's decision not to participate in the prod-uction phase of the
European Fighter Aircraft project has exposed sharp divisions between the
Spanish govern-ment and the country's aerospace industry.
Immediately after a majority of the German government coalition decided last
week not to include production funds in the budget for next year, Casa, the
state-owned Spanish aerospace group and the lead EFA contractor in the
country, announced it was determined to go ahead with the project even if it
meant assuming new costs.
For Casa and the Spanish aircraft industry, the EFA is vital; the project
has already involved large transfers of technology to Spain, particularly in
composite materials. A joint venture with Rolls-Royce to build EFA engines
in the politically unstable and economically deprived Basque region is also
dependent on the project going ahead intact.
By the time the German decision had been made, however, Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
Spain's prime minister, was already entertaining serious doubts about
whether Spain would stay in the project.
Mindful of the strains being placed on the economy by a 55 per cent growth
in the government deficit this year, the defence ministry warned the
aerospace industry that budgetary considerations would be paramount when it
came to deciding whether, or how, to proceed with production.
Last week, the defence ministry said that Spain, which has a 13 per cent
share of the project, wanted to cut the costs of the aircraft by changing
EFA's technical specifications and cutting the cost of the overall project.
The ministry added that it hoped it would be possible to build a
pan-European aircraft to replace its ageing Mirage F/1 air defence aircraft.
In addition to the costs of the EFA, Spain has also been uncomfortable about
the absence from the project of France, its most important European economic
and political partner.
Last week, after meeting Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, in
Madrid, Mr Gonzalez said he had invited France to consider rejoining some
form of project to build a European fighter. 'The project has changed since
it was begun,' he said, 'and it would be advisable to adapt it to the new
(international political) situation.'
For the moment, however, Madrid is unlikely to make any precipitate
unilateral decision over its future participation in the project. Spain will
probably use the next round of discussions with its EFA partners to try to
find some common ground between Germany's wish for a cheaper and lighter
aircraft and Britain's desire to proceed with the original project.
Should Spain be forced to choose between producing the original aircraft
with just two remaining partners or to drop out of production, current
budgetary restraints make it likely that it would be forced to take the the
latter course of action.
