  [Text] After his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in Washington, Spanish Foreign Minister 
Javier Solana underlined the normality of relations between the 
United States and Spain. 
  Solana said that during their meeting they covered the 
international situation and more specifically the situation in 
Bosnia and the EU [European Union] enlargement process. 
  Solana underlined that the Spanish Government is very 
concerned with the reconstruction process in Bosnia. Solana 
briefed Christopher about the EU enlargement process and added 
that the recent agreement concerning minority voting rights is a 
balanced compromise that allows the defense of Spain's 
interests. 
  Furthermore, Solana -- who is traveling on to Egypt and 
Lebanon next week -- said that the latest events in the Middle 
East meant that the peace process was going to go through a 
difficult phase. 
  Solana and Christopher also discussed various Latin American 
issues. 
  In his statements to the press in Washington, Solana said 
that the Spanish Government is awaiting an official announcement 
from the Algerian Government about its apparent decision to 
extend its territorial waters to 53 miles and to increase 
pressure on foreign boats fishing illegally in its waters. 
  The Spanish foreign minister underlined that there is no 
actual or specific Algerian document saying what this means and 
that he would rather not comment until an official declaration 
from the Algerian Government was available. Then, he added, we 
will give an appropriate answer. 
  Meanwhile, Vincente Albero, the Spanish agriculture, 
fisheries, and food minister, said that although the government 
was awaiting more information about the measure, it had told the 
European Commission about Algeria's decision to extend its 
territorial waters toward the Spanish coast.
