  [Text] Madrid, 24 Mar (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president 
of the Cuban Council of State, has described as positive his 
working visit that concluded today in this capital city. During 
the visit he met with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and other 
high-ranking members of the Spanish Government. 
  Likewise, in exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage 
expressed his satisfaction with the current state of relations 
between Cuba and Spain. 
  The high-ranking Cuban official explained the meeting with 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, which lasted an hour and 
a half, allowed him to provide an in-depth depiction of Cuba's 
current situation and the measures implemented on the island as 
well as to analyze bilateral relations. 
  It was also an opportunity to evaluate Spanish investment 
opportunities and perspectives in Cuba and the possibility of 
expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields. 
  During his four-day stay, Lage carried out a very tight 
agenda, which included meetings with Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana, Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, and Commerce 
and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez Navarro, as well as with Jose 
Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for cooperation. 
  Lage also met with Carlos Solchaga, president of the Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party parliamentary bloc and former economy 
minister. The Cuban official also met with Rafael Portaencasa, 
rector of the Madrid Polytechnic University. 
  We appreciate these meetings and working sessions giving us 
the opportunity to explain the our efforts and how difficult it 
is for us to progress amid U.S. pressures against other 
governments and investors, Lage stated. 
  Likewise, these contacts, he added, allow us to enlighten 
Spanish authorities on the expected Cuban successes in the near 
future in certain fields. 
  According to Lage, this exchange of ideas and opinions is 
also useful, because it offers the opportunity to provide more 
information abroad about the country's progression. 
  Lage explained his visit to Madrid follows a visit by Jose 
Luis Rodriguez, Cuban minister president of the State Committee 
for Finance, who met with representatives of Spain's financial 
institutions last week to discuss technical issues. 
  He said talks with financial institutions from Spain and 
other nations have been taking place for several months now, 
because Cuba is confronting a totally new situation in which it 
must adopt economic measures. In this respect, Cuba is ready to 
assimilate experiences and knowledge from other nations. 
  We are aware conditions are different, because, first of 
all, 
in our case they are occurring within a socialist context; 
second, because Cuba's economic adaptation is taking place amid 
the U.S. economic blockade, the Council of State vice president 
explained. 
  In expressing an opinion on the results of his agenda during 
the past days, Lage said it allowed an interesting exchange of 
ideas with the leaders of the Spanish Government, which, in his 
opinion, is important in many ways. 
  In this respect, he cited, among other aspects, the 
magnitude 
of economic exchange, bilateral cooperation, the possibility of 
expanding the historic closeness between Cuba and Spain, and the 
affinity as well as affection between both countries. 
  Finally, Lage said this contact with the Madrid Government 
is 
not an isolated occurrence, rather, something that will continue 
to ensure greater dialogue and economic exchange between Cuba 
and Spain.
