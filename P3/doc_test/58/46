  [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Isabel Allende today 
described the bilateral relations between Cuba and Spain as good 
and constructive. Vice Foreign Minister Allende who is on a 
working visit to Spain said that, as in every relation, the 
parties involved have differing views on some topics, but the 
important thing is the attitude assumed to overcome the 
differences and difficulties. During her stay in Madrid, Isabel 
Allende met with high-ranking Spanish Foreign Ministry officials 
with whom she discussed bilateral matters such as the progress 
being made by the joint scientific and cultural and technical 
and industrial commissions. Allende also talked about Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming trip to Spain. 
Robaina was been invited to visit the country by his Spanish 
counterpart, Javier Solana. 
  Many Madrid newspapers today reported on Vice Foreign 
Minister Allende's visit to Spain. The fact that the newspapers 
covered Allende's visit has been interpreted as a sign of 
interest in the island which has opened up to foreign 
investment, mainly Spain's. In response to questions asked by 
reporters about the blockade, Allende said that this U.S. 
measure against Cuba is illegal, that it violates international 
laws, and denies the precepts of a market economy, which is 
based on freedom of trade, enterprise, and navigation. Allende 
also admitted that since President Bill Clinton assumed office, 
a less aggressive language toward Cuba has been evidenced; 
however, this does not mean that their policy toward the island 
will change. Allende, who is currently visiting the Cuban 
consulates in Barcelona, Vigo, and Sevilla, will return to the 
island next week.
