  [Excerpts] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has held 
a joint news conference with the president of Hungary, who is 
continuing his official visit to Spain. Felipe Gonzalez said 
that Spain will support the process of Hungary's integration 
into the European Union once the corresponding period of 
adaptation has passed. 
  Asked about a possible withdrawal of the Spanish blue 
helmets 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia if the conflict worsens, 
Felipe Gonzalez said the Spanish Government will not make a 
unilateral decision on this, but rather in the context of the 
commitment agreed with its partners in the European Union. He 
said, however, that security measures are envisaged and 
expressed his hope that the situation will improve. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the news conference on the occasion of the Hungarian 
president's visit, Prime Minister Gonzalez said he is against 
sending more reinforcements of blue helmets to the city of 
Sarajevo, as requested by General Rose. However, he is not 
opposed to a change of position by the Spanish blue helmets. 
Here is what he said: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] In Bosnia I have to say that the 
effort for us is at the limit of our possibilities from the 
human point of view -- you know this well. I have said as much 
on a number of other occasions. A change in our deployment in 
the territory can always be studied, if it were useful, but for 
the time being that is not a question which has been raised. We 
occupy a place in the territory of great importance from all 
points of view, but, naturally, we are open to cooperating with 
the other UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in whatever is 
necessary. [end recording]
