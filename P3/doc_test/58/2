  [Text] Carlos Lage, vice president of Cuba's Council of 
State, has expressed his satisfaction with the state of 
relations between Cuba and Spain. The Cuban diplomat assessed 
his visit to Madrid, which concluded on 24 March, as positive. 
During the visit Lage met with Felipe Gonzalez, head of the 
Spanish Government, and other Spanish Government figures. 
  During his meeting with Gonzalez, which lasted an hour and a 
half, Lage explained in detail Cuba's situation and the measures 
being applied. The two men also analyzed bilateral relations. 
Lage said that the meetings held with the Spanish ministers of 
foreign relations, economics and finance, and commerce and 
tourism, as well as with other high-ranking officials, allowed 
those officials to better understand the efforts being made in 
Cuba and the difficulty of making progress amidst U.S. pressure 
on other governments and businessmen. 
  Lage's presence in Madrid permitted an evaluation of the 
prospects for Spanish investments in Cuba and the possibilities 
of expanding bilateral cooperation in divers spheres.
