  [Text] The heads of state and government participating in 
the fourth Latin American summit are taking advantage of their 
meeting in Cartagena de Indias to hold bilateral meetings. 
Cuban President Fidel Castro has expressed his interest in 
meeting with Felipe Gonzalez. Juan Luis Diaz Prats reports from 
Colombia: 
  [Diaz Prats] King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez have held separate meetings with other leaders 
attending the fourth Latin American summit. The king received 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle, and Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres. King 
Juan Carlos was interested in the situation in Chile and Costa 
Rica and in Central America. He said he regretted having to 
delay until next year his official visit to Uruguay, a country 
which has begun the electoral process. 
  Gonzalez held meetings with the presidents of Colombia, 
Uruguay, and Honduras. The summit agenda was discussed during 
these meetings, but so was the situation in Cuba. Cuban 
President Castro has asked to speak to Gonzalez at 0700 Colombia 
time, which is 1400 Spanish time. Castro was the last leader to 
arrive in Cartagena, after 2300 local time. 
  The Uruguayan president confirmed to Gonzalez that his 
government would continue to collaborate in the fight against 
terrorism, restricted only by respect for judicial decisions. 
Gonzalez also spoke about cooperation with the three Latin 
American leaders. In the specific case of Colombia, the Spanish 
prime minister offered to continue aid to the areas devastated 
by the floods in Cauca and Huila, which will be visited at the 
end of the summit by Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for 
international cooperation and Latin America, who is responsible 
for drawing up a Spanish aid plan for southwest Colombia.
