<F P=106> [EFE report: "Foreign Ministry Does Not Deem Cuba's </F>
Opening-Up Measures Sufficient"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Spain deems "clearly insufficient" the 
measures adopted by the Cuban regime to promote dialogue with 
the opposition, according to Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of 
state for international cooperation and Latin America. 
  Dicenta emphasized to the Congress [of Deputies] Foreign 
Affairs Committee that "the Spanish Government may err on the 
side of generosity but not of naivety and passivity with respect 
to the Cuban people's suffering," and emphasized that "we also 
maintain scrupulous respect for Cuban sovereignty." 
<H5>  There Is No Interference </H5>
  Hence he asserted that Spain's constant calls for respect 
for 
human rights and basic individual freedoms should not be 
interpreted as interference in Cuba's internal affairs. 
  In his opinion, the good level of dialogue and relations 
between Spain and Cuba and the public and constant condemnation 
of the U.S. embargo do not prevent the government from 
reiterating its views on Cuba's future to the Fidel Castro 
regime. 
  "We will emphasize the Spanish Government's firm resolve to 
cooperate in order to enable Cuba to emerge from the crisis and 
join the community of free and democratic countries with 
prosperous economies," Dicenta said.
