The film: "The Godfather, Part III," directed by Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
The setup: In the third of a series of Corleone family bloodlettings, an aged 
Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, pictured) passes the ring of don succession to 
nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia, pictured), the bastard son of Sonny. 
</P>
<P>
The look: Pacino navigates the treacherous waters of legit business deals and 
underworld intrigue in exquisitely tailored double-breasted suits of no 
distinct period. Garcia, who is lusting after Corleone's daughter, Mary (Sophia 
Coppola), tries to win his uncle's respect by changing his personal style from 
that of flamboyant-stud-thug to sophisticated-macho-upper-management type. He 
makes his first entrance in a zoot suit-sized black leather jacket, but by the 
film's end, he is wearing a custom-made tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
George Hamilton cuts a sartorial swath through the film as the Corleone family 
lawyer. His clothes are more colorful and his jewelry is a brighter shade of 
gold than the other men's. He wears ascots and coats with velvet collars. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Corleone (Diane Keaton), who left Michael years ago and has remarried a 
very upright WASP gent, is present in this film's pivotal scenes, modestly 
covered from earlobes to kneecaps, wearing nondescript clothes in shades of 
brown and beige with high-necked white blouses. Connie Corleone (Talia Shire), 
the shrill, blood-thirsty matriarch of the clan, orders hits and plots revenge 
in larger-than-life, Martha Graham-sized jewelry and dowdy dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The details: The film is set in 1979, not that you'd notice from the clothes. 
The styles range from '40s-suit styles to '80s evening wear and accessories. 
Mileana Canonero, the costume designer, explains that rigidly adhering to a 
time period is not the point of this film: "It's not about frocks. It is about 
the essence of operatic tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Age and hierarchy of power within the men's ranks is suggested by the choice of 
their ties. The oldest generation of now-retired dons wears foulards, while 
Pacino and his peers wear paisley and rich, tapestry-like prints. The young 
guns are put in more eye-catching abstract florals. 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino is willing to do anything for the part. He let the makeup people thin 
his hair on top so he would look older. It was then streaked with gray and cut 
short in a modified military brush cut. Canonero said they chose that 
particular haircut for Pacino from a selection of styles composed on a computer 
video screen. 
</P>
<P>
The good: The principal males, except for Hamilton, have gorgeous wardrobes of 
cashmere suits with coordinating overcoats that Canonero had made in the Verri 
workshops in Italy. (Verri recently opened a store on Rodeo Drive.) Her 
insistence on dressing the men in a single solid color with subtle differences 
in shading -- a brown suit with a beige shirt would be topped with a dark brown 
overcoat -- she says, was an attempt to create the "look of a Renaissance 
painting. It gave importance to the face. The body was more in unison with the 
background." 
</P>
<P>
It also sets off all the gold jewelry. The monochromatic coloring, tasteful 
jewelry and indistinct suit styles -- wide, peak lapels from the '40s, 
contemporary jacket tailoring and easy-fitting, draped trousers -- are quite 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The bad: The women's knee-length dresses are a quick reminder of why designers 
seem to prefer hemlines either above or below the knee. Mid-leg is not a good 
proportion. The biggest fashion risk, though, was Shire's breast plate-sized 
necklaces with beads the size of golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar: For her big scene, Sophia Coppola bares her shoulders in a 
ballet-length gold gown and gold flats reminiscent of those by Italian designer 
Romeo Gigli. So are Keaton's garments for the same scene: an embroidered cocoon 
coat and high-necked velvet dress. Canonero claims Sophia's style was developed 
from Victorian pictorial references to Shakespeare's Juliet, but concedes the 
similarity and suggests they are not as exaggerated as Gigli's creations. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: This movie may do more for the men's gold jewelry business -- 
collar bars, lapel pins and, yes, even pinkie rings -- than did "Saturday Night 
Fever." GAILE ROBINSON
