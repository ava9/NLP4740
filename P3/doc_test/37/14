Paramount Pictures is launching a worldwide casting search to find a young 
actor-singer or opera singer to play the son of the powerful Don Michael 
Corleone in director Francis Ford Copolla's upcoming third edition of "The 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
The film maker is looking for an Italo-American tenor in his mid-20s who could 
play the son of Michael Corleone, who was portrayed by Al Pacino. The pivotal 
role will feature the successful tenor singing two arias from the classic 
Sicilian opera "Cavalleria Rusticana" in the scenes to be filmed on location in 
Palermo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The third act of "The Godfather" begins in New York City in 1979 and continues 
the story of the Corleone family, first chronicled by Mario Puzo in his 
best-selling novel "The Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
Casting directors have already seen more than 200 candidates, but the role is 
still considered to be open.
