JIM MURRAY: THIS GUY DEFINITELY IS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW

James Caan is crazy. His mother knows it. His producer knows it. His agent 
knows it. He knows it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he's one of our age's finest actors. I don't mean to suggest he goes around 
thinking he's Napoleon. (Marcus Allen, maybe. Hulk Hogan.) You don't have to 
get a net over him. 
</P>
<P>
But, he's a big movie star, right? I mean, you're talking Sonny Corleone in 
"The Godfather," the guy who broke your heart in "Brian's Song," who can play 
Mr. Nice Guy ("Cinderella Liberty") or Mr. Tough Guy ("Thief") with equal 
degrees of skill and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
So, he can go everywhere by limo, right? Well, Jimmy goes by motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't always get there. Jimmy drives a motorcycle as if he's jumping 20 
buses with it. The first motorcycle accident wouldn't have been so bad except 
he was carrying this small hardwood martial arts sword in his side. That broke 
more ribs than the curb. 
</P>
<P>
Movie stars have hobbies, OK? Usually, it's a yacht with room for chorus girls 
and champagne. Jimmy Caan's hobby? Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. He's not on a yacht. He's on a horse with a rope in his teeth 
chasing a running calf. Once in a while, he gets on a bucking horse while three 
movie moguls faint dead away, the insurance company gets hysterical, his wife 
threatens divorce and his agent starts looking for a psychiatrist who will take 
him on. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many rodeo cowboys born in the Bronx (actually, there is one born 
in New York City), and the only calves Jimmy Caan saw growing up were on hooks 
in his father's kosher butcher shop. 
</P>
<P>
But, Jimmy was no Midnight Cowboy. He got busted up so many times on horseback 
that his pal, George Anderson, trainer of the Raiders, doesn't send him a tie 
for Christmas, he sends him a box of tape. "He tells me, 'I don't want your 
heart and liver when you die, I want your skeleton,' " Caan chortles. "He says 
my X-ray looks like a three-car pileup on a freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Caan holds the listed world record for hospital escapes. He usually stays in 
them just till he comes to. "I tell them I'll send over my stunt man to take my 
medicine for me. He does all the dangerous stuff." Once, he says, a young nurse 
found him creeping out of the hospital in the wee hours with a tube still 
attached. "She burst into tears. 'Oh, Mr. Caan! You'll get me fired!' she says. 
I told her 'Honey, check the hospital records. This is the fourth time this 
year I went over the wall." Most people leave a hospital by wheelchair. Caan 
leaves by drainpipe. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Caan: "I just tell the doctor, 'I gotta go home, I don't feel well. And 
the hospital's no place to be when you're sick!' " 
</P>
<P>
When a gushing fan-mag type found him in a rodeo in the San Joaquin Valley one 
time and said, "Oh, Mr. Caan! I didn't know rodeo was your hobby!" Caan 
corrected her: "It isn't. This is what I do. Acting is my hobby." 
</P>
<P>
He sneaked off to a rodeo in Palm Springs once during the shooting of "Funny 
Lady" with Barbra Streisand. "I was the 'heeler' in team-roping," he explains. 
"Now, you can always tell a heeler. Check his thumbs. Your thumb gets caught in 
the rope and when your rope goes taut, your thumb is apt to go spinning to the 
horizon. Mine just got pulled back a little -- all the way to the elbow." 
</P>
<P>
He had to take the cast off to do the love scenes. "I'm the only guy in history 
who ever looked as if he was trying to do a love scene in the middle of an 
appendectomy." He had to try not to scream. So did the producer, Ray Stark. 
Another time when Caan was missing from the set, producer Stark asked bitterly, 
"Have you checked the alligator farms around here? He's probably wrestling 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Caan has had so many stitches, he looks as if he was not born but embroidered. 
When he tore his shoulder and thumb, the doctor wanted to know if he should 
bring a needle. "You better bring a sewing machine," he was told. Caan has had 
so many screws in his shoulder, he has them chromed and made into a necklace. 
There was a time he could set off metal detectors naked. 
</P>
<P>
He played football at Michigan State. "(Coach) Duffy Daugherty liked to say he 
turned me into an actor," Caan said. "He saw me run with the football and said, 
'Ever think of something else for a living, kid?' I like to think it was the 
other halfback, Clarence Peaks, who turned me into an actor." 
</P>
<P>
But James Caan has mellowed. Now, all he does is race powerboats offshore and 
practice karate. The powerboat attraction is that, in addition to crashing or 
burning, you can also drown. You can't get a more perfect sport than that. 
</P>
<P>
Karate has been his other longtime love. He's been a black belt since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He fell under the aegis of a martial arts master named Takayuki Kubota, whom 
Caan holds in the same awe as kids do Batman. "In this country, when we have a 
riot, we call out the National Guard. In Japan, when they have one, they call 
out him," Caan boasts. Kubota has trained police departments from Osaka to Los 
Angeles in the use of martial arts and baton techniques in subduing criminals 
short of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, James Caan's type of guy. To honor his mentor, Kubota, a four-day 
festival of competition featuring practitioners from 40 countries will be held, 
culminating in the finals at Cal State Los Angeles on Sunday, Nov. 5. "Kubota 
is Soshihan Kubota, which means there is only one of him in the world," Caan 
explains. "And I am next in command or Soshihan Dai, which means there's only 
one of me in the world, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Kubota World Cup commemorating 50 years in the martial arts for the 
Soshihan will consist of competitions, seminars, a banquet and meditation 
periods. Jimmy Caan probably plans to spend his meditation time behind an open 
throttle -- or an open parachute.
