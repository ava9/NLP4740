CHRISTMAS EVE
IF YOU took away all the music and movies, the airwaves would remain
virtually silent for much of the Christmas period. The pick of today's
movies begins (or for many readers, no doubt, began) at 9.30 this morning
with the first and one of the best musicals made by the Fred Astaire /
Ginger Rogers team, Flying Down To Rio (BBC2). Fans of the partnership who
have already missed this absurdly early offering can take heart since more
of their films are spread through the holiday. Most are screened even
earlier in the morning, so it looks like a job for the video recorder.
The music begins in earnest after lunch at 1.05 when Radio 3 offers a 1970
recording of Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio. The late Leonard Bernstein
conducted the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Chorus with a
starry cast: Gwyneth Jones as Leonore, Walter Berry as Don Pizzaro, Lucia
Popp as Marzeline and James King as Florestan.
If you prefer modern dance and have the afternoon free, BBC2 screens Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theatre at 2.50 with the famous American company
performing Ailey's own ballet 'Memoria'.
For many, the day's most important broadcasting fixture is the Festival Of
Nine Lessons And Carols from King's College Chapel which begins at 3.00 on
Radio 4. This has a comparatively high proportion of modern and foreign
songs. Another version on BBC2 at 6.15 is more traditional with 'The Holly
And The Ivy', 'Silent Night', and 'Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem'.
The day's most unusual music and dance programme promises to be Everybody
Dance Now (8.00 C4) which looks to the pop video as the chief source of
popular contemporary dance once provided by the Hollywood musical. Exponents
seen in the programme include Madonna, Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul and M C
Hammer. ITV provides a Midnight Service from Ely Cathedral (11.50).
Other notable movies include Sea Of Love (9.45 BBC1), a 1989 mixture of
police thriller and steamy romance which is getting its first showing on
terrestrial television. Al Pacino plays the detective and Ellen Barkin is
the suspect with whom he begins a passionate affair. Dear old Auntie BBC has
censored the language.
Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown is also having its first
terrestrial airing. This was made in 1988 by the biggest name in Spanish
cinema since Bunuel: Pedro Almodovar, darling of the film festivals. His
work is sexy, funny, eccentric, stylish and brilliantly coloured.
The best of the oldies is Arsenic And Old Lace (12.35 BBC1), Frank Capra's
hilarious wartime adaptation of a popular stage farce with Cary Grant
playing the man whose aunts take to poisoning.
There are just three non-musical programmes I want to catch. First, Fanny
And The Plastic Saints (5.30 pm Radio 4) because Piers Plowright's radio
documentaries are very special; this one is about actress Fanny Carby who
had a part-time job 50 years ago painting and gold-leafing saints and
martyrs. She now goes in search of them.
Second, BBC2's account of the 1992 re-run by vintage cars of the 1955 Mille
Miglia race, How About A Lift Old Boy? (7.30 pm BBC2) because Ian Wooldridge
who navigates for Stirling Moss is a particularly good and funny reporter.
Third, Harry Enfield's Festive Television Programme because the ghastly disc
jockeys, Smashie and Nicey, are two of the funniest characters on television
(9.20 pm BBC2).
CHRISTMAS DAY
THE PICK of the day on Christmas Day is the Queen's Speech: 9 am Radio 4, 10
am Radio 5, 11 am Radio 2, 1 pm Radio 1, 3 pm Radio 4, BBC1 and ITV 6.25 pm
and 8.30 pm BBC2 and C4 (both have sub-titles &amp; sign language).
You will also be well served if you like music - especially religious music
 -and movies - especially old ones. The first notable offering comes bright
early at 7.30 in the morning when BBC2 shows Rio Bravo, a Western which,
although slow and predictable, is peculiarly enjoyable. John Wayne plays a
sheriff determined to hold a prisoner, although he has only a drunk (Dean
Martin), a boy (Vicky Nelson) and a one-legged veteran (Walter Brennan) to
help him.
The best thing to do this morning is steal enough time for a leisurely bath
and listen to either Down Your Ear (10.30) or Desert Island Discs (11.00)
both on Radio 4. The first is a recycling of the events of 1992 by Armando
Ianucci who has been responsible for some of the funniest of recent radio
programmes, notably 'On The Hour'. In the second - an extended edition - the
castaway is the Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking.
If the middle of your day is free you can watch, and more to the point
listen to, a repeat of The Messiah on C4 starting at 11.30. This was a
performance in Dublin marking the 250th anniversary of its first performance
in that city in April 1742. An impressive list of soloists includes Sylvia
McNair and Anne Sofie von Otter. That goes on until 1.55.
Instead you could listen to Radio 2 at 1.00 for Comedy Hour which begins
with a repeat of a 1958 Christmas edition of 'Take It From Here' devoted
entirely to The Glums. While playing sardines, Ron gets locked in the
cupboard under the stairs with the buxom barmaid fancied by Mr Glum . . .
For anyone who has still never seen it, or those of us wanting to watch for
the 27th time, at 1.15 BBC2 again shows Top Hat, just about the best musical
ever made by Astaire and Rogers. The numbers include 'Isn't This A Lovely
Day', 'Cheek To Cheek' and 'White Tie And Tails' and the dance sequences are
among the best ever to come out of Hollywood. Of course the story is
ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the thing. The supporting cast
is splendid, especially Eric Blore.
Otherwise the most tempting movies of the day are Dangerous Liaisons (9 pm
BBC2), the cinema version of Christopher Hampton's hugely successful
dramatisation of the epistolary novel by Laclos in which aristocratic French
lovers plot the seduction of a young woman. This is the first showing on
terrestrial television, as is the screening of Shirley Valentine on BBC1
(9.50). This is another filmed version of a stage play, but a far more
sentimental one. Pauline Collins plays the uncherished suburban wife who
finds fulfilment in a Greek holiday romance. Tom Conti plays the Greek.
The most interesting of television's own programmes (there are far fewer
than on a normal day) may well include Saint Mugg: The Making Of A TV Saint
(7 pm C4). This considers the transformation of Malcolm Muggeridge from wit
and humorist in middle life to religious zealot and crashing bore in old
age.
Centre of BBC1's evening, and therefore candidate for one of the largest
audiences of the year, is Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast (9 pm). Where
her contemporaries tend to be described as 'among the top female performers
on television,' Wood is so good that her sex does not have to be taken into
account. She is simply one of the funniest and most talented people on
television.
BOXING DAY
CONSIDERING the well known availability of the audience on Boxing Day, this
year's schedules look surprisingly ordinary, even lacklustre, some may
think. One reason, presumably, is that, as the years have passed,
broadcasters have learnt that Christmas editions of their own normal
programmes win ratings at least as big as those for expensive galas or new
movies. Hence the succession of familiar titles on ITV and BBC1 early in the
evening.
Also, fewer special music offerings are on offer than you might expect; just
two of note. The Mikado (7.30 BBC2) is the new D'Oyly Carte production,
marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of Arthur Sullivan, recorded at
the Buxton Opera House under conductor John Owen Edwards. Since the
copyright lapsed, there have been several modern and unconventional
productions of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operas, but the D'Oyly Carte company
sticks pretty much to the established Savoy Theatre traditions. Deryck Hamon
sings the Mikado, Jill Pert is Katisha, and Julian Jensen plays Nanki-Poo.
Altogether darker and more serious is Channel 4's main programme of the
evening: Salome (8.10). This is the Peter Hall production of the Richard
Strauss opera, mounted at Covent Garden with Edward Downes conducting. The
title role is taken by Maria Ewing who was formerly married to Hall. Ewing,
happily, is a good example of the modern requirement that sopranos playing
seductively gorgeous man-killers should no longer be allowed to weigh 18
stone and to waddle around the stage, but must actually look the part.
Watching Ewing in the dance of the seven veils you can well believe she
would achieve her purpose.
Of the 21 movies on offer from the four main networks, four seem worthy of
mention. The Sword In The Stone (3.15 ITV) made in 1963 is not one of
Disney's best cartoons, nor even among the best of the studio's modern
works, but it has never before been shown on terrestrial television. It is
adapted, of course, from T. H. White's splendid King Arthur story.
For those who have still not managed to catch it, BBC2 is repeating Claude
Berri's poignant two-part saga of French rural life beginning today with
Jean de Florette (4.35). The stars are Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand.
'Manon des Sources' is screened tomorrow.
When Harry Met Sally (BBC1 10.05) is a modern American comedy romance
containing the famous scene where Meg Ryan proves in a crowded restaurant
that a woman can, indeed, realistically fake orgasm. And ITV is showing
Parts 1 and 2 of The Godfather starting today at 11.20 pm. This Mafia epic,
beginning with Marlon Brando as the head of the family and Al Pacino as his
heir, runs to a total of six and a quarter hours (and that is excluding the
inferior 'Godfather 3'). But it is much the best thing Coppola has ever
directed, the acting is outstanding, and the photography superb, so it is
worth the time.
For traditionalists there is Racing from Kempton Park (12.30 C4), and, for
skating fans, highlights of Torvill and Dean's ice spectacular in Simply The
Best (4.05 BBC1). Anyone who missed the most recent 'behind the scenes'
documentary about the Queen, Elizabeth R can see a repeat on BBC2 (2.45).
There are just two new television programmes which I particularly want to
catch. God On The Box (7.10 C4) sounds as though it might have been
specially made for television critics: it tells the story of the 'God Slot'
which began in the days of the 'toddlers' truce' when television
transmitters were switched off in the early evenings so that mothers could
put their children, un-tempted, to bed. This is about to end with the coming
of the new ultra-competitive ITV. Most of the programmes in this slot were,
as the makers of this programme admit, 'curdlingly sanctimonious'.
Bookmark (9.50 pm BBC2) promises Maureen Lipman as Enid Blyton in a
programme which mixes drama, animation and documentary. Blyton was one of
the earlist victims of political correctness, falling foul of librarians who
felt her work was much too middle class and enjoyable, and banned her books
because - they said - Noddy was a racist. Time for reinstatement.
CHRISTMAS SUNDAY
FOR ANYONE who takes an interest in television scheduling, the crucial
moment tonight occurs at 7.15 when BBC1 and ITV both finish a dose of what
passes for religion on television (jolly songs and fat men with sad smiles).
ITV then starts a two-hour Ruth Rendell Mystery Movie starring John Duttine
and Mel Martin, and BBC1 offers More Auntie's Bloomers with Terry Wogan
trying desperately to seem as funny as the out-takes - journalists' fluffs
and actors' pratfalls - he has to present.
That is followed at 8.05 on BBC1 by Miss Marple: The Mirror Crack'd with the
matchless Joan Hickson starring for the last time as Agatha Christie's
famous little old lady detective. Such a contest will inevitably split the
audience and destroy anybody's chances of record ratings. But my guess is
that, in spite of the big figures achieved by ITV with its 'Ruth Rendell'
productions in the past few years, the BBC's combination of out-takes and
Miss Marple will win hands down.
The notable movies mostly carry over from yesterday. Manon des Sources (4.25
BBC2) certainly can be watched as a self-contained piece of work, but the
story of water rights and the wild child growing up in a remote farming
region of Provence will be even more impressive if you saw 'Jean de
Florette' yesterday.
The Godfather II (11.30 pm ITV) is still more firmly hitched on to
yesterday's opening section of this gripping story of the New York Mafia and
its Sicilian connections.
Best movie offer of the day is BBC2's first terrestrial showing of the 1989
bittersweet comedy / romance The Fabulous Baker Boys (10 pm). Brothers Jeff
and Beau Bridges star as the drooping piano-bar entertainers who are
returned to tumescence by the arrival of an electrifying singer. Michelle
Pfeiffer plays Susie Diamond with such wonderful oomph that she won a Golden
Globe award and was nominated for an Oscar.
The two musical productions which look particularly interesting are both on
BBC2. In The Maestro And The Diva (3.25) Kiri Te Kanawa sings Richard
Strauss's Four Last Songs (which have become extraordinarily popular as
concert pieces in the past three or four years) with Georg Solti conducting
the BBC Philharmonic.
At 6.25 the channel offers La Cenerentola, an opera version of Cinderella
written by Rossini whose birth in 1792 we have been celebrating this year.
This production, directed by Michael Hampe for the Salzburg Festival, has
Riccardo Chailly conducting the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna
Philharmonic and the singers include Francisco Araiza, Walter Berry and Ann
Murray as Cinderella.
As ever, radio has some tempting programmes. Chris Wines has made what
promises to be a remarkable curio for Radio 4: 33 ypm which stands for '33
years per minute'. In one hour from 7 pm the programme undertakes to cover
2,000 years of history.
Radio 3's Hamlet (7.30) is a repeat of the Kenneth Branagh production with
himself in the title role, Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Judi Dench as Gertrude
and Richard Briers as Polonius.
Most compelling of all, since it is one of the earliest events I can
remember vividly, is David Perry's half hour on The London Smog Of 1952 (11
pm Radio 4).
