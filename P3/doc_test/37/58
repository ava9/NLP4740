ORLANDO (PG) Sally Potter
SCENT OF A WOMAN (15) Martin Brest
A SONG FOR BEKO Nizamettin Aric
KNIFE IN THE WATER (18) Roman Polanski
Fleeing through the centuries, Virginia Woolf's Orlando was a boy-girl on
the run from sexual predestination. Changing gender as she careened through
400 years of English history, 'he' became 'she': partly in chameleon
response to a new Enlightenment, partly for the intuitive hell (or heaven)
of it. Meanwhile the novel's camera-shutter changes of place and time - each
time it went dark we next woke up to a new snapshot image of England in the
1600s, 1700s, 1800s - fixed the book's style somewhere in the prehistory of
cinema. Time-tripping a la Muybridge or Daguerre or Julia Margaret Cameron.
Sally Potter's film of Orlando keeps the flickery serenity of the original.
The changing tableaux, like animated lantern slides, shuttle us through the
changing eras: Tudor London (Quentin Crisp as Queen Bess), Augustan tea
parties (Ned Sherrin as Dr Johnson), Victorian romance (Billy Zane as a
Byronic heart-throb, plus billowing shirt and black locks) to a 20th century
of world war, pregnancy, free love and dawning feminism.
The final scene, which could have been daft, instead defines and seals the
film's style. Tilda Swinton's Orlando sprawls Alice-like under a tree (the
image makes a bookend with the matching opening), while sung to by a
fuzzy-coloured pop-video angel dangling in the sky. At the same time
something about female liberation is intoned by a voice-over: 'She's no
longer trapped by destiny . . .' It sounds winsome and preachy. Instead it
is light, lithe and deliciously self-ironising.
We speak as one who dreaded this film. To hand Orlando the book to a
writer-director like Sally Potter, best-known previously for feminist
torture sessions like The Gold Diggers (Julie Christie going gnomic in the
Yukon), might have been like handing a gun or club to a psychopath. But
instead of shielding our heads, we are soon making Macaulay Culkin
palms-to-cheeks gestures of wonder.
We are in visual heaven as soon as the jewelled 17th century scenes begin
skating by. The Greenawayesque precision in sets and costumes - from G's own
design team, Ben Van Os and Jan Roelfs - is married to a brave freedom in
dramatic styles. Quentin Crisp camps it up with the queenly advice: 'Do not
fade, do not wither, do not grow old' (the story's self-fulfilling
injunction). Swinton flings verbal asides and mini-monologues boldly at the
camera. And everyone talks, eats and dances on skates, inventing the
tracking shot 400 years before it was invented.
Though each ensuing time-hop makes its social, cultural or gender-political
point, from the male chauvinist clubbiness of the Augustan salons to the
vaporous romanticism of Victorian times, nothing is laboured. Potter's
hurry-on-by direction and Swinton's sphinx-like ethereality as a presence -
nothing so crude as 'acting' ever seems to take place within this actress -
mean we segue into the next historical encounter before the ink is dry on
the last one. And pedagoguery is kept at bay not by avoidance but by a
mocking Brechtianism. The film's chapter headings - 'Death', 'Love',
'Politics', 'History' - use a small inoculating dose of schoolroom chalk to
ensure we never catch the full-blown didacticism.
Ironically, the only danger the film almost does fall prey to is a sense of
inconsequentiality. Okay, so we have sped through four centuries of
sexual-political evolution. But where exactly are we now? Womanhood, on the
cusp of a new millennium, may be happy and fulfilled and quired to by MTV
angels. Then again some women might not see it that way. Perhaps Orlando 2
should be made, giving us a sci-fem sashay into the future, where the icons
of machismo still hold out and the A. Schwarzeneggers of this world wait for
a final showdown with the T. Swintons. The novel's original author might not
approve. But then who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?
Miss Woolf, given half a chance, would eat Scent Of A Woman alive. Male
bonding and male values are the entire known universe in this tale of a
grouchy, blind, retired Colonel played by Al Pacino. Colonel Al needs and
gets a seeing-eye minder, schoolboy Chris O'Donnell, for a last weekend on
the town (New York) after which he plans to - Tss] Tss] Mustn't give away
the ending.
But will you still be there for it? It comes two hours 40 minutes after the
beginning. This is a dramatic span so epic that we wait for some epic events
to fill it. But no. Colonel Al keeps barking out sour wisdom to young Chris.
Young Chris keeps hoping Colonel Al will get him out of the moral jam he's
in back at school. (The head teacher might help him to a Harvard place if he
sneaks on a mischief-maker). And the ghost of Virginia Woolf keeps rattling
her chains saying, 'Aren't there any women in this film, except the ones
Pacino either wants to lay or to wish on the virginal youngster?'
This overextended buddiness binge was scripted by William Goldman and
directed Martin Brest, a specialist in male-bonding comedies (Beverly Hills
Cop, Midnight Run). Inspired by a 20-year-old Italian movie called Profumo
Di Donna (unacknowledged in the credits), it is up for a lot of Oscars. That
should surprise no one. The thinking at Oscar nomination time goes like
this. Give us a film in which disability, dying, teenage bewilderment and
surrogate parenthood are all mixed together in a bitter-sweet Learning
Experience and we will give the pseudo-humanist twaddle a shot at the
statuette.
The only true deserver is Mr Pacino. He plays Colonel Grouchy-But-Softy to
the hilt. Indeed the hilt might be sticking out of him. Early on Mr P's
performance is all staccato, cunningly modulated rasps, as of a man saving
his energy for better, more painless times. Then, as in The Godfather, the
Pacino economy pays brilliant dividends when the 'fff' markings come along.
The roars are unstopped, and the Colonel's trademark 'Hahs]' or 'Hoo-hahs]'
become claps of derisive thunder from heaven.
In the last reel the old soldier's life-or-death confrontation with the
youngster, across a loaded revolver, has Pacino eating up the air around
him, plus the furniture, plus Master O'Donnell. Given this actorly
phenomenon in its midst, Hollywood should surely fashion something worthy
for him. How about King Lear? No, perhaps not. They would probably call it
Scent Of A Monarch, add in a subplot about a surrogate son and then lay the
overlong heartwarmer before the Oscar committee.
Nizamettin Aric's A Song For Beko is the first Kurdish-language feature
film. Critical perspective buckles somewhat under the weight of this
geo-historical fact. We can say that this tale of a Turkish Kurd forced into
a border-hopping odyssey of flight by war and political oppression  - the
Iran-Iraq conflict, Saddam Hussein's gas-assisted attempts at ethnic
cleansing - is stiffly acted (except by Aric himself in the lead) and
plainly directed.
But the film's mere existence is a feat. Though Aric funded it from Germany,
where he himself fled in 1984, it makes few attempts (orphans apart) to
provide ready-access drama for an international audience. The plains
forbiddingly howl, and only the subtitles mediate between you and the
soundtrack's strange guttural noises. Once in a while, though, a scene
invokes the universal language of despair - a landscape of slaughtered
villagers, a poison-gas bombardment from the air - to erase all distance
between spectator and spectacle.
Knife In The Water is the early testament of another man now condemned to
pace the wilderness. Roman Polanski, ex-Polish, ex-Hollywood nomad, made
this three-folks-and-a-boat black comedy back in 1962. Its queasy
sex-triangle wit is unsurpassed. What better setting for a film about the
destabilising swell of tension and jealousy than the ditto swell of a large,
windswept lake? Though the spoken language is Polish, the body language,
facial semaphore and prickly telegraphic silences are universal.
