Though "The Godfather" was released nearly two decades ago, people still 
recognize Abe Vigoda for his role in the Oscar-winner as the Mafia leader, 
Tessio -- especially airline stewardesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy the cassette of the film and read me all my lines," he says. "They go 
over to me and say, 'Will you get me off the hook for old time's sake?' They 
say, 'Hello, Tessio. How are you?"' 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda, 69, was a 30-year veteran of the New York theater when he was cast in 
"The Godfather." Suddenly, he was hot property. Hollywood beckoned and the New 
York-native landed prominent roles in such films as "The Don Is Dead" and 
"Newman's Law," and became a major TV star as the grumpy, tired Detective Fish 
on the comedy series, "Barney Miller." But after Vigoda's spin-off series 
"Fish" was canceled in 1978, the actor seemed to disappear from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not on TV in a regular basis people feel you're retired," Vigoda 
confesses. "But that was never the case with me. I have always worked." 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda has spent most of the past decade keeping busy by doing theater. 
</P>
<P>
It was out of left field, Vigoda says, that he was cast as John Travolta's 
feisty 100-year-old grandfather in last fall's surprise blockbuster, "Look 
Who's Talking?" He hasn't stopped working since. 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda's co-starring in the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan comedy, "Joe Versus the 
Volcano," and the Mafia comedy, "Keaton's Cop," in regional release. 
</P>
<P>
In "Joe," written and directed by Oscar-winner John Patrick Shanley of 
"Moonstruck" fame, Vigoda plays an unhappy Polynesian chief. "I had never met 
John, but he supposedly wrote this part for me," says Vigoda. "The film is sort 
of an offbeat comedy with tragic social significance. It's an epic." 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda is overjoyed Hollywood is knocking on his door again. "I'd like to 
continue doing feature films," he says. "But if a new series came along. . . ."
