CRITIC AT LARGE: ANJELICA HUSTON: THE TRIUMPHS OF A LATE-BLOOMER

It is now customary but true to say that Anjelica Huston lived for years in the 
large shadows of two men: her powerful father, John Huston, and her companion 
for 17 years, Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Her father had, with kind intentions, cast her at age 15 as the co-star of "A 
Walk With Love and Death." It was too much too soon. The film failed badly and 
the critical pummeling she received was enough to make professional dog-walking 
seem an attractive career alternative. But she gamely worked in the theater to 
restore her confidence, understudying Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" in 
London, where she appeared, and New York, where she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was pretty enough to be a movie actress," she said at lunch a 
few days ago. "I didn't want to be the subject of a critical onslaught again. 
I'd been humiliated by all of that. It would've been a mistake to do anything 
else at the time, although it might've been different if Maerose had come along 
then," she added with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
(She prays that Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, acting in "The 
Godfather Part III," will not inherit anything like the same critical 
targeting, simply or in any degree because she happens to be Coppola's child.) 
</P>
<P>
John Huston is gone, but not before he launched her extraordinary, 
late-blossoming career by casting her as Maerose, the don's tough daughter in 
"Prizzi's Honor." 
</P>
<P>
The long relationship with Nicholson terminated abruptly and permanently with 
the revelation that he had fathered a child with another woman. Anjelica Huston 
is on her own, and it isn't half bad. 
</P>
<P>
Her newest film, "The Grifters," directed by Stephen Frears from a novel by Jim 
Thompson and a script by Donald E. Westlake, opened Wednesday and Huston is 
again a revelation. Blond and haggard, she plays a tough survivor in a tough 
world, working the race tracks for a major bookie, keeping a distant eye on the 
son she bore illegitimately at 14, conning everybody as the first line of 
defense against being conned herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the film seven or eight times," Huston said, "and it was only at the 
end of a cast and crew screening the other night that I felt for the first time 
what a conniving woman Lily was. 'Ooh, what a dreadful woman,' I thought to 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
But, Huston said, that was the skill of the late novelist Jim Thompson: 
"finding the sympathy in unsympathetic people, humanizing the dark side." The 
film indeed offers three of the least sympathetic characters, plus some 
unappetizing side dishes, that you are apt to encounter. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of Huston's work is that you come away with some understanding and 
a touch of pity, if nothing higher, for this woman who is both victim and 
victimizer, the conning and the conned, in a kind of endlessly repeating loop. 
</P>
<P>
Huston has by now developed a line in women who may be strong but who are as 
well loners and sometimes losers and who, always, are thoroughly realized 
individuals, comprehensible if not invariably sympathetic. When they are not 
particularly sympathetic, the characters earn a grudging and often amused 
admiration for their mastery of the arts of survival. Maerose Prizzi 
established a high standard and the beginnings of a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Dead," her father's beautifully melancholy last film, she was a woman 
living, it seemed, for the memory of a lover dead too young. She was a study in 
another kind of survival, the existence that outlives the life. 
</P>
<P>
She was yet another kind of loser in Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," 
the mistress discarded and then murdered when her jangly, ever wilder 
importunings got out of hand. In Paul Mazursky's "Enemies, a Love Story," she 
was a survivor again, of the world at its genocidal worst. 
</P>
<P>
The "Enemies" role was hard, a long leap from the woman she was to the woman 
she was playing, accent and all. They rehearsed a month. "But I didn't know 
until the night before we filmed my meeting with Ron (Silver) just how I'd play 
it. The experience of Auschwitz can't be taken lightly, and I was scared of my 
gall in claiming it as my own." 
</P>
<P>
But then she made an obvious but not so obvious actor's perception: "You forget 
you don't have to provide everything. I was intimidated until I took the onus 
off myself. I let Ron carry it. I could look in his eyes and take it from him." 
</P>
<P>
Lily was difficult as well. "She's not necessarily someone everyone will love 
but she's a fantastic role, and that's what I care about. That's the fun." It 
was a hard shoot, a relatively short schedule and modest budget, done all on 
locations in workdays that were often 15 and 16 hours long. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a quality in Stephen's work," she said. "The scenery seems to fall 
away and his characters are right in your face. He seems so vague for someone 
who knows precisely what he wants to do. He's dumb like a fox." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Huston had a development deal at Lorimar but decided it was not for 
her. "There's a pitfall. Actors tend to develop ideas around themselves, and 
that's not always the best way to go. And I realized that I like to be a tool, 
someone who can understand what the director wants, be an interpreter. When 
you're a producer, you're embroiled in things that aren't helpful to you as an 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
After the succession of critically celebrated roles that began with Maerose and 
has also included "Gardens of Stone," "A Handful of Dust," "Witches" and a fine 
cameo in television's "Lonesome Dove," Huston can pick her shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be in control of my own destiny," she said, "and that's what I've always 
wanted to be. I like to ask myself, 'Can I really do this? Can I fulfill this?' 
You try to stretch, and those are the parts that are the most satisfactory in 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Presently she is acting in a film version of "The Addams Family," with Raul 
Julia, Judith Malina and Christopher Lloyd (from "Back to the Future") as 
Fester. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a romp," she said. "We are shooting for 16 weeks. It better be a romp."
