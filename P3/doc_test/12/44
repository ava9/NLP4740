FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Indonesian fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A dangerous haze from thick smoke caused by Indonesian forest fires has been
blamed for at least one collision between ships in the seas between
Indonesia and Singapore. Air transport to Kalimantan has been paralysed by
the smoke since early last week while flights to Indonesia's industrial
island of Batam, near Singapore, have been disrupted. Malaysia's information
minister said at the weekend that Malaysia was prepared to help Indonesia
control the forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Pollution from the haze
has reached a hazardous level in Kuala Lumpur, the worst-hit area, officials
said.
