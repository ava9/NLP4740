All around us, trees draped in bright green foliage rear more than 100 feet
into the air. At our feet, the orange clay has been churned up by
bulldozers. Close by we hear the roar of a chain saw followed by the slow
crash of a falling tree.
We are deep in the Kalimantan rain forest, in one of the giant logging
concessions which supply the bulk of Indonesia's timber. This one, covering
a huge area of 470,000 hectares, belongs to the International Timber
Corporation of Indonesia (ITCI). We are here because ITCI is keen to rebut
accusations that it is ravaging the forests.
Suwardi Suwasa, who is in charge of forest rehabilitation, explains that the
concession has been divided up into 35 blocks, and only one may be logged
each year. Even then, an inventory has to be prepared and accounted for to
the authorities, and only trees measuring more than 50cm across may be
felled. This form of selective logging, which removes up to 10 trees per
hectare a year, is healthy for the forest, Suwasa explains, because it lets
in light and encourages regeneration.
He shows us a spot logged five years earlier. The 'pioneer' species which
recover first are already 20 feet high, creating an environment for the
slower growing, longer lasting species to return.
After felling, logs are loaded up to 10 at a time on to huge haulage trucks
and sent off to the saw mills where they are transformed into plywood,
boxes, furniture and even conservatories for English suburbia.
The ITCI operation looks impressive to visitors. But environmentalists say
it is not typical of logging operations on the island, where much felling is
done illegally, with the connivance of the authorities. It is certainly easy
to see the results of earlier rapacious logging along the coast where whole
tracts of land have been flattened, and now lie neglected. Another worry is
that Indonesia may increasingly turn to fast-growing eucalyptus to feed its
ambitious plans for a domestic paper industry. But the forestry industry is
beginning to hit back at these accusations. Mr Djamaludin Surjohadikusumo,
minister of forestry and a former forester, acknowledges that there are
'weaknesses in the chain of control,' but he emphasises that steps are being
taken to beef up enforcement - he points to the growing number of
concessions which are cancelled each year because the holders have failed to
heed the rules.
Apart from employing more foresters, he is encouraging the industry to set
up an eco-labelling system so that purchasers of Indonesian wood can know
that the timber came from properly managed forests. The scheme, which would
be independent of government, has the support of non-governmental
organisations.
'The industry needs a sustainable supply,' he says. 'Without it the industry
would commit suicide.' He estimates that illegal logging amounts to between
4m and 6m cubic meters a year, compared to official production of about 30m
cu m - 'but no one really knows'.
The forestry industry on Kalimantan also supports a local independent
research institute, Wanariset, which is funded by Tropenbos, the Dutch
foundation, and multilateral lending agencies such as the World Bank. Mr
Willie Smits, the Dutchman who runs it, says that the basic intentions of
the Indonesian forestry industry are 'good', but implementation of the rules
is a problem.
His institute is developing ways of managing the forests more economically
through botanical research and computerised management. He envisages a time
when anyone buying a product made of Indonesian timber could identify the
precise location of the tree which supplied it, and obtain an aerial
photograph showing whether the area had been regenerated.
