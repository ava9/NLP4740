FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Smog clears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The smoky haze that has affected Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia had
largely dissipated yesterday, thanks to rains and favourable winds.
Thick smoke from forest fires raging in Sumatra and Kalimantan had shrouded
large parts of south-east Asia. Singapore's authorities continue to advise
people affected by haze to stay indoors. Many people have had breathing
problems.
