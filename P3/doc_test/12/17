FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Rules must be right, and upheld -
The safeguarding of the tropical forests cannot be taken for granted

TWO ISSUES will decide whether Indonesia's valuable tropical forests survive
in good health into the next century: are the rules on limiting timber
extraction being enforced, and are the rules the right ones for Indonesia in
the first place?
The answer most often given to both questions is 'no', a source of concern
not only to Indonesian and foreign environmentalists but also to the
government and the country as a whole.
Large-scale exploitation of Indonesia's rich forests began in the late
1960s, and forest products - mainly plywood - are now the country's fourth
most important export after oil, gas, and manufactured goods; in 1991 they
earned Dollars 3.7bn, nearly double all agricultural exports put together.
On paper, Indonesia's plans look reasonable enough. Of the country's land
area of 193m hectares, 144m ha or 75 per cent is classified as forest, of
which 66m hectares is supposed to be selectively logged, 48m preserved
intact for national parks and vital watersheds, and 30m chopped down to make
way for agriculture, new settlements and industry.
Implementation of these sweeping plans, however, is another matter,
particularly when it comes to the logging concessions which are meant to be
exploited in a sustainable manner.
In a damning recent report which shook the Indonesian establishment, Walhi,
the leading domestic environmental group, not only questioned the economic
value of the industry to the country but also cited convincing evidence that
logging companies routinely flout forestry regulations.
Bribes are paid to forestry inspectors to encourage them to under-report the
amount of timber extracted from concessions, Walhi said.
It quoted a 1990 forestry department report as saying that only 22 out of
578 concessionaires had actually followed regulations on selective cutting
and replanting, and cited another official report which disclosed that only
30 per cent of log production in East Kalimantan on Borneo was reported to
the government as required.
In the past, the report added, Japanese figures for the import of logs and
wood products from Indonesia were far higher than the Indonesian figures for
exports to Japan. Walhi concluded that the state captured only 17 per cent
of the economic rent from timber in taxes and fees, compared with 85 per
cent for the technologically much more sophisticated oil industry.
Although the government and big private companies are establishing tens of
thousands of hectares of plantations for the pulp and paper and other timber
processing industries, the programme is behind schedule and has so far done
little to protect Indonesia's natural forests.
There is scant transparency in the bidding for natural forest concessions,
and the logging industry is dominated by timber magnates such as Mr Mohamad
'Bob' Hasan and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who have close ties to President
Suharto.
'Wood is not being harvested, it's being mined,' says a foreign aid
official. Another says: 'The legal loggers are legally logging sometimes and
illegally logging at other times. There's no end to the genius involved.'
However, the government and many foreign donors agree that big logging
concessionaires like Mr Hasan - because of their financial resources and
their huge stake in the future of the industry - are more likely to manage
forests sustainably than smaller operators who might be tempted to
'asset-strip' their concessions for a quick, short-term gain.
There is also agreement that forestry rules are contravened. 'Our government
doesn't have the capability to measure illegal cutting,' says Mr Bambang
Soekartiko, a senior official of the ministry of forestry. 'We know there is
excess cutting.'
As for the existing system of selective cutting and replanting, Indonesian
and foreign forestry experts are acknowledging that, because of their
limited understanding of the biology of forests rich in valuable dipterocarp
species, they might not be able to make it work even if the rules were
strictly applied.
Part of the problem is that a typical forest does not contain equal numbers
of large, medium-sized and small trees which would allow regular cropping as
each generation reaches maturity. In fact the large, harvestable trees
dominate the canopy and thereby stunt their successors which then take many
years to reach the required size.
Several proposals to improve the rules for managing Indonesian forests and
the enforcement of those rules are under discussion, including an extension
of concession periods from 20 to 35 years, the use of costly performance
bonds to ensure logging companies comply with the law, and the deployment of
foreign inspectors.
Foreign donors have welcomed the appointment of Mr Djamaloedin
Soeryohadikoesoemo as the new forestry minister in the March cabinet
reshuffle, although some of them say his decision to adopt a new and
little-understood system of forest strip-cutting is a sign of the
government's desperation as it seeks save the industry from its own
excesses.
The idea is to cut long strips of forest - including the smaller trees  -
and leave other, neighbouring strips intact, allowing the logged strip to be
replanted or seeded from the untouched forest and letting in sunlight to
nourish the young trees.
Forestry ministry officials say the strip system will be easier to monitor -
by satellite for example - and they also believe that natural forest growth
will increase from one or two cubic metres per hectare per year to between
eight and 14 cubic metres. 'The productivity will increase eight times,'
says Mr Soekartiko.
Others are sceptical, pointing out that loggers will be tempted to venture
into the supposedly inviolate strips of forest to take the most valuable
trees, and that the open strips might be used as farms by the settlers who
always follow in the wake of the logging trucks.
Implementation of the new method has not yet begun in Indonesia. In the
meantime, high demand for logs from more than 2,800 sawmills and plywood
factories continues to put pressure on Indonesia's forests; the mills and
factories have a capacity of more than 50m cubic metres a year, compared
with the government's official figure for sustainable log output of 31m
cubic metres.
One of the few hopeful signs for Indonesia, as it strives to avoid the
deforestation suffered long ago in western Europe and more recently in
Thailand and the Philippines, is that local inhabitants have become more
vocal in their opposition to state-sanctioned logging in their homelands.
The inhabitants of Yamdena, an island on the eastern side of the
archipelago, and of Siberut off the coast of Sumatra, have won reprieves for
their forests, and even the logging companies of Kalimantan are said to be
concerned about their own future; they may yet heed Walhi's warning:
'At the current level of deforestation, Indonesia's forests will disappear
in the next 30 years.'
