NEGOTIATIONS ON a new International Tropical Timber Agreement resumed in
Geneva yesterday, with both producing and consuming countries expressing
optimism for progress in the week-long talks.
The first session of talks in April ended in stalemate over producer demands
for temperate and boreal, as well as tropical timber, to be included in the
new agreement. Producing countries, the biggest being Malaysia, Indonesia,
Ivory Coast, Papua New Guinea and Brazil, say the present accord is
discriminatory.
The 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement, which came into force in
1985 and expires in March next year, aims to balance economic use of
tropical timber with environmental needs through co-operation, consultation
and research. It has no price-setting mechanisms.
Consumers have pressed for stronger environmental provisions, including a
clear commitment to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical timber
exports come from sustainably managed forests. Producers do not want this
target to be legally binding and say similar commitments should be imposed
on all internationally traded timber.
Consumer countries continue to oppose the inclusion of temperate and boreal
timber in any agreement.
At a meeting of the International Tropical Timber Council in Kuala Lumpur
last month, however, they proposed three points for discussion in Geneva
which they hope will allay producer concerns.
In particular, consumers have suggested language in the new agreement that
would bar discrimination against exports of tropical timber as such and
ensure the accord could not be used to justify trade curbs.
Consumers have also offered to examine a shift to sustainable forest
management for temperate timber and increased funds for projects in tropical
producing countries to promote sustainable management and increased market
transparency.
The negotiations, sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, involve some 50 countries accounting for virtually the whole
Dollars 7.5bn a year trade in tropical timber. Unctad officials say that a
final deal is unlikely this time.
