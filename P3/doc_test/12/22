  [Text] Malaysia has reacted positively to Indonesia's 
desire to settle the dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan more 
quickly. Izhar Ibrahim, Indonesia's chief delegate to the Kuala 
Lumpur talks on the dispute, said there seemed to be progress in 
the talks because Malaysia had reacted positively to Indonesia's 
hope for a speedier settlement. During the talks, which started 
on Wednesday, Malaysia also responded to Indonesia's statement 
on the ownership of the islands made during the earlier talks in 
July 1992.
