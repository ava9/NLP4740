IN SARAWAK, the richly forested area of north-western Borneo which forms the
largest state in Malaysia, it is hard to escape the sight of logs or the
hotly-contested debate on logging.
The Sarawak authorities regard foreign and local environmentalists, human
rights activists and journalists as interfering hypocrites who fail to
appreciate the importance of the forestry industry to the local economy, and
who romanticise the primitive lifestyles of the inhabitants of the jungle.
The forest dwellers themselves complain that their ancestral lands are being
ravaged to fill the pockets of a few timber tycoons, while the
environmentalists warn that continued over-logging will not only damage the
global environment but also finish the local timber industry in a matter of
years.
It would be too much to speak of a meeting of minds, but there are signs
that the chasm between the two sides is beginning to narrow. Although
Sarawak officials still say foreigners have no business worrying about the
state's forests, it is beginning to dawn on them that they are heavily
dependent on a dwindling resource.
With a certain amount of mental gymnastics, they maintain that Sarawak's
forests are being sustainably and selectively logged, at the same time as
promising to reduce logging to theoretically sustainable levels suggested by
groups such as the International Tropical Timber Organisation (Itto).
'There's a very definite perception everywhere that it's finite,' says a
business executive in the Sarawak capital Kuching. 'People are beginning to
realise this.'
Statistics on the logging industry are notoriously controversial. Suffice it
to say that Malaysia accounts for nearly half of world timber exports
(compared with Brazil's 2.4 per cent), that Sarawak accounts for most of
Malaysia's production, and that Sarawak's unprocessed log exports have risen
to 15.8m cubic metres in 1991 from 6.7m in 1980. The World Bank reckons the
trees are being cut at about four times the sustainable rate.
Anecdotal evidence is as telling as the statistics. Logging companies
seeking valuable trees are working in increasingly remote areas as supplies
closer to the coast become scarce.
Fifteen years ago, according to locals in the building trade, it was common
to use a soft, decorative wood known as Ramin for ornate ceilings; nowadays
it is almost unobtainable, and a substitute called Bindang - which is more
grainy and less consistent in its colouring - is used instead, but even this
is becoming harder to find.
One of the obstacles to bringing the logging industry under control is the
close relationship between the loggers and the state government of Mr Abdul
Taib bin Mahmud, the chief minister for the past decade.
Mr Taib's uncle and political rival, Mr Abdul Rahman Yakub, let it be known
during an election campaign in 1987 that his nephew's relatives and
political allies controlled 1.6m hectares of the state's timber concessions,
about a third of the total. Mr James Wong, the state environment minister,
is also one of the largest concessionaires and has come into conflict with
local inhabitants seeking to stop the depredations of his logging trucks.
There are signs, however, that the Sarawak government - noting the economic
problems faced by the greatly deforested neighbouring state of Sabah - is
seeking to enforce stricter controls on the logging industry and to
diversify the economy.
First, Sarawak is encouraging the establishment of downstream wood
industries and setting aside timber processing zones in an attempt to add
value to its exports to Japan and other tropical timber consumers. A fifth
of timber exports are now supposed to be processed in Sarawak, a proportion
which is expected to rise to 50 per cent in the next few years. Sarawak is
also trying to lure non-timber industries to Sarawak from peninsular
Malaysia.
Second, there is a drive to encourage tourism in the state, particularly
'adventure tourism' which takes advantage of Sarawak's rivers and jungles.
Third, the state is promoting the conversion of forest land to palm oil
plantations and other forms of agriculture, and the Sarawak Economic
Development Corporation (SEDC) is overseeing an aquaculture project
producing tiger prawns.
'We are pioneering a lot of industries, diversifying away from our
traditional resource base,' says Mr Jeffrey Wei, of the SEDC.
Sarawak is rich in oil and gas, but the revenue from these resources -
unlike the revenue from timber - goes mostly to the federal government. The
relationship between Sarawak and the Malaysian peninsula across the South
China Sea has long been delicate.
Sarawak, run by the Brooke family of White Rajahs until the arrival of the
Japanese in the second world war and then ceded to Britain, joined the new
Malaysian federation in 1963, whereas the neighbouring Sultanate of Brunei
chose to become independent rather than sacrifice control of its oil
revenues. Sarawak did, however, retain a measure of autonomy, and to this
day has its own immigration controls and requires west Malaysians to obtain
permits if they wish to work in the state.
The 1.6m inhabitants of Sarawak - drawn from more than two dozen ethnic
groups, including the local farmers and nomads collectively known as Dayaks
 -complain in general that the federal government does not give them
sufficient funds, and in particular that the planned tar road across east
Malaysia has yet to be completed.
Even if Sarawak's independent policies on its forests undermine the grand
environmental targets announced at international meetings by Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the federal prime minister, the two governments appear to see eye
to eye on the desirability of ignoring foreign environmentalists and
'civilising' the few hundred nomadic Penans who continue to oppose the
intrusions of loggers in their ancestral lands.
The Penans - described by one western diplomat in Kuala Lumpur as 'a very
primitive tribe with tremendously good public relations' - have become an
international symbol of the fight against uncontrolled logging in Sarawak.
Sahabat Alam Malaysia (Friends of the Earth) has accused the Sarawak
government of flouting public promises made over the last five years to set
aside reserves for the Penan.
In its latest bulletin, the organisation quoted Mr Along Saga, a Penan chief
on the Adang River, as saying: 'Everywhere there are logging activities,
except the small area adjacent to the fisheries station near our settlement
where government ministers sometimes come by helicopter for fishing.' The
logs, it seems, will continue to leave Sarawak, but the arguments over
logging will not.
