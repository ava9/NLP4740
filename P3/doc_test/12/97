  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Cambodia will set up a joint commission to promote 
reconstruction in the Indochinese country. 
  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, was announced this 
yesterday, said the commission was suggested by Cambodian Deputy 
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut at their one-hour meeting 
at the Foreign Ministry here. 
  Cambodia wanted to tap Malaysia's experience and expertise 
in 
agriculture, tourism, extraction of Minerals and petroleum, 
logging and manpower training, he told reporters after the 
meeting. 
  Abdullah said Cambodia also requested Malaysia's help to 
attract foreign investment. 
  He said the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority was 
the most suitable agency to explain Malaysia's investment 
strategy to the Investment Council of Cambodia. 
  The Malaysian Economic Planning Unit might also help the 
Cambodian Development Council on development strategies, he said. 
  Abdullah also said Malaysia would support Cambodia's 
participation as an observer in July's ASEAN foreign ministers 
meeting and the post-ministerial conference in Bangkok as well 
as the ASEAN regional security forum. 
  He did not expect any objection from other ASEAN member 
countries since ASEAN had played a role in bringing peace to 
Cambodia. 
  As such, Cambodia's participation in regional conferences 
should be welcomed, he added.
