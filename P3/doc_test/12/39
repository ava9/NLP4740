  [Text] Indonesia was of the opinion that the second round 
of talks with Malaysia on the disputed Sipadan and Ligitan 
Islands have achieved maximum progress even though a settlement 
has yet to be realized. 
  Izhar Ibrahim, the Indonesian delegation leader to the talks 
in Kuala Lumpur, expressed hope that the progress would pave the 
way toward the achievement of further progress in ensuing talks. 
No time frame has been set for the settlement of the dispute 
although the two parties agreed to hold further talks in Jakarta 
in four months' time. Apart from this, the two nations also 
agreed that the issue of Sipadan and Ligitan Islands settlement 
be based on the principles of international law.
