  [Text] Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid, Chief of ABRI's 
[Indonesian Armed Forces] Information Center, told newsmen in 
Jakarta today that ABRI shares the opinion of the Indonesian 
Foreign Department in regretting the plan by Malaysian 
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) to conduct a forum on 
East Timor. 
  He said that if the forum in Malaysia is allowed to proceed, 
the solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia 
will be negatively affected. 
  The Indonesian Government hopes that the Malaysian 
Government 
will adopt the same attitude as that of the Philippine 
Government, whereby a planned forum on East Timor was canceled. 
  The ABRI Information Center chief feels that the forum to be 
held in Malaysia can tarnish the good reputation of the 
Indonesian Government, particularly the ABRI.
