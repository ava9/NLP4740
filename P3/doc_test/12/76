ASK for a meal in a cafe in Kota Kinabalu, the quiet, seaside capital of
Sabah, and the chances are that the waitress will be an Indonesian teenager;
glance at a building site, and half the construction workers you see are
probably Filipinos.
Since the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of casual migrant workers and
refugees have poured into Sabah, the state perched on the northern tip of
Borneo two and a half hours away from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur by
air across the South China Sea.
The immigrants, politely and inaccurately called 'the transient population'
in official documents, are now estimated to account for as much as 40 per
cent of the Sabah population of 1.8m and two thirds of the workforce; many
have lived in Sabah for two decades.
Their continued presence is yet another bone of contention between the
federal authorities and Sabah's predominantly Christian state government.
A large portion of the immigrants, numbering between 450,000 and 700,000,
are Moslems from the southern Philippines or Indonesia.
Sabah is one of only two states in the country led by opponents of Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the federal prime minister, and Sabah officials of local
Kadazan or ethnic Chinese origin suspect the federal government of wanting
to flood the state with Moslems who would be favourably inclined towards Dr
Mahathir and the Moslem-controlled national government.
'What Kuala Lumpur is trying to do is to legalise these people by the back
door by giving them the identity cards which signify your citizenship,' said
Mr Bernard Dompok, the Sabah finance minister, in an interview. 'We don't
mind the workers here, but we want them to be properly regulated.'
Like immigrants in so many countries, the 'illegals' of Sabah are needed but
also resented by the local population.
They work in plantations, building sites, restaurants and hotels and as
maids in the homes of richer Sabahans for wages which the local inhabitants
would not accept.
Tourism, for example, is an increasingly important foreign currency earner
for Sabah, as the logging industry inexorably declines after years of
deforestation and over-extraction of valuable timber. In the last five
years, visitor arrivals have doubled to more than 100,000. Many workers in
the tourism industry are of Filipino origin.
Plantations of oil palm and cocoa are also vital to the Sabah economy, with
the state accounting for 70 per cent of the Malaysian cocoa crop and 10 per
cent of palm oil output - a figure which is rising as more and more oil palm
plantation developers come in from peninsular Malaysia. In some areas as
many as 95 per cent of plantation workers are Indonesians.
Sabah's remoteness and internal transport problems can push costs for
businesses 20 or 30 per cent above the national average, and the Sabah
government acknowledges that cheap migrant labourers help to offset such
disadvantages.
'In many ways the economy of the state of Sabah moves because of them,' said
Mr Dompok. 'They are a source of cheap labour .. This is the only
competitive edge we have over west Malaysia and Singapore.'
Even the smuggling of cigarettes and other goods from the southern
Philippines - often on the same boats as the migrants - is welcomed by
Sabahan officials as a means of reducing costs, since most customs duties
are collected by the federal rather than the state government.
Sabah citizens, however, complain bitterly that the immigrants overload the
state's schools and hospitals (without paying taxes) and breed crime and
prostitution - to the extent that some areas, especially in the eastern
towns of Sandakan and Tawau, are said to be 'no-go' areas for the police.
The problem of coping with the immigrants is compounded by confusion over
who in Sabah really are Malaysian citizens and by widespread forging of
identity cards. Many Sabahans, especially the Kadazans in the interior, do
not have birth certificates and it is easy for an immigrant to bribe a
village headman into acknowledging him or her as a local.
'They are so integrated,' says one ethnic Chinese Sabahan of the immigrant
Filipinos. 'I myself can't tell the difference. Some people have been here
20 years.'
Mr Harris bin Mohamad Salleh, a former Sabah chief minister and a strong
supporter of Dr Mahathir, says that 10 to 20 per cent of immigrant Moslems
have become citizens over the years and claims proudly that more than half
the state's population is now Moslem. But if the federal government is
indeed encouraging the naturalisation of such people it is a tactic which
may backfire.
One of the dangers is that the presence of numerous Filipinos in Sabah will
revive a dormant territorial claim to Sabah by the Philippines; in the 19th
century the Sultan of the Sulu islands, now part of the Philippines, leased
Sabah for Dollars 5,000 a year to British businessmen. He never got it back.
Another danger for the federal government is that the influx of Moslems will
not have the desired political effect of boosting support for the United
Malays National Organisation (Umno), the dominant national party.
According to officials in Sabah, local Moslems are as resentful as anyone
else about the competition from immigrants, especially in the fishing and
fishmongering trades along the coast.
Nor is it certain that newly legalised Moslems will support the Kuala Lumpur
government. The immigrants often share the Sabahans' resentment of the
dictats of far away Kuala Lumpur. The Sabah state authorities, under Mr
Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, pride themselves on the
integration of races and religions in Sabah and have managed to lure some
Sabah Moslems into their fold.
'What it (the federal government) doesn't understand is that these people,
even if they are Moslems, are basically nominal Moslems,' said Mr Dompok of
the Filipinos who make up two thirds of the immigrants. 'Religion is
secondary.'
