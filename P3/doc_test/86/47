Nestled between condominiums and a shopping mall, the Conejo Valley Botanic 
Garden, with its chaparral-covered hills and winding nature trail, is an urban 
refuge for both woodpeckers and people. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting an average of 60 plant enthusiasts, joggers and bird-watchers each 
weekend, the garden remains one of Thousand Oaks' best kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the absence of a defined boundary makes the garden appear to be 
just an extension of its neighbor, Conejo Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer gardeners hope to clear up the confusion by installing a fence around 
the northwest portion of the garden later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the fence, about $3,000, will come from a recent $10,000 grant from 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
"With a fence, people will be corraled into the garden," said Barbara Song, 
treasurer of the nonprofit Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation Inc., which manages 
the 35-acre grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We also need more signs because people get off in the wrong direction. We're 
hoping this will do it." 
</P>
<P>
The fence should also help reduce vandalism and create a protected area where 
gardeners can grow more sensitive plants. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the foundation has hesitated to exchange seeds with other gardens 
out of fear that the plants would never get a proper chance to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
Children who use the garden as a shortcut to and from school knock over 
sprinklers and plants, Song said. The gate on the fence will be locked at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they plan to expand the collection, which includes olive trees, 
holly oak trees and Aleppo pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will focus on drought-resistant plants so that the garden's 
twice-weekly watering schedule will not have to be increased. 
</P>
<P>
When the Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District was given the land in 1973 
by the Klingbiel Corp., it was little more than a hill covered with dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
The Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation was formed to manage the grounds under a 
$1-a-year park district lease, said Jim Gilmore, development planner. 
</P>
<P>
With water provided by the park district, the foundation spends about $1,000 
annually on repairs, relying mainly on contributions and volunteers to expand 
and maintain the garden, Song said. 
</P>
<P>
The garden contains 200 species of plants and trees, including a small orchard 
and a section for succulents. The Conejo buckwheat, which is Thousand Oaks' 
official flower and is on the endangered list, has also found a home at the 
garden. STEPHANIE STASSEL
