Torrey Pines' psychological edge was as important as its aggressiveness on the 
field against Bonita Vista Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The more-experienced Falcons had already defeated the Barons, 3-0, the most 
goals scored against Bonita Vista (26-2-2) this year. Torrey Pines had won the 
3-A San Diego Section title the past six of eight years and was undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
And so it wasn't that surprising that Torrey Pines (23-0-4) defeated Bonita 
Vista, 1-0, in the San Diego Section girls' 3-A final at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fighting their will to win," Bonita Vista Coach Ron Pietila said. 
"Torrey Pines was very confident." 
</P>
<P>
Said Christy Peters, Torrey Pines' junior midfielder: "We had a definite edge, 
but they had an edge in a different respect. They had nothing to lose; we did. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons had four objectives going into the game and managed to accomplish 
three: Dennis Costello became the first coach to win three consecutive girls' 
3-A section soccer championships. The Falcons remained undefeated for the first 
time in the three years Costello has been the coach. And Torrey Pines only 
allowed seven goals this season to tie Bonita Vista and break the Barons' 
record of eight allowed in both 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines wanted to reach 100 goals but fell one short. The Falcons did 
collect their 20th shutout as goalie Kyla Schmedding was forced to make few 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very close game tonight, right to the last minute," Costello said. 
"It was the kind of game that's very enjoyable for the crowd to watch -- a game 
between the No. 1- and 2-rated teams." 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Napoli, a 5-foot-1 1/2 senior, scored 12 minutes into the first half 
and finished the season with 31 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a couple mistakes on defense," Pietila said. "We had two youngsters on 
defense who just weren't communicating. The girl with the most experience 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We had opportunities late to score, but they're too good. I am very 
pleased with our effort."
