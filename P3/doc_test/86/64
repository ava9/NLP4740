Hundreds of Huntington Beach residents gathered under a giant pine tree 
Saturday to mourn Harry Montague and remember his work with the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
Fondly known as "Big Harry," Montague was with the recreation department for 12 
years, coaching the essentials of sports and offering a willing ear to those in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a gentle giant," remembered co-worker Suzie Smith of the 6-foot, 
5-inch, 240-pound Montague. "He just had a way about him that the kids were 
drawn to. They were very comfortable with him." 
</P>
<P>
Montague, an avid bicyclist, was killed last June in a bicycle accident on 
Pacific Coast Highway. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoyed all sports, Montague's true love was basketball. With 
dozens of the young athletes he coached looking on Saturday, a towering pine 
tree in front of city basketball courts at 21377 Magnolia Ave., along with a 
plaque, were dedicated to his memory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarship Fund Created 
</P>
<P>
And four young athletes -- two young men and two young women -- were awarded 
the first Montague scholarships from a fund created after his death by friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 scholarship fund yielded the first four $400 scholarships. Each 
winner was a member of the Edison High School varsity basketball team. They 
were Laura Radloff, Tiffany Nii, Jason Carey and Bryan Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Nii called Montague "the nicest man I ever met." 
</P>
<P>
For Carey, Montague was "one of the most influential persons in my life. He got 
me started in basketball in the third grade. . . . He was truly a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
"Harry never blew his own horn," said Shirley Carey, Jason's mother. "He may 
not have realized the impact he had. We all thought he would be around 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Evelyn Montague, was pleased with the memorial. She said she was 
both gratified and surprised at the outpouring of affection. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know him as a community leader," Evelyn Montague said. "I just knew 
him as a kidder at home." 
</P>
<P>
Montague grew up in Long Beach and went to Millikan High School and Long Beach 
City College. He earned an economics degree at UCLA and a masters degree in 
recreation from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Werth, the city's senior recreation supervisor, said Montague viewed his 
position as more than a job and that he had an 
"above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty attitude." 
</P>
<P>
"He saw hundreds of kids each day and he knew almost all of them by name," 
Werth said. "He even knew a little something about each one. He had an 
outstanding memory." 
</P>
<P>
"He is being sorely missed. Very few like him come along," Smith said. "He 
encouraged the kids that had potential to get into coaching. He gave them a 
sense of responsibility. Harry saw in them what others didn't see."
