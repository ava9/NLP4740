Charlotta Ashworth, who recently moved to Torrance from Atlanta, had heard that 
the Los Angeles area was austere and not very friendly at all. So she was 
pleasantly surprised when two strangers knocked on her front door, bearing a 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors were members of Rolling Hills Covenant Church, which recently 
launched a campaign to welcome all new residents to the South Bay with 
hand-delivered housewarming gifts of seedling pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect anything like that," said Ashworth, 46, who said she and her 
family had been told that "the people here were cold." 
</P>
<P>
"If we just do good things in the name of Christ, it's just like planting 
seeds," said Kimberly Creasman, director of the SEEDS campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign is also an attempt to boost the church's membership by 
inviting South Bay newcomers to the church's services. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the seedling pines, wrapped in white tissue paper with a green ribbon, 
come with planting instructions and an invitation to "come grow with us." 
</P>
<P>
And it seems to be working. The Rev. Chuck Olson, the pastor, said the church 
has had double the number of visitors since the campaign began in September. 
</P>
<P>
The church, using volunteers, plans to distribute 10,000 trees by the end of 
October. About 2,000 families have so far received the welcoming gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"If you brought me a rose, in a couple of days, the rose would be gone," 
Ashworth said. "But, with a tree, it's different because it's going to keep on 
growing and living." 
</P>
<P>
The church was able to obtain the addresses of all homes sold in the South Bay 
this summer from area real estate agencies, and about 100 members volunteered 
to deliver the seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a refreshing personal contact of warmth in an increasing age of 
coldness," Creasman said. "People moving out to the L.A. area are incredibly 
lonely because they're surrounded by a metropolis (and they feel that) no one 
cares about them." 
</P>
<P>
Although volunteers often found no one at home when they visited, they left the 
seedlings on the doorstep to welcome the newcomers home. 
</P>

Angie Shao, 26, was nonplussed when she came home from work one afternoon and 
saw a miniature tree on her front porch. After reading the card that came with 
it, she promptly planted the tree in a pickle barrel and put it in her back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, people give you brochures or ask for money," said Shao, who just 
moved from Carson to Torrance in August. "This time, we're receiving something 
and it's really nice." LILY DIZON
