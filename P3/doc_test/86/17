<F P=106> [Article by Sauli Korpimo: ``Health of Finnish Forests </F>
Declining, Every Fifth Tree Suffers From Needle Cast''] 
  [Text] The health of Finnish forests is getting worse 
again. Needle loss came to a halt a few years ago, but during 
the last two years it has increased again. Now, 20 percent of 
all trees suffer from needle loss. In general, forest growth is 
still satisfactory, although, in more sensitive areas, one can 
see various symptoms of stress on the trees. 
  Needle loss among Finnish conifers is average, based on 
European standards. In Finland and Sweden, between 10 and 20 
percent of all trees are damaged, and, for example, in Norway, 
Estonia, Germany, and Poland, the figure is 20 percent. The 
forests in Czechoslovakia are in the worst shape: Almost 60 
percent of the trees are damaged. 
  Needle loss is used as a measure of tree vitality, or, in 
other words, their ability to survive, grow, and produce seeds. 
A tree has suffered needle loss if it has lost more than 20 
percent of its needles, and it has been damaged if it has 
dropped 25 percent. 
  Researcher Martti Lindgren does not believe that air 
pollution has any significant effect on needle loss. In the 
southern parts of Finland, nitrogen and sulfur emissions have, 
in part, caused needle loss among pines. 
  ``Aside from areas in the vicinity of emission sources, 
densely populated areas, and roadside areas, needle loss is 
primarily caused by the aging of trees and by unfavorable 
climate and weather factors,'' said Lindgren. He spoke about 
needle loss studies at a research convention arranged by the 
Forest Research Institute in Vantaa. 
  The greatest needle loss has been suffered by conifers in 
Lapland. Also, spruce forests in Kainuu suffer from needle loss. 
Pine forests on the south coast and in Ostrobothnia have 
suffered more needle loss than in other parts of southern 
Finland. 
  Needle loss has been suffered by 38.5 percent of all spruce 
and 11.5 percent of all pine. The defoliation percentage for 
deciduous trees is 18.
