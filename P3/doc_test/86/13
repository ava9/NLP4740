Wandering amid the two acres of live Monterey pine at the Orange Christmas Farm 
on a recent sunny day, Keith Kenney was looking for the perfect tree. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney and his two daughters Dana, 6, and Erin, 8, had set out to surprise Mom 
-- Grace Kenney, a registered nurse who was cooped up studying for refresher 
courses -- by bringing home a special Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always wanted this type," said Kenney amid the forest of living pines. 
</P>
<P>
He knew that choosing a tree from a farm was a little more expensive than 
taking home a pre-cut one from a lot -- in fact, twice the amount he says he 
usually pays for a tree. But the 33-year-old engineer said this had been a 
special year. 
</P>
<P>
"With school and working -- it's been a real strain, so this will be a real 
special Christmas for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sentimental holiday enthusiasts, longing for the look and scent of a fresh 
evergreen to fill their homes this Christmas season, have been abundant during 
recent weekends, searching the county's live tree farms for the pine of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had to take our tree down the day after Christmas; it was so dry, 
it was a fire hazard," said Cynthia Kareem of Yorba Linda, as her husband, two 
children, a friend and a next-door neighbor roamed among 5,000 pines at the 
Bailey-Findley lot in Yorba Linda. "Hopefully it will be fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Most customers visiting one of the more than a dozen farms throughout the 
county defer to staff workers to do the chopping. But a few brave souls, 
including 8-year-old Omar Kareem and his neighbor, Scott Woodward, 9, prefer to 
take saw in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Now if you cut it, you have to carry it too," Jim Bailey, part-owner of the 
lot, told the boys after they had felled a six-foot Monterey pine, which is the 
type offered at most lots because they grow so well in the county's climate. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the twosome carry the pine from deep inside the farm to the 
parking lot, they heaved it over the side of the Kareem family's Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that heavy," Omar said. "It was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said his parents aren't buying a tree this year because of the fire 
hazard, but he was sure that he would spend time enjoying the tree at his 
neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been wishing I could have a great, big Christmas tree high as the 
clouds," he said as he nestled in the back of the Jeep with Omar and the tree. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa's Forest, also in Yorba Linda, where wooden bridges take shoppers from 
the jam-packed parking lot off Yorba Linda Boulevard into a serene and shady 
five acres of evergreens, some buyers found the freshness of just-cut trees a 
worthy investment. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see any dead stuff in here," said Stan Jablecki of Brea as he moved 
aside the branches of a pine, revealing a nearly perfect green tree. "The last 
thing you want is a fire. No matter what the cost, what's the cost of your 
home? It's a lot more than a Christmas tree." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife Sue said they have been buying fresh-cut trees for about 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got pictures of little Elizabeth standing on the trunk" of the chopped 
tree, said Sue Jablecki, referring to the couple's now 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Holmes, who has worked at the Santa's Forest lot for 16 years, says that 
even fresh-cut trees need special care. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that buyers chop off the bottom of the trunk just before they put 
the tree in water, and add fresh water every few days. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who has sold Christmas trees for 20 years, said the trend is for 7- and 
7 1/2-foot trees, and especially ones that are full, fat and perfectly shaped. 
But he said everyone has a particular preference.
