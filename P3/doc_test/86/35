You have to get the whole picture: 
</P>
<P>
This rather large lady lives on an island in the South Pacific that is said to 
be more perfect than paradise. The island is three miles long and five miles 
wide. Her husband, 6-foot-3 and 270 pounds, farms palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
She dresses in billowing cotton pajamas. She eats glorious fresh fruit. She has 
a swimming pool, a garden and a house with, the last time she counted, 30 
rooms. And every day, this lady, Colleen McCullough, surrounds herself with 
acquaintances who have been dead for 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero: "I was reading the letters of Cicero, those marvelous letters of Cicero 
to Atticus," McCullough said. "It is so extraordinary to read them. In one 
letter, Cicero says: 'That woman has finally quit Rome.' " McCullough looked 
jubilant. "He was talking about Cleopatra!" 
</P>
<P>
Julius Caesar: "It is rare in history to be lucky enough to read the words of 
the man who ran the place." Unfortunately, said McCullough, "Caesar never put a 
foot wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Caesar's apparent faultlessness knocked him out of the running for the role of 
hero in McCullough's latest literary endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to make a hero who does nothing wrong," the author of "The 
Thorn Birds" and four other novels said. 
</P>
<P>
So there on Norfolk Island, not far from where the mutiny on the Bounty took 
place, McCullough crafted new heroes to fill six volumes of fiction about life 
in republican Rome. The debut novel in the series, "The First Man in Rome" 
(William Morrow &amp; Co., $22.95), was published Oct. 1, arrived on the Los 
Angeles Times best-seller list on Oct. 14, and on Sunday moved on to the New 
York Times national best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women run around in togas in McCullough's new novel. Their names and 
the places they live and visit are so complicated that McCullough has included 
a 15-page glossary. The research took 13 years -- "10 years of dabbling and 
three years of sitting down and doing nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
It probably would have been easier, and undoubtedly less risky, to write a 
sequel to "The Thorn Birds," McCullough's best-selling contemporary family saga 
of 1977. But, she said, "I had always wanted to do a really fat historical 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
No two of her books are in the same genre, she explained. "I mean, I'm 
hopeless," she pronounced, plopping herself down in a chair in her hotel suite 
here. McCullough has hair that seems to march to its own brush. Her 
black-patent leather shoes have fake leopard-skin trim. Instead of lunch, 
McCullough takes a swig of paregoric, because her stomach is bothering her, and 
lights the first of an endless, unapologetic chain of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I read anything," McCullough said. "Everything." 
</P>
<P>
Thwarted in her search for an ashtray, she commandeers a candy bowl. "I can 
still tell you what is written on the toilet paper in the public bathrooms in 
London." On the top of each sheet, said McCullough, are the words "London 
County Council." On the bottom, "Now please wash your hands." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to read in every genre," she said -- and also, to write in them. "So 
anyway, a historical novel I knew I couldn't do until I had enough money not to 
have to work for a living." Fortunately, "I have not since 'Thorn Birds.' " To 
emphasize her point, McCullough threw back her head and laughed. "I ain't 
hurting for a quid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But to do an historical novel, McCullough knew she needed to find a period that 
had not been done. "I like to be fresh," she said. "And I really came across it 
when I was reading the letters of Cicero and Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
Now McCullough is just the kind of person who would be reading ancient letters 
for recreation. A science major at the University of Sydney, McCullough became 
concerned that she "had never acquired much culture," and signed up for a 
classics course. "We read everything," she said. "It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, after the publication of "The Thorn Birds," McCullough decided to 
reread the classics. "I thought I would love to do it again." Unmarried well 
into her 40s, McCullough thought it seemed an appropriate pastime -- "life 
being serious when you are a spinster, and expecting to remain a spinster." 
</P>
<P>
Early on in the years after "The Thorn Birds," McCullough began to feel unsafe. 
She had lived alone since she was 18, but with the fame of "The Thorn Birds," 
she said, "there were threats, and all sorts of weirdos popping out." 
</P>
<P>
A friend suggested Norfolk Island, where the mutineers from the Bounty were 
resettled in 1856. Residency was by permission only, but McCullough quickly 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the time in my early 40s, therefore I wasn't going to be a strain on 
the local hospital," she said. "I was wealthy enough that I wasn't going to be 
a strain on the economy. No. 3, I had no children, so I wasn't going to be a 
strain on the school." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after she arrived on Norfolk Island, "I was lucky enough to meet, for want 
of a better word, one of the natives." 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, a.k.a. Ric, "had just sunk all his money into 
palms." Since "all those palm trees that you see in hotel foyers all over the 
world started life as seeds on Norfolk Island," palm farming can be "very, 
very, very" lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, Robinson's wife "packed up and left him," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
"She let him go." 
</P>
<P>
"Really," she added, "that's the trouble with women. They never know when 
they're well off." 
</P>
<P>
But things worked out well for McCullough and Robinson, a descendant of the 
Bounty mutineers. "The next thing you knew, we were married." Another toss of 
the head, and another big laugh. Since Ric is 13 years her junior, "I am Mrs. 
Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the new book's historical accuracy, McCullough employed a 
multilingual research assistant. "She traveled around the world, interviewing 
people on my behalf," locating, for example, "the world's expert on the Roman 
saddle." McCullough herself drew sketches of all of her characters as she wrote 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Historical fiction can be chancy, McCullough conceded. Academics in particular 
are often quick to attack the credibility of these novels. 
</P>
<P>
But "times are changing," McCullough said. Money is tight and attendance is 
down at many universities, and "history departments are one of the first to 
feel that economic crunch," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
"So anything that popularizes ancient history" is seen as a good thing. She 
flashed a big smile. "So, I will popularize ancient history." 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Rome was a jumping place, McCullough said. "It's so interesting and 
juicy and meaty that I would love the whole world to know what went on there." 
</P>
<P>
McCullough's total-immersion approach to writing this series gave her an edge 
on some historical novelists, she said. "The thing that I object to in many 
historical novels is that the characters think in the present." By contrast, 
McCullough's characters "think like Romans." This is possible, she said, 
"because when I was writing, I was a Roman." 
</P>
<P>
Six volumes on ancient Rome seemed no more daunting to McCullough than any 
other work of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always written novels, always, since I was 5 years old," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But as a Depression child, "You never announced to anyone that you were going 
to write novels." McCullough made science, neurophysiology, her "bread and 
butter." It was during her 10 years as a research associate at the Department 
of Neurology at Yale University that McCullough wrote her first novel, "Tim," 
and completed the manuscript for "The Thorn Birds." 
</P>
<P>
The success of "The Thorn Birds" made science "impossible," McCullough said. 
"To do useful work, I needed to be faceless, anonymous." Suddenly, at dinner 
parties, "I was being introduced as 'our novelist.' " 
</P>
<P>
So McCullough fled to the sanctity of Norfolk Island, where, she said, "This is 
what I do. I just sit down and write books." 
</P>
<P>
There in her tropical Eden, hard-core workaholic McCullough writes at least 
eight to 10 hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
Having written her love story ("Tim," 1974); her family saga ("The Thorn 
Birds," 1977); her whodunit ("An Indecent Obsession," 1981); her novella ("The 
Ladies of Missalonghi," 1987), and her future tale ("A Creed for the Third 
Millennium," 1985). McCullough can now add history to her dance of the genres. 
She is two-thirds finished with the second in the Roman series, and promises 
that "it's even better than the first." 
</P>
<P>
And so, next? 
</P>
<P>
"Next I think I will do something contemporary, nasty, bitter and steamy," 
McCullough said. She thought for a moment and decided she liked that idea. 
"Yes, something steamy, after the Romans."
